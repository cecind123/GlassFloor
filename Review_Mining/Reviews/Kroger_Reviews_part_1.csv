bad,"Managers don’t respect their employees. "
bad,If you enjoy having more and more work thrown on you and no training this is your place.   management is a JOKE! Training is not available  and  no support from leads on up
bad,They work you hard for no money and no appreciation. Never acknowledge you or tell you good job. Treat you like you are just a cog and not a person. It sucks as a place to work.
bad,"Worked there with excellent reviews for over 15 years, until 21 new grads were hired making much less.  Then they started firing many of us for made up reasons."
bad,"My time at Kroger was incredibly brief, I ended up walking out after six months since the management at my location was absolutely insufferable. I worked in the deli department that had been neglected in terms of cleaning for years before I joined the team, but I was scapegoated into it being all my fault and that I was unfit for my job because I wasn't unable to undo all of this overnight. "
bad,Kroger as a company likes to tell you when you're hired on that they take care of their employees and make sure that everyone is happy and taken care of but thats just not the case. They treat their employees like garbage and work you until your crying.
bad,Worked at overnight frozen lead. majority of the time didn't feel in control cause of the over seeing management that can't even do their own job but wants to control everything. negative work place environment. did not feel comfortable at all. only good part was being by myself some nights and leaving. Don't suggest anyone to work at this location
bad,I enjoyed a few coworkers there. They had unrealistic expectations of employees and set you up for failure. They gave one person the job of 3 and not great pay.
bad,"This is the worst company I have ever worked for. As an administrative assistant, I had to run new hire orientations, and ended up lying to new hires and trying to make Kroger seem like a great place to work."
bad,"-Management constantly standing over your shoulder. "
bad,"The hourly pay is substandard compared to Walmart that starts at $11.00 an hours.  Kroger starts at $8.25 an hour part time even though Kroger has a union which costs $8.00 a week for membership.Consequently, your first hour of pay goes to do nothing union. If you want to quit the union you have to quit your job and come back again. If you want to become a full time cashier than you have to wait for the few cashier to either retire or die....The best thing about is that the deli makes delicious fried chicken, If your a college student wanting only part time while going to school than Kroger is a great match. However, if your an adult with a family to support look else where for a job"
bad,"Management is rude and pay is lousy! There is absolutely no support by the union, they clearly work for the company not the workers.  The store is filthy and they dont seem to care!"
bad,"It was appalling. I worked there more than 2 years, and the first half of my time was fine. The second half, however, was awful. We got a new department manager then. A lazy, unreliable individual who couldn't keep new hires, because he refused to train new hires. So, I took over for him. I unofficially ran the team for more than a few months before he noticed. Then he started writing me up for making him look  bad. A spotless record, ruined, because of his worthless pride. 0/10. Would Not Recommend."
bad,"Trash within trash. A place so heartless and deeply filled with evil is not right in my eyes. They have a strong reputation, but its not my go to place."
bad,I have not received my second check  its been a month since I had this job I'm not on the schedule not sure what's going on I like to work but not for free especially  if I'm getting up out my bed I do everything they ask me to do an I still cnt get any hours or days not fair I feel like they have they favorite that works
bad,Managers are bad. Working in the DELI is the absolute worst. Employees in the department are lazy and filthy. The store needs WEEKLY Ecolab checks for unsanitary working conditions. Managers rather walk around on their phones talking to their baby mamas/ baby daddies instead of doing their jobs. When I told the managers about the conditions in the DELI department was nasty they acted like they knew nothing about it. They expect me to cook in that kitchen is beyond me
bad,"My experience was absolutely terrible. The worst thing about the job though was definitely the management. Also once I changed my availability because of school reasons, I was completely taken off the schedule for weeks and when I was at least supposed to get 12 hours a week based on company guidelines, I got less than that."
bad,They don’t care about you as a person. They downsize departments but increase the workload. Management doesn’t care that you have 8 hours to do 12 hours of work. They expect it to be done regardless.
bad,"I was only part time and it was nightstock, and i was very sick running to the bathroom every 5 minutes, i only asked to leave 4 hours early, the manager told me to stop being a p*ssy and get back to work. (i was sick and it was coming out both ends, i had food poisoning.)"
bad,Don't work for a union store. The union Did not help me. I loved my job. I did more for that department than the manager. It was dirty and Not customer friendly.
bad,"Great job for children who have attention disorders since management is always looking over your shoulder, and the pay for a fulltime employee is not enough to support a family and take care of bills,"
bad,The work enviroment was very hostile and not friendly. Not Helpful and were not team players. Management was not helpful or kind to employees and they were self interested.
bad,Even though I only worked there for three months due to a pregnancy. I hated that job. I started with 25 hours a week and ended with 15 hours a week. Pay was horrible. About 8.50 an hour. The workers there was rude and not friendly. Now I'm not saying ALL kroger locations are bad just the one I worked at. And would not reccomend.
bad,"Terrible bosses, always trying to run a skeleton crew. Very cheap company. Management couldn't care less about the union or it's associates. Please stay away."
bad,The Kroger company is a terrible workplace that abuses their staff and prioritizes monetary value over their employees. They verbally abuse and threaten their employees with seemingly no end. They are an awful company devoid of a soul.
bad,"Been a courtesy clerk so I've seen the worse of it. They have a separate human resource department which is sketchy never felt recognized and they treat you like a slave. They ""forget"" to give you breaks when your supposed to just to keep customer traffic low at the front."
bad,"I work almost every day while going to school. I had to keep telling my manager that I had to go to school the next day but, they still made me work long hours. I would have to do other people job."
bad,"Typical day at work would consist of being short by two people in each department. Click list employees helped out in other departments as they were able. Customers would complain about having to wait for long periods of time. Store director and assistant store director did not effectively communicate with department management. Had to work every weekend. Food was donated as part of the zero waste, zero hunger initiative, when food should have been thrown out."
bad,"I've found that Kroger does not particularly care for their employees. Most, if not all, of the time, they sacrifice an employee's health and job security, just to make a single customer happy. Not only that, but I've personally seen corporate employees belittle and shame department managers and anyone below. That is acceptable  for an employer."
bad,Managers have no sense of how to do their jobs. Employees are expected to cater to every whim of their supervisor. They’ll try their best to make you miserable
bad,It's about the Ohio office bonus checks and not the employees at all. The raises are horrible so sad. They fired managers that was about to retire this month have them nothing but the door. Had them all go to a meeting and fired them in one day 150 managers in one day at this location but 400 in all total
bad,"No loyalty to employees, management is rude when dealing with employees, they don’t follow their own protocol, will find any way to terminate an employee when it’s convenient for them, no motivation forfrom management,"
bad,They are most concerned with the bottom line than the people that work for them that help them get to that bottom line. The pay starts out pretty good but getting even a yearly raise or promised raise is in a timely manner almost never happens.
bad,"management was very disrespectful to me and my coworkers, no training when i started the job. no benefits until i was there for a year, so i couldnt make my doctors visits, and too far away from home."
bad,I said tripping balls on acid thinking you were referring to working on a farm. I'd rather shove my dong in a deli slicer than ever get a living from these cheapskates ever again.
bad,"1 does not matter how many year you gain or have they never give anyone a promotion."
bad,"Got interviewed by the AM, and got the offer. First pay check comes in, pay is short, and I speak with the manager. He looks into it, and tells me they made a mistake when hiring, and the lower wage I received was what they 'wanted' to hire me at. This of course, did not fly with me, and in attempting to resolve in in-house (HR, Manager, and myself) was told I would receive retro-pay for the issue. Months, after months went by and I started getting ghosted, so I bugged them even more. Multiple times a week. This issue eventually ended with an external resolution to which I received the pay they promised in my onboarding documents. I honestly do not know what was going on with management here."
bad,"The managment is nothing but judgmental and just have no clue about their roles. No room for emergency family situations or sick children.  They run on very little to no help an its just horrible atmosphere.  It's sad to know you able to do a job but are expected to be without any life outside of the work an your supervisors don't communicate at all . "
bad,"The supervisor, and the manager picked and chose who they liked. I did not have a good experience working with company. I was fired because I meet the quota of the job daily."
bad,"I don't know were to start but you will see an add promising the gimmick of 18.60 an hour, easy interview then hired,First Once you start you will hear from management and trainers that this warehouse id the most dangerous Kroger warehouse in the country, They will tell you true horror stories of how unsafe their warehouse is from day one, The most severe incident happened a while ago and each manager will tell you about it, People have lost their feet, legs, etc and this place, Unqualified manager and the worst is the sleazy smiler 26 Yrs old wanna be kid who is sadly the assistant warehouse manager who will smile and show his sleazy  molars every time you wake by him, the hire a class of ten each week, they fire 9 the week after and here you go, It all started last year when this place opened and the inexperienced and unqualified first team who spent training in Utah and became freinds in the hotel lobby and rooms became trainer, managers and supervisors, Immature mentality and childish managers, Employees are encouraged to hurt each others.maotheremployeemployees.with incentives an"
bad,This company is a horrible company to work for they don’t give a care about their employees and if you are with the company for a long time and you make too much money they will do anything they can to fire you or get rid of you so they can hire someone for starting wages there is not many opportunities to move up in this company
bad,"Never have i felt valued, but it is grocery retail so everyone is replaceable. Management encourages working people into the ground to get them to leave as opposed to helping people grow as all companies boast they love doing. Opportunity is a lie unless you invest 20 years into here."
bad,It sucks.  I learned that company politics suck.  The management was totally corrupt.  I would never work for this company again.  It was the worst experience of my life.
bad,"Trash, DM's don't care. Pay lip service to work life balance. Completely under paid for the amount of work required. Just fired half of the salaried store managers and increased work load. How much fun does that sound like?"
bad,I just feel like the managers could do a whole lot more but they don’t do anything but sit in the office goofing off and they let ppl slide with way to much stuff at the store ...
bad,"I had only worked there for a total of 3 months and during that time the most enjoyment I got from it was the fact that I was surrounded by food. The work conditions were less than acceptable, the workload forced onto one person while the rest of the employees working the same potion got to do lighter work was far too common. Horrible pay and not enough compensation for the employers pushing employees to work hours that couldn't even allow for a person to get a regular 8 hours of sleep."
bad,Enough said about a corporation that only provides for its corporate people in Ohio.  Their actual workers are like unappreciated slaves.  Nothing is ever good enough not even when their sales are up.
bad,"Managers would often play favorites, and used threatening tactics to push their way. It was extremely unprofessional. Prepare for little work-life balance, long shifts with little pay, and soul crushing labor."
bad,its ok for someone younger. i need more hours. i have a son and bills. This is why im looking for something better for my future......................
bad,"Kroger only cares about making more profit that they don't pass to the customer or the employee. Recently, they fired hundreds of managers to make more money."
bad,They dont care about their employees at ALL! They are stingy with hours. You only get a 30 minute break in an 8 hour day. Management sucks. Horrible job to have.
bad,"Management and supervisors literally forget about you, you never get breaks on time, asking to use the restroom is aperently a no no..  (thats illegal btw) "
bad,"Do I need to say much about Kroger. An excellent starter job, especially for the teenager. Pay is subpar, the newer contracts tend to screw employees over."
bad,"It would be hard to find a job that values its employees less than Kroger!  No advancement opportunities, pay that is non livable without multiple other jobs, unaffordable benefits when you are paid so poorly"
bad,Poor upper level management that doesn't help you when you have problems or issues.  The support that you would think you would receive is not there.      Unable to do job because of incompetent upper level management.
bad,"Management is all about them,  they dont care about any of their employees, and try to push you to do more and more, and have you work over even if you have a set schedule"
bad,"Uncompetitive pay, ridiculously low hours, awful management, terrible focus. What's there not to hate? One of the worst-run organizations in corporate America."
bad,"When I got hired as a cashier everything was going fine until this manager came back from maternity leave and all heck broke loose. She started cutting my hours because of a spat that happened between an new hire employee and me, even though it wasn't my fault because she was on the clock screaming in my face in front of customers. So this new hire employee who did got promoted and got more hours for het behavior. I got stuck in the deli whete i lost my privilege as a cashier  without my permission."
bad,They were nice in the interview but treated me terribly while I worked there the management just wanted to gossip and not get their jobs done and they wouldn’t never do 21s ever making minors jobs terrible and would get a attitude with costumers
bad,"worst experience I have ever had, still have nightmares. Customer cussed me out and called me curse words after he would have to wait for his opioids and the pharmacist paid for his meds after he treated me so poorly. Then, after I created a position for myself someone with more seniority stole it when he moved to our area. Union was no help."
bad,Worse company ever they promise the world and never deliver.they hire everyone part time permenant so as not to have to provide benefits.They hire handicap people and treat them like there second class citizens.They verbally abuse their associates.If you are outspoken they find a way to get rid of you. I know i wasted 10 years of my life with Kroger/ Smiths Marketplace
bad,it's like.. part time hours. paid little. paid weekly which honestly.. isn't very awesome because it just makes it harder to manage your money. a lot of people that work there are crazy.
bad,"From my experience as a  former employee, it sucked. For one thing there is no support as far as management(at least in the store I worked in). Even when the customer was in the wrong, no one had your back. The amount of hours per week weren't enough to live on. Management was cold and uncaring especially when it came to family situations. Kroger is the worst."
bad,"When I was hired, I had over 5 years of experience as a cashier. I was told at hiring I would be a bagboy until they hired some more bagboys, and then they would make me a cashier.  In 6 months they hired cashiers, fired cashiers, and even hired one of my co-worker's father and promoted him to a supervisor, over his own daughter among others.  This was a union store, and I should have been asked, as I had seniority, but they said it was because he had ""experience"".  So seniority is something they can choose to ignore.  "
bad,I was done wrong I worked at Kroger for 5 yrs for the last year that I worked at Kroger I was sexually harassed an was touched by a co-worker when I turned it in to the manager they acted like they cared then before you know it they told me that I was fired an someone touched me an im the one that was fired.
bad,Tried calling to talk to upper management was rudely hung up. Very unprofessional can see why they need union.  I was union still let go. They talk about other workers in front of other employees. They kept my last paycheck and refuse to help me get it. I will never recommend them to anyone.
bad,Management is hypocritical and judgmental. God forbid you have an abscessed tooth. They will haul you in for a drug test.  You only get 10-14 hours a week. Not even enough to live on. Not  worth the drama.
bad,"This used to be a great place to work.  Until the store manager was allowed to bring his team of unprofessional manager's in. He let's his pickup supervisor run the store. If your not in thier group they will stalk you.bully, you,and degrade you. They have no integrity. The whole store is short staff on a daily. The turn over rate is at a 99%. Because of how the supervisor treats people. And corporate wont do anything."
bad,"Not worth a moment of your time, they’ll resort to underhanded tactics in a heartbeat. I was there for over two years and it was nothing but a charade, they’ll purposely lie to cover themselves and have no ethical morals"
bad,"The manager I worked directly under was a total nut case. She would yell, cuss, and scream at me and other associates in front of coworkers. She didnt really do any personnel management, or have any real direct contact with associates. She had many complaints filed against her, and even had been ordered to appear in court to a answer for her treatment of a former associate. The worst of it all was that upper management did nothing's to remedy the situation. Over all, not a good place to work"
bad,"Do not work for this company I was there for 3 plus years, they rob you of your life, and they change the rules every hour it seems , nobody is on the same page , you cant advance unless your in the cool kid group, or unless your gonna talk about the bible and religion."
bad,Very poor pay. Working 14 days in a row but only working about 4 hours a day to squeeze out everything you need to get done. Poor management. wont attempt to work there anytime soon
bad,"Best thing about the job: weekly pay & discounts.Continually short-staffed. No real training. No corporate manual to search for instructions on how to fix an error or understanding the jibberish the cash registers spew out on their screens. What may be ok in one store for a customer to do, may not hold true in another store.Managerial staff constantly changing. Management is constantly belittling the staff.writing employees up & When asking about benefits, no one seems to know. "
bad,"Work place bully tactics are condoned by every level of management, supervising, and facilities director. This is not a good place to work for anyone with integrity, morals, honor, or respect for the human race."
bad,"If you are looking to be treated like nothing by your managers, and co-workers, Kroger is the place for you. Not only do you constantly face, rude customers, and large workloads barely having a break, you also get constant negative feedback from your higher ups. I spend most of my time in the front end at the store. Managers don't give a heck about you, or any problems you have at home. Sick? Too bad. Family member died? Too bad. Have a problem with a co-worker or manager? Too bad. Even the HR, sides with the management, and nothing gets through. You will not be listened to. Constant co workers talking down on each other. I worked many places before Kroger, and none have treated me so poorly, (not even fast food). Manager is a rich white man, with no cares or worries about others people problems. Harassment is a constant problem, but is never taken care of. Scanning groceries isn't all that bad, except when you have rude customers, and a quota on how fast you can scan, and how accurately you can scan produce. Aside from working in this business for four years, I still have no respect, or appreciation for being at my job. Kroger is all about how to respect the customer and make everyone happy, but It's ironic as to how many employees at Kroger regret their jobs. My store manager doesn't even know my name. Countless times I tried to get change or switch departments, but that never happens. The most enjoyable part about this job is A. Leaving and B. Not answering my phone when they call to have me cover someones shift."
bad,Horrible place to work the one in Appomattox Virginia is the worst place ever to work at the managers are jerks the throw people out of their store and they get mad if you have to leave for an emergency like my fiancé was having an allergic reaction and I had to leave and they got mad plus they treat you like your five
bad,We would work three or four hours before we would get our break.Management didn't do anything and the union didn't because I waited too long to turn in my complaint. They were understaffed and management changed often.
bad,Don’t know how to treat people  talk behind your backs they help you with nothing if you have an issue  they will send you on a dummie mission to find something that is not carried in that store  and they yell a lot whether you did something or not
bad,"I worked there nearly a year, the complained all the time that night crew was too slow when we have the most work to do and then if we stayed to finish they would complain we were having to much over time, so they started making us unload the truck ourselves giving us more work and the manger would come in later to say he would stay after us to do any work we dont finish but really it was to avoid having to help unload the truck. IN short this company and management wasnt worth it."
bad,"VERY busy store most days.  A few managers really cared.  Severely under-staffed.  "
bad,There was very poor management they treated you like you were nothing and if you had any doctors appointments and you brought them a note they don't accept them and they are supposed to excuse any doctor's note
bad,"Terrible management that does not know how to run the store correctly, will move people around constantly because people are always either quitting or getting fired."
bad,Horrible environment.  People yelling at you from all directions.  Managers dont communicate with each other so told different things constantly.  Very stressful.
bad,"When I needed certain days off they said that if I didn't come in I wouldn't have a job. So I missed my dad's hospital appt. because of that.  And then I work 4/7 of the days of the week, and they are threatening with my job if I don't work more even though I am only part-time."
bad,Don’t work there they are Terrible people they’re only worried about their selves we never had any help in the deli it only be one person there the whole night and I do not see you any help
bad,The worst job you’ll ever have. The managers are very toxic and the pay is not worth that stress. Do yourself a favor and PLEASE look elsewhere. You’ll be much better off. Would give 0 stars if it was possible. Worst job ever. Southfield Kroger is toxic.
bad,If you want to be called names and treated like garbage then here you go. Don’t get breaks because they’re always low staffed. This job will tear you down
bad,"Over worked and underpaid, little to no help from management with scheduling."
bad,"Oh god where to even start. More than half the staff of supervisors and below (Yes, you read that right.) was under the age of 18, if a costumer complains management gave them their way no matter what. Heaven forbid you ask them for anything at all. (More hours, a day off, have a broken piece of equipment repaired.) Well over half the workers are incompetent but nobody listens to you when you tell then how everyone is acting foolish. Any rules they are given are apparently both ordained  by some infallible god like being and yet can still be interpreted to suit mangment's needs."
bad,"I felt as though I was a really good employee, but was constantly harassed by managers for things that either weren't my responsibility or just because they knew me outside of work. On top of that, I was only paid minimum wage. I would receive punishment for unnecessary things, such as catching bronchitis from someone else who worked there and then alerting management that I was instructed to not work for 4 days and handing in a doctors note. They immediately cut my hours down from 32 to 13 for the remainder of my stay which was about a month."
bad,"Worst job I've ever had.  I worked my shifts,  picked up as many shifts as they needed,  and got disrespected by my manager in front of customers,  who were stopping and starring.  Worst job ever."
bad,Did not like it there to much stress and discrimination could barely choose the hours I wanted to work. I did not like my position at all. Management did not care about employees there.
bad,they dont care about you no matter how much or hard you work the want young stupid people they can run over and mold into little kroger robots also no money they will never pay you close to what you should make especially the handicapped they screw them over all the time with not paying them right
bad,"Kroger doesn’t care about their associates. It’s all about the money for this company, not one employee matters. The pay is the lowest of the grocery chains."
bad,"The management was horrible, The job as a whole felt like school, just childish. Mangers did'nt set great examples, they we're lazy. No respect was shown to any employee, The pay was aful and if you even got overtime they would threaten you or even fire you!"
bad,"No chance for advancement"
bad,I started off as a bagger and worked myself up to becoming a supervisor. I loved working there until the management got switched around. Started my pay off at 7.75 an hour. Worked there for 2.5 years and barely saw improvement with the store/pay
bad,"My department was extremely understaffed most days. Having dozens of orders to complete and only one person there, maybe two."
bad,This store is very low in sales which means less hours to give employees but they also want all the work down in less than 7hours not 8hours cause theres not enough hours to give to everyone also the pay is the worst with prices raising the pay stays the same until the company decides to agree with the union
bad,District Manager was so rude. She fired me after making me go outside 2 times to get carts within 30 minutes of each other(it was below freezing outside)!! Even though another employee offered to go in my place. She got an attitude and later that day called me to her office and fired me. The main manager I normally dealt with was very friendly though. I still don’t recommend working here!
bad,"Managers treat you like dirt, don't look you in the eye, introduce themselves, or talk directly. "
bad,Kroger is supposed to be a warm loving family. They dont give good hours. They called everyone names. I would NEVER recommend this job to anyone.they are nothing but liars.
bad,My boss there was horrible she had a vendetta against me. Couldn't get a day off even if you put in a 2 week notice for that day. No respect from her or anyone else. Absolutely hated it. She was my worst nightmare ever.
bad,"If you're looking for a good job to support your family,  then apply elsewhere. If you're young, a college student or a retiree looking for a little cash, then this is for you. Overtime isn't an option for part or fulltime workers, Management will get angry at you for working over your clock out time, and you risk of getting yelled at. If you do run over your scheduled time,  then  it'll be known that you won't be paid for that extra time. Also you risk of not getting your first weeks pay for part time employees."
bad,"The managers have free reign over you, no matter what department you are in they can pull you into others including cleaning up messes. even if the department has a pay increase you work the department but not with the department pay."
bad,Apply with caution. Corporate made decisions that has tarnished and ruined the excitement about working there. I know so many new and old Managers and Co-Managers out of a job.
bad,Management downsizing to try to make a profit that way instead of reviewing budgets and cut spending where it was needed. Lack of proper leadership will be the companies downfall
bad,"If you're looking for a job that has backstabbing coworkers, will ruin your mental health, and overwork you to near death then Kroger is the place for you. They'll lie through their teeth, promising you promotions and then going back and forth on it, until finally saying you wont get it. The turnover rate is awful, nothing stays consistent for more than a few months especially when management is taken into consideration. Some managers are good, but the good ones always leave and are replaced with people who will throw you under the bus in a moment's notice. They try to push their best employees out the door, saying you don't do good enough when a vast majority of the time you're left alone. They'll nitpick every little thing you do to make you feel bad more than half the time. 10/10 don't recommend working here. There's so many other places that will probably treat you better than Kroger ever will. Good luck on the job hunt!"
bad,"SC Kroger pharmacy has zero respect for their technicians, pay is poor, zero order on how things should be done. Dirty as well!! Just horrible there! I worked in MI for 2 years and have never seen anything so bad until I went to Carolina Forest Kroger. Would never refer anyone to this company now. The HR also did nothing to help with a lot of issues that would happen. Just poor environment"
bad,"RUN! Do not pass go, do not collect $200. This company has the biggest turnover rate and the employees get paid crumbs compared to other grocery stores."
bad,This Corporation is not an employee friendly employer is poorly managed by people who are so full of themselves. The store was filthy not managed correctly
bad,If you are good at what you do and want to move to a different departments management won't let you they pick and choose who they want very unfair to full time
bad,"Store ended up shutting down, 1 out of 15 in my region. The managers sat up in their offices all day doing stupid things while the rest of us on the floor were trying to keep everything running smoothly. Supposed to get one week paid vacation after working there for a year. I worked there for two and I never got my one week paid or severance check."
bad,"very busy.  always things to do. i learn how to do returns, ordering, sorting truck, stocking the truck for customers. changing over the seasonal aisle from season to season."
bad,"If you have a family ,enjoy doing things with them the jobs at Kroger are not for family people. Always short of staff and want to call you in and not having a regular schedule."
bad,I would get people orders ready for the pick up times. Make sure the customer has everything she or he ordered. If not find them in the backroom make substitutions
bad,"Worst place to work, very unorganized place of “business”. Couldn’t keep no one long enough to keep them on the schedule and too lazy to train and show you the ropes properly. No organization at all! Expect you to work o.t and don’t want you to get paid for it claiming it will be on the next check but it won’t ! Always calling u in cause someone quit or no show rude about everything just very unprofessional"
bad,"Regardless of how hard you work it is near impossible to get a promotion without being at the company for half a century. And even then, the raise is not very much. A 5 cent raise after every 6 months is what they tell you but unless you are on them about it you won't even get that. The store I worked at 792 I believe has some of the worst management I have ever worked under in my entire life. I'm 30 now and have been a member of the workforce since I was 16 years old."
bad,Kroger's lies to get u in there to fill out a application  they say over the phone they will pay u a certain amount but when u start it is not what was discussed you dont get a raise in 6 months like other work places you have to work alot of hours before u even see a 5 cent raise there rude to employees  you pay out of pocket for your uniforms not a good place to work it is weekly pay but you pay union dues and that's alot out of your first few checks plus uniform cost first check they dont have no good hours and they will call u on off days to see if u will come in and work they lie on u to get u fired I barely got breaks I got 1 break my whole shift each day for 15 minutes and it's not a set time limit for a break you get to go when your not busy and if your the o lying one on the floor you get no break at all
bad,I didn’t like it. They were very unfair. The managers did not care about there employees. They had favoritisms. Some of the hours were tricky.  I feel like they should change the management.
bad,"They will write you up for things that is not true just to show they have power over you. They will take away your hours for no reason. If you want to be treated like the dirt beneath their shoe and their puppet, this is the perfect place for you."
bad,"I was treated like a robot. They dangled a promotion in my face for a year and if I don't get, I'm quitting. Management sucks and half the time, I don't know anything about the managers they bring in because they don't introduce themselves. They don't tell you anything, corporate gives us new following orders, well you're just supposed to know them."
bad,Managers never had the proper information to give us. The company lacked teamwork when it came to big jobs. Pay was very small even with raises. Company was just unorganized at the time and store was all over the place.
bad,Its a good thing Clerks are part of a union! Management is very much about what can be done for them.My whole time working there I only had maybe 3/9 managers I actually liked.
bad,"No, really don't bother. They don't care about you, they dont care if your manager or supervisor is a misogynist  and demeans you daily. You can go to any upper management and make a report. They still dont care."
bad,Worked at the one in Bloomfield michignan on lasher rd and maple. Had a manager constantly calling me slurs against Jews and other managers and union wouldn't do anything.
bad,I was hired as full-time once my department changed so did my hours. I went from 40 to about 10-15. They don't know how to treat the good employees they. They can't keep employees because the way were treated.
bad,The many was rude they cut people hours and  they have people outside for the whole day with out giving them something to drinking like water or etc they never gave people their breaks on time
bad,As a member of the deli department for over 2 years there it was really brought to my attention that the environment had grown toxic. This was due to a sever lack in employees 142 hours short to be exact. DO NOT DO IT.
bad,"a self-proclaimed bargain shopper, I like to save money in every aspect of my life.  My favorite thing to save money on is definitely groceries because it’s just so easy!  However, if you don’t put any effort into it, grocery shopping can be the easiest way to throw your money away.  One of my tips for saving on groceries is to not stay loyal to one store.  Shop around, research weekly ads, and put thought into what you need before heading to the store.  In this series, you’ll find the 7 reasons why I love my favorite stores. all about… Kroger"
bad,"1) you’ll never have a set sch even if you tell them that from day one2) vacation ? Is a joke you have to put it a year in advance and still might not get approved!3) raises its like 20 cents a year ! No matter how good you are4) you’ll never have enough help 5) you’ll always have too much work not enough pay !"
bad,"I feel that my job as Kroger pharmacy technician could have been much better. There was a lack of training, teamwork and equal opportunities. I felt that I was being pressured into having to become certified to keep my job, that was not something that was in the job description on an application. I have a lot more that I could say but not enough room"
bad,"It’s all political. Favoritism and butt kissing are key to advancing, not how hard you work or how good you are. The lazy people usually end up with the promotions. The VP of the company was hired from Walmart and the decline in hours and quality help shows. So if you like working during crazy busy times with zero help, this is the place for you! The customers have even noticed the downward spiral the company is taking. It used to be a great place to work, but that time has passed."
bad,Racist boss always shows favoritism expects you to drop what your doing when someone calls in and come running to work. Union is a joke boss thinks he's God
bad,"Poor management , not enough hours, Never Enough product for customers very embarrassing when you run out of stuff, if you just get hired in people with seniority get more hours you don't and can take your shift from you, overall I wish my brother and sister would have never told me about Kroger only thing I miss is some of the employees that I worked with at the Liberty Fairfield on "
bad,I worked there for 1 year as a student for  a part time job and it was absolutely horrendous.  I was a cart pusher and a bagger who was forced to learn how to do cashier work without getting paid for it.
bad,I hate it I will never recommend nobody to Krogers one day the manager took my brake away just because it was busy. I wish the best for Kroger-Stores.
bad,"It’s like the standoffs prison experiment but with food products. They smile in your face for 15 minutes, make you feel good, and never follow through on promises."
bad,This job requires 100%. Meaning you are running for 12 hours a day they do not care at all! They are not understanding and only care if the job is done or not.
bad,The manager they had over the store I worked at had no respect for The workers they were very bias and had favorites in the departments and it showed through the hours.
bad,Upper management is not supportive.  They need to adopt a servant leadership approach. The question upper management should ask is why are we loosing some many middle managers.
bad,"Management in this department is awful and soul crushing. I get yelled at daily, more than once a day.They refuse to work with me and my availability and my restrictions unless I have documentation that I can't work because of school. As a mother of 2 kids, I can't work all the times that they want and they won't work with me. Also you are forced to join the union and the amount you have to pay for it ridiculous and they union doesn't do much to help you in work situations."
bad,"Worst company on this planet "
bad,Managers who would rather go on a smoke break than to make sure their staff is doing what they are required to do. The filth in the food prep areas was disturbing and the improperly stocked areas would show items expired for up to a year still on the shelf. Ooops was the most often word spoken when brought to managements attention
bad,"When I first started working here I thought it would be interesting  and a good learning experience however over the next few months I realized that it was the complete opposite. The deli “managers” don’t help with anything, shows favoritism, do not care that the slicers are safety hazards due to them falling apart, will not change your schedule if you are in school or plan to start it. Also they expect you to do things that you weren’t trained for then get mad when you don’t know how to complete the tasks. The customers at this store are also very rude when it comes to the chicken."
bad,"I was one of the most reliable workers. I was open to any and every opportunity but since they couldn’t “lose” me in my low end position I was never able to advance, although I had the seniority and background knowledge. It totally is disheartening when you strive to reach a goal for your family and your income provider stops that!"
bad,Never enjoy people and under pay. They don't pay you what you are worth. The health insurance wasn't any good. The sick leave wages wasn't no good. Managers was unprofessional.
bad,I really didn’t prefer their underpaid environment and their slave labor mentality . Managers seemed non appreciative of life in general and I struggled to function under such negativity.
bad,I was hired on with the promise of experience pay after a set amount of time had passed. It never happened. I was told when I first started that my experience pay would be $14.45 an hour. After some time passed I never received it. I ask about it and was told that once you have your starting pay there was no changing it and experience pay had no time limit. I asked to see my paperwork and noticed the manager had put in the wrong dates for my experience and said I didn’t have any and started me at minimum wage. I fought about this for months and after them finally telling me that there was nothing more I could do. I turned in my 2 weeks notice because I hate working for a company that lies and will not right it’s wrongs.
bad,"Working here was not my best experience. The other employees were not selected with their store goal in mind, many did not care and management didnt do much to change it"
bad,One of the worst jobs I’ve ever had when asked to rate management the women who works in the office filled it out and I really didn’t agree with how she rated management. The store manager needs to learn how to speak to line employees and not to treat me like a child very inappropriate and unacceptable. I wouldn’t recommend this job to anyone. The hiring manager was also very unprofessional
bad,"Coworkers are nice, that is really the only good thing. Small discounts on Kroger products.   "
bad,Worst job I've had so far and I wouldn't be surprised if I never had one worse. Management doesn't care about you and WILL LIE TO YOU. Pay is never raised and you spend your whole career wanting to end it.
bad,"Poor management, poor benefits for all part time workers. Will schedule you back to back shifts with minimal federal required hours in between shifts. No one will work self scan area. if you dont want to do something and you had seniority, they dont make you. Be prepared to be ignored and treated with disrespect. Good luck getting breaks on time too!"
bad,Got terminated because I went on vacation. Think they could be more understanding and better attitude towards employees. They didn’t understand that things pop up and just are so quick to fire someone.
bad,"The front end manager accused me falsely. My brother worked there too, before i did and was out with internal bleeding and she said she is pregnant and still comes to work"
bad,I wasnt impressed they were not flexible with scheduling at all and when i tried getting my pay fixed the person from union never showed up they shorted my pay by 3 hrs
bad,"No really, the hours are garbage and you'll most likely be asked to do the job of 3 people. If you meet company goals your rewarded by being given more responsibility and significantly higher goals."
bad,They don't care about their employees. You're just a number who is easily dispensible. They pick favorites and only favorites get promoted. If you are not a favorite they ignore you or they try to get to quit so they don't have to pay you workmans compensation.  You have to be completely obedient in order to work here. You voice does not count.
bad,"There is no growth, The pay in very low grade, they overwork you and you don't qualify for benefits for a full year of part- time work but you work 40 hours a week. Then when you qualify for benefits you cant afford the deductibles to go see any doctors. The managers are rude, and they have favoritism towards one associates."
bad,I’ve heard bad things about all Kroger stores. The one I worked at had terrible management and someone was always fighting. It’s very hard to get any time off. At the interview they tell you they’re really flexible with school obligations and things like that but they’re actually not at all. I had the hardest time just trying to get Sundays off to help stay on top of my school work. My store manager actually told me that my accounting classes “weren’t that hard”
bad,Kroger management does not communicate with each other.   They do not give consistent hours and they don't work around school or other schedules   Pay is minimum.  Terrible company to work for.  Do not patronize this store after working there.  They don't care.
bad,"Very unfair, and you do two jobs. Never enough help and no one cares. Just care about their Q vision times.. sad you do two jobs and no Manager cares."
bad,Working in the fuel center for Kroger we received very few hours and low pay. Management was rude and never wanted to help us. We would go days without breaks or help. It was terrible.
bad,Kroger Is A Company That Only Looks Out For There Own People That Been There For Years And The Supervisors And Managers That Are There Find Every Little Thing To Get People In To Trouble Or Fired
bad,There were managers who spoke of advancement but then other managers would say no. There is no py increase and you cannot survive unless you live at home and parents pay everything for you. It's not worth being in a company that does not care for the employees.
bad,"Union sucked, management sucked, hours sucked, schedule sucked, planning for rush time sucked, planning for weekends sucked, planning for holiday rush sucked"
bad,"Supervisor has favors and are very Prejudice that they don’t talk to you & only talk to their skin type. They should be turn in. "
bad,No room to move up in the organization. Hard work and no pay difference for night and day shift. No difference in hard workers and those who do not work in Managements eyes.
bad,"Don’t recommend working here rude management who do t understand how to treat their employees fairly."
bad,Working for Kroger in south gate Michigan sucked because management wasn't doing anything to help. We were timed on certain things  and rushed to get order to the cars
bad,The environment wasn’t good for me. To much drama between coworkers and even mangers. The great thing was getting paid every week. But the my pay was very low for all the various jobs I had to learn and do.
bad,SO bad its no fun they have a lack of employees so the work load is very large. Plus the rate of pay is GARBAGE. Kroger itself is not making a case for anyone to try.
bad,"Horrible management, the managers, Human resources all do not care what happens to the employees, they are very rude and unorganized mangers, nothing ever gets done, no one ever comes to work, it was terrible"
bad,The management for my location was horrendous. Not flexible with hours after hiring me on with a specific availability. Constantly over worked while other co workers did absolutely nothing. Store was run very poorly while I was employed they also had a very fast turnover rate.
bad,Manager steals commissions and district does not care... horrible environment ... would never shop there merchandise is cheap associates are rude and only out for what they can push sale
bad,Good place to work if u r a child or disabled not if ur a adult looking for a normal work week with weekends or even two days off in a roll.  Management is pour.  Get everything in writing or carry a recording device otherwise they will say it never happened.
bad,"The particular Kroger I work at has a huge list of problems. Most of these problems are the result of uninvolved managers, poor training opportunities, unrealistic expectations, poor communication, poor compensation, rigid scheduling, extremely poor higher management (district presidents, coordinators, etc.)- the list goes on and on. The amount of depth necessary to explain the reason why this company is a bad place to work is too great. Avoid this ""career"" at all costs."
bad,"I've been with this company for 2 yrs now. Got hired on as PT but worked OVER 40 hrs for almost the first year and after still managed to get 40 or close. Now after 2 yrs of being a loyal, dedicated employee they have dropped hours so drastically that I'm struggling to even be able to my bills, let alone be able to buy food to feed my child or gas to even get to work. No advancement."
bad,"Management is very stressed all the time and puts that on you, high turnover rate so noone really knows how to do the job correctly. There's no training to speak of, its definitely a sink or swim situation. It's a union store and pay is set per job class, regardless of what your actual responsibilities are."
bad,Managers were terrible. They treat the employees horribly. Pay could’ve been more for all we had to do. They don’t give good hours.                               I encourage you not to work there.
bad,Disorganized company with no sense of logic. They would schedule you hours outside your availability while taking college classes and tell you if it's already on the schedule then you had to work it. They also put more emphasis on color coating products rather than making sure the shelves were full. Management is a joke.
bad,Unknown I don't have any that I know of working there was terrible very poor management very very poor employees there was no structure when the store was roundy's they were very poor management
bad,"Wouldn't recommend working for this company, rip you off anyway they can, rules are made to be broken, management lies all the time. No support with customers, your on your own for everything."
bad,"Management was my largest issue working here. They rarely listened to employee feedback and acted as if they were too important to be bothered with any problems. You did good if you were liked by your direct team leader but if not they would wash their hands of you and you would be either relocated to another department or fired completely. Plans made to improve problems in the work place were ignored and the common response to those problems was ""It's always been this way, just have to deal with it."""
bad,Worst company EVER!!!! Management are all brown misers. ASM is the worst EVER....not one manager knows what the other one is doing. One completely oversteps boundary’s by threatening employees...it’s horrible.
bad,They work their employees like walmart employees but pretend to be higher class. Shameful etching away at employee rights and lack of empathy drove me away. Do not recommend anyone work here.
bad,"Very catty women in lead positions."
bad,managers don't treat there workers with respect. and they come together behind your back to try to get you fired but cant because your a great worker.
bad,"This job sucks, this position Hs no respect and you are talked to like a peasant. If you are cool with management then you don’t need to work as hard. Also you are on 24/7 surveillance to make sure you don’t check a text or sit down ever. Customers are needy and don’t appreciate your help. No benefits at all, if something was to expire the next day,  they would rather throw it out than give it to an employee. I found work really hard, it’s not just bagging, it’s constant. Also one huge problem is the company is too cheap to create more positions so they have you do multiple jobs in one. Also pay roll is not accurate."
bad,Horrible company to work for. The only thing they care about is money. They expect you to do the job of 3 or more people. I was screwed over the whole time I worked for them.
bad,"They make a ton of promises, and never follow through. Someone is always in your personal business or trying to cause drama. Employees aren’t treated fairly."
bad,I wish I knew then what I know now.  I would’ve never applied to work there. It’s unfortunate because there are some really great teams at other Kroger stores.
bad,"This is a job for those who want to be told how to do something and then be told why what you did was wrong. This is also a place for those who enjoy being micromanaged every moment of every day. This is a high stress, high demanding job that has few rewards and no life/work balance. This is a company that has lost its way and is imploding."
bad,"I worked here for about six months.  It was great at the beginning, than management change for the worse.  Store politics and favoritism caused workers to quit and department became short staffed and stressful."
bad,"While I was with the Kroger company not only was my manager rude, but she had some sort of problem with me. I wasnt good at my job because I never had someone PROPERLY train me. I was constantly being tossed around. The employees were nice, most of them at least but, because of my very short time there id never apply again. I couldn't afford to live on my own with the low wagesand they barely have me any hours"
bad,"Most employees were unproductive and mistreated. I feel that no matter how hard I worked I was never appreciated or granted any ease. Management always liked me after they got to know me, but the biggest problem is the management cycle. Management constantly were cycled and everyone that came in would assume all workers are awful and treated everyone accordingly to that assumption. Poor hours and bad scheduling. Its a great job for seasonal, but during the year it's not worth keeping."
bad,Anyone just looking for a job the Kroger on 249  not it all management is horrible and staff is horrible too some are nice but they all quit  they all messy and will absolutely talk about u to others and they will not train u properly and will get mad if u don’t know how to do certain situations
bad,"I was put on the floor with no training whatsoever, at $8.50 an hour. Most coworkers obviously didn't want to be there, and weren't helpful. $8.50/hour isn't enough to live on."
bad,Not a great place to work the company treat employees like a number and not a person. No real Bennefits so many changes within the company to put more money in the pocket of the people on top CEO etc.... and the shareholders. Kroger is not for the regular man.
bad,"The Rochester,In Kroger store is a joke. To many people thinking that they are in control. And the management just lets the employees do what they want to do, talk like they want to. The supervisors are way overpaid and do nothing butt boss people in not so nice of a wayaround with no"
bad,"Kroger is a company in its last days.  If you are salary they own you, and all of the accountability is on store management.  The Union keeps any hourly associates from being effectively held accountable.  The executives are more concerned about serving a left wing agenda versus concentrating on an effective merchandising and operational business model for the future."
bad,"I have work with this company almost FOR 3 years and I didn't get any chance to grow with this company"
bad,"Greet customers "
bad,"Management at the store was just horrible. Always thinking they are God's not People. They do anything and everything in their power to belittle you and your character. Don't stand up for yourself or people there, nobody really sticks together unless Union is involved."
bad,"I had first wanted this job since I am struggling financially enough as it is and they pay weekly so I thought, what could go wrong? Boy, I found out quickly! I was hardly working 3 days a week and my last paycheck was a miserable $24! When I complained to one of the supervisors, she acted like she didn't care and said it's because a lot of hires are coming in for the summer and want to ensure everyone gets hours! I heard baggers are at the bottom of the totem pole but even a janitor gets treated better than this!"
bad,"Not a good place to work unless you are young & management’s favorite. If you have a work ethic-you get stuck with all the work while the people that wander around,play with their phones,show up when/if they want get treated like the best. The pay is laughable at best. Most make minimum wage. 40+ years experience gets you $1.20 more an hour."
bad,I worked at Kroger for a few months and staff lied to the managers and said that I was doing things that I never did it went on for a few months and I got tired of it and I quit
bad,Was wrongfully accused with footage.. But it took so long they don't want to put back to work with back pay...after wrongfully suspended.. They would rather force a resignation... For no reason reason... With Union invovled...no hope sad..
bad,"I worked at night and I didn't enjoy my job. The management was rude and often threatened me with job loss, what I learned was life is funny sometimes because you might meet someone eeriely familiar."
bad,The company doesn’t care about you. No bonuses. Horrible raises. No opportunity for promotion without willing to move. Impossible requirements. Technology slow.
bad,I REPEAT DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME management is horrible. Hours are horrible. Don’t care about school schedule. No paid time off. No benefits. Rude customers.
bad,Extremely discriminatory un friendly managment to employee. Management refused to adhere to doctors orders and forced me out of my job. Management made claims of not knowing of problems arising from the forward facing registers on employees backs from the constant bobbing forward. But they admitted could not do that job for the hours company requirednot d
bad,never in my life have I hated myself as much as when I had to wake up walk into this horrendous job. I don't think I was capable of feeling joy when I worked in that garabage pit of aganony. if you decide to work there then say goodbye to any kind of sane mental health
bad,"Treated like dirt "
bad,No help u mess up once you get yelled at. Management sucks they dont what they are doing half the time. Kroger only cares about itself not its employees
bad,You have to do everyone’s job and they get paid for it!The Manager of the store doesn’t know how to talk to her employees.You pay into the union for what they don’t do nothing for you.Yes the union helps keep your job but they really don’t help you.
bad,Management was terrible. The scheduling is just terrible. Have no life. Never know when you work. And can't plan on enjoying time with your family. Pay sucks starting. The managers only care about the store and not the employees and hire anyone and everyone just to have boys
bad,"i do not recommend Kroger to anyone.  Low pay, high expectations to complete a task.  Moral extremely low due to the lack of management care or follow up."
bad,"The management at Kroger was very hostile. It was obvious that they had no problem with a high turnover. They did take time to train their employees, but after spend such a high investment in training, it was wasted once you got to store level. The managers overall were rude and hostile.  Hardest part of the job was the culture. Most enjoyable part of the job was the fact that it was a brand new marketplace store."
bad,"The managers do not care about their employees nor does the district managers. Customers can throw things at you behind guest care or curse you out, and the managers will not do anything on behalf of their employees and they will allow the customer to continue along their business instead of asking them to leave the store."
bad,"Horrible and negative place to work at. The pay is horrible, as well as the benefits. You only get an raise if you have been with the company for years .."
bad,"if you remember the song tied to the whipping posts. the providence mount Juliet store and the north mount Juliet rd store made you feel like you were tied to the whipping post. they let the teenagers supervise the adults for 8 hours a day or more which is extremely illegal but they did not care, we got tired of putting band aids on their boo boos ."
bad,"I regret working here during my first year of college since this job became the main issues i dealt with daily. The environment was horrid, management cared nothing about your personal life."
bad,Management is incredibly rude and picks favorites. Coworkers are rude as well. Training is a joke. There is no possibility of picking up hours if you aren't a favorite. Management will keep you at a minimum. Store managers need to pay more attention to department managers and how they are treating the team members.
bad,Most employees don’t last six months.  I’ve been there two years and I   Barely recognize anyone.  You’re micromanaged by managers who don’t have any clue about your  department
bad,"Kroger has a terrible work environment.  The management do not care about the employees, at all, and it shows in employee work ethics.  The company is supposed to be members of a union, but the union rep is rarely on site, and when they are, it is impossible to find them.  The union does not care about the employees and the rep is friends with the management."
bad,Don't know what to say about Kroger but I can say Manager tend to throw you under a bus. Poor machine aka produce cart was broke never fixed it was hard to haul around with 100 pounds or more. Then rid acure of why products weren't in spots. Maybe order more.that were Kroger's managers had it .
bad,I was a overnight stocker. I worked for Kroger for seven years. Management was the worst and very unprofessional. They  harassed everyone who worked hard while some of the other workers hardly worked they didn’t seem to care. Favoritism was given to certain workers and others were treated like the place was a prison and the management would talk to you in a disrespectful way and always giving you a hard time about doing all the work and running back stock with a short staff. They union was a joke as they are supposed to respresent you as you paid for their services and they are actually working for the company and look out for the company’s best interests which include low pay raises. A 15 cents raise for part time workers and a measly 25 cents for full time workers. Everything about working there is poor and I am so thankful for leaving as it was the worst job I have ever had in my lifetime.
bad,You were worked to death and paid hardly anything (starting is 7.50) management is a train wreak you have all these associates who think they are managers trying to run everything making a mess and the actual managers are for the most part pathetic excluding 2 or 3. The front end manager is the worst. Your hours were everywhere and a lot would be asked of you. We were understaffed majorly with hardly any baggers or cashiers. Youd be asked to stay late or cover a shift but none such would be done for you if needed. Glad I left there are a lot better jobs around here. Dont waste your time with them.
bad,I would give it a 0 * if I could. As management is not helpful and neither is the Union you can't trust nobody and everybody just gossips all the time. I'm glad to be moving on and away from the stressful and hostile environment at this place offers you day in and day out. Don't trust a union or not any better.
bad,During my time there I was accused of many things. I had the worst management there could be. I worked in many hours overtime and was never able to bring home decent amount of money.
bad,It like trying to put a square peg in a round hole... there is no communication between management and staff. If someone calls out it could be well into their shift and noone downstairs knows anything meanwhile managment knows but says nothing.. promises of advancement but there just empty promises...
bad,The Company does not care one bit about you. And most of the managers there are rude. Only a few really helped you out. They will work you to the bone for next to nothing.
bad,"This company is a terrible company to work for in my opinion if you want to get further with it. Worked here for almost 3 years and I am angered at the fact, that they not once offered me a promotion from Bagger to Cashier. I covered for a lot of shifts when they needed it and also put loads of effort into my job. They wanted us to consistently make sure the parking lot is clear of carts and I moved pretty quick at it. I've always been kind to the customers shopping, regardless of the rude attitude they throw at me. For the amount of great customer service I provided, I feel as if this company does not pay enough and they do not manage their hours well especially, considering how many times I've covered for others' shifts. They provide hours to people that never come in for their shifts, then expect me to be able to work it everytime. I work consider myself very reliable and they took advantage of that, not once have I been recognized for it, however. There are many jobs in the market just like Kroger that will offer better benefits, like promotions and higher compensation."
bad,"Was a supervisor in the ""click list"" section. No backup training for other store employees to step in to help. If you don't have enough staff....too bad! My department as well as myself, were treated as the ""red headed step child""! No concern other than get those orders out!!!!"
bad,"extremely unfair to their employees.  It is who you are and who you know type of place to work."
bad,"I haven’t worked at a Kroger yet where the managers aren’t crazy and fire for no reason. They have their favorites and stick to them. Doesn’t matter how much work you do, it will never be seen as enough. They are not appreciative. Terrible hours, bad pay, next to no benefits. Also unequal payment to females."
bad,"This company was the all time worst company I have ever worked for everything from mismanagement to unfair treatment, prejudice you name it Kroger has it all. Hardly anyone last more than a month and those that do are wasting they're time, Kroger will do everything they can to make sure you never reach full time so that they don't have to give you anything that makes the job bearable if you are smart you'll never work for kroger"
bad,"they don't really pay good, and they low-key treat me different from the other workers there and i think that it's not fair, they barely give me hours to work and make money."
bad,Fast paste at times besides other employes temper and non confidential attitudes things get out that other employes arent supposed to be told and they change schedules mid week and dont let anybody know even though theyre told i dont have easy access to internet
bad,had absolutely no management. No raises are given whatsoever. It is the perfect job if you need extra cash but not to live off.There is no opportunities to advance.
bad,It is run by Human Resources. Management has no say in anything. They do not care about work life balance or their employees. HR will randomly suspend people even without their Manager or Supervisor’s knowledge. Rules are bent for certain employ but not for everyone.
bad,"this is a good place to start your pastry career just until you find a real pastry kitchen "
bad,"As a cashier, you are treated terribly by customers and upper management. Upper management switches every couple of weeks. People are fired and hired constantly, and no stays for more than a couple of months."
bad,Company talks about work-balance life but that's because the company takes away necessary hours to help build a higher profit. Yet they hire more people while moving or firing others at whim. Hourly employees lose money in a paycheck while the managers gain higher bonuses. Wasn't too bad when first started but the need to follow behind Amazon is causing the business to fail. Larger management micromanages to the point of absurdity.
bad,"Management is hateful, will ask you to stay late/come in early or to work on your days off and then fire you for too much overtime. Place is stressful, since you are constantly understaffed, and they wont hire or schedule anymore people. Work you 40 hours a week, every week and then say you are still just part time."
bad,"They market their schedules as ""flexible"" when in reality they mean ""change on a dime, you might come in a few days one week and then an entirely different set of days the next. Maybe none at all for that week, but you still have to come in to at least check your posted hours for NEXT week because we sure don't email them to you."""
bad,This was by far the worst Job I have ever had I literally hated coming to work each day. Over worked under paid sometimes I didn't even get paid for the work I did
bad,"This job completey sucked, management sucked. It was literally the worst job ive ever encountered. Krogers step up your game. Im going to walmart. I wouldnt recommend  this job to my worst enemy."
bad,"Worst company to work for. Managers are all the same they say they want to help you but go behind your back and does other things. Your two weeks notice turns into 4 weeks because they are short staff. Only good thing about this company is paid vacation, paid personal days and benefits."
bad,"I was accused and berated for stealing $200. on my register, when in fact the csm "
bad,"This was by far the worst place you could possible work. Managers are rude, arrogant, and no help. I was told that I had 3 ""no call no shows"" when in reality I checked my schedule and I was there every day I was scheduled. Managers get mad when you call in sick, you also don't get breaks on your scheduled break times. There were days I didn't eat lunch until 6pm when I had been there since 10am. Their employee turn-over rate is insane and there's a reason for it. Management is rude to customers on a daily basis as well.  Managers here do not care about their employees and in fact neglect them and are beyond disrespectful. "
bad,Kroger was a place where I have worked for almost 5 years. The company did not value my opinion or my overall cooperation as there was never any advancement.
bad,i didnt like woking at kroger cause u did more work than what u was paid for the management sucks they were understaff most of the time they didnt give hour the culture was alright we got along hardest part of that job was management
bad,"Very negative experience with Kroger stores  in the pharmacy Department as a pharmacy techin Griffin, Georgia brought over 25 years of medical experience."
bad,"Too much drama because of seniorty, prejudice people, favoritism, poor management. Worked hard never acknowledged. Cement floors caused back and feet problems."
bad,"This company isn't worth working for. They give you hours when you start working for them but after working for them for a month. They slowly start hiring more people and you'll slowly start getting less hours (personal experience). My sister worked in each department for 7 years including bookkeeping and only got paid $10 an hour because they said she didn't advance to anything. Yet a coworker of mine worked the same position for 7 years and made $17hr. Neither person was working management. From what I heard from my coworker they had to go to the union just to get that pay raise. This company is too cheap and trying to compete with Walmart. This job is best suited for someone still in school, someone close to retirement age who does not need this job for a main source of income or for someone who wants nothing in life. It doesn't even pay enough to afford a roof over your head. I even spoke with an assistant manager who is working 2 jobs just to make ends meet. The turnover rate is so high here, that's why they are always hiring. People never stay because it's not worth their time and the money. Unless you plan on working a few months and quitting... I wouldn't waste my time at this company. There are so many other companies that offers better. If you work in fuel center, you won't get any benefits. You'll NEVER be full-time at this company unless you break your back. They start everyone out as part-time and if they sense that you might get 40 hours they will most definitely cut your hours the upcoming weeks. The training is stupid it's not on the department your working in"
bad,"Kroger has plummeted in recent years, what once was a company that prided itself on being friendly and caring has created new soundbites and motos stating that it still cares for its associates while blindly following numbers and metrics with no real clue how to run a retail store effectively. Kroger has alienated Store Managers, ASMs, and department management by focusing on unreachable metrics and the belief that if you don't like it, there are 10 people behind you wanting your position."
bad,"Did not enjoy at all. Store was filthy, workers were incompetent. Failed to get paychecks on time. Machines were broken and the manager took as much time off as he wanted."
bad,You will be over worked and there is no work life balance. It’s all politically driven and those that are good in the company stay in there position by blaming others. You work every holiday and spend the majority of your life in a box store. The company used to be a good employer but has recently lost its moral compass. Stay away if not desperate.
bad,"Managers are horrible to their employees and harass them whenever possible. Always a click of employees that kiss up to managers and get promoted. This is supposed to be a union company but union representatives let managers get away with treating the employees like garbage and disposable. That is unless the employee belongs to the ""click""."
bad,"It's been years since worked there so time have changed but didn't have a decent experience. I was able to advance to management and connect with customer more, and it made my job more when you get to know customers."
bad,If you need a paycheck this is the place to look for. If you're looking for a serious job with job security and where you're actually be happy to come to work look somewhere else. Managers and supervisors will micromanage you everyday. You will have daily reminders that this job is at will and you can quit if you want otherwise you have to keep adding more work to your job duties. If you're  not liked you will not advance in this company. Word of advice don't be desperate enough to work for this company there's more companies out there that will treat you better and pay you better for the work you'll have to do here. Don't accept anything less than 16 per hour even with no experience.
bad,"Kroger needs to help their employees more. The union getting underpaid by kroger. You have nobody backing you. If you love jobs that make you feel like your incarcerated this is the job/ Career for you."
bad,"A typical day at Kroger is hard."
bad,"Paid less than minimum wage, threatened and assaulted by management, then banned my entire family. Doesn't pay out vacation pay, if you don't go away quietly."
bad,The union sees to it that you don’t get a raise worth anything. You get .25 cents a year as a raise if the contract is renegotiated and you’re not paid enough to live on. Certain people are held accountable for their jobs while others are not. You have to be promoted to full time in order to get full time pay even tho you work 40 hours every week.
bad,Kroger is one of the worst companies to work for and their managers are trained to not care about their employees . You will get slaved but will get paid minimum wage . We have been lied to for almost a year about getting a pay increase . They expect cashiers to go outside and get carts because they can’t keep any baggers cause people are always quitting . It’s unfair . I wouldn’t dare work at Kroger again .
bad,"Very poor management , will move other people up before you. Customers are extremely rude and little pay was ofter. Kroger treats their employees awful and will fire you for no reason. This place is severely under staff , you will be overworked and underpaid. The company doesn't like diversity !!!"
bad,"The worst place l ever worked,  period!!! Thank God l left. I loved my customers and coworkers,  but the Management its POOR!!! You're treated like a slave. It's all about who you know in the company..."
bad,"I only applied cause I desperately needed a job. "
bad,"I worked there a long time ago, I believed they're paying more now but was working for a measly 7.25 an hour straight out of high school, wanted to leave but really needed the work at the time. Tried talking to the manager or one of them at the time, it was made difficult to get it back, but the overall terrible experience here was terrible."
bad,"I had applied here and specifically asked for a Full-Time position at the store I am at now and they told me that I would be full-time. Come up the other day I am not full time, but only part time working full time hours. So in order to get health insurance, I have to work 40 hours a week minimum and never miss a day of work for 1 full year as a overnight, Part-Time Associate. I also had to wait a full year before I got any kind of paid vacation time. These people will swindle you into thinking you’re a full timer and in reality you’re not."
bad,Management to lowest employee...they just don’t care about you and you having anything outside of work.  Employees don’t care about you either cuz if they don’t get what they want they just call off anyways.
bad,the hardest part of this job is that the manager is all way right and the workers are wrong and customer is right to with everything they can make stuff up to get free stuff.
bad,"Worked at Kroger's for 17 years and I'm glad I walked away from it.. I worked in the office doing accounting for 14 years. My last manager had his click an if you where not in it your just another peace be of you know what that they can walk on... I asked for help an I was told I've been doing my job long enough an we are not gonna show what you did wrong. But they sure did have the other acsms shadowed by a CSM.from a nother store because they where not doing it correctly. So why them an not me? "
bad,"The hiring manager was unprofessional.despite I stated I was keeping my other job as part time or less working around Kroger. they responded it would work after I asked all the questions to make sure.they actually hired me than retracted what was agreed."
bad,It can change from day to day. I think the management treats us like slaves and doesn't care about us or recognize us enough. I feel like management is not working along us and doesn't know what we go through on a day to day basis.
bad,"Upper management was just down right hateful. I never called out and the one time I did, the assistant store manager freaked out. I had just gotten off a long and late shift and came home to my father having a heart attack. I stayed in the ER with him all night and when they finally put him in a room the next morning, I called work to let them know that I wasn't going to make it in that afternoon. She told me that I still need to come in. She said that I wasn't a doctor or a nurse so there was no need for me to be up there. She told me to leave the hospital and go home and take a nap so I could be at work on time. She then proceeded to ask me where my mother was and how come she couldn't handle that. I told her sorry and that I wasn't coming in. My father ended up having open heart surgery. He had a 5 way bypass. I've never seen such a lack of compassion in my entire life. I was not the only one that had something like that happen. Many of my coworkers had similar experiences when trying to call out or leave early for family emergencies. We were treated like mindless robots."
bad,When dealing with racist people who are in charge you fight a losing battle. When you go through the proper chain of command you get black listed and tormented. In the end you quit and he gets a promotion. I feel this way even after I got 6 months back pay because instead of filing for my temporary leave of absence he filed job abandonment paperwork instead and got in trouble with the union. But they still promoted him anyway.
bad,"They promise full time, only for 3 months to go by and then they cut your hours. The final week needed for full time. I cleaned their nasty moldy ceiling because I thought I was getting full time."
bad,Management was horrible pay was low job was very physically strenuous only hired certain people for first and just a terribly horriblework environment
bad,"Kroger, more specifically pick n save stores are absolutely terrible to their employees. They try to force people to quit if they have cancer. They make empty promises. They will completely throw your availability out the window after guaranteeing your availability will work for them. They're completely biased. I have dozens of recordings proving their terrible treatment of employees and their lies. Recorded them guaranteeing my availability and then changing it multiple times. Recorded HR telling me they'd handle it only to have them do absolutely nothing. Recorded managers admitting to me that other managers were working together to force people they didn't like to quit by making them do things they couldn't do. Do not work for Kroger or any of their affiliates. Even their HR is dirty."
bad,"Pay is awful, advancing is non existent, and the salary is awful. Would not recommend if you have a family because you would not be able to pay for anything."
bad,Kroger’s is a place where I will never in life work again because they are very favoritism and rude and don’t care about the workers and i don’t like working there
bad,"when i first started working there i thought i liked it, but as the weeks rolled by it continued to get worse for me. i had to leave and find what was best for me."
bad,It was terrible manager and assistant manager were terrible. Department was understaffed. Lazy co-workers. Hours were bad no vaca. Lied to about advancement.
bad,"This job is only good as a temporary job until you find something better. It's stressful, and the hours are not flexible. There is no room for advancement and they play favoritism. They do not care about your wellbeing and expect you to have no life but to work at krogers."
bad,Poorly staffed CSRs... they make their cashiers PUSH CARTS when there are perfectly capable young guys to do that job.  I pushed carts for 8 hours one day and the CSR never gave me a break.   My shoulder hurt so bad the next day that I had to send my son to Grandpa's house. Poor management is an understatement.
bad,"Kroger was a very fast pace, stressful workplace. rules seemed as if they changed daily.  Management was confused, and really did not seem to care about anything, but having the store in order for the CEO coming."
bad,"The company claims that they are very associate focused. This is not true. When it comes down to it, hours get cut and you are expected to do the same job with less hours, less people, and less pay."
bad,"I worked at Kroger Market place in Chester,Va for 3 1/2 years and very disappointed in management.  They promise opportunities to grow in company but the truth is another story.  Favortism seems to play major influence instead of actual work experience.  The store has such a shortage of help and quality of work has fallen when one person is expected to do 3 job positions  I rarely received 2 days off in a row or even rarer was a 2 day week end off.  Quality of life is greatly sacrificed to receive money to pay your bills."
bad,"Every day was a busy day , you learn how to work as a team. Management was ok. Work place culture was friendly. Harest part of the job was that things change constantly  ."
bad,"I wouldn't recommend working here, it's almost as if there is absolutely nothing to do except listen to people complain for eight hours. I didn't learn anything here and management doesn't care about workers until someone takes a break for a minute too long. My manager didn't let me get water on a hot day while i had to work outside."
bad,"inconsistent scheduling.  Great place to work for seniors, college students, high school students, must be super friendly and provide great customer service."
bad,"Good experience to have on your resume. Other than that though, the company had a very high turnover the whole time, catty environment and advancement was focused on who you knew rather than your work ethic."
bad,"High turnover rate"
bad,You are way I've worked and under paid. Even if it's necessary you work mornings you're stuck on nights. Management doesn't know what they're doing and everyone is biased. You don't grow in the company and if you want full time well don't hold your breath it isn't very often you'll get it.
bad,"I wasn’t train for anything I was just told to do things so I took notes,the bakery was fun I learn a lot by watching, and doing hand on training , the department manger was cool all the workers got along great laugh joke had a great time and still got the jobs done"
bad,If and when u get a raise its 5 cents and they dont care if people call off and u are closing three departments will not make others help you. I have never quit a job till working with them
bad,"Working here was like working for an emotionally abusive parent. While I never was physically harmed, I never enjoyed my time at Kroger. I was hired as a part timer, but I didn't get part time hours, I worked full time instead even though I was a student. When I asked for days off, they were very invasive as to why I could not come in. The work was simple and I enjoyed my coworker's company, but even that could not save how unhappy that place made me. As a student, it never felt like school came first at my store, they only wanted me to work as much as possible, regardless of my previous obligations."
bad,"jobs like this are suposed to be temporary, but some people think that they cant do anything else and dont want others to succeed. and that is all i have to say about that"
bad,"Our store manager and assist managers, never fixes any problems. They would listen and just blow our problems off. My director manager made my work environment very hostile and no one would fix the problem. I thought Kroger was a good place to work, learn and build a career, I was wrong."
bad,"Kroger was one of my first jobs. I hated nearly every moment of every day I worked there. My manager was terrible to work with, she frequently tried to get me and other coworkers in trouble with upper management."
bad,"Bad management and policies not followed uniformly.  Management was also very racist.  Google ""Kroger accuses Black Man os stealing because he is Black"""
bad,"Kroger in Florence Oregon Sucks. the management at this store are self involved and do not pay attention to the customers at this store."
bad,"As of 03/15/2019, I’m back on the unemployed market. It was my choice, a choice I wouldn’t think twice before doing. To make the story short, I had planned to stick it out for a hot minute, but I was forced to work with the flu, and when I tried to take a day to get better, I was told by my manager to suck it up. Sorry, yours truly isn’t going to be run ragged like that.To make it even more interesting, that same manager had called in sick prior to my last day. Also, the store manager had quit because the company wouldn’t let him attend to a “family emergency “. PS: I also was riding my bike, a $200+ folding bike, to and from work and had it locked on their rack and someone stole it while I was working. It took me a month of saving up for it with my prior job, and that was my only way of getting around. So, I will not be taking my business to that place any more and a piece of advice I have to share is avoid rotary/ 3rd shift at all costs."
bad,"toxic environment , "
bad,"Job flexibility management is out of touch, not a fun environment. Scheduling is poor. Training is awful. Constantly short handed but still expected to deliver on high expectations with out zero additional hours."
bad,"Although flexible hours, poor working hours amount.  Want employee to bust their backs to meet corporate demands but won’t invest in employee growth.  Some managers are really nice."
bad,The managers don’t treat you good.  Neither does the customers. Schedules are flaky. One week you could have 40 hours the next you can have 10 hours. They lie about benefits. They don’t trust there employees and don’t make anyone feel appreciated.
bad,Too many managers makeing decisions and then a new group of managers would change them and that went on and on so you really did not know where you stood in the company
bad,Start my day  by clocking in then going to the backroom and opening the meat department. Then check out of date meat and mark down anything that is out of code or short shelf life. Cut all daily production for the store then clock out and go home.
bad,"Kroger used to be a decent place to work, but wages are not comparable to other retailers, management rude and disrespectful, and Kroger does not keep its Promise ( A set of values the company developed.)"
bad,I was a front end manager until my Father passed away. I also was never taught how to write a schedule. It is almost like they set you up for failure.
bad,Managers don't really care bout you. youre just another number that can be replaced. treat you awful. most heads of the departments don't care about u
bad,"Even when you try to lower hours then keep them the same or raise the hours even when you have less transportation, terrible management. Makes employees hate working there.. Can try and pick on you to make you do more stuff than everyone else. Just a weird environment in general..."
bad,The Kroger I worked at was HORRIBLE. I told people looking for jobs NOT TO APPLY THERE. The front end managers had their favorites and would yell at some of the other cashier if they were doing things they were not supposed to do and allow their favorites get away with doing the same thing you are getting yelled at for.
bad,I worked in a Plano location and it was not run very well. I constantly had problems with my schedule. The boss was very demanding. The working conditions were not that good.
bad,"As with any job in the south, the company feels like they are doing you’re such a favor by offering you a position with no advancement, no future, and you’re surrounded with a bunch of people who are very content on going nowhere in life.   The lies start before you even begin your job. They will tell you that your base pay is $16.50 an hour plus incentive, only to find out that your base pay is $11 an hour and in order to reach that  $16.50 an hour, you must produce around 130%. Furthermore, if you have a family, this is definitely not the place. There lies just continue to grow and grow and grow until you finally have had enough of their BS that so many people leave, yet they wonder why they have such a high turnover rate?   I wouldn’t recommend this job to anyone who has any ambition in life. You will never amount to anything here unless you suck their butt through a straw. I have 0 points and 0 write ups, and can’t wait until this place is in my rear view mirror."
bad,Most thankless job I've never worked so hard for so little pay even when the minimum wage was $3.35 an hour.treated like red headed stepchild.very little training wasn't informed that the position was seasonal
bad,"no room for advancement, poor management, require you to not have another job, very low weekly hours and not enough staff, hours get cut in the beginning of the year."
bad,"If you're over 18, this is not a living wage. Very stressful. Awful management. Loved my coworkers. They were awesome. Lots of drama with managers. Lots of infighting."
bad,"The Cashiering part was easy. But working Utility Clerk, don't get me started. baging is easy but you have to deal with rude people.They had me working in the negatives for 5 days straight pushing carts."
bad,The company is not a good company to work for at all management is poor the co-workers are disrespectful the company will fore you for any and every reason no matter what it is if it's legal or not.
bad,very poor management the people who run the stores are very racist and do not accommodate anything for there employees they give very little to no overtime and no chances to move up
bad,My experience with Kroger was awful. Management was very rude and disrespectful and don't listen to you about your schedule hours. They don't like to pay you the right amount of money you were supposed to get in the first place.
bad,The management at my location was so poorly educated and had no common sense in any category. They also tried to tell us we could not have anything but Kroger branded water (which they did not provide) even though some of us were outside in the 100-degree weather and needed electrolytes. This was also against OSHA rules and regulations. A couple of people would pass out every month from working here.
bad,it is a horrible work place. fire you because of medical issues and lie about you not turning in doctors excuses. they are very rude and disrespectful to employees.
bad,The pay was not enough and not enough hours weekly no room for advancement only 10 cent a year raise no adult person can maintain a household with that kind of pa
bad,"Poor management, Poor pay, Poor working hours/flexibility, Lack of seriousness over jobs/micromanaging. I will give a 150 character minimum but i have nothing nice to say about this job."
bad,"this is a goo place to work because it is good and it keeps getting better, i wasn't a fan of the management there and i think that it should change, thanks"
bad,This a terrible place to work. From the management to the culture. They're really are no benefits. It's stocking shelves for no pay. You can't raise a family let alone live off the stagnant pay they offer. No chance for advancement. I don't and won't shop there.
bad,"The management was poor, hours were inconsistent and that was very frustrating. The company didn't seem to care at all about it's workers. The pay was minimum wage. I was fired because I had to miss work for school and management refused to work with me on my schedule. I was also unable to move up to cashier even though I had requested to do so for months."
bad,I would never recommend Kroger to anyone. It’s a job for high schoolers only because no one really stays. Very stressful. Ever changing. Procedures change constantly so you can never grow a routine.
bad,"It Started off as a pretty easygoing job once I learned the rope until the holidays.Did not receive my W-2 ,Had my hours cut , Didn’t get paid for grevience time off"
bad,horrible place to work for I would not let my worst enemy work for Kroger. I started out a bagger then when it was time for my annual evaul I went to my HR and asked her if she could do it she said she would look into it. that went on for three years. there is no commincation no leadership no communication no happiness even to this day.
bad,"I was a bagger, I hated it, and no matter how much I worked on my testing to become a cashier, I was never promoted. Management was horrible as well, very uncaring about employees and their health."
bad,"Very old school set of rules. Management needs to all"
bad,"I was fired because the HR manager didn't make sure I was cleared to transfer before he had my replacement hired, and before I was removed from the Deli position and moved to being a temporary cashier for the waiting time that the other store was going to find an available position for me in the first place. This resulted in me having absolutely no schedule available in the system, nothing to verify, and one of the other managers telling the manager over the front end that my schedule is the same schedule as what I had at the Deli, despite the front-end manager specifically informing her that she does-not-have-the-available-hours-at-the-front-end-for-me-as-a-cashier-as-was-assigned. After I was told ""We can't use you, and your transfer has been denied"" (I had already been told that I was approved.)the HR manager had informed me a week later that he wasn't even told I was fired - and he was the one who was trying his best to get me transferred, because I was spending OVER HALF my waged just GETTING to work."
bad,"A typical day at work would be slicing meat and cheese, preparing fruit and veggie trays, sandwiches and wraps. Keeping slicers clean, doing the dishes and cleaning the floor."
bad,"Typical day at work was very busy, very fast paced. Management needs to be replaced with more helpful, intelligent individuals who can better run the store."
bad,"The only positive thing that I can say is that I am not there anymore!"
bad,"If you can tie your shoes then you can get a job at kroger.  Literally anyone can do the work there, they train you if you can;t.  There's always greeters at wal mart..."
bad,"I worked loyally to Kroger for two years and the management was just awful, he was rude, and always acted super off about things. My final straw working there was when I was asked to use the restroom in the back of the store cause of the way I cut my hair and how I dressed."
bad,I was hired for Home and Garden worked in home and garden a total of 3 days then was moved to fuel center and was told i would be back in Home and Garden in a week I was just covering for someones vacation and was never brought back to Home and Garden
bad,Everyone is miserable and feels the need to make you miserable. To the customers you are expected to smile and pretend like nothings wrong. Meanwhile behind the scenes you get yelled at because you will not let yourself be bullied by someone above you.
bad,Kroger is a horrible company to work for. Management and corporate never cares for any associates that are working for them. Management has no respect for their workers.
bad,"Store managers at Kroger are rotated in and out of stores leaving the cashier managers behind. It creates a disconnect between the store managers, and the employees. "
bad,"Pharmacy is run and staffed like a fast food restaurant. The pay at a fast food restaurant is better! Horrible pay, scheduling, benefit's. They understaff to make more money. Physically exhausting."
bad,"Mangers were hired due to favoritism none. Of them had completed college or any higher ed course work. Showed in attitude and treatment of other people. Do not work here if you respect yourself or have a life outside of work. Management had a constant revolving door of people going in and out, they could not keep anyone longer then 2-3 months."
bad,I didn’t care for this job mostly because of my managers. They were really rude and when they went to point out mistakes you made they told you in front of customers and humiliated you. They also don’t care about you personally as long as your job is done they are happy they have no interest in you.
bad,Worst job ever!!! Courtesy clerks are totally underpaid for the work they do! the staff is terrible and treat customers and employees terrible and on top of that our hours were bad as well. I would never consider someone I liked to have this job. ever.
bad,I worked there for less than 5 weeks. I loved my coworkers and the job. I had to miss 2 days because my children got sick. One was taken to the dr. They waited until I came in to work to tell me I was fired. I felt so humiliated.
bad,"Starting out you have to go threw 2-3 days of video training & the rest you figure out on your own.  Management are so brainwashed to do things "" the Kroger way """
bad,this place will sell you anything. they put out food they know is going bad. they cheat you out of your s/money and will gang up on customers.they are a poor company to work for.
bad,The management is horrendous. They don't care about you. They will agree with the customer and leave you to take the blame even if you were right. They don't offer any advancement no matter how much you ask.
bad,"It was a good job for a while. Need something different now though. Something more. People are good, so was management. Just trying to get to something more that fits my life."
bad,Kroger was a very hostile work environment. There was no respect given from management to employees. They do nothing but make promises they have no intention of keeping.
bad,Having worked in a few Kroger stores in various positions I have found it to be a poorly run company on a whole. Poor upper management and overall corporate employees who express very little concern for the store level employees. Top Store managers are not qualified for the position and have very little people skills. Union membership fees take a good bite outta your check weekly and union provides no real efforts to obtain better work environments and pay scales.
bad,"My department head was great. The store manager, not so much. Store manager tried to stop me from calling off 24 hours in advance  while my grandmother was in the hospital"
bad,They are selfish and don't care about their workers. I am tired of how they treat me there. A manager told me I had no life so I was forced to do what she needed me to do.
bad,"This company does not appreciate good workers.It has its ups and downs,but mainly downs in my opinion.I worked here for 8 years and it caused a lot of stress in my life.I worked very hard.I was the manager and management always made me feel like I didn't do enough."
bad,"I worked for ralphs/Kroger for almost 4 years. Let me tell you it was something else. I am not the person to talk bad about a company but they did not treat you right. Especially the store I worked at, it was all over the place and was not worth working there."
bad,"Every day one person is expected to work 3 different peoples jobs.  When someone quits it takes them 6 months to a year to replace them.  every department is way under staff.  People quite all the time because they do not get any help.  After I found a different job and put in my 2 weeks, they cut my hours from 39 to 27 hours per week.  My department manager quite a year latter because of lack of help."
bad,"A typical day of work is okay. You will mainly get carts from the parking lot, and assist customers and chasers. You will also have to clean a lot. Overall, the workplace is toxic, and it is not a place I ever enjoyed working at. Some employees deal drugs on the clock, some a good amount do drugs on the clock."
bad,"The working schedules were not flexible.  Not enough hours to keep me a float. It is fast paced and always busy. Friendly staff members, some have been there a long time."
bad,"Not good at all. The schedule posted was always changed giving me no time to plan time with my family. "
bad,"Cut hours for bigger bonuses for upper management"
bad,"Plain and simple, they don't really care about the employees unless you're good at sucking up. Not sure about other departments, but they do not know how to schedule or be honest with us in mine. They will schedule you for 19 or less hours a week and then call you in when they become short handed at their own fault. They also lie about position availability as well as advancement. Hard work will not get you very far in a place like this, especially if you're wanting to make a career out of it."
bad,data entry is a job that will never challenge you in any way. you never have to rise to an occasion. there are no highs and no lows. there is really no meaning to your life
bad,"Run like .......!  The management is terrible and rude!  You not only work your asz off, management is NEVER happy with your efforts. You get paid slave labor (look at other chains and retail, fast food, etc) and you are just a number that they will fire on the spot.  Do some homework, they cannot keep employees because of the turnover.  People quit after a few shifts or sooner. I would give a zero on every rating but it's not an option. Kroger is the devil....they will steal your soul.  There's many other jobs that pay better and you don't have to feel horrible for busting your asz! I did this horrible job for six months."
bad,Working conditions/ tasks that had to be done were simple/easy nothing to dramatic working here but the customers can wear and tear at your soul form time to time. Standard work environment.
bad,It was okay to work there for the time being. I was able to learn about all imported meat and cheeses while getting an understanding from what customers want face to face.
bad,"Did not like working here. Management was always grumpy, everyone has a very sullen attitude, all day the employees just talk about how much they want to go home, and there is no personability. I tried to come in to work and cheer everyone up every day (was 16 when working there) and would be shut down by my older, grumpy managers for so much as smiling. Do not work here."
bad,"This place is a burning dumpster fire. Some managers will haze you and no one will care. They expect everything from you, including your health and mental well-being, for almost minimum wage and incorrect checks. The company changes its mind so often about things that no one really ever has an idea of what's going on, so miscommunication and confusion are a constant workplace hazard. They can't keep employees or management at all, so it's always understaffed with people who don't know what they're doing, which pretty much just adds fuel to the fire. "
bad,They will screw you left and right. Only the favorites get raises and promotions. I dont have much else to say. THey suck and I dont want to talk about it
bad,Wish they paid more than 10 an hr we bring in less than Walmart does Walmart brings in dollar more than us it is so underpaid they treat others Horribly Kroger is not good place to work for they treat people like dogs
bad,"I was employed with Kroger for over 10 years,  I was never able to move up as management continually demonstrated favoritism and unfair practices.  "
bad,Horrible. Mistreated me. Worked me as a slave. Would of stayed there if manager would of talked to me but he webtvaround saying where i was going and talked bad about me leaving
bad,They did not offer any benefits unless you joined the union. They started me out on great hours then cut me down to 20 hours a week. Other than that it was an ok place to work.
bad,"Overworked, department head always in a seprate department, co-workers refused to do certain tasks, most of the time alone in thw whole department even though combined two departments."
bad,They are not professional with hiring. It takes weeks for background checks to come back. You sit and wait for your orientation and then  they low ball you with pay after the long process.  They do not return calls on hiring status.
bad,You Get to refill and take prescriptions. Talk to customers inbound and outbound . Use computers to locate patients  .talk within the Kroger building to employees about anything they listen pertaining to work
bad,"Dirty, overworked, TERRIBLE PAY, TERRIBLE HOURS, the fight for breaks is BRUTAL, the only discount you get is 10% off of KROGER BRAND FOODS, despicable management, they’re rude and judge mental."
bad,Don’t ever work for Kroger. They only care about making money and they fire people left and right doesn’t matter if you’re innocent or not because they don’t care. Also for all the hard work you do the wages suck. Don’t even dream about having weekends off or working good hours if you are cashier or parcel. Overall this place has bad management who wants to pay the people at the top big bucks and lay off all the hard working people. Don’t ever work for Kroger !
bad,slave you and under pay you. went two years without a promotion the last time I put in for an advancement they gave it to someone who has a months experience and I had a little under two the store manager was on a power trip wouldn't even let me transfer to another store
bad,the pay was terrible. You couldn't get a weekend off. The shifts were all over the place and never consistent. I only got 6 hours a day and there was no overtime.
bad,"People are rude, horrible management, non flexible hours, work there is horrible. The management don't caee about your personal life. The employees are horrible."
bad,"If you seek very, very poor management, uncooperative coworkers, a hostile work environment, and no time to yourself, among more things, Kroger is the place for you! I would never recommend any job from Kroger to a friend."
bad,okay if your young but if your 18 and older it is a complete waste of time. they don't pay well and you really do aloot of work for a job that doesn't give you a living wage
bad,"I work at two kroger store the first Kroger which was based of Cincinnati Ohio branch was awesome great paid and got a raise every few months it was located at Troy Ohio, Then I had to move to get away from a abusive relationship I had no choice but to move so I had to give my job up then I moved to follansbee wv the closes krogers we have are 4 different stores I got hired at the store in weriton the one that's on three springs dr anyway it started out good till my magnesium oil check I got only for 8 hours it was not right then almost every check was this way i always had missing hours then they want me to stay later no thank you if i dont get paid for it then the hr there had no idea what they are doing yes there was more then one like 5 crazy but none knew how to do time or go through proper hiring or how to give  Experience pay my was only 10 cent for always three year working at another kroger I know that was not right I had to quite cause of the stress and the management yelled at me in front of customers they are not supposed to do this now they had open interviews for krogers in my area Oct 4 2018 it been two years since I quite I thought I go back to work for some extra money for the holidays and they would hire me back I have  Experience in 3 different departments deli bakery Starbucks and I can run a  Cash register and still they would not hire me back cause i quit on them I know that people quit and got hired back this  Ridiculous I should sue for description I cant get hired at none of the Krogers in my area based off the  Columbus branch they need to get help"
bad,Just wasn’t a good fit. Department head and managers were very rude and always complained when you you didn’t come in on your off days. A lot of times I was treated wrong because I was looking to make a career out of kroger
bad,"No hours, managers talk about you behind your back, low pay and managers are not organized at all. they send you from department to department and doesn’t change pay rate."
bad,"Stay away from this place at any costs. Management is the worst they complain about just anything you do, they don’t give you any credit even if it means you are doing something very good for the store and it’s all favoritism for them they promote the people they only like and just leave the rest to rot. Overall just stay away and find somewhere else to work because they will drive you into the ground."
bad,Ehh it sucked workinghere did not get paid enough and they onlylet me work 2 days awwweeeekkk so it waaaas noooot wooorthhh itttt first tieme job but still
bad,"They were so rude and racist when they found out I have biracial children, they cut my hours for no reason and they are super rude when you don’t work 24 hours a day 7 days a week"
bad,Do not get a work life balance. Very very stressful. Becoming a lot like other competitors. Use to be a great company to work for but not anymore. Needs to change for the better
bad,"As the least paying retail store in the United States, you would think that Kroger would offer at least a few benefits to make up for their lack of payment. Nope. "
bad,"Itts a union, they pay the bare minimum, mainly a kids job. the adults act like kids, the managment rolls over every 3 months because they are terrible."
bad,"This job is overall not a good one, between the inflexible hours, no consistency, not enough hours,and the lack of management and understands baffles me, and i would not recommend working here even if its just for experience."
bad,"Totally disparity,  Kroger is a nightmare.  Modern day slavery, wouldn't  even recommend  this company to my worst enemies, just an absolute  disater for employees."
bad,"never ever work here, they don't care about employees or customers, they just want to make as much money as they can with no regard to anybody besides the people in charge"
bad,"An absolutely terrible workplace and environment, the co-workers can be great and wonderful, but 90% of the time they are rude and crude. The managers don't really care about your well-being unless you file for workers comp,  the workers comp, doesn't even compensate for your time you missed because of an injury. Overall, i will never suggest someone to work at this place, i have worked for 3 different Kroger and the management is always the same, self-absorbed."
bad,"Managers are very aggressive and non friendly and give very unrealistic targets and goals, but then get very mad and frustrated when they are not met."
bad,"I worked for Kroger for about a year and I just have to say it was the WORST job Ive ever had. They do not care for their employees. Honestly, just save yourself some time and apply for a different job. Going to work everyday was like going to high school, non-stop drama."
bad,"poor management.poor management.poor management    .poor management.poor management. excessive OT. dirty plant. management degraded mangers in public. Bad people, bad place to work, not professional"
bad,"This was  my first grocery store job. It went well at first, until i started getting moved around into  different positions with the minimum training."
bad,I hated working here. The management is rude and stupid. They are rude to u and they are racist too. My manager was even rude to people with health problems and would not compensate on family issues and would ask for proofs. And she also wanted me to prove it to her that i was at my grandmas funeral that is how insensitive she is
bad,this job is ok for a part time job. they work you to the bone and expect you to do your work and everyone elses. managers were average at best. not a long term job
bad,There was not consistent breaks and the management team did not seem to care about the folks in the fuel center.  The pumps are typically broken and the hours were all over the place.
bad,"On a typical day at kroger, I would clock in and start bagging groceries. If  I was needed I would go outside to get the carts from the cart corrals. We would only have three people in the store that were baggers which really hurt our productivity. By the time one of the corrals was cleared and we moved to the next the other would be filled. We then would be told we were stealing time even though we were trying to keep the corrals cleared."
bad,Workplace culture has become very cut-throat over the last few years. Is not likely to improve with ever increasing competition. Favoritism is abundant for promotions.
bad,"I didnt understand kroger policies and they didnt give me enough hours to even want to work ever again , every manager was mean to the employees, most people didnt understand what was going on"
bad,"The people i worked with was cool, but lazy. The management was horrible. They didn't care for our department. They talked to us crazy. The scheduling was very poor."
bad,Not a great place to work. Management sucks. They don't care if you're sick. They expect you to be at work everyday. They also play the favoritism card. The management is also very unprofessional.
bad,"I started working at Frys in 2011 and ended employment by forced resignation November 7th 2018. Throughout the years i worked there I received no chance for advancement, constant ridicule from coworkers and bosses and I was always written up for ridiculous reasons. If the bosses ever did anything wrong, they would blame the underlings for their failures. Don't apply here because you will probably go through the same thing I did. Also buyers beware, they will put clearance sell almost expired foods and drinks and I almost got badly sick because of it."
bad,"bad management, very rude bad hours didnt respect anyone very harsh on new employees if they messed up by accident they were overly harsh and not understanding at all"
bad,"This place is so sad, so many great people work there for nothing and then you have like 2-3 awful individuals that think they run the place.  A great deal of jealousy and gossiping, talking mean about other employees, the managers even made fun of some...a colleague asked me to start listening to the conversations on the internal ear pieces and I about dropped dead when I heard what the former GM, Bistro Manager (who loved giving away free food to  any group-load it up and walk out the door! "
bad,"The management at Kroger was not its best, but I did enjoy my time there because of my coworkers. I also learned the basics of retail and customer service."
bad,"hours were trash, management are stupid ex-cashiers with nothing but a GED or less, not worth the time you would spend here working, the pay sucks and the atmosphere is garbage."
bad,"Kroger is a Union based company. Do not expect to get paid any where close as to what all the other grocery stores pay their employees. Every time I went in to work, it just felt like a cold and dark place. There just seemed to be no energy inside the store to help motivate the employees."
bad,"Office culture is dead, management plays favorites, cheap, penny pocketers.  Get the most value out of you and they DO NO hire from within.  Only externally"
bad,They play favortism and lie and work you to hard for little pay managers are hard to speak to and do not have your back they are not flexible when I told them I wanted to finish school.
bad,"I first started at Kroger when I was 17. It was my first job and I was so excited. That quickly went away after just a few weeks. Not enough training, people advanced before me even though I had seniority, one manager would say one thing but another says the complete opposite so you never know which is correct. In the year+ I worked there I received one raise and it was .05 cents. Yes that is correct an entire nickel. Now I know this is a part time job and I want expecting to make a ton but after a year I only get a nickel raise after I'm worked like a dog? No thanks."
bad,Very very horrible. Lack of performance inconsistent payment checks we're. Lost almost every other week managers very rood disrespectful. Does not treat every one the same
bad,People there are very rude and the management is unfair. Bad pay to anyone new and little to no benefits. Nobody cares about safety. Worked by myself from 11pm-1am as a 18 year old girl. Felt very uncomfortable.
bad,"very unprofessional place to work , very uncomfortable place to work to work envirment is incredibly uncomfortable the min u walk through the door .. people there aren't really as happy as they seem its basically like all a show they put on in there … I hate that place with a passion...."
bad,"Very long work days.  Never any time for a break"
bad,the management has no compassion. When you are the only one in your household and pay all the bills Kroger does NOT pay enough to cover all the bills and make sure that you have food on the table. There are other jobs STARTING THEIR EMPLOYEES OUT higher than what I am making at Kroger.
bad,The management is terrible and get used to working multiple jobs for the pay of half of one. You get threatened to get written up for every mistake you make. Terrible place to work.
bad,Kroger could be a decent place to work under the right management and if the employees could be treated a little more better. Seemed as though unless you were a upper manager you did not matter.
bad,"A typical day includes checking in with other associates, taking an area for assembling and making neat items in Apparel Department.  The hardest part of the job is maintaining all racks/shelving neat at all time.  The most enjoyable part of the job is assisting customers finding items desired."
bad,Management all picked a favorite and let that said person do whatever they wanted that had nothing to do with their job while everyone else had to do their job.
bad,"I really don't have anything negative to say about my experience working at Kroger's."
bad,I was terminated from kroger because of an injury not a very good look for the company I worked there for ten years and my manager told me i was not coming back
bad,"I wrked for Kroger Company for 12yrs. This particular store ws my last starw Kroger-Starkville, Ms i have never wrked in a place so disorganized within management,  very poor.  Every dept manager has a favorite and if yur not it, u get treated poorly or used if u dnt speak up for yurself. Mainly yu hav to be a butt kisser to be treated fairly its sad. No organization or leadership skills."
bad,They shorted my pay and instead of helping me out they gave m the run around. Then they still wanted me to work without proper compensation. Good first job for the summer but never again.
bad,Terrible management when I worked there. No room for growth. Company was very cut throat managers would throw employees under the bus for stuff they where asked to do. I would not recommend here at all.
bad,"Kroger has an extremely high turnover rate. The pay is not competitive. You work with a lot of teenagers who no call and no show or just call off, often which means double the work for someone else."
bad,Poor mangement no support on training and it was very unperfectional and not much respect eith employee's or management team it was just not the best job to work i did not enjoy it
bad,"Time and time again, the meat manager would slack off to make out with his girlfriend on company time (in the room where the meat is processed) and continuously get orders wrong, where myself and my co-workers would take the fall from customers. The manager was aware of this and chose to take it out on us rather than replace our manager, 3 of us left by the time I had, and we don't intend on coming back."
bad,"its weekly pay but your checks will come up short everyweek which means more problems, the staffs dont listen when you complain about something and they also do not care when you have a family emergency"
bad,This is not a nice company to work for. They base hours off of seniority even if the your senior is terrible. You're stabbed in the back every time you turn around. Good luck getting a pay raise.
bad,"Kroger is a not a good company to invest your time in. they have poor work ethics and poor attitudes throughout their stores. they've tried implementing better mood programs because the problem is so grave. their employees are unhappy and over-used without proper compensation or coaching/motivation."
bad,"Not flexible with hours, lack of hours, poor pay, Poor management. uncaring management. rude supervisors. no job security at all. no benefits. poor break schedules."
bad,I would not work there ever again. They have so many assistants managers to many of them. there is eight and none of them know whats going on most of the time.
bad,There was just too much commotion . Management was horrible . People in higher positions were just rude because they could be . There really wasn’t any respect in the work place
bad,"I've been here for 5 years and I make $10/hr. Management doesn't care about you. If you get sick, they will write you up (even with a doctor's note). They will always think you're faking and will make stuff up about you. It's like high school all over again (with the older employees not just the high schoolers). I prefer working with the high schoolers rather than the older employees. The lines are always long, and customers always complain because there's only one person behind customer service. They never schedule enough people to work."
bad,"I thought that this would be the best place to work. Management has changed that view for me. Well my store, I don't like. Cant compare it to other stores though."
bad,"There are very few jobs I can literally say I hate. The people I work with were fine but don't ever expect to get any breaks. Seriously, they won't give them to you if they don't think they have to. On top of that if your sick and need to go home the managers will break contract rules and tell you to suck it up. the front end managers care about their people and not anyone else. It's really a thankless job."
bad,If your a politician? Work there and if not dont be expected to get ahead. If you like a atmosphere of learning and getting a feel of how you will know what needs to be done? Forget it. It wont last and they will change things weekly and just as soon as things start to work they will change them on you.
bad,"This place may have changed but when i was working for it ....they used you up and took any chance they could to cheat you out of a pay raise."
bad,They don't respect days yo request off. The only raise i got was when minim wage was increased. It is union. You get two breaks and a lunch for an 8 hour shift.
bad,Don't go here for a job... management changes all the time so the rules change constantly...your hours get cut all the time... advancement is literally impossible unless you kiss someone's rearend...just a stressful bad place to work!
bad,Kroger was the worst place to work. there were no advancement opportunities and even when doing the most work you got paid less then everyone else. everyone was super cranky and rude to each other all the time
bad,"stock produce and ensure that the produce is culled,demonstrates ability to perform duties successfully with minimal supervision be knowledgeable about produce"
bad,"anytime you think something is going well for you in this job, the managers come through and ruin it for you, then expect you to work harder. for the most part everyone you work with is lazy, so if you take work seriously, expect to pick up slack for everyone else on top of your own endless work."
bad,I hate that place with all my being and dont reccomend ANYONE to work there. Most of the people you work with are nice but the management and people close to management are very mean.
bad,Overall the management is terrible and the pay is even worse. They pay 15 cents above minimum wage and expect you to be loyal even though they don't offer any incentives what soever to provide good work
bad,Poor management and workers wouldn’t do there jobs and try and put it on others and favoritisms was a big thing with the managers they were also unfair about spreading the work load
bad,I did my job and loved my job but need a different atmosphere. With me having kids and them not working wirh me i need something different. I learned alot from there.
bad,"First job ever, regrettably. I wish I had never worked there. Typical day includes the usual except you'll be doing everyone else's job for them because they are too incompetent to do it themselves. I learned CYA and what that means. That should be an indicator of how it is there. Only good part is that you get to be very close to some people, but really that happens at a lot of jobs."
bad,Very low salary and worst management. Union and seniority of other employees are only important for them. Treating new employees very badly especially when they are in probation periods! Will not recommend anyone to work there!
bad,"Cashiers and baggers do not get any respect from the management team. Promised a certain amount of pay and that was not met, treated more like children than adults. I was trained decently and now as they hire more people to fill positions they are not trained at all other than videos and just told to watch the others that have been here longer. There are coworkers that have been here for years and are treated with the same amount of respect as front end and stay hoping things will change but they don't."
bad,Although I was the number one employee as rated by the customers (whom I enjoyed) the management team there was the worst I have ever encountered in 43 years. I can only describe it as an evil place to work that I would never allow my children to work at.
bad,"I took this job with the hope it would be a legitimate change from the string of low paid jobs I've had, which it seems graduating from one of the best schools on the planet will get you these days.  It was one of the worst decisions I've ever made.  I only stuck with it for as long as I could handle it because I simply could not find anything else.  Every single waking second at this place is agony.  Avoid this industry - but more specifically - avoid this particular company at all costs.  Trust me, you will be better off to never know how ineptly a company can be run and how little you could possibly valued as a human being.  And I've worked at multiple locations for this company so it's just not one location to which I am referring.  I don't have one single positive thing to say about this employer and the time I have spent there.  Just keep on looking."
bad,"I have nothing more to say about this employer, I have had a very poor experience with them. I was my second time reapplying to this place of business. I you happen to interested please don't waist your time or energy. It really not worth the drama!"
bad,"worked there long ago and dont remember much. I was a clerk of all departments. People were nice and friendly, worked every holiday whether it was busy or not."
bad,Management and Communication is horrible. They will treat you horribly! No room for advancement and alot of favortism. Co-workers and customers are awesome!
bad,All my coworkers were either 30 year old losers making a dollar more than me and treated me like garbage or 16 year old kids who didn't understand the job and broke everything.
bad,"The management there was useless, if you made a tiny mistake, they took it as the end of the world. They expect you to do their job and more for less."
bad,Everyday was busy mostly on the holidays and the first day of every month. Learned to do everything on my own and do things that are out of the way. Management wasn't every understanding. Most of the people there were friendly but there was a lot of drama. I found it difficult the work in that type of work environment. I enjoyed having multi friendships with people in other departments .
bad,The union fights to keep to many people in a job that shouldn’t have one and don’t allow you to discipline associates as you should be allowed to. They expect way to much from their management staff and don’t give enough pay to compensate that!
bad,"Cashiering, stocking, produce clerk.. I learned how to use industrial kitchen appliances. Management didn't know what was going on. They didn't handle situations well."
bad,"Not a good job. The incentive to work here are not available and management is now finally stepping up to the plate to help, but to late customer are now seeking other stores.Bathroom breaks do not exist and breaks and lunch breaks are never on time. Hold it for as long as you can before just walking of to the restroom, to be paged from the restroom while you are rushing."
bad,Management was poor. Scheduled shifts were always in the way of other mostly academic responsibilities. Sometimes they would schedule me right after school and not let me leave until 11 o clock in the evening.
bad,"Corruption of management all the way up to regional including violation of laws, contracts, safety, treatment, poor benefits/pay, etc. Don't work here"
bad,manager was awful and treated me poorly. i never knew what i was working. every day i worked i felt there was a new manager and new employees never the same.
bad,"After working for Kroger for almost 5 years I have not fairly gonna the pay I deserve. I have been an acting manager for several different departments with out the pay to show it. I will say Kroger is a good starter job, but not good to grow in."
bad,"Kroger says that it is a progressive job and had room for moving up, but in fact does not. The managers are poor, the work environment is drab and they switch you from department to department when ever they see fit."
bad,"Kroger will always post job's, because no one last there, unless they're are old and just stacking up their retirement!!!. They really don't care about the employees and the union there!... Omg!!!!... It's a joke!!!!. The whole store is just a joke, and should be thrown away in a dumpster!!!!. The pay is ridiculously insane!. Don't even look at the ' we're hiring friendly faces' sign, that they put high up on their store's!!!!!"
bad,"The worse place I have ever worked at !! They don’t go by availability!! They are so messy and some are racist!! Most people that apply for this job doesn’t always stay because of the money , availability, and the mess!!"
bad,Whenever you went to work you felt like you were in high school. Management had their favorites and if you weren't apart of that then you were treated poorly
bad,I am very unsatisfied with my time employed with Kroeger. I am suppose to be part time and they have worked me double the hours I am suppose to. As a single mother I am missing out on time with my son.
bad,Hated it people are very rude nothing but childish behavior standing around not doing work rude to customers and co workers management are liars they don't do there job
bad,"it was a okay job!! didn't care for it much the company looked into helping customer's more than helping there associates. you could earn things if managers notice your ""work"""
bad,Kroger over works their employees and management is is poor. Didn’t pay me well enough to survive for the amount of work you put in. Low on staff and new hires
bad,"Kroger was my first job and I honestly hated it not worth the money. Too stressful, too much drama. Managers didn’t care about employees or what was happening in the store."
bad,I really liked working with the associates.  They were friendly.  The management was poor.  You did not have a set schedule.  I would be called in out of the blue and was expected to drop what I was doing . Meaning be at work in an hour. Poorly managed store.
bad,"Don't trust them, very bad place. They hired me, I gave my current job notice and was never was put on the schedule. When interviewed I was never told that it was late evening and nights. Or that part time is around 20 hours. I was only available for morning and days. When they couldn't bullie me into changing my availability they just didn't schedule me. Thanks to them I am unemployed. I left a good job getting between 30 to 40 hours with ok benefits to be treated  bad. Please don't fall for this scam like I did."
bad,"there was favoritism in the department I worked in. Others could call in without being threatened with a write up, yet if I did I got written up. Individuals would quit because of this and I would end up working 6 days a week."
bad,Kroger was a opportunity for me when i first moved to Georgia. As i stayed there for Three years i had to leave. it wasn't ran right & was horrible experience.
bad,"I like working with the customers that come into the store."
bad,Store 609 isn’t  anything you would like in my opinion their management sucks and they demand you to do stuff! They think they run you because their the manager but they don’t. Same goes for the supervisors there.
bad,Low wages. Low pay. Bad management. No chances for advancement. The work is painfully boring. It is a very strict environment which is counter intuitive when you're trying to be friendly with customers.
bad,"they are very unorganized, and have poor management. I have years of customer service experience and there were people who did less and worked less that received more pay."
bad,Do NOT work here! Management is absolutely horrible! They treat there employees horribly! They do not train you but then expect you to know how to do your job. They expect you to do the job of 5 people. There are no lunch breaks. If you are working 8 hours or more you get one 15 minute break. And anything less then 8 hour you get no breaks.
bad,Kroger is a horrible job they require to much for the pay rate which starts at $8 a hour. Overall management is rude and you only get promoted if you stay with the company for 10 years plus and when you do get promoted it’s never to a livable wage.
bad,"its a mess no one actually manages, and the people who work hard get screwed because everyone dumps there work on them and management doesn't do anything about it."
bad,"Zero training. Cut throat sink or swim mentality. Horrible management. I worked for this company twice, taking a 5 year hiatus. I went back to a different store hoping it would be a different experience. I was terribly wrong. Their starting wage is circus peanuts, and ask the world of you for said pay. Their staffing and retention issues are such a crisis that newbies will leave on their first day on the sales floor."
bad,I can't tell you how many times i got yelled at by someone cause i had my bagger talk to me or how many times a customer got mad that their coupon didnt work. When i got sick the store manager wasnt going to let me leave and go to the er. that place is garbage. they dont give breaks the right way and are just horrible and a joke!
bad,do cart and bagging groceries and help people and the work hard stay busy and trying do my best stay focus and being self and be  trying to  do my best friend
bad,Did not like working there not enough pay not enough hours management I did not care for mangers was rude always complaining didn't recognize me for being a hard worker
bad,No set schedule to many managers not enough hourly help no training long hours dirty not enough cleaning bad attidueds most enjoyable pay day to much product not enough customers
bad,"Poor managent and overall horrible enviroment at my old location. Managent wishy-washy, no real coworkers to rely on. Nonunderstanding of school schedule."
bad,Awful company. Do not fall for their lies. They promise you competitive pay I was making minimum wage and only received a 5 cent raise in my 2 years there. The only way you can advance is this career is with time. The union allows bad workers to stay and offers no compensation for quality of work. They will not work around your schedule. If you try to call off for a funeral or anything school related you will be scolded at and disciplined.
bad,"KROGER SUCKS, typical day in the pharmacy is being harassed by the impatient customers who just can't deal without their opioids.................. Upper management is A JOKE"
bad,Management was friendly hardest part of the job was cleaning and stocking the store before it opened met a lot of friendly people workplace culture was diverse
bad,keep in mind i was working in a kroger located in a low income area in dekalb county georgia. Nobody wanted to work there so there where shifts i was bagging all the groceries in every line with the cashiers and a manager. i was overworked and underpaid..(7.25). period.
bad,"I don’t know about other Krogers’ in other areas, but I had a horrible experience here. Managers will go to their higher ups and lie about things you’ve done simply because they don’t like you or for whatever reason they can think of. There were times where there wasn’t even change or fresh cash drawers for people arriving for their shifts. The store is on the verge of shutting down, I couldn’t seem to get any schedule, and when I did have a schedule it was for only weekends and only 6 hour shifts. How can someone live off of that? They also tell you that they understand that real life situations can pop up from time to time, but if you even speak of something that came up with you, they’re threatening to fire you. Basically, you get treated nicely if the managers like you and treated very poorly if they don’t."
bad,"Good luck working here one of the worst companies I have ever worked for. They are going to tell you how much Kroger loves their employees, and how much they care about you. Its just a bunch of fluff to make you feel great during orientation. First day you will be thrown into the fire and good luck because they don't care. We were always short staffed and never had enough people so we were always behind. They would say always help the customer the customer is always right and they come first. Well then the lines would back up and guess what they would call you over and over on the intercom to come help bag or check out. Well if you leave a customer to help guess what you are in trouble, secret shopper comes in while your bagging , you fail that and you and your department get in trouble. If you don't go up when they call you, you get a warning, or even a write up for not following directions. Though the write ups were rare and usually they would tag something else on top so you couldn't say you were helping the customer. The Union was essentially useless I could never get any information I needed about anything I would get the run around. Overall I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone how such a horrible company stays in business is beyond me. Oh and I hope your okay with management making you feel like you don't work hard because they will make you feel like you suck at your job no matter how hard you work."
bad,I would not recommend this job to anyone but teens. The pay isn't great and there is zero lack of communication. They do not care if ppl show up and leave you holding the bag.
bad,"During my time here I was treated like I was nothing, there was constant gossip and no one seemed to like working there, the longer you worked there the more you realize, wow, people only stay because of the insurance. One person there regularly worked 60 hour work weeks and had 3 heart attacks while working there and they still expected him to work those kinds of hours, truly appalling."
bad,"discount on Kroger's things and good reg hours ,just I was a lead deli clerk and all I did was fry chicken ,not all other things deli clerks do so I was lead to think I was a cook,and I didn't like cooking so I quit after 8 years ,and found a happy to work,where they all smiled and work together as a team."
bad,"Very poor management, negative working environment caused by complacent supervisors as well as administrators. Extremely poor wages for backbreaking work, non-existent benefits and no job growth potential. "
bad,"I was hired in as a cashier. I was told that my main job would be to run a register. I was wrong, my schedule keeps being changed each week to fill in a position that they can't keep people in due to the way they treat their employees. I have been put into the position of a courtesy clerk, not the position i was interviewed for!  If you are considering a position with Kroger be prepared for them to run your life. The whole idea of Kroger being union based only benefits the full time employees, and the part time whenever it is convenient."
bad,I’d never make this mistake again . I got hurt numerous of times by other employees wrong doings. I never came into a clean working environment which put me behind on my task but I still got them done thankfully. Management treated us employees like dirt on the bottom of their shoes.
bad,I worked in three different departments and was only paid 7.55 an hour. Barely had any vacation days or PTO. Management was unhelpful and always bullied workers.
bad,"Management frequently ignores broken and dangerous equipment, employee availability, time off requests, leaking ceiling's, and customer complaints. No one takes ownership of mistakes within the store, instead choosing to blame either another manager, or another employee. Drama runs rampant throughout the entire store fueled by rumors, yelling matches, and even occasional physical altercations. Instead of fixing this behavior upper management encourages it through creating rumors themselves, and badmouthing employees in a very unprofessional and non-constructive manner."
bad,They throw you in to learn on your own and then get upset if it isnt done correctly.  The other assiciotes act like they are in high school and lie about you and expect to get five different jobs done at once and get mad if you done get them done and make you stay over time which they dont want to finish everything
bad,Managers have favorites. their “favorite” people wont show up to work and wont get in trouble they’ll probably even give them more hours but when a new hire does it they get CHEWED out and grt told not to let it happen again Or Else. everyone ends up quitting because of the managers attitudes. DO NOT work here if you have another job they dont make your schedule balance and youll get in trouble when you tell them you cant go in !!!!!! DO NOT work front end they treat all children that are 16 or still in HS like dogs / animals and youre forced to be outside regardless of what weather condition
bad,Kroger is a terrible place to work if your looking to make a living. They do not give you enough hours. They pay minimum wage with no option to be full time.
bad,A typical day at Kroger is terrible and they treat their employees like slaves. They dont care about your feelings and the pay is awful so I would not recommend this job to anyone.
bad,"Hours were always late, never saw my family, they put me at the furthest store located to my house.  I never got any weekend time off and the training was 6 weeks of classroom and then thrown into the fire."
bad,"I will say that, the only reason people work at the kroger company is because it does have cheap benefits that work well, but the company does not pay very well and it is very hard to become full time at this company as well it is a Unionized company and it does have a contract that it does have to abide by with the employees, which does not seem fair to the hard workers that do not need the insurance but need the money to make a living and the hours."
bad,I worked for the kroger on howell mill in atlanta that was a bad choice. I wasn't getting no hours while making 7.25 weekly. Manager was rude and unfair. She wanted me to do everything while she walk around talking on her phone
bad,"Lazy, mouthy managers, horrible pay, no empathy for anyone, way too much drama for a work place, high school-like atmosphere, no one can take responsibility for ones issue, likes to point fingers."
bad,"I was an order picker for the Kroger stores, I would pick an order and take it to the shipping panes and drop in off and receive another order  and repeat."
bad,"no incentive to work here, treated unfairly, no raised after being there for two years, no opportunity to succeed in this company, I wouldn't recommend anyone working here"
bad,it is a horrible place to work everyone is not friendly and will throw you under the bus if you so much as breath in the wrong place management is a joke and does not need to be in charge of anyone
bad,"Kroger is Union but I was never done fair after I complained on how unfair they were to me. I never received any insurance, I was told to wait even my raise and kept all others who complained and came later, when I gave them an A+ Performance. supervisors and management are unfair and selfish and leadership stinks."
bad,I learned how to multitask and work efficiently. Meeting new people was a pro. Miscommunication in the department was a con. Working at Kroger encouraged me to explore other opportunities.
bad,Do not work at this company unless you want to wait one whole year to get your health insurance. The management was not nice and they always made excuses as to why you couldn't drink water when you went outside in the heat to pick up carts.
bad,I dealt with customers in the bakery deli front end money handling bagging and customer service answering phones and cashing checks stocking shelves. Show customers dicferent products
bad,"Store management is a absolute mess, management depends on employees and still runs them off. Very unprofessional environment! Store manager adds her ""favorites"" on Facebook and then sends screenshots of employee conversations to other manager friends, makes no changes to employees who request help or come to them with problems. Kroger has a huge depression rate."
bad,"mission is to build connections between our clients and their potential customer base by creating a standard of excellence and providing top notch service while, fostering our teams’ growth through a rewarding and progressive environment."
bad,"Not the best if you have high functioning anxiety and work in a store that is popular and have you on your feet without any breaks. It pays the bills, but thats it."
bad,The managers suck here. They will disappear on you in a heart beat. They don't care if you are short staffed. They are two faced people. Never work here again.
bad,"I worked for Kroger for some money, then I started college and worked harder to pay off some classes for college. This job wasnt the best job but I always did my best, I worked in each department but with every low pay but I worked a lot of hours to make up the amount of money I was getting. At the end of each each I got paid 290.00 or less depending how much I worked because I started taking classes."
bad,Didn't get the right pay for my years of experience I was getting paid under minimum wage I would love to go back if my pay rate would go up other then that the job was okay and very easy I love to help people
bad,"There are so many horrible things about this company, its impossible to list them all. If anyone is thinking of working here, do yourself a huge favor and look else where."
bad,"Kroger can be a good place to work, i jmade many friends and got to know some of the customers as regulars. kroger tend to have to many policies and horrible management."
bad,"The team leads have stupidly high expectations and overwork you. The store policy was that no overtime was allowed, but they sill scheduled you for it. The leads would schedule one person during the busiest times in the deli/baker."
bad,Nothing is organized at Kroger. Employees are not treated fairly and they do not pay enough for the work that is being done. It is very unfair and unprofessional.
bad,Kroger doesn’t promote within so you will not be able to get any kind of promotion. There is too much favoritism that goes on and you can’t almost never get time off that you request.
bad,Kroger left everyone in the dark and decided to close down stores with the absolute minimum amount of time required to notify their employees. The rate at which stores were purchased made it clear that such decisions were made well in advance but corporate intentionally kept everyone unaware.
bad,Multitasking and speed is a must. Always on my feet. Never a dull moment. I learned to ask questions and get help right away. It helps to know where items are through out the store so you can assist the customers better.
bad,Working here was horrible the manager were all for themselves constantly throws workers under the bus they are so unprofessional there are all ways shaming the bad stuff that happens but never shines in the good we do
bad,"Would never work here again"
bad,"They are taking my job away, leaving me jobless. I've been working with this company for more than 5 years and they decided to close for good in my area."
bad,Horrible place to work. Wouldn’t suggest my worst enemy to work there. The management was terrible. They never stood up for their employees even if they were right. They would help the customer yell at the employee.
bad,no ratings. haven't worked for the company for years and have no idea what goes on there. It was a good started job and it helped me with my current job to understand it.
bad,Managment was horrible. Treated like trash and underpaid. Discrimination and racism is obvious. No backing for the employees and hours are inconsistent and you feel cheated. Advancement depends on who you know. Would not work for this company again
bad,It's OK you don't get enough hours cause they say they don't have the hours but they keep hiring people.they pay is okay but they like to short change you
bad,Worked here for six years did everything from customer service to accounting they loved me and what I did but didn’t want to pay me what I deserved for the amount of work I was doing.
bad,Terrible management. Always short handed and when you say something about it they try to get you fired and move on to the next employee. Worst company they don't listen to any feedback.
bad,"Meeting people was very fun at Kroger , you saw many different faces each day , the people were very fun and interactive , they really appreciate you ."
bad,Work and life balance was terrible.  The corporate chef had no idea of what was going on.  Had no real life kitchen experience.  I was told my food safety standards were too high.
bad,I found this place to be really hard to work for. Only offered part time with extremely low pay and not flexible with you at all. I only received 10 hours a week.
bad,the hours was not good there and the pay was nothing but minimum wages. you cant live off of the money that u make there and the managers where horrible as well
bad,I hated working at Kroger. Hours changed day to day so you could never plan for your home life. Always on your feet you weren't even aloud to lean on a counter with out someone yelling at you. No overtime and the pay was terrible.
bad,This used to  be a great job. So much has changed or maybe I've just out grown the job. Its like being in high school except your paid to be there. Great benefits but we are not treated fairly .
bad,It can be a nice place to work if you put your head down and ignore all the drama around you. Once you look for advancement management wants you to do really sketchy things. Since it was union it was very hard to get fired unless you didn't show up. So they would cut hours to nothing for people they didn't like. Very simple job with ordering and getting people work to do. I loved the job itself but won't deal with management who think they can ruin people's well being even when they're a good worker just because of personal preference.
bad,The particular store was poorly ran and I had a bad experience. Low motivation and lack of company support. Management needed change during my employment.
bad,"Management at store level sucks and corporate level is even worse , it's is a easy job but the mangers put to much stress on the workers and when corporate is in the store it worse ."
bad,"Working at Kwik Shop has been a challenging experience.  They demand a lot for the amount of pay. Overall, God is my provider, so I trust that all will be well in the end."
bad,"I didn't like working here I was young 16 at the time it was my first job. Management suck lied on me about not being there , best thing was the were pretty women in store"
bad,The pay sucks! Managers need more training in communication and working with their staff. 15 minutes breaks are not long enough if you have to stand for long periods of time. They care more about the customer then they do their empolyees.
bad,Managers where lazy. They never came when the front end called. the hardest part of the job was dealing with management and supervisors.  I worked. every Saturday from 3:30 to Midnight.
bad,"I was overworked, underpaid, unappreciated, mistreated, and abused. The store managers were horrendous, cruel, patronizing, and condescending. I would never want to work with Kroger ever again."
bad,"I was a bagger at Kroger. I had a reputation as the best bagger. All the other baggers were lazy, didn't want to work. So management expected more from me and I was the first choice if carts needed to be gathered or a spill needed to be cleaned. Because of this, I was never able to get another position. My pay was $7.25 per hour for the whole two years I worked there because baggers are not able to get a pay raise no matter what. I was denied full time because Kroger didn't want to pay for benefits. Kroger has given me an absolutely horrific work experience. I am much better off working at McDonald's which actually paid their employees based on merit, provides full time for those willing to work, and provides opportunities for growth and new experience. In my case, I learned to receive shipment and stock the restaurant. Something Kroger never did for me. Please, do not work for Kroger. Their policies are unfair, unreasonable, and care absolutely NOTHING for their employees!"
bad,"Kroger is a complete joke. More so, management. Once you get past the fakeness, rudeness, and overall nastiness of the store and it's location, sure... it's a GREAT place."
bad,A lot of call outs and no coverage. Worked with a lot of high school students. Never knew when you would get to go home. Often eat dinner at customer service desk. Union was awful!
bad,"There is absolutely nothing enjoyable about working at a Kroger store as a bagger. At my store, the management were cold and disconnected. An air of depression hangs over my store."
bad,"Standard retail job, where there is little upward mobility.  Low hourly wage high customer demand.  Must be able to lift and organize pallets as they come in."
bad,"Was a horrible place to work, was under paid and over worked. The management says we are all a family but only looked out after themselves and would throw anyone under a bus to save themselves."
bad,"They do not care about their employees.  They want you to show up to work, even with a doctor's note.  If you are sick, they still expect you to work or they fire you."
bad,"It payed absolute minimum wage and had Union fees taken out of every single paycheck. Given that pay was weekly, you had a lot being taken out of an already meager wage. Managers didn't care about giving even a semi consistent shift and would schedule people to close one night to open the next morning. You had no choice but to be part time, which didn't prevent the managers from having you work 38 hours a week with a couple hours of overtime, leaving you with part-time benefits (i.e. nothing)."
bad,"Management is a joke, hours are a joke, overall a horrible place to work. I don't recommend working at frys unless you want a 10% on kroger foods. Other than that, don't do it."
bad,"The first day I started working at Kroger was a horrible experience, right off the shift manager was extremely hateful and would yell at you for anything she felt like yelling about. This continued until the day I quit basically, even after I had to have surgery and was on a medical leave which they almost refused to give me. When I handed in my papers for my leave of absence the store manager told me I could only have a week off even though my medical documents stated otherwise. It was a pretty miserable experience overall, I would never recommend anyone work for this company."
bad,"Management was indecisive and very confused about the duties of the positions of their employees. I know not all of the Kroger stores fall under this description, but the Columbia City, IN store certainly does."
bad,Stressful. No pay!! Terrible work environment. Did not learn anything. Old ladies that have no lives that want to boss you around. Never get a raise. Start at the bottom and can barely work your way up unless you work there for close to 15 years. Wouldn't be flexible with hours and would complain about when you ask for a day off.
bad,"If you like having another employee put a fist up to your face, call you names and throw equipment then Fry's Food is the place for you!! It's no place for someone with integrity and a good work ethic. Management has no back bone, you have to call out sick for 2 days in order to get paid for one, it's a culture of a lot of FU's."
bad,"Terrible work place do not work here. It makes decent money, but at the end of the day you end up extremely depressed and upset. The pay is bad and the management does not care about you."
bad,"Cannot keep workers at all due to poor management and not enough hours. Hours are very inconsistent, working at minimum wage way below the Cost of living."
bad,i lived in georgia for one year and i worked at this grocery store.the hours were limited and the shifts were all over the place.i would not recommend this job for an adult with a family.
bad,it was horrible worst job ever.  union doesnt back anything up and not actually paid for the Job I was doing. was replacing manager while on  leave and I did not recieve the pay i was entitled to. I had to fight for a nickel increase.
bad,"Management only really looks out for management, serious issues are overlooked daily or shoves under the carpet. The normal employees are so fed up with the day to day that teamwork and collaboration are almost non existent. If you do need a job absolutely 100% and you don't have any choice and are okay with sufferening to barely and not even make a living go right ahead and apply."
bad,This is a union based company. You have to pay your weekly union fees out of your check and don't get a whole lot in return. Advancement is based solely on how long you have been with the company and not based on your experience or merits.
bad,They do not pay you enough for the tasks that are performed. Obviously some stores have better management than others but it sucks--pay raise is  .10.
bad,A typical day at Kroger involves trying to complete multiple tasks without the necessary help or tools or guidance to do so. There is a severe lack of hours provided to each store in order to complete tasks that are necessary to maintain business.
bad,the team members work great with each other and the store is kept very clean and management tries to solve all employee and customer issues they are very understand and willing to work one on one with you to learn your job tasks
bad,A typical day at work is anywhere from 4-8 hours. You get a 15 miunte break once or twice a shift and a 30 minute lunch youhave to clock out for when you work over 6 hours. Management was poor and constantly changing. I was a full time employee but got as little as 4 hours a week which made it hard walking into the store and enjoying it since I was making no money.
bad,"the place smelled, no good pay. All the people I used to work with left. i wouldn't recommend that place to anyone. I never liked it and I don't think any one else did."
bad,It was a bad job with mean people all day long. they act like they own you. they don't care or want to care. its a mess of a place to work. the leader don't do anything.
bad,"no work life balance , pay is below national average for managers .every region is run completely different which causes a lot of confusion apron transfers .the union is also very hard to work with which makes the job a lot more stressful .  Kroger has also made it a habit of being dishonest and not forth coming with its managers after store manager graduation. Training for positions are little to none trail by fire ."
bad,"no job security, hours would be cut without knowledge. coworkers were hard to get to know and unfriendly. management, was harsh and was switched around a lot."
bad,The Scheduling was inconsistent. The management were slave drivers. They treat you like dirt then tell you  you're not doing enough. Literally do anything else before applying to Kroger.
bad,"You can work all the hours in the world and try as hard as you want, but if you're not ""inner circle"" or a corporate ""KroBot"" fav, you will never get promoted.  They will move you around to a dozen stores until you finally quit.  Co-managers at Kroger are the most miserable associates, just ask one..."
bad,"Management was poor in guiding or helping"
bad,I was expecting to work hard and learn a lot at this job and I tried my hardest at every task I was assigned or expected to do however my immediate lead never acknowledged my work and continuously reprimanded me for things that I was not trained on properly and the expectations for me were vastly different to others as they were allowed to literally sit around and not work. This may be just my experience but if the upper management allows this sort of behavior then I wouldn't recommend working here.
bad,it was alright. i worked there in college. They were not flexible with the schedule and weren't very friendly to those who worked part time. Its not a bad place to work if you're okay with customer service
bad,"My view of Kroger is they want you to do the work of a $20.00/hr job but only pay minimum wage.  If the shift before or after yours goofs off and doesn't get their job done, they want you to do your job and theirs.  They don't give hours, but by golly if they call you in you better go.  Terrible place to work."
bad,"Never work at Kroger's in Starkville, MS. A lot of favoritism and racism towards workers and customers. I wouldn't recommend anyone to work here. Front end supervisor have horrible attitude."
bad,"The management doesn't care about your personal life, emergencies, when your sick they get mad at you when you out or call in late. Scheduling sucks. They don't care if you have kids or a family life."
bad,"Part time, no benefits, you go from one dept. to the other in case someone is not there, and the pay was terrible. There is nothing good about that place."
bad,"Working at Kroger normally results in long hours on your feet for little pay. As a Barista I have learned how to make all of Starbucks drinks however, as a part-time employee I was unable to get enough hours to sufficiently make enough money to make a real difference. The only reason I am still there is I am still looking for a different job. Since I have been there I have learned that most of the grocery stores in the area pay a good deal more. The only way you can get a raise is because of the automatic 25 cent raise you get about once a year. There is a strong union at Kroger but that really doesn't matter much. As a Barista, we are required to lift cases of milk, and deliveries that restock our supplies."
bad,This job made you lose hope that anything would ever get better. They were very restricting with hours. Because they were restricting with hours I offered to help out at other locations that were short staffed. Everybody wins. They said after I did that for a little bit that if I liked it so much at the other stores maybe I should leave. It was not a good job.
bad,not a professional place to work at at all promises you everything delivers nothing pay increases were really non existant economy was really bad that is why i worked there for so long
bad,Everything is out of order and the benefits are not worth the way employees are treated. The wages don't match the work that is done and workers feel belittled and overlooked.
bad,"I worked for this company in high school and in my time there I was bullied relentlessly by managers, supervisors, and co workers alike. All because I preferred to work in sanitation."
bad,"I've been working at Kroger since I was a sophomore in High school all the way till I was a sophomore in College after two stores, 5 rotations of different managers and meeting so many different kinds of front end/store managers I have to say people that do not understand how to handle certain situations should not be in charge of others. Another thing to point out is that I was doing almost everything, I signed up as a part time cashier, but instead I was customer service/stocking/front-end supervisor/front-end manager/ baby sitter and all at the low low price of 7.50 an hour. I know some are going to read this and say why didn't you join the union because they would take what little money I already earned at that point. That's really all I have to say 2/10 would rather have worked at Wendy's pays better."
bad,"-Trained properly"
bad,"I worked here part time. One of the worst jobs ever if you were a cashier. No breaks  (except management of course), you were made to stay way later then scheduled, and you never had help if you were crazy busy."
bad,The overall atmosphere of Kroger makes you feel unwanted and underpayed. Poor management with very little respect of employees. The front end management is especially bad trying to blame you for something they did. I would not in a million years recommend working here. Very little training and almost no advancement opportunities.
bad,Kroger is a union company. union dues are steep and lower tier employees have no say in anything. too much politics within the store. they demand perfection but when its convenient. when management doesn't want to deal with it they just swept it under the rug.
bad,"Kroger is an interesting company to work for. During my time there, I worked my way up from a part time associate to a full time assistant department manager. The pay was really low until I ""topped out"", and even then was far below the average for other businesses of a similar nature. The culture is very cut-throat, with other's constantly trying to make other people look bad in the hopes of opening new positions. Management lacks insight and any real sense of how things should be, and corporate is even worse as they pile on new policies and regulations but insist on cutting overtime even in stores that are drastically under-staffed. If you want part-time work, it's not bad aside from low pay, but if you want anything more then be prepared to be cajoled into working 50+ hours a week by management, then written up for overtime by the same management and all while other people are gunning for your job."
bad,Kroger was poorly managed and probably one of the worst jobs that I have ever had. The mangers needed to be trained more! Was ran poorly and un professional!
bad,Bad workplace environment. Bad bosses and no advancement. No overtime. Bad customers and no human resources. Had a lot of trouble just trying to switch shifts.
bad,They don't really care about their employees like they say they do. The pay is terrible. They are terrible with scheduling. I just did not like working there at all.
bad,Kroger is a company that does not really work for the little guys. All they seem to care about is their profit margins at any and all costs. I will never return to work for a Kroger based company.
bad,"Its sad that they are willing to only start their employees out at 7 dollars and 25 cents "
bad,disregards everything else gives u less then 20 hours a week pay is horrible the hardest part of the job is the department heads and the customers in some areas
bad,if you want to make any money you are working all the time and all hours of the day.  they try to keep most store employees under 30 hrs a week.  pay rate is very low
bad,Poorly managed employees. Supervisors would constantly be at odds. We would get caught up in what they had as priorities. We were never acknowledged for doing a good job or going above and beyond our responsibilities.I would get in trouble for assisting customers. They thought I was neglecting my work.Some customers want extra help in finding specialty items.
bad,managers only care about themselves. The only thing they are good at is making their employees feel dumb and they talk down to individuals A LOT. You end your day of work wanting to quit on the spot.
bad,You really have to be full time and work 4 or 5 years to be top pay. They are starting out at min wage if you have no experience. I would ask up front what you get paid an hour. Part time is 24 hours for part time benefits and 36+ full time benefits. 12 wks straight for full time status.
bad,The pay is a joke! They start your pay out at 7.25 an hour and you get 10¢ ever six monthes. They need to improve the pay for employees in order to keep the good employees. I saw so many good employees quit because they just couldn't afford to work there.
bad,it is fun and a somewhat fast paced environment. managers are good now. good way to get experience with public and basic sales. wages are not very good at all.
bad,"I hated that store, didn't even give me other options besides firing me right there! I liked working here at first but as soon as the months went by, they started treating me different as if i didn't exist anymore."
bad,The Kroger I worked for needs new staff in the office. Everyone chats about each other. I didn't have a great understanding about my position and when i was moved I still wasn't even the proper training.
bad,"The Breaks and all were good, drinks from a vending machine cost $0.30   however, with all that going on for breaks, it is low pay. on many days after work on a rainy day, i would stay and help customers one at a time to the car with an umbrella from my own car, taking out of my own time. did i ever get noticed, even when other employees and my own boss told me i should be at home, and asked why i was out there? i didnt get anything for it, i went above and beyond what i was supposed to do, i have frinds that worked there making 9.25 per hour as their starting pay, but they didnt get a pay raise given in over the 4 years they had worked for the company, bad company to work for."
bad,"To many cooks in the kitchen. To many people thinking that they are above having to do what makes he company money. Overall they have to many standards, that aren’t followed from the people creating them."
bad,"My experience working at Kroger was absolutely horrible. I was paid seven dollars and fifty two cents an hour and I was completely overworked. My responsibilities at this job included bagging groceries, gathering carts from the parking lot no matter what the weather was, cleaning bathrooms, back stock, taking out all of the trash and whatever other things mangers and or supervisors request of me."
bad,"Managers never listen to employees. Always take customers word 100% even if they are wrong. Low pay.  Either no hours or overworked. 7 days a week if they feel like it but all short shifts. No overtime allowed. If you need a day off they punish you for taking it by dropping your hours. Also if they call you to come in and you say no, they drop your hours. I loved the people I worked with, but management is a sad joke."
bad,i have worked for Smiths for over 10 years and I felt great for my career choice but recently the demand that I see on my store management from our corporate managers has made me feel less appreciated I feel that we are a sinking ship and its time for me to get out
bad,"• I stock items on shelf’s "
bad,the job is you alone doing 6 other workers jobs because most of them are kids and don't want to work. most of the supers at the meat and seafood are great but others will curse you out for no reason or if there mad at another employee they will take it out on others. this is not a good place to work for
bad,"Bad work environment,  Assistant Manager Needs to work on attitude.  Took Forever to Fix the heating system,  Worked with hat and gloves on during the winter because of no heat. Management doesn't care about personal life ."
bad,"Beginning your career with KCF it will seem nice and comfortable and secure. But the longer you work there the worse they treat you. Along with zero flexibility or consideration in any way. You are in every way, a number to them."
bad,I’ve worked for Kroger for six years and I am currently under the worst management staff I have ever seen. I am a dull-time employee but I don’t make nearly the amount of money I should for working 10+ hour days due to overtime and lack of staffing. It is absolutely ridiculous and I am so disappointed with where this company is headed.
bad,"The job was always stressful, long shifts, horrible management, inconsistent hours, never got the days I needed off off even though I requested them. Boss is a vapid, narcissistic, over bearing, axe to grind old woman"
bad,bad place to work unless you are a girl they make guys do everything at the store but if you are a girl they promote you supper fast and make sure you never have to push carts empty trash or even bag groceries just stand at the regester and smile thats it
bad,Kroger is not a good workplace the people were always rude to me though i did as they said and never complained and also they never gave me my last check of over $300.00 dollar.
bad,paid terribly and employees are treated like dirt. good employees get taken advantage of very easily and poor employees get away with everything. its ridiculous.
bad,"My experience working at Kroger's food Store, was stressful and the people was rude and unfriendly, I do not recommend it you are not a people person."
bad,You pay union dues for a union rep to do nothing. Also the management doesn’t do their job. All in general bad working environment and hours are constantly getting messed with i went from having 40 one week to 12 which is completely obsured.
bad,People I worked with were very disrespectful and rude to not only me but customers as well. I am very disappointed in the work environment and the managers as well.
bad,"Watching your back, keep your mouth shut, dress appropriately, always make it right if you can find a sticker and always keep in mind to trust no one."
bad,The short time i was there Kroger expected everyone to be there even in the horrible backroads conditions of TN they only care of money no the employee and they have a rat issue they refuse to take care of
bad,"The pace was hectic and your running to get stuff done. Management is disorganized and no clue what they are doing. Its a job again a ""dead end job"" there is no real culture to this company its all a show for their customers. You better be able to learn and pick up quick if you plan on working there a while cause training is a JOKE! At least you make ""some money"" will working there but that is a issue along with hundreds that this company has!"
bad,"Management is very frustrating. As long as you’re pals with them, they’ll let you get away with anything. Literally anything. But as soon as you say/do something they don’t like, prepare for a world of non communication and isolation."
bad,I didn't really like working at krogers their wasn't really any respect to the worker and it just wasn't good I wouldn't recommend anyone to work for krogers but at the end of the day a job is just a job
bad,i worked there for the needed total of 60 days for the probationary period over the summer. yet when my college schooling started and i brought them my schooling schedule they had to let me go cause they said my schooling would interfere with my work load. not cool Kroger. NOT COOL!
bad,"Kroger's is a bad place to work. Everyday was miserable, I didn't receive proper training or anything I was self taught or told by other employees when my trainer/managers should have."
bad,"I was never employed at a Kroger Super Market ..........................."
bad,When I first started with this company I was very excited and happy.   But once I started there it was a totally different thing.  Management is nonexistent unless you are someone favorite employee.  They promise to move you up in the company and then never ever do as they say!  Pay is poor and the environment is horrible.....  most of the employees are looking for ways to back stab you.  Very disappointed in this company!  Would not want want even my worst enemy than work ther!
bad,The store that I worked for cared very little about filed complaints or issues that were had. Prior commitments to employees were quickly discarded if it was beneficial to the store.
bad,"never got recognized for my hard work i put in everyday but management always stated that the people that never worked and always sat down were the hardest working people, and when someone got sick it was always a problem."
bad,"Not a good place to work you can not survive on the awful hours that they dish out to you schedules are all over the place no regular set days , shifts or hours they exspect you to work and not have a life besides working there"
bad,"it was an okay place to work. the hours weren't the best. you only got raises every 1,000 hours. get a 10% discount on kroger products. management was okay little rough on everyone."
bad,"Horrible work schedules; if salaried, constantly reminded that manager could work unlimited hours.  The manager had no back bone and allowed everyone to walk all over him."
bad,This was a terrible company to work for. The pay is bad the benefits are bad. You pay to be in the union but they do nothing for you. you have to pick up the slack of all the other people that dont want to work. just an all around bad job.
bad,"Started the job as a replenishment worker and was offered a cake decorating position which I gladly accepted. Wasn't compensated for my position because sales were 'too low'. Terrible managers decreased work ethic. If you were offered a higher position, qualification process took months. No pay compensation."
bad,I would never work for the company ever again. I was told about my starting wage at one wage and that is not what I was making. Maybe things are different in other departments but I am not willing to find out.
bad,Management was more interested in their own job security than helping employees. Union and management conspired against employees. Any complaint lodged against management was instantly disregarded.
bad,"While my relationship with my coworkers at my level was good, management was terrible.They encouraged us to act as a ""family"" but would slash hours and treat workers poorly. There was an endless cycle of managers who would come and go very quickly, because they couldn't do their jobs properly. Scheduling was a nightmare and hours kept getting cut more and more. I started at 40 hours a week, and by the time I quit I was only at about 25 a week. The schedule was horribly inconsistent, and usually posted the night before the next week started. Not to mention at pay was horrendous at $7.75 an hour. There was the bare minimum employees at any time, so we were often understaffed during busy times, and overtime was almost never approved."
bad,Kroger in swartz creek michigan has poor managment and the union is less than desirable. Union will not fight for your job like they say they are going to.
bad,Management was non understanding about home life only cared bout their selves and their bonuses.  No fixed schedules and its union you have to be there longest to get positions and hours and the pay sucked.
bad,"Co-workers start drama, lack of hours needed, let co-workers take other peoples shifts. Let underage kids but alcohol and tobacco products. Management just stands around."
bad,I worked there only part time and found another  position as quickly as possible so as to have more pay.  felt well treated in many ways but as with all retail there has to be a lid on compensation.
bad,The culture was so unproductive that some of the management team resigned. Every day one of the associates called out or just stopped coming to work completely.
bad,"What a terrible place to work!!!! During one night I was outside collecting carts, it was close to 10pm and I was alone as they make you go out a night alone. I never had a problem with it before but this particular night I was approached by three men who harassed me. Following me into the store and stood there waiting for me to come back out. My manger got upset when I asked if a male worker would come out with me. After writing a report I said I would no longer nights and they STILL scheduled me nights."
bad,Management at Krogers was terrible . I mean terrible they hardly cared about your problems and scheduling was not on any system and could hardly ever talk or find the person who does them .
bad,"the worst job I've ever had. bathrooms are unsanitary, there are rats in the back. the managers are rude and disrespectful. we are underpaid and they overwork us."
bad,Kroger is a poor company to work for. They test the employees with disprespect  and don’t pay a lot. They over work you and aren’t flexible with hours or understanding you have a children.
bad,"They expect part timers to work full time hours for minimum wage with no opportunities for advancement, or adequate compensation. They also expect you to perform duties of 2-3 people at a time because they refuse to staff the store in accordance to the customer flow."
bad,"If you want to work around deli slicers, ovens, and hot chicken grease, Kroger's deli is for you.  I do not suggest this job to anyone, especially if you have a college degree."
bad,"A typical day of work starts with dealing with other people not doing their job and screwing you over"
bad,"Retail is not the best field to get into and most people already know that. But at Kroger, they really don't know how to treat their employees and their management is the worst by far."
bad,Worked for store 540 Virginia Beach VA 3901 holland rd .. overnight stocking took 15$ from me after we closed the entire store down and locked all doors was in front end department upper management horrible to employees managers look down on us never replayed tapes over worked me to just get up to 25 hrs a week or less. denied my availability change when i told the lady manager i wanted to switch being I'm a mother and was looking into going back to school. There was lot of high schoolers that are inconsiderate and managers tell them EVERYTHING being they've been here longer then some of us. I've had a teenager come to addressing what i spoke with a manager about by myself. & If you looking to advance I'd advise you not to work for them as far as front end anyway. Other than that GREAT place to shop as far as working i will never again.
bad,I wouldn't recommend anyone to work here. They worked you hard all day then only gave one 15 minute lunch. The customers were very rude. The managers were very selfish and uncaring.
bad,This would be a great job to keep for a while. If only the company knew how to keep promises that they make upon hiring someone. they tell you they will give you a certain pay rate then they dont. they promise hours they cant actually give. They expect you to drop everything in your life to come into work on your days off. if you dont come in when they call you on your days off the threaten to fire you.
bad,Do not ever work here. expectations are impossible at best. Almost every shift i left in tears because of the unfair treatment and the lack of support from my superiors.
bad,Good job for a teen or a young adult in college...not something to make a career out of if you know you want more out of life...not enough hours...favoritism in departments
bad,"It is not a fun environment, and the hours were decent. The managers never accepted availability based on when I had school, sports, etc.The lunch breaks were 15 minutes for 4 hours and you only got 30 minutes for 8 or more hours. They'd get you up to 7 hours 45 minutes so you wouldn't get the 30 minutes."
bad,"very low pay, very fast paced, hours are inconsistent, I do not like management, it was a job I kept to make ends meet. ideal for highschool students."
bad,i worked for like 2 days and i immediately got outta there because they over work the employees i would not recommend this job to anyone under any circumstances
bad,"The “ fezs” at the Westfield location, are immature and do not do their job and put their tasks onto other people. They do not give required breaks. That store is not the best."
bad,"I worked there for about 6 months, absolutely hated it. The pay sucked, and they didn't offer any chance for more. Management was awful, and so was scheduling."
bad,Poor POOR management! No real workers that care about the store. You would be better off to go to a fast food chain and make $10+ an hour compared to the pay they offer.
bad,I worked by myself at times where I had to a lot of work on my hands it was very stressful. I noticed  they have a lot of retention issues people realized they came in under paid.
bad,Working in the freezer was a pure joke we started working 4 ten hour shifts then they changed it to five days a week they preached safety but it was one of the most unsafe work places I've ever worked Cincinnati fresh center is a joke! Will fire you If you don't have 100%
bad,"This company needs to get some perspective. They offer the lowest wages in the area, then constantly run their departments understaffed causing good workers to be stressed and leave and then wonder why they can't hire/keep employees. The whole building is run like a high school. There is constant drama between employees, including managers, and if you aren't in good with the right people forget about getting a good raise or moving up. The union is a joke and does nothing to protect the employees. I was in the union and still dealt with constant harassment from my department manager and the store manager. If you are a cutthroat, backstabbing person who enjoys clicks, this is the perfect career choice for you!"
bad,Does not matter if you have experience only seniority. Exteremly poor pay and hours. Management does not follow through. Would not recommend working here.
bad,They will start you off with a low pay rate and only give you 15 cent raises every 6 months so I was there for 3 years and ended off making 8.55. Fuel center employees and part time employees don't get the option of insurance.
bad,"I would prefer not to review, this is not a good balance of life and work, I am sure other reviews are available.  This is a old company with old ideas."
bad,I really would not recommend this place as a good work place. The hours are not consistent and management is not very associate friendly. That open door policy is a big lie.
bad,"If you are seeking work/life balance, career advancement and working with really strong leaders, Kroger Corporate HQ is NOT the place for you. The culture is still very ""old school,"" with Merchandising leading all decisions and very little new thinking. The day to day environment and mantra is ""get things done no matter what."" "
bad,If willing to work a 40 hour weeks without getting the position then this is the job for you. Young kids working get by being lazy and on their phones. They need help and hire part time people and have no work ethics but are willing to overworked the good ones. I have 43 years as a cashier but because it was convenient store they would not pay the correct rate for experience.
bad,Kroger is a horrible company to work for. The management fight amongst themselves and hardly work together much less with their employees. just the overall impression that Kroger gives off is one undesirable from any.
bad,"The job itself isn't bad, kind of boring as all you do is ring groceries.  desired, but enjoyable if the guest is willing to speak and carry on a conversation while you ring.  I've learned that this is not a good job.  Very unprofessional management, no finess in handling people.  The culture is pretty good among the employees and there are those that I enjoy seeing. Most enjoyable part of the day is getting off work."
bad,"poor instore management, lack of communication skills by department/store manager. Does not hear employee concerns, also safety issues are always a major concerns when brought to their attention."
bad,The pay is terrible even if you have experience they still don't pay you enough but they expect you to work harder and do jobs that are not your title
bad,No place to move up in most positions. Pay is not near as good as it could or should be. Most of the time employees feel under appreciated and very stressful.
bad,I took the job at kroger because it was the only place hiring immediately. I needed a job and some kind of experience. I wouldnt work as a cashier anywhere.
bad,"Don't work here terrible place of employ. Especially if you are attending school at the time.  They are not understanding of time off, and will work you to death."
bad,"Management at the Sylvania, Ohio store is not professional creating a very hostile work environment to workers. They expect a lot for the pay and nothing is ever good enough. You do not get a lot of hours and they make it hard to obtain more hours. Not something if you need the hours/pay! Associates are not treated fairly."
bad,"Typically I would show up for work and be given the plan for the day. Then about 2 or 3 pm I would be pulled off the floor to assist with the produce order. Then I would go through the produce to make sure it was fresh. If floral help was needed I would go and assist, if possible."
bad,"I was excited about this opportunity but that quickly changed, the managers are unorganized and rude. They would call me with less then an hours notice to come in. I was never given a regular schedule even during training. The last straw was when I came in and they told me they were transferring me to a different department without my knowledge or permission. This Kroger is awful, they play favorites, let people talk on the phone while handling meat products. They don't make you wear proper safety equipment when handling meat either so I wouldn't buy any meat from them."
bad,"I used to enjoy working for this company.  I enjoyed waiting on people and filling their prescriptions.  but now it's to the point that if you do not have something they want or can't give them what they want, you see adults magically turn into five year olds."
bad,I was laid off from this job on unfair grounds. Manager wouldnt give me a schedule that was right for a person who had never worked in a bakery before.
bad,"I did not like working at Kroger at all. It is a terrible place to work. The facility is dirty, and it stinks. They do not hire enough staff to work during shifts, so they overwork their employees to death."
bad,this place is bad the staff and all the corners they cut the lack of leadership. they say they have amazing costumer service but they are not a family its cut throat.
bad,"Stressful"
bad,"Management doesn't care at all"
bad,"Management was horrible."
bad,"A typical day at work is your supervisors or managers always on a register and breathing down your back to make sure you sell sell sell whatever we are promoting. It's not a fun job, but then again what job is fun. You work with people of all ages, you have kids who are 15+ who decide they don't want to work and end up not showing up for their shift, and so then for that day, we are short. My manager didn't make the job any better, she'd be rude to the workers and sometimes get in fights with this other managers, she would talk about them behind their backs. The hardest part of the job for me was taking off and not getting ridiculed about it, I was working at Kroger, a student in high school involved with sports so I had to take time off. What I enjoyed most was the people i worked with, they made the job fun and less stressful."
bad,"Kroger is leader in low pay and limited advancement.  This job should be avoided unless you are going school or you are retired.  The industry is a real problem, the problem with retail is they chase low prices while their workers are on public assistance."
bad,"Working at Krogers was one of the worst working experiences I have ever had. There's no communication within management, the opportunities for growth were minimal, and the environment was catty to say the least. I understand why they have a huge turnover rate."
bad,"even if you are scheduled to work 38 hours one week, if someone has been there longer than you have and wants that shift you can lose it and only actually work 20 of those hours or less. if you have something going on and need assistance from managers in regards to it they will not provide assistance. they do not care about the health or safety of their employees at all! i called in one day because i was rushed to the hospital with a blood clot in my artery and they told me if i was not there for my shift i would be terminated because it was such a busy night for my department and they needed me and my attendance was not up for discussion and i needed to make a choice."
bad,the management was subpar they wouldnt work with me when it came to my hours and what i wanted to do. sometimes they wouldnt even schedule me enough hours so i was required to stay over my shift. do not reccomend
bad,"i worked in the produce department at my local kroger for about 8 months, the job itself was not hard gather the produce and put it out on the shelf and displays. but the people who worked there where rude and mean and even to the point of  harassment and made me feel super uncomfortable."
bad,"Very difficult to advance unless you know someone or are related to someone...or other unscrupulous activities."
bad,"Kroger was the worst job i ever had. the customers are beyond rude, and the pay is horrible. You have to work every single day for 8 hours just to get a decent pay check. I would not recommend working here as your main job, just a s a side job for an extra 50$ each week."
bad,"didn't like this job, poor management, strict managers, less than intelligent co-workers, and troubled consumers and very rude people, was not my favourite but it paid good money"
bad,"The company underpays its employees to many hours or not enough. Poor management ,always rushing ,A lot of good people work there but definitely deserve better ."
bad,I hated working at Kroger the manager was unprofessional and they barely gave me hours I would not work there again and I wouldn't recommend anyone to.
bad,Bad management no advancement low pay to much turn over emloteenin and out manager lack of care and aweful hours . CEO need to look int the company and the person they have representing them. Pharmaceutical Dover crossing is aweful
bad,"Produce/Cashier/Bagger/Fuel Clerk/Home Clerk/Courtesy Clerk"
bad,Kroger doesn't appreciate any associates in any way at all. I was very unhappy working with someone who talked down to me everyday. None of the managers had any faith in any of their employees yet expected employees to work overtime and come in on their days off to help.
bad,"Kroger doesnt pay a livable wage and will boot you out to hire a cheaper worker if you want a raise. The management is full of incompetence, and sycophants."
bad,"A typical day of work at kroger? I work in the toy department,as a back up lead, and at kroger they will force you to go up to the front end on multiple occasions to be either a cashier, without offering any training for it, as well as a bagger. This causes many of the oter employees to fall behind on their actual work and makes their departments look like absolute trash. I have however learned a lot from my departments and my actual homeside manager. I can order product, Merchandise, print and check invoices, shrinkage, and so much more. A big part of kroger is also customer service!! so ive got that down path for sure. Im honestly not even sure if kroger has any workplace culture. Its a horribly run industry altogether. The hardest part of the job is working as hard as you can, going out of your way to do things for others, just to be told that you are a replaceable employee, and they dont really need you there if you dont want to go the the front end. There arent even any enjoyable parts of this job, aside from working with some good people."
bad,Was left overworked and underpaid only received 7.25 and worked 8 hour shifts accumulating 30-40 hours a week in which I'd be doing more then neccesary simply because someone else didn't want to.
bad,"Favoritism, hostile involvement, not an equal opportunity company."
bad,"Working for Kroger was one of the most unsatisfying jobs I have ever had.  Three main issues that need to be addressed are:"
bad,Appreciated opportunity to advance throughout departments. Allowed for many leadership opportunities. Only complaint is manager at the time was incompetent.
bad,"· Job is very stressful at times"
bad,"Very cut throat, management plays favorites, lots of gossip, the honest hard working people usually get shafted. The people who are lazy or whiney do little work which is why most of the stores are understocked."
bad,"The management is poor, and the it is like a high school atmosphere. The union representatives are too friendly with management, and don't do a good job for the employees."
bad,"Working at Dillons was a nightmare. Four to five people call in every day, there is never enough help. The management does not really care about their employees health. They will work you  till you are so run down, you don't know if you are coming or going."
bad,"the managers all sucked, the hours were bad the coworkers were not ever friendly to me, I would give them my schedule and they wouldn't cooperate with it"
bad,"work when i get there and till i leave. "
bad,"Terrible workers, terrible management, terrible everything. I could have been a better manager when I was in the 10th grade in high school with no experience."
bad,"Kroger paid its employees very low and,instead of talking to a manager about a problem,you would have to go through the union."
bad,"Micro managers, confusion. Too many chiefs not enough Indians. Absolutely would never go back to Kroger. The job isnt explained or demonstrated and the leads are inexperienced."
bad,"place where i worked was racist to me and singled me out, even though I worked hard and showed up on days off. I was treated unfairly. The pay was okay and the work was fine."
bad,"The way this company is run is insane. I understand profit, but there is a way to talk to your employees. We're supposed to be a team. It definitely wasn't like that."
bad,"Kroger became one of the worst places I ever worked. The interests and work ethic of the employees were not respected, and management does a terrible job of making sure the employees could perform at their best. We were frequently threatened with being fired even though we always did a fine job with helping the customers."
bad,Cut throat environment. The heart of the Company are its people that work very hard day in and day out to make the stores what they are. Upper management can care less about the hourly or salaried managers that are running its stores.
bad,"i worked there for 10 years, and thought I was taken advantage of due to my hard work ,ethic, and the pride I took upon myself to make sure i could do what it took to get the job done.."
bad,"I like what I do. I enjoy my co-workers. All stores are definitely not the same. The store I came from definitely had more structure, however where I work they are a work in progress."
bad,"I was miss led by management, I had an accident and was asked to resign when I didn't have to. I feel that people need to be real if they want to help people advance."
bad,Its hard to get help at krogers. The restrooms are always dirty and when you ask for help there they get an attitude with you. The customer service is very poor.
bad,"The managers were mean and didn't seem to care about their workers and stripped me of my pay when they moved me into a different department. They over worked me and made me work double shifts. I wasn't even considered a full time employee and to be an ""full time"" employee you have to work 5, 40 hour weeks consecutively but somewhere in the middle of it they would take one of your weeks down to 35 hours and jip you out of full time so they wouldn't have to give you benefits. All in all it was a really bad job and there was no advancement. I wouldn't recommend this company to anyone."
bad,had me working for 3 weeks only to tell me they couldn't hire me because of my record. which is a total of 1 misdemeanor charge when I was 17 years old.
bad,Loads of ads kissing only way to get promoted. If they didn't like you they would target you and accuse you of the most idiotic reasons. This company is getting very bad only care about upper management and the customers the rest of the employees are expendable and worthless cause you can always find the next moron to work for you. As told to me by one of the district staff members plus the pay is garbage how they expect people to work 15 hours a weeks for 7.85 an hour greedy bas tards
bad,One of the managers called me a wh*re to one of my other co-workers. Union due was outrageous and they work you like a mule. Never work for the company if you love yourself.
bad,They poor pay they do not give you enough hours to have a full pay they are very bad on the management team they where never together they where all over the place
bad,The office is where I worked at in Houston Texas.  That was a very interesting place to work.  The benefits were out of this world.  If I still lived in Texas I would still be working there
bad,all in  all it wasn't a bad place.management needs some serious work though. though someone else may have better luck then i did with a certain member of management.
bad,Started off great. 3 weeks in they cut my hours. Then the gsr manager leaves me with a lot of pizza pans nothing prepped then the next day shows up 7 mins late. Managemwnt has no idea what there doing. I feel bad for the manager that started here. She's trying her hardest to fix what the others have pretty much destroyed. Do your self a favor don't work at this place. And when they say full time there lieing its part time
bad,You can work the hardest within your store or job role and receive the same pay as someone who does absolutely nothing. This doesn’t provide motivation. If someone works less than me but still gets paid more there is an issue.
bad,A bunch of long time workers who hate there job so much and bring everybody down. Not training. Cut throat and pro black. I begged for hours and wouldn't let me work in other depts. to get some hours.
bad,This is one of the worst place that I have ever worked at. The management lacked communication and respect for the employees. The hours during the week are not enough.
bad,Poor management. People just sitting there making fun of customers. Yet no customer service wow. The disrespecting customers an rushing them or closing lanes when they see elder customers. Needs a change hire trust worthy people not aggresive people.
bad,Mangers are horrible. A lot of drama. Everyone is in everyone's business. HR didn't seem to care about anything. A lot of drunks come in. And worst of it all is seeing people steal and can't do anything.
bad,"Nothing seems to ever get done you could work your hardest and not be shown any respect, you have to be nice to customers even if there standing there yelling at you that doesn't seem right no one should be treated like that.  Management doesn't seem to want to fix anything just say yes and agree to everything."
bad,"my manager I had was very rude towards me and I worked there for 2 weeks. I don't work with rude people because of my murals and beliefs. The hardest part of the job was having to move the pallets and stock the groceries, and since I have a bad back and knees the company fired me because of my medical background as stated by my manager but wrote lack of work on my separation notice."
bad,"It was horrible, pay was, the hours, the people there, the management was. Didn't like it at all I would not recommend working at any Kroger store at all."
bad,My coworkers and managers were the most disrespectful lot. The customers were also rude and unsavory due to the workers. It was just a cycle of hate there.
bad,Got in trouble for doing something I was not trained on. Common theme since your thrown to the wolves on your first day with lack of supervision or available help for questions. When you do get help its usually condescending rude
bad,"These people that I had to work with were all around awful. I'm talking the managers, supervisors, everyone. You think you have friends until they talk badly about you behind your back. I called corporate with their awful management and how they would make fun of my special needs brother nonstop but nothing was done about that either. If you or your child is special needs, do not send them to apply at kroger. The courtesy clerks are already the bottom of the food chain, you get treated worse if your special needs."
bad,"Actions of management ""do this or else"" are very unprofessional. Compensation very poor (union). Over-regulated culture leads to nonsense. Corporate employees in Compton are egoistic and two-faced.  They are only nice when they want something, and you can tell its fake."
bad,The new team of managers are so unorganized. People are calling off of work or not coming in at all and they are not be disciplined. They cannot keep good workers because they refuse to pay. They want their workers to do all of this work for minimum wage and then only work 20 hours a week. Management is VERY unprofessional.
bad,They were unorganized. Called me on my off days.  When I requested off days it was hard to get approval even though I was a part time worker I worked almost full time
bad,Kroger needs better management. the managers don't care about employees. all they care about is the money that is spent at the store so they can get a pay check. they are not friendly to workers nor customers except when need to be.
bad,"Scheduling is too stringent and demanding. There is little room for advancement, and the pay is far too low. Working 8 days in a row with one day off does not benefit employees or the employer. Many disgruntled employees here."
bad,They hire you for one position with promises of a different higher paying job and make you work in that promised job but don't change your job title or pay.
bad,"Marketsource alone is a hit or miss, I have been with them for over a year in different areas. Their target openings are okay as long as you keep your head down. Bosses there do not like you asking for a raise, more hours, days off or certain days off that were negotiated before hiring."
bad,Managers at this location are pressured by corporate runners and in return it makes for a terrible work environment. No one has any energy and it's like kindergarten where I'm asking to go to the bathroom.
bad,"The managers have absolutely zero interest in your personal life. You could work harder then all the full time employees but yet, will never become one."
bad,you can do better then here. I worked here for almost 2 years never advanced and always got stuck with the worst work to do. I didnt mind much but the managers made it hard to enjoy your day with the constant yelling at you for things that aren't under your control.
bad,"Sucky place to work , hate it, don't work for them, they broke, they really broke , they try to take money from you, not worth it at all, no freedom, too much traveling"
bad,"I dislike Kroger with a passion, I never wanted to work here. I only did bc they called back and i was in high school so my mom forced me. i hated every minute i was there. i did not like any of the supervisors or the managers, they weren't fair about anything. and did not do their jobs. most of the time they would forget to send you on break or they would send people on break first, that came in after i did. they were always quick to complain about everything you did. i hate everyone"
bad,"Management is a joke. Working hours do not work with you like the advertised on the system    The association in the store is bad"
bad,They need Better management very unsatisfied not a very reliable  job. You can't pay bills with this job. They treat you very unfair. I would not recommend anyone NB to this job. A lot of favoritism not enough help. One person running more than one station.
bad,no improvements and the store is always busy. The managers push us to much with our low salary. The starting pay is horrible the managers are mean. The carts are annoying.
bad,"Raises are based solely on accrued hours, instead of job performance. An employee who slacks off will be compensated the same as an employee who is driven."
bad,"The managers always complained no matter how hard you worked, they would only tell you when your stocking looked bad and never when it looked good. It was a fast workplace and you worked way too much for such a low pay. Would not recommend to anybody."
bad,Not satisfied with management but loved working in the environment. The environment got me relaxed. Management did not properly train associates the proper way to stock each corporation is different. I was not trained the way they wanted me to until right before I quit management was to much stress
bad,In this day and age I don't feel anyone should be getting paid minimum wage. Krogers is fine for high school students but I wouldn't suggest it to anyone else. The company does not look out for its employees. The best thing about Krogers was the union. I moved up in the company any my pay never changed because I was hired in as a clerk. Being hired in under the title clerk meant they could place me wherever they wanted to and didn't have to change my pay. I went from cashiering to bookkeeping and I was still being paid 7.25.
bad,"At the Morton location, management does not care about their employees' safety or wellbeing. The entire place was a toxic environment. The head manager thought it was okay to scream at and berate the female employees on the sales floor in front of customers."
bad,"If you're ready to be treated like a paperclip, Kroger is the place for you!  Every time you are assigned something, get ready for extreme attitude and disdain from the manager!  Also, if you do your job well and show up on time, management will still complain about this department and favor other departments! What a blast, right?"
bad,They are Union and don't cre about there employees and always in a big hurry and unorganized so I would not recommend this job to anyone. I don't have much more to say
bad,worst job ever. everyone is very rude to their employees and they do not care about family. tried to change my hours but they of course agreed then went behind my back and did the opposite
bad,They refused to help me when I started back at ricart automotive. They didnt want me to have a second job even though they paid me under minimum wage.
bad,the work isnt hard but you will only go so far as by working hard. the rest is how well you kiss butt. in fact if your only good that that you will go quite far.
bad,Managment has lied to me repeatedly while working at your stores. Not very understanding of situations. I would not want to work at your establishments if I will be lied to and i will not stand for secrets by your upper management. It's almost comical you are still even open.
bad,I experience with Kroger was very back the managers had no Idea how to run a store. I would never go back nor recommend anyone but 15-16 year old kids to work there.
bad,"back breaking job"
bad,Horrible place to work for! Pay is horrible the union isn't strong at all! I worked at the one in east Nashville the eastland location. As far as management I would describe pretty much hostile!
bad,was a great first job very good with working with high school schedule and sports. all the managers where very friendly and understanding of what's happening
bad,I enjoyed working for the company in the beginning . then it just became so over welming with high school drama. Others lying on you to try to get you in troble. The only yhing i like about the company is the union .
bad,Employee/Employer relation was discordant.  Inovation and ideas where not encouraged or embraced.  Keep your head down and work. Store Managers and CoManagers were not in touch with day to day operations.
bad,"They are not good to their employees the union there is a joke, you pay so much money out of ur paycheck and they don't even help you the way they should. They show favoritism there no matter how hard you work or how many days straight you work without a day off, if your not one of the favorites they treat you dirty! All hard good work goes unrecognized. I would never go back to work there."
bad,stocking fruits and vegetables using FIFO. at the end of the day the walk-in fridge and freezer floors have to be sprayed down and squeegeed clean. work around general public
bad,"This place was terrible the manager was always swearing and yelling, the head manager never had a problem swearing out staff in front of customers.  Scheduling a huge mess, the scheduling manager never scheduled right, and was constantly calling people in because they never scheduled for entire departments. I worked there for a couple of years and I never felt appreciated over other employees who were thanked for coming in half way through their 8 hour shift. I absolutely hate this place. STAY AWAY!!!"
bad,The location was horrible. And the manager had attitude problems. The store had multiple health violations and eventually got shut down. So it all worked out.
bad,Worked in the pharmacy and there were not opportunities for advancement or salary increases. Enjoyed fellow co-workers. Benefits would be more attractive if the main store package was made available to pharmacy employees.
bad,"My experience working at Kroger located in Latonia KY, Winston Avenue was absolutely horrible. I was only trained for one day, I was given other employees hours, multiple times without being notified. I was also Underpaid, even when working extra hours. They took advantage or the mentally disabled employees, and made it very clear of who their favorites were. They had also 3-wayed called me with an employee getting information about my personal life. Then teased me about it later which is why I quit."
bad,the managers are bad and most the employees were so rude. I will never work here again. Don't even like to shop there becasue of how terrible it was there. didn't ever want to let you off for things you had going on and if you did you got in to trouble. Terrible place to work for
bad,I was working kroger customer service it was so cool sometimies ill get some angry customers but other than the angry person work was always cool the most hard part was keeping it together with a rude customer and the good thing was most of my customers was very sweet to me
bad,"Not so great management over the front end.."
bad,Working for this company was terrible. I never wanted to go to work at all because the managers are always on your neck for no reason. They choose who they like and who they don't like. The pay is so little for the work you do.
bad,"The way that employees are treated are unjust, and when corporate is involved, there are no changes. This company has degraded and shamed itself with the lack of respect it gives to the people who are employed."
bad,Kroger is a big company and as a result has forgotten the employees that actually keep the place running. The management is rude and will think nothing of screaming at you in front customers or other employees. The cashiers are never trusted. Never get a beak to eat or go to the restroom. All this review was at my second Kroger.
bad,Have worked in floral dept.for almost a year.No room for advancement.Minimum wage and minimum  hours for P.T. workers even though we are paying union dues and getting nothing for it.Rude customers and inept management.I 'm glad I will be finishing college next year and moving on!.
bad,"The management at Kroger is bad she is full of herself and stuck up. They are not understanding of a person with a disability they do not have any feelings for people. Management is poor. They do not provide you with a daily chart of things to get done. They expect you to mind read and know what to do automatically. Their trading sucks, they do not train well."
bad,Work at fry's store 622 in mesa AZ was always undermanned and always wanted you to work 3 departments at perfection then talked to you with so much disrespect if you applied here run away because if wanna do the job of 3 people and get paid as a courtesy clerk then is the perfect job for you plus took 9 months to get a 10cents raise
bad,would never recommend to anyone ever. Managers are lazy and do not care for customers. employees have horrible attitudes and overall hate their job. you are burdened with other people's work. they do not care about the home life of their employees.
bad,this was the worst place to work gave you one day of trainging which was 3 hours and then made me close after one day i had no idea what to do this was my firs job mind you  i didnt even get a lunch in an 8hr shift
bad,Kroger thrives off of offering the public low prices and not paying their employees well at all. They are against the workers unions and have a terrible attitude towards you if you are a part of the union that protects an employee's rights.
bad,Management is not helpful. They dont give good cjances for advancement and often play favorites there have been few good managers. And the culture seems to be pile pn thw work and provide no help.
bad,The more business there is the less help there is. Constantly under staffed and can not retain associates   longer than a few weeks because of the expectations. When it really gets busy all of the upper management disappears then reappears when it slows down only to belittle you for not getting more done. There is absolutely no balance of life and work unless you are a favorite even if you have seniority and the pay is a joke unless you live at home or have no bills at all. Maybe you used to be able to make a career of this work but now it's for high school or home for the summer kind of job.
bad,"A typical day was very fast paced , hourly associates were not given enough hours to perform their job functions. Thus management had to work long hours to finish what was not completed. I was a assistant manager at Kroger , the only way that you could move up in the company was if you new someone or if you have done favors for the right person. Kroger always preached to all associates that they cared about the associates and the customers , but as a manager I can tell you that is not the truth. The hardest part of the job was having to deal with corporate management , which in most cases they had never even worked in a store situation previously. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the associates progress into higher positions. Also building relationships with the associates as well as the customers that I dealt with each and every day."
bad,the so called management team at krogers is a complete joke. they all just sit upstairs in the ac and if they need you they call on the overhead phone for you. no human interaction is involved.
bad,Everyone is also trying to cut the person down that makes them feel like they are threatening their job. There is a huge language barrier and nobody acknowledges that.
bad,A typical place at work was busy but needed lots of improvements as far management and employees.  There was not very much I learned there since I decided to leave after a few months. Workplace culture was difficult at times but acceptable.  The hardest part of my job was that I had to close the store at midnight and not leave until after 1 and the pay was terrible.  No benefits and only 12 hrs they gave.
bad,Management sucks pay is not worth it for breaking your back stocking. Don't waste your time working here. Can't move up in company because they dont make enough money in the store to promote people.
bad,"Management was bad, employee moral is terrible, bad bad bad place to work. I do not recommend this job to anyone. I work harder than many people there and get nothing in return for it not even a tahnk you."
bad,The management and department heads are immature and underqualified. As an entry level employee all the way up to someone who has worked there for years you never get the respect or appreciation you deserve.
bad,"Work 4-8 hour shifts with no breaks. Ask for a break and get yelled at and hours are severely dropped. They call you in ALL the time. Union local 1059 is a joke. All they want is there money. "
bad,"A typical day of work includes getting asked the same question (how's salad bar looking, did you check salad bar) about 2-5 times throughout the shift as well as before being punched in the clock. Management is extremely poor and unprofessional. The hardest part of the job is working fast enough to avoid being called over the loudspeaker at least three times or more; management thinks I must be super human. There is a lack of consideration of work load given and the feeling of under appreciation is constant. There is nothing enjoyable about this job."
bad,I would recommend that you do not work here. Management sucks and treated me poorly. I worked at night time and got stuck with the work no one finished during the day. I complained to management multiple times and they did not fix anything. I would have continued working if they would have changed something. They only have new employees because all the old ones quit since they got treated poorly as well.
bad,"Kroger is terrible. The management cares less about its employees. I personally believe that if you keep your employees content, everything could run smooth.Kroger's employees are underpaid, unappreciated and sometimes very hard working, and often it shows. (which is bad for customers)"
bad,"When Kroger decided they were going to start doing same day pickups everything was awful. We barely were able to get orders done as it was, then with the same day pickups it was absolute mayhem. They were short staffed and the employees they did have were extremely incompetent. The store managers expected you to greet and help every customer as you picked orders throughout the store even though Clicklist was super busy and you didn't have any time for that. Management was very abusive and power hungry and always tried to belittle you. Do yourself a favor and do not work for a company that sets such extreme unrealistic expectations."
bad,"The managers literally had no care for any input or concerns employees had.  Always short handed and barely worked with your schedule. If you worked overnight and need an entire day off, they'd schedule you for midnight that night."
bad,You do so much of the dirty work and it's never noticed or appreciated. Nothing is ever good enough for the managers. Not worth the minimum wage. I'd suggest working for another company.
bad,"Koger was a horrible work experience. You feel like just a number. Very unwanted. Hardly any training. When you need help, you don't receive it very often."
bad,The turnover was tremendous and a lot of unhappy employees! What they offer and what they do for employees is a scam! Management was horrible! Unhappy
bad,"Seniority overrides merit and great job performance. New hires are not acknowledged through casual conversation or any at all, especially by management. There are clicks and if you dont know anyone you are ignored. Seniority employees get better hours than anyone else. My last straw was when I came to work with 10 hours on the schedule. I simply quit."
bad,Worked for Kroger for more than 2 years. The pay is not enough for the position and the stress that comes with it. Needs to pay more attention to employees
bad,"Working at Kroger is okay, managers can be really sneaky and condescending, hourly pay is not survivable, and full-time positions are hardly filled; causing part-time workers to work full-time hours, but not receive full-time benefits."
bad,Very stressful. No room to advance. The lazy people are promoted and the hard workers are exploited. Sad work place employees are un happy in general.
bad,Worked here for 10 years and was treated fairly . Compensation was not nearly enough to have a family. Management puts work off on every employee but doesn't help with the workload.
bad,"I would never work for a company that totally disrespects its employees, that accuses them of false things. They scheme and move people around to fire them. Nasty place"
bad,this is the most hardest most ungreatful place too work so as an employee its hard to even move up in the company so i pity the workers that work with me at store 853 on 7000 east broad st reynoldsburg  OH.
bad,"didn't respect our time no balance between school ,and work. Managers were not reasonable no negation. Everyone was overworked and we never got our raises only the responsibility."
bad,"Going into this company, I truly thought I could move up easily, like they promised. That did not happen. They refused to move me up despite the knowledge I had and everything I proved to them because it was ""not in the budget."" I was doing the job of 3 people and only receiving partial credit and minimum hours part time. If you're an over-achiever hardworking person, this is not the job for you. I had high hopes and was let down for years! The most enjoyable part about this job was some of the people that I worked side by side with, they are what kept me there four years later and kept me sane during the tough times."
bad,"AWful job, do not apply to the kroger on MLK. Needs imporvment, needs new management. Awful place to grow and the pay is dirt cheap. Complained about needing new employees but fired them after a few weeks bc the original employees wanted to come back."
bad,Kroger is million dollar company that starts their employees with minimum wage. I worked there for 6 years and ended up making $10.95 when I really should have been making more.
bad,when i first was hired for Kroger i felt like family and i liked it working for them. but later on down the line they full of crab the fired me because i wasn't fit to go outside and pull the carts from outside in the winter time. i have cystic fibrosis which causes me to have treatments and it makes it harder for me to breath in winter cold air.
bad,Worst place time ever worked !!!!  Terrible management never available to help always intimidating hourly people . Always confusion would never listen or try to resolve issues no compromise !!!
bad,My time with Kroger was full of stress. The Manager seemed to push you to your limits. I did however learn more computer skills that I can carry over into my future careers.
bad,fast paced working in the pharmacy... different culture.pharmacy was located at a busy intersection. made the time go fast. i believe this location is not there any longer
bad,while working for krogers turkyhill store was great at first after being there for a month and getting a new assistant manager things started going down hill because people started leaving the assistant manger didn't do anything but be on her phone and flirt with all the male customers. the store manager favorite certain employees. i was usually the only one actually working
bad,"The pay rate is extremely low, and employee moral is down. Benefits are horrible. Management only likes you if you are family or have know them for years like a family"
bad,"A typical day at Kroger's consist of doing multiple activities through the day that may not have been explained in your job title. For example i am a Deli Clerk i was trained to do that position but i have been told to SCRUB DRAINS, BAG GROCERIES, CLEAN THE BATHROOMS, STOCK ITEMS. Which would seem normal to some but for myself it was not told upon my work placement that i would be doing a job of a custodian. I learned that not all managers are managers should be managers, some can over work you, not care about your outside life, or even care to give you your break, I've even  encountered my boss talking badly about me to my coworkers but this unfortunately an ordinary day at Kroger you will continuously be given additional work through out the day without being able to finish current assignments and you will get in trouble for it. Management will not handle situations properly I've encountered one manager that was a professional and very helpful. The hardest part of the job is not letting people break you down and just staying strong because you have bills to pay because customers will test you, as well as coworkers, and management. The most enjoyable part of the job is going home. All together all i can say is if you need a job this is exactly what that is a job. But in my experience not saying that every Kroger is bad but the one that i work for i would never recommend to anyone i would say to avoid this place."
bad,"It is mandatory to sign up for the Union, they do not give alot of hours, so your not really making anything. Overall, I don't recommend this company."
bad,"got hurt at work, went to the doctors they sent me too and I am being billed cause fry insurance won't pay them. I will never work for them again,  no"
bad,This job was a stepping stone for me to get a better job. For starters forget about your lunch and breaks. The managers will definitely forget about them and you. I worked there for about a month and a half. They already forgotten about my lunch and breaks. I would work a full shift without​getting a break or lunch. Even though you get paid every week. You cannot survive off of your paycheck. Kroger will rather you die from being overworked and starvation before they care about you. They management staff are very rude. They will cut your hours whenever they want
bad,"Well, working in retail is never a good way to go, as its mind numbing work and its a very unenjoyable experiance. Never go into retail, once again, im not stalling to make this seem more legit becuase i dont want to write this, but dont go into retail."
bad,good place for star specially if you don't a driver license   or if you are new in us or you are a student  for help yourself  and get some money  the union doesn't help the worker  the salary its  not good for married people
bad,"the company offers all this great stuff if you will work for them. once you get there its adifferent story! hours change actually whole schedule will change with out them notifing you, the clinic manger at the clinc I was at was so rude to staff. she has no idea how to manage a clinc."
bad,"Dillons is a nice store made with the high efforts of its employees."
bad,"The pay at Kroger is almost laughable. I believe we deserved more for the work all of the employees did. The employees under management were all so wonderful, but when it came to supervisors and up, including my lead in Starbucks, they did not seem to care about anything and treated us poorly."
bad,A typical day at work included bagging groceries and bringing carts in. I feel like my supervisors would forget that I was outside sometimes and I would be stuck out there for 2 hours+.
bad,Everyday here was the end of the world to everyone working in it. Everyone was so stressed out all the time i'm not sure how anything got done. I constantly walked into management on lunch talking negatively about not only me and my coworkers but members of other departments as well.
bad,"I felt as though there was no way to move up in the company. Almost impossible to get full-time, unless you are in the cliché with management. I would not recommend working here"
bad,Was treated poorly by management and staff. They are very rude and not responsive to things. Manager was never there when needed and was not given proper breaks and broke labor laws. Management would not work with school schedule and refused to listen to me about my hours.
bad,This was by far the worst company and management I've encountered in forty years of a working history.  They treat their employees like less than dogs; could care less; forced union; pathetic management; huge turnover; over-controlled and regulated without clear understanding within management.  Poor pay; and best of all....they lie.
bad,Could not move up in position very easily and management did not help speed up the process. Was stuck as a bagger although I was taught register for no one to tell me that I had to go do the training to get a physical promotion on my job description to go in my file.
bad,Hard labor decent pay check. I learned to be patient in learning and to gain much wisdom and insight as Possible. The workers are friendly people that are trying to make a good life with the wages that there given.
bad,"If you love to hide in the restroom and talk on your cellphone while others are working, Kroger is the job for you. Please don't work at Kroger! Management loves their lazy employees. They get all the praise, more hours and hardly any work. The employees that will actually work will get more work. Management does not care. What matters most is that the work gets done."
bad,"a lot of stress and management treated Starbucks like the red headed step child. No support or help from the managers, always getting yelled at for things in other departments. signing up for benefits was a joke and 401k plan never went into effect. Kroger is a joke"
bad,law suite was filed after I left the company because of Kroger paying employees less than what was correct. That saying a lot about a company. Check your checks!
bad,Moved up quickly to not get the correct raise. Worked over 40hrs/week no lunch or breaks. Overtime due to this was frowned upon. Not enough coverage to receive lunches or breaks.
bad,Kroger's is a place for high school children. It is not for adults especially based on the pay and hours. Kroger's really need to up their game and get better managers
bad,"Going downhill, Company does not care about the associates that make the company successful.  Constantly changing standards on a weekly basis, never having the time to fully understand any certain way.  Company has changed for the worse since the President of the Michigan Division took over."
bad,Management isn't on the same page they play favorites pick on certain people and do not do their jobs correctly. Alot of the employees are lazy so the hard working people have to pick up the slack. if you call union or even complain to managment they wont do anything about it .
bad,"One of the worst place have worked at. They treat you like a slave and expect way to much out of everybody. They always degrade people cause they can't do their expectations.. High turnover here people don't stay here to long and everybody that has been there for years complains about how bad it is anymore ..."
bad,"The store I worked at was very understaffed and all of the employees were constantly overworked. Store managers would always side with the department managers, never listened to the workers."
bad,"I was lied to upon hiring, as were many of my coworkers. The scheduling is based on seniority so you will have to beg your whole department to let you have your prefered day off. The management has no trouble threatening your job even on your first day. Favoritism and unproffessionalism abound and in the store I worked at there are multiple employees who will never be fired despite consistently being reported for harrassment of explicit nature. If you want ot get by at Kroger then don't care about your job security and have no respect for your job or managers. If you care they only take advantage."
bad,It's a job but low pay. You will work hard and will get low pay. The only good thing is you get paid weekly but they make you go across town for training (which I think is not needed.)
bad,what started as a dream ended as a nightmare.  I don't step foot on any kroger property because of my experience there.  I can't see myself going to a kroger anytime soon.
bad,Not a good place to work at.  they pay is very low for the work they want you to do bring carts in bottle return clean bathrooms. They also have favortism. They promoted people who came after me.
bad,This job is for children. You are expected to go above and beyond for little compensation  and work on every holiday and weekend. They have a high turn over rate and low moral.
bad,"This company is a horrible place-to be employed with. No benefits, the hours that are allotted are less then 25 during a normal work week."
bad,I didn't really enjoy this job 1st off it was little pay for a mother of 2 and I took on to many responsibilities for so little pay plus to many people didn't do there job right
bad,"They have you work multiple things, but no raises. They pressure you to work over time. act as if you have no life other than working there. managers are awful"
bad,"I would not recommend it at all to any body, not even as a starting job. Everything about the job changes on a dime, and there is no direction what so ever. Just find something else."
bad,Worst place ever to work.Management does not care.Noone will offer you support when you need it.People will brown nose and if you arent one of them you are always at the bottom
bad,"This job offered no real benefits, the training was unsatisfactory, and I felt like I was being watched every five seconds. I did tasks that were not according to my job detail for little pay."
bad,"Did not care for this job, my manager was a jerk who singled me out of everyone to yell at me a good majority of the time. Absolutely do not recommend."
bad,"I was bounced around departments, forced to stay on days I couldn't, forced to work weird hours just to get hours, and the management was bad. Not a nice atmosphere."
bad,"They gave you no hours, sent you on break way too late KNOWINGLY, the managers are hateful and nasty for no reason. I would NEVER recommend someone to work at Kroger on Terry Rd, Louisville KY!!!!!!"
bad,I hate kroger with a passion. Nobody is nice. Everybody who works there is younger than 20. The pharmacy is under staffed and overly busy. This job sucked. I hated my life.
bad,"Always working understaffed, VERY stressful, very large work pile on top of a 7 person line of customers staring at you. So you can't get anything done because ""customer comes first""............ and they never stop coming. This job made me absolutely HATE people. Management isn't motivating, encouraging or uplifting. Pay SUCKS for what we have to deal with. 8.30 is what they start you out at and you get a raise for each test you pass but it maxes you out at about $10-11/hr within 1-2 years. You'd think for such a big corporation they could pay you a little more for busting your butt off for them 40 hours a week!!! They don't care if you get a break or not. Most of the time we just have to skip it or it gets shortened. You're allowed one 30 minute break in a 8 hour shift. So if you work a 10 hour shift you still only get 30 minutes and that's even if you get one. I met my 2 best friends here and that's the only good thing I have to say about this job. You will hate it."
bad,Kroger is an awful place to work ...constant gossip trouble making and back stabbing no pay raises ...the union does nothing and you still have to pay dues out of what little you make ...the benefits for full time are awful ...
bad,don't care about your personal life if you have children if your an only parent if your going to school high school or college always make you work on your days off even if its a school day and they know u are unavailable that day. always make you stay over your time unwilling to let you advance they need you were you are at.is a good job for teenager nothing more
bad,"Kroger is not fun to work for, they pull you in with promises of being a great, employee friendly place, when in actuality it's a low quality job with near to no benefits and coworkers that run the gamut from useless to alright at best."
bad,"I didn't enjoy working there, for the most part it was ok. Horrible employers and very inconsiderate and very unprofessional and careless. Some days I enjoyed work."
bad,Super poor training. Was only there two weeKS and they let me go.  Capitalist thugs.  Dnot care bout their workers. It's a  sweatshop.  Got a stupid booklet and never really had time to fill it out.  Never had time for wbls either.
bad,Kroger company only care about money. Managers do not care about employees or how they're feeling. Horrible place. Do not work here. I advise you. I didn't enjoy it.
bad,every day was terrible . management was mean and didn't give clear instructions on what to do. my last day of work 3 months later i still had no idea what i was supposed to be doing the entire time i was there
bad,"A typical day at Kroger as an employee or customer is lousy. Employees are rude and dirty with horrible customer service and managers are inconsiderate, self-absorb, egotistic people."
bad,Immature managers. Rude front counter teams. I do not recommend to anyone. They will be intrusive to your personal lives and will also pick on your flaws.
bad,"I came in the morning and set up the sweet shop."
bad,"Did not care that I was in school. Started me off at minimum wage, lower than I made at my first job. Worked several hours that I asked to be off when I signed up"
bad,"Managers would disrespect workers by being rude and yelling. Messy work place. Hours were terrible, not willing to work with college student schedules."
bad,"While employed at Kroger, I worked an average of 23 hours making 6.00 an hour at the time. The atmosphere wasn't too negative but the hour was very limited."
bad,"It is very stressful "
bad,"I thought I would love working for Kroger, but soon found out that there were too many stipulations involved.  The harder I tried, the more they expected.  I was limited to where I could work and was denied requests"
bad,"This is by far one of the worst places you can work. Managers do not value any of their employees, and there is little to no chance for advancement. There were no pros to this job."
bad,The management at the corporate office suck they do not care about their employees and they do not know how to do their jobs they are need to hire more professional managers who know how to do their jobs properly.
bad,"Worst job I ever had. Hard work, low pay, long hours. Save yourself the time and don't even apply unless you are desperate for a paycheck. It was such a relief quitting."
bad,as soon as i started working there i felt instantly unwelcomed as an employee. the managers there are not professional at all. i hated waking up knowing i had to go to work.
bad,"The amount of work that had to be done in the meat dept versus the amount of pay I was getting made no sense.  It felt like modern day slavery, and the environment was no fun either.  Other employers felt the same way, its like a revolving door. dont apply here"
bad,When I started working at kroger I loved it. But over time the managers were more focused on drama and they didn't appreciate the workers for the hard work that was done. I felt unappreciated and overlooked.  Overall the experience was bitter sweet
bad,they are not a very reliable company they let you go with no notice and are very disrespectful have a big turn over rate. They aren't very willing to work with your schedule like they say. when you have a issue they don't really seem to care.
bad,"A typical day at work consist of people arguing, not working well together, supervisor ignore concerns. I liked my overall job as a shopper and attendant, its the staff I worked with, that were intolerable. Supervisor even reported to HR how the environment was very hostile, upper management did nothing to correct the problem."
bad,I wouldn't work there at all i hated working for that type of company and it was not a job i would go back to because the people there were so rude and there wasn't any conversations with other people
bad,"Its great if your a teenager and don't mind making 7.35 an hour."
bad,"I didn't like it. Terrible management. I was harassed, bullied, my boss attempted to blackmail me and forced to pray on the job to a god I don't believe in. HR is a joke. Their incentive programs are a joke."
bad,"If you were a cashier you would come in and try and figure out what register you need to be on. Once you figured that out you would begin your work day. The management tried their best to get you your breaks and make your day go smoothly, but they have a lot of employees and not enough of them. The hardest part is working with the customers, most customers don't want to be there and they take it out on you when things don't ring up correctly or we stopped selling something they bought there."
bad,I hate this job really bad hard to move up in this company I work there 16 years and never ever ask u have to b white an kiss butt. And they all look down on blacks
bad,it was not a great place to work. being lowest on the line i got my hours cut and a few times no hours in a week at all. then the next week only get 4-8 hrs
bad,Management was always mad and upset about something. The typical day at work consisted of getting jumped all around and yelled at for doing your job. There was never an enjoyable part of the job unless you were getting carts because you weren't being watched like a dead animal to a vulture.
bad,The orientation to not understand ability with disability about what is all about. So I will not definitely not happy what they did to me for in 45 days that they are advantages of my rights ability.
bad,"never given the hours to do the job with and always hounded to get more and more done. very poor pay. only good thing is the full time benefits, but dont worry they wont let anyone become full time."
bad,"The pay is awful, and no room for advancement. Although they work with your schedule, they do not care to give you consistent hours unless full time. Forgot to put in my work experience and ended up that I only had 30 days to dispute it, and was left with no experience which meant lower pay. There are so many discrepancies in their rules and expectations, it makes it almost impossible to enjoy to go to work. Also, you get a whole 5 cent raise every 6 months."
bad,I enjoyed being a part of Kroger. I brought attention to my mangers and co-workers how friendliness and complements on my work ethic helped the companies rates.
bad,The main manager got fired and then it seemed no one had the thrive to keep positive and going. The store became dirty and no one wanted to work anymore.
bad,If I could give management no stars I would. I worked in the Pharmacy and the manager who is also one of the Pharmacists is no good. All she literally does is talk bad about her employees when they weren't there to us. Also my pay checks would be messed up sometimes. Just overall didn't enjoy working there.
bad,Needs Better Leaders In The Company. Communication Is The Key To Working With Each other Especially With Management. Marianos Has To Do Better As A Whole.
bad,I was pregnant and sick at the time. None of my higher ups seemed to care and made me work while throwing up and use chemicals that could seriously harm my baby. I also had little to no training and things were rarely cleaned properly. We failed health inspections miserably.
bad,"shortly after starting, all but one member of management quit. i felt underpaid and unappreciated. i had to drop out of college to keep the job. i would not recommend this job to my worst enemy"
bad,Due to the volume and lack of bulk staffing I found it very difficult to complete task. Not very conducive to success . I feel that it is not managed correctly overall.
bad,"You get 13 hours and half goes to union, leaving me nothing but gas money.   Wasted time trying to get enough hours to the at gas and food bill. I was better off on welfare or begging with a hat and a vet sign"
bad,"I worked out in the Fuel Center. I literally got fired on my FIRST day working out there alone, (I had 5 days of training). I know they have the right to do this, but I felt terrible, seriously, after my first day ever not being a trainee? Why? I messed up just a FEW times while in training, but who doesn't? Maybe they hired too many people, I don't know, I just think it's cruddy considering my Kroger was with a Union. I was not even told what I did wrong, so I can't improve for future workplaces."
bad,"They did not give me any hours, and paid me very little to do a lot of work. I was a bagger and had to get carts, bag peoples items, clean bathrooms and occasionally take out the trash. No one ever did carts so I had to do double the work. Management sucked."
bad,Really it was BS they didn't give enough hours and the pay was crapp. and if I ever had another opportunity to work at krogers again I would not take the chance.
bad,"terrible terrible terrible. Horrible place to work, the managers act like children and involve themselves in all of the highschool drama and treat their employees very poorly. If they do not like you, they'll wait until the last day before they cant fire you to do so."
bad,"I have only work there for a little over a year but so far the pay is garbage, management sucks, it is a skeleton crew 24/7, and they don't work around your schedule."
bad,"you work your but off for little money, they don't schedule properly for the help they need,and want you to work on days off when they call but forbid you from overtime"
bad,"The management was horrible , There training wasnt long enough or comprehensible, . Nobody seems to know any sense of organization or communication"
bad,"This company is really cancer. This has been the worst place I've ever worked, and coincidentally the first place I worked. This company should be shut down entirely. The compensation is garbage, the work required is all pushed down onto new employees and lower level employees. People were stealing from the company because they get terrible pay."
bad,Never once in a regular day of work was I ever trained properly had to always guess the duties. The hardest part of the job was been all day in the freezer with a light sweater and not been able to work properly with the correct techniques that were required. Also never show the correct schedule.
bad,"They lie to you about promotion from within.I was never late to work and went above and beyond I raised sales in the deli 9% and instead of promoting me or giving me full time my dep "
bad,"Worked at Kroger for about a year. They will work you so hard for little money. Not worth it for the job you do. Before holidays, working there was horrible and back breaking. Wouldn't recommend working at Kroger, also I've approached a lot of rude customer. Ruined my spirit within a second."
bad,"This was the worse place I ever worked for. Short help, cut hours management not good stay away not good. Expect everything done fast with short help get told to work faster."
bad,"While working for Roundy's I held many different positions for different departments. Some of those departments included Chef's Collection, Deli, Bakery, cupcakes, and bottled products. My co-workers worked well with me, and the most enjoyable part of that job would have to be working for the bakery. Management would be a down fall. They ended my assignment after I had learned all these position sadly."
bad,when I first worked their it was all right but and then some people especially one of the co-worker I ask a question and she just got snippy at me and I felt like i'm not supposed to be their. but most of all I liked some people that worked with me but not all though.
bad,A typical day at Kroger is coming into work to be yelled at and keeping the store well kept. The hardest part of the job was bringing in buggies from the lot in all kinds of weather. The most enjoyable part of the job was going home.
bad,I did not like the job. I actually hurt myself at that job. They had me bringing baskets into the store. And I could not push them they where to heavy.
bad,"bad communications between co workers, management talks down upon workers, managements likes to play favorite and lets things slide for some but not all."
bad,Terrible job there not clean at all.  People take big doo doo and leave it in the toilet and they expect you to clean it up. You bag groceries and go get carts in the coldest weather or raining and lightning weather.
bad,"I love working with customers, and see of the workers were really nice and helpful, but the management people are rude and lie, they cut hours and give it to seniors..."
bad,"horrible. management was very unfriendly, bad hours. can't move departments. also drama, worked up front next to the door and we couldnt wear sweaters"
bad,Rouny's is not a really bad place to work. Although I felt that it can be pretty divided by race depending on what department you work in. I also think that they need new equipment in order to get the jobs done in a reasonable amount of time.
bad,"Terrible place to work, management was not approachable.  Felt like there was a prejudice because I wasn't willing to do things that I did not feel were appropriate, would not lie for other staff members, not part of my work ethic."
bad,This place drains the life out of you and spits you out when it's done. This place sucks. The turn over rate is high for a reason.
bad,utter chaos! there is almost no communication between management and employees. Too many people trying to do the same tasks.
bad,"If you value family, friends, sleep, respect, or just being able to do any at home chores such as mowing the lawn, then this is not the job for you. Expecially if you go into management. My advice would be do not work there."
bad,"I worked for Kroger over almost a year. I barely made enough to pay my bills or even buy food for the week. My hours were constantly taken from me from people that had more seniority me. No one really worked with one another or communicated with one another."
bad,"this was a bad job because they lied to me about how much money I could be making , they told me I didn't have enough customer service experience but ive been in that part of the workers field since I started working except my very first job. the hours are long and to be honest its not enough money for the position and too much money comes out of the check so you don't even make 200 a week even working full time."
bad,Needs massive improvement in so many areas. Extreme turnover. Low wages. Employees not treated as fairly as they should be. Management covers their own backs and that is it.
bad,Love discount hate the people who was always judge me could not do it anymore mess up my self esteem and confidence. And no money in the world is worth that
bad,Terrible work environment company is money hungry and doesn't care about their employees. if you have a family emergency forget about getting excused...the exact words of a supervisor was that the only excuse they except is death...
bad,You bag groceries for customers and offer to help take the groceries to their vehicle. You also have to clean spills and the bathrrom
bad,"This company doesn't care if you come in everday and do your job. If they can find a way to terminate you they will. I worked for the Kroger Distribution Center in Memphis, TN and I made my production numbers weekly and came to work on time everyday and was still wrongfully discharged and they breached a collective barganing agreement contract to do it. Do not shop at their stores or work for this company."
bad,Kroger is a joke. It is a waste of your time. The managers are a joke and they don't listen to anyone. You are always clocking in and out for everything at all.
bad,"I would never reccomend working at Krogers, they have poor management, and do not take care of their employees very well. It was fun at first then everything starting going downhill when we got new management"
bad,Must be able to select items on a pallet jack in a matter of time with out spilling or miscounting items. Management didn't care about their workers.
bad,"If I had too , I wouldnt work there again. 12 hours a week and little pay. The managers were all over the place. I enjoyed being apart once everything shifted."
bad,done this same review three times in a row. now im rambling to be able to submit. fix this system before i lose my mind. hire someone from these resumes to fix this.
bad,they don't pay their workers like they should be paid and don't work with them like they should. just overall a bad company to work for. they don't care if it is a family emergency  
bad,Terrible. The food is gross and sometimes expired. The boss leaves the children alone for hours to go run errands. The pay for minors is illegal and should be reported.
bad,Managers treat employees poorly. Little to no benefits. Little to no help and you are still disciplined when you cant finish your work. All of the upper managers care about is profit. Teamwork and friendship among employees is discouraged.
bad,I was hired in for the Holidays only. Since i worked my 90 days and got into the untion they couldn't let me go so then they started to treat me badly.
bad,"I worked here in 2014. The management is completely unsupportive. They like to hide upstairs in the offices all day, and if you manage to see one of them and ask for help, they tell you to get someone else to do it, or either help and roll their eyes like they have something better to do. One of the female managers openly ridiculed employees and talked about them in front of customers if they made a mistake. I was verbally attacked on two separate occasions by two employees whom I had never met or spoken to before, and they got away with it because they had been there longer. The schedule was always wrong. We would get calls saying that we were late for work when we were not. This is one of the most awkward workplaces I have ever seen. I worked at another SC location before transferring here, and that location was pretty cool. I wish I had never transferred and managed the longer drive."
bad,"worked there for almost a year. made horrible schedules. had horrible and old non functioning equipment yet still demanded high yield. had managers that would do noting tohelp what so ever. people would all out and the managers would not help at all, leaing one person to do a three to four person job."
bad,"I dont have time to answer right now. They are & promote lying, cheap, discriminating. Treats there employees like slaves. No advancing & the pay is a joke."
bad,unprofessional management and the pay isn't worth the time. They allow harassment happen and don't do anything to resolve problems with that problems between relationships with co workers.
bad,Co-workers that have worked there for 20+ years treat new comers like trash. They do nothing but talk behind your back and the manager does nothing to change their ways. Special treatment was only given to favorites.
bad,this was the worst job ever. with bad pay and bad hours. i wouldn't work for Kroger co again. it felt like everyone hated me and no one help me or show me what to do.
bad,A typical day was pulling orders all day while on your feet the entire time. I learned to work off of a hand held device. The management was very rude to their employees The coworkers were great to work with. The hardest part of the job was being on your feet all day. The
bad,Did not enjoy my job at Kroger the past few months as the managers expected way to much out of you because they could not keep working for them. Very nice people do work there those.
bad,"No one listens to the employees from management. Personal time/ life doesn't seem to matter, and schedules seemed to have been based on how well management liked the employee and not on need of work."
bad,"The managers pic their favorite employees and if you're not one of their picks, they will not listen to anything you say, and will not notice anything you do. I was dealing with a bully in the workplace and I came to the manager and told her everything that was going on, and nothing was ever done about it. The pay is minimum wage."
bad,I do not care to comment. It was a bad environment.  It was a bad culture.  It was bad.  No one wanted to be there.  If you go there you will never escape
bad,Company wasn't the best experience due to alot of management as well as the company just not wanting to raise wages. Hours where always different instead of being consistant.
bad,my view is they don't treat workers good and there management it so poor because they saying that every china inside shop is your manager so you do what they asked you to do. I learn that chines are here for money they don't care about us worker
bad,i dont think that do all they can for anyone in the kroger stores is sad i hope one day that they can help out all ones they can
bad,Management is not very friendly or understanding of things that are out of an employee's control. It is a very stressful environment to work in.
bad,"workload can be horrendous at this place and they repay you with 7.75 dollars an hour. mamagement doe not like to train, very very unreasonable when you do something wrong"
bad,"Kroger was in limbo, was not a great work environment. Management had a ""do not give a darn""  attitude as well as other key staff."
bad,"A typical day at work would include me going to work in the Deli, and never having enough people to fill a shift. So, if my shift ended at 10 pm, I was always there until 12 am or later., and the management did nothing to help. They would also bring new people in all the time, and expect us to be able to train them, and get everything done that they needed us to get done. Mind you, I was never the manager, and the manager never worked nights. The co-workers I had were the only thing that was pleasant about this job. Management could care less what kind of troubles we were going through, and how late we had to stay.  They also never worked around my college schedule like they said they would when I got hired, and expected me to skip school in order to work (this did not happen)."
bad,"Training Kroger Associates on varying levels and positions"
bad,I have worked with the company for 3 years..And I would not recommend working there to anyone..Management is just horrible to all the associates and lies to us all.
bad,"I learned a lot of skills while there, people are willing to help you as long as you ask. speak up it is a busy place everyone is nice"
bad,it was a grocery store. typical environment. nice people it was a fun experience. I learned a lot of things in the short time I was there
bad,While working I had a health issue causing me to go to an Emergency Room. Management was mad I couldn't make my shift and demanded I came in after my ER visit.
bad,"they only care about themselves not you, not even as an employee. they do what benefits them and never seem to care if you have school or family conflicts"
bad,Do not reccomend this company. Was always doing above the standard without the pay. Was close to full time multiple time and the company would cut back the hours so it was impossible to get.
bad,"I have worked for this company for about 2 years. Union is trash, they take 10 dollars out my paycheck for what? benefits are useless at best. management is trash, whoever says the management is good got lucky they are f-in horrible. On top of all this, i have worked every department besides gm and meat and im making 8 dollars an hour. They wont move me up regardless of how much i do, and they move up the most mentally ""special"" people in the  world that do not do there job. What the ? Bottom line, horrible pay, horrible management, horrible co-workers, and no advancement opportunities ."
bad,"Totally unorganized, too many young people allowed to be on their cell phones while working and no one new knew what was going on.  They just put you wherever they need you, it's ridiculous!"
bad,"There is no organization or customer service at all. The employees are rude, the managers are rude and don't handle any of the issues that arise between the employees.There is more work to do than you are paid for."
bad,This job only works for u if your a high school student the pay rate is terrible. Manangement does not care if the store is understaffed. Employee management relations is non-existant.
bad,"Kroger is a great place to work. I do enjoy interacting with the customers, very friendly environment. Cool place to work."
bad,store management was unfair in punishment of only a few departments while others were ignored for behaving badly employee morale was always low and employees were leaving for other jobs often
bad,The are not organized and the attitudes are horrible with the staff member. other than that they are pretty good with the produce and other food items they just need  attitude adjustments and they will be ok .
bad,"Don't work here, even Walmart is better. Just don't ever work here, Always Hiring/Firing. Most employees are replaced within weeks, new employees all the time, min wage starting pay. poor breaks, no lunch breaks at all."
bad,"They are a very shady company to work for, often did not pay me for hours I worked and promised to put them on my next check but never gave me the money. The management was terrible, yelling in their employees faces and in front of customers, and always in the office not helping out their employees when they were needed. Just horrible management and no morals when it comes to taking money from their employees, hard working moms and dads. I refuse to shop there now as well. And their union is ridiculous, they take way too much out of your checks."
bad,You are not paid your worth here. Kroger will over promise and under deliver each and every time. I would not recommend this job for anyone.
bad,"I go to work and do my job. I enjoy shopping at Kroger stores, but I do not enjoy being a part of the company as a whole. I enjoy some of my co-workers. I feel management as a whole treats employees distasteful."
bad,"alot of favortism, alot of people looking to get in mangements good graces by any means necessary, managers do not care about you and once your done being of use to them they throw you away."
bad,"My supervisor/ boss and i had discussed me being a college student, she agreed to work around my school schedule so i was able to succeed at work and with my grades. Once i started working she completely disregarded my school schedule and i was forced to quit."
bad,I find myself frequently staring out the windown -- this is completely different than anything I have ever done before -- it has given me a completely different understanding of what it means to be an hourly employee
bad,"Underpaid and overworked, good people though. Da sljfhldfh jsfjdnkldsflhl kljsjfhlahsf kjsdfhlkashdg kdskj sjbffg sdkjbfkjs dsgfjsgs sf"
bad,you dont know crazy until you work here. all the customers seemed to be insane. COMPLETELY over worked and underpaid. hated working here. but i guess it was ok for a first job.
bad,"This is a high demanding job with very low pay. Contradictions in policies, procedures and expectations are everywhere you turn. Although this is a Union represented place of employment, there is with rare occasion that the Union is actually helpful, productive, nor beneficial and always results in unaddressed retaliation from the non-union upper management. There is no recognition and no reward for hard woking individuals that have even just a little work ethic and integrity, in fact, those whom possess such standards are grouped with, and treated accordingly to those who take advantage of the union's representation to be unreliable, lazy and outright terrible employees. I can honestly say that I have no idea how people can remain employees of this company for so long."
bad,"I'm not talking about all Kroger stores but the one in Morehead, KY is awful.  Rude smart mouthed kids working on night shift. They make fun of customers after they are fake and smiling to their faces. I even heard one boy talking about his personal life with women in front of customers. And the management is bad too. I would ask where I needed to go for the day and half the time they wouldn't even look me in the face when talking to me. I didn't make enough there to put up with rude co-workers and management. The customers were the only nice people in the place."
bad,It was a good place to work until I got  took againist my will and after closing one and got fired because I was missing it is a hire to fire job
bad,"New management fire 3 caucasian staff for insubordination or theft, yet let some of the african-american staff get away with these issues."
bad,doesnt really agree with the way they treat employees there shift managers the lack of respect makes you not want to even shop there
bad,Do not bother not worth it. bad sceduleing with bad management with rude co workers might as well work for the army. some of the head can be cool. the head of drug gm is a guy whos really cool.
bad,"A typical day at work involved cleaning, stocking, ringing up sales and good customer service. I learned a lot about the grocery aspect of the business. Management, however, had a lot to be desired, because of the lack of communication from management to employee. My co-workers were interesting people. The hardest parts of the job were communications, and teamwork, which there was none. the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new and interesting people and furthering my customer skills and making new acquaintances."
bad,"I would not recommend any one to work here.  Over all when I first worked here when pregnant it was a good experience.  When I came back later after having my son 9 months later the environment completely changed.  Def. Would not recommend working at the Kroger on emmet st.  They say they are a family company, but really all they care is if you show up to work and do majority of everyone else's work.  I would never work here again."
bad,Typical monopoly job were management does nothing and employees are pushed on with a unrealistic uncontrollable goals. Your expecting to be in control of sales projections when all you do is work a register.
bad,This location was very oppressive work environment. I worked mainly at service desk and did some accounting. No help at all and everyone was out for themselves.
bad,"2 years was more than enough. I started out as a bagger and within two months was ""promoted"" to cashier. Being a cashier and being on the bottom of the totem pole is the best way to experience how much retail employees are valued by their employers and the customers. In that they are not valued at all. The pay was dismal, as you start out at minimum wage (which is wage slavery and not a means to support oneself) and have your hourly salary raised 10 cents every 60 days. Big whoop. The management was awful. The store managers just sauntered around while cashiers and the service desk were being overrun with unruly customers - They did little to no 'managing' and never stepped in to help. We were always short staffed and we only had 7 checkout lanes and 4 U-Scan checkouts. There were usually only 2-3 lanes open at the most. They did their best to have as little people on the floor as possible. The few times I had overtime hours, management trimmed those hours to make the week an even 40 and put the extra onto next weeks pay-stub. I was too young and naive to realize I was being taken advantage of. As a fresh, new cashier my hours were sporadic, bouncing between every shift. Sometimes I would have 4 hours off before my next shift of 8 hours started. I was always used for the dates and shifts the more seniior employees and management didn't want. I often found myself working 3rd Shift from 11pm to 7am as the only cashier present, operating the U-Scan checkout lanes. Fostoria, Ohio is home to many people on welfare so unruly customers would wait until midnight on the 1st of the month"
bad,i left because of the high expectations for job performance that were not match by a decent compensation. i called in sick 2 times in a 10 month span and was told it was grounds for termination.
bad,"Out of the jobs I've had, I hated Kroger the most. The management is rude. Failure to work with schedule if in school. Not recommended."
bad,"At first I enjoyed working here and had a good department manager, but the store manager is not a good manager, and over time I got more and more miserable while there, I would leave my daytime job in a good mood and be angry by the time I got to Kroger an hour later."
bad,This place doesn't want you to advance within the company. There is a lot of favoritism within this company. You work full time hours and receive part time benefits. Managers are very rude and do not motivate their staff in a positive manner.
bad,"Wasted 5 years working at this job. Management sucks, and after union dues are taken out you basically make $4 an hour. Not worth it."
bad,Poor compensation for all employees. Decent employees are not treated well. Store management does treat associates as they should be treated.
bad,I signed on to work part time and was supposed to work 20 hours a week. They made me work 38. I was a student and they wanted me to work night shifts in addition to day shifts. They don't pay well and the management is awful.
bad,Mariano's is the worst place to work. Managers and higher management are rude and do not care about you. Very disrespectful and unruly.
bad,"Kroger was a horrible place to work. The pay sucked. The management sucked, for the most part. The hours were stupid. The only good thing about working there were some of the people you meet."
bad,"Assisting customers"
bad,"A typical day was working a 7-8 hour shift in an understaffed deli/bakery.  Management was very demanding and was known to throw temper tantrums.  Managers would scream, yell, and throw things and then threaten to write you up if you didn't kiss their feet.  The co-workers were okay, but most there just to get a paycheck.  They had little work ethic and were pretty nasty in the handling of food that was being sold to the public. I would not recommend purchasing food from the deli."
bad,"No, no, and no. Do not work here! You waste your life for low pay, no advancement, rude customers, and deal with  mis-management."
bad,The pharmacy manager is racist please do not apply at this store they do not treat employees with respect they talked to employees anyway
bad,the staff was rude and when I tried to take it to corporate they didn't do anything about it.They would put me outside for 2-4 hours at a time and that is technically illegal but they didn't care!
bad,"For the amount of hard work that is required with this company, the pay is tremendously too low. The often start new hires off at minimum wage and only offer a .5 cent raise every six months."
bad,"Customer service and book keeping was my main duty among this job. I would help customers with anything they needed. Whether it be questions on prices, fixing their gas points, calling corporate for needs above my power, being their Western Union representative, and refunding items they bought by mistake or had defect. Co workers were the best part of the job, in fact it was the only good aspect of the job. Management for the most part was rude and misunderstanding. The hardest part of the job was basically dealing with irate customers when a manager would choose not to take part in helping the matter. The most enjoyable part of the job was going home."
bad,working at kroger i learned how to multi task . i could answer phone calls & assist customers all at once. I gave great customer service
bad,Being hired at Kroger you will not be paid for experience and you can look to start part time minimum wage everyday more And more work is loaded up on you and the management staff expect you to become a robot or something this is the worst job I ever had no moral it is an awful unforfilling environment if you are new the people that have been here for centuries will ignore you if you even speak ridiculous
bad,"There was a lot of miscommunications when it came to performing work according to plan, lack of teamwork. I learned that trust can be easily broken when working with stubborn management with closed minds not willing to listen to others ideas."
bad,Kroger only cares about Krogers no one else they do not know how to treat their employees . customers can do something to you and Krogers says they are right what this  is bull I  will not shop there ever again .krogers is a joke I will be only dealing with shopping at Walmart .Krogers is a joke!!!I guess when  a male customer talked under my clothes I guess the customer was right then also huh Krogers no not me cause I told that man a thang or two !!!
bad,wouldn't recommend it to any one terrible place to work for the pay you get they don't believe in paying you for your work they dom't believe in raises either
bad,"This was the worst job I've ever had. I got terrible hours and an even worse paycheck. If I am dealing with drugs that need to be locked away and confidentiality issues I would like to think I would make more than a bag boy. You get an opportunity to raise your pay, but only on someone else's schedule. If this job didn't look good on a resume I would have quit after a week."
bad,Never heard a job well done. Harassed and never complimented on work. Poor management. Hostile work environment.  Managers especially store manger need a etiquette training.
bad,I was only a bagger and I realized from within a few days they are not geared towards the customer service. I had this job during high school and was a bagger. The baggers do the most work and get paid the least. At least when I worked there the management was poor and they were not strict on policy.
bad,look if i was u reading this... krogers is not worth it my dude.. itz a sham. no respect or help. itz mostly every person for ya self
bad,"So i was hired as a bench manager for bakery. They give you an agenda to follow 3 month training program they say. 2 weeks into the job I was doing things that should of taken me 2 months to learn according to the program.  Training was horrible.  When I contacted HR to let them know I'm not happy they said well maybe we should part ways if this isn't working out!! "
bad,"I was under pay and over work, I  work fulltime and when I get pay it 170 dollars that was cheap and I have kids to feed, sometimes I couldn't even buy milk for my kids"
bad,Bad management A manage cut my hours because of my race . When confronted. she lied to the Store manager and they moved me and took me off the schedule.
bad,"I worked in the Bistro checking out the customers to eat their or what ever the bought their. I would clean the whole area up the tables and sweep the floor and take care of the tables also over at Star Bucks. I would also put all the cups and lips out for the customers and make sure everything is clear and clean. I would make sure the products out in the store is brought to the front for the customers to be able to get the item make look proper in the store. I would take the garbage out of the cans if they were over flowed b/c some times the Kroger employees did not have time to empty them the night b/f I started my shift.  Reason I left they had rules that I did not know and would not give me another chance. I resigned , Best choice to due that because that is what the union told me to do."
bad,"They don't pay you what you deserve. They don't appreciate the hard work you put in. Instead, they tell you everything you're doing wrong, even when you are trying your best. This corporation does not care about their employees whatsoever. They will pay you the minimum and only give you a raise depending on what the union requires, not by how hard of a worker you are. The only good part of working at Kroger was working with the people I worked with and the nice customers I helped. But I would never recommend anyone to work for them. They take advantage of their employees and do not care about you."
bad,"As this was my first job, it was terrible. A customer threw a potato at me because it was to much money. The management did work with my high school scheduling but it was always the minimum hours a week."
bad,"Poor work environment and treatment of employees. Fired me after approving an unpaid maternity leave for me, had me fill out paperwork for the leave then fired me stating I was not elible for a leave. Depended highly on a pregnant woman and was angry when I had to leave to have my child - they were fully aware of my pregnancy they whole time"
bad,"Kroger is not what I call a friendly environment to work for and quite frankly, if you plan on going to College to make a better living then I suggest you do it."
bad,Full of employee drama very rude and careless managers ! U will not succeed at a place like this!  They choose favorites and dont pay anything at all
bad,I didn't really like the work. It may just be me. It was no place that I would want to stay at for many years. You should work there if you enjoy being paid on time and if you are patient enough to wait for the benefits.
bad,"I've have worked for many great well- known company’s before and Kroger isn't one of them. I think for customer and the customer service it’s a great company but for employees not so great at all. There are a lot of people that live for Kroger but the appreciation isn’t received. They work you too death in any department that you work in the store. I think that the most challenging department is the front end. There are the ones too put that last impressions on customers face and the appreciation for it  isn’t receive well from the company at all. If is it’s only through a 1 dollar coupon. Also management is horrible they most defiently don’t get involved with their staff un friendly, favoritism, non- mulita task and nonchalant people in charged. I've transfer once because of that but by me going to another store and experience the same things it’s not the store it’s the company itself. Kroger headquarters let these types of things go on and don’t care of fixing it. Just the store appearance and customers is all they care about."
bad,Terrible management. Terrible owner. The store is way too big for the lack of amount of employees. I was hired at 22-25 hours a week and was cut to 10 hours per week.
bad,management doesnt know what they are doing they cant work with your hours for school they cant even have full coverage of managers they will have two m managers come in at 5 pm and work till 10pm havent learned anything your bascilly just there to run register and they wont show you how to do it your discount only works for kroger brand and it s3hit they wont actavate it for like 5 months even thoe its so post to be on hire date and when you not on the register they have you work your a3ss off for 825 a hour walmart starts at 9 and other jobs go up to 11 they dont give you breaks unless you ask and you only get 1 break of 15 min regardless unless you work 7 and a half hours you will get a lunch walmart and mcdic3ks are two 15 and a half hour lunch wtf ruler quit being slave drivers
bad,"management was ok except for one, but other than that all was good. a typical day was just setting pumps and selling merchandise.."
bad,I don't think I was getting paid enough money for the type of work I was doing. I wish they would've paid me more. Much of my time was spent moving and unboxing pallets often hours non-stop. Luckily I had some opportunities to stand in one place and rest for a little bit when I was done stocking merchandise and could wait on customers by the meat counter.
bad,You don't get any hours you might get lucky and work 20 hrs most of the time you get between 10 to 16 hr a week!!! As far as getting a raise you have to work a lot of hr that you don't get!!! And the 10 percent of of Kroger brand well they can keep that.Kroger is worse then Walmart almost all the workers get ebt so they can eat !!!!So if you want a real job Don't work for them Not in Dayton and the union is a joke!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
bad,"Management is the worst I have ever worked with.  Part time and cheap pay, not enough money to pay your bills. Would not recommend working here unless you are desparate"
bad,i worked at Kroger in Elizabethtown KY. It was a joke. They literally bounce you from position to position and shift to shift and they don't give you any help to learn what to do! The management is the worst over EVER seen! They had a 60 yr old women pushing carts in the parking lot in the snow... Like really? It's awful!!!
bad,"The Store Manager & the co-manager do not talk to the employees, the employees are always wrong, the wont help you with anything. Worst place to work at"
bad,Always on time. Prepare the register to began ringing out customers. Try to get customers to sign up for a Kroger card. I didn't really like the few hours the were providing me.
bad,A typical day at work would be running the U scan machine.  Greeting those visitors and directing them in the right location as well as assuring them they have gotten the best produce and fresh tasting. The sales is great and prices are at low
bad,"From what I experienced it is very demanding for what little you make to come to work."
bad,"Promised pay raises after testing, but never received the first one. Was left to do jobs that I was not legally allowed to do."
bad,"Typical day at work involves getting chewed out by corporate Butt holes "
bad,"A typical day at work is very simple, I clean the bakery and the deli and cook. I've learned that working here and dealing with the unnecessary stress for only $7.25 an hour is not worth it. Employees never really want to help you out. The manager never seems to care about anything. The pay is horrible and we receive no benefits."
bad,"Typical day at work is Fast paced."
bad,My story is this. WHAT THE HECK. THEY DIDN'T GIVE ME TRAINING AND SO I FAILED THE DARN JOB. Almost all my co-workers were extremely immature. The supervisors griped about EVERY little thing I did. Wasn't even trained.
bad,Worked there 6 years kept thinking it was gonna get better ha! When I went to kroger I had 7years of customer service under my belt. I started at minimum wage and stayed there yet a guy that I trained started at $11 an hour what? Management does nothing about issues.
bad,Mangament is a joke . Hrs alway getting cut by 50% . Mangament is always on you for something . Department heads  are always getting they're way. Krogers don't allow for family time at all we'll work the weekends and all holidays . It is hard to get time off  no raises .  The union that is there is a joke . Union only helps themselves . Don't work there bad place to work and for
bad,"They don't want you to have a life."
bad,I worked at Marianos for way too long with the way I was treated. I was expected to do 6 different jobs some that I was not given training for. I was passed over for management training in leu of kids who couldnt ring up alcohol yet I was still expected to preform management duties. This company is a joke. Customer is always right is taken to a whole other level. They end up making customers feel like they are high and mighty and can treat the employees like garbage.
bad,A typical day at work was busy. I learned how to better my customer service skills. My co-workers were kind of lazy. Management was okay in the work area.
bad,"Terrible. management was rude and made promises that were never kept, co-workers were lazy, hours were unpredictable and customer service was never their main goal; instead it was time customers spent in line even have that meant rushing them."
bad,I nice group of people to work with and they work as a team.  I was not able to receive hours to help me care for my family at that time.  I also learned that 3rd shift was not for me because I could not sleep once I got home.
bad,Like the job. Got good review for higher  pay. Great job security for other position. Nice for anyone to start on a job that  just begin to work. Coworkers  are true team players at work and social activities from the job.
bad,"I'd advise anyone whose looking for a job, not to work here. The environment is horrible. Management is awful, & it's hard to work with your colleagues at times. Associates are very often underpaid, especially the courtesy clerks, we're in charge of cleaning the bathrooms, returning carts, bagging groceries, helping customers pack groceries out, cleaning up spills ect. All for a measly 7.25 an hour, sometimes we work 6 to 8 hours a day. On the days that you work 6 hours you only get a 15 minute break. At one point it was about °100 outside and humid, but the manager didn't care, she still had us outside returning carts for 30 minutes at a time. There was also certain people who skipped lot (returning carts) and so the person who had to clear lot at the end of the night could be there until 3am clearing lot. The break room was filthy & unsanitary, flies all over the place, if you put food in the fridge for lunch, more than likely somebody would steal it. The last straw for me was when one of my coworkers decided to threaten me because she thought i hadn't done an efficient enough job on lot, even though she isn't a manager or anyone of authority. There was no witnesses so it would've been my word against hers, plus she had been working there longer. I found this to be extremely unacceptable, i will not work anywhere where people feel like it's okay to harass you. I decided to be the bigger person & quit. None of that is worth 7.25 an hour. So my advice to anyone looking for a job would be to make kroger your very last choice, or not to work here at all."
bad,"The hardest part of the job, they would never have enough clerks to do a certain duty. Management , rarely had the front end under control and had bad customer service. I learned to always to do your job no matter how much pressure you under."
bad,"Once you get comfortable, if you're there more than 10 yrs, because you've likely just than achieved full-time than because union, and they try their best to disallow you the opportunity for full-time...you're going to be there for life. They will use and abuse you if you allow them. Benefits are awful."
bad,"Poor Management, not enough room for advancement, terrible scheduling, and poor culture.The 10% discount on kroger brand products does come in hand depending on how often you shop with kroger."
bad,"This company is a terrible company to work for. They lie they manipulate and the use you to your breaking point. I informed them in my job interview I was expecting a surgery and explained the procedure and the recovery time and what would be needed when I returned to work. While I was still in cast they were bugging me about when I would be coming back and told me they would be happy to accommodate me upon my return, when really all they wanted was an extra body on the registers, they repeatedly threw doctors notes away."
bad,"Definitely the worse company I've ever worked for. Hours are horrible! If you're a teenage boy or girl, its perfect. They'll hire you and give you horrible hours. Once you complain about the four hour shifts two days out of the week, they call you on your days off and ask you to work. They give you 12 hours a week. You'll never be promoted, you will never be full-time, and most importantly will never be satisfied!"
bad,Not only is there crazy drama constantly on the floor but the drama between management is atrocious. Working in the Fuel Center meant having to call 4 hours in advance to ask for my break only to be completely forgotten about and disregarded. If I had any questions I would call another Kroger because their managers would actually answer the phone. Basically. they just want you to bust your back so they can treat you like you don't matter. Worst company I have ever worked for.
bad,Kroger has good co-workers. The managers have no respect for customer nor associates. The job was actually very easy and the best part of working there was interacting with the customers.
bad,"The company overall is just very cheap. They want you to work your behind off for them for practically nothing. They also, from the time I was there, have poor management."
bad,"Though the company is new and provide a a innovative feel do not waste your time or talent. If you are a high school student then by all means part-time work here is just for you. Other than that expect to be OVERLOOKED and OVERWORKED like crazy, In a company in which they claim they value your input and opinion TRUST ME THEY DON'T. "
bad,I didn't really care to work here. It was borig. Didn't like cleaning the restrooms. My co-workers were okay to work with. Management wasn't the best. Had good customers.
bad,Very good at keep everyone happy. Never know who you might work with. Hardest part of the job would be the low pay. Management treat us well and fair. Didn't learn much besides refining lifting and talking to customers.
bad,"For Kroger's I worked in a small one person booth and control the fuel needs of others, checking on gauges and tank of fuel, supplying the customer with their fuel needs, restocking and shelving the items supplied in the booth like candy, cigarettes, potato chips, lighters, cigars, and drinks, taking inventory of all these items."
bad,"customers service, phones, lottery, refunds, inventory checking in and unloading loads. "
bad,Horrible work environment. Kroger is okay but a lot of unhappy employees full of attitude. the environment isn't great nor is the management outstanding but its a job and I stay positive about it.
bad,Managment wasn't good and there was a lot of special treatment. The pay was horrible. You didn't receive raises during a timely manner. And the raises weren't that much.
bad,Fun meeting new people. Best part of the day is meeting someone I have never meet before. The worst part of working was working alone in a box.
bad,stocked shelves unloaded trucks  ordered product order reviews helped customers also did help the front end out helped bagg grocerys quit because they wanted me to run cash resgestor
bad,"ringing up peoples purchases, and fuel purchases. Stocking and cleaning the fuel station. How to properly do things in a fuel station. My manager in the fuel station was wonderful. We got along like life long friends. I even helped her with the schedule.  Closing at night would have to be the hardest part of the job. It was scary being there by myself. meeting new people."
bad,well at work you will deal with a lot of drama and have to deal with managers that do not care about you what so ever. I quit because the friend of a manager didnt like me and they would try to make my day at work horrible.
bad,I was stuck in this job for 2 years as a bagger and after trying for a year and 1/2 I could not do anything else. I tried to be a cashier but it never happened.
bad,"When I first started at the job I love it. Through the years, my feels went down for them. They don't appreciate their employees. The work them to the bone. I was under paid, if you wanted a raise you had to move around in the company."
bad,The management do not know how to do anything on a store level and do no care about it's employees.Wasted a lot of time here.
bad,"Terrible company, raises every 5 months for only 5cents, will work you 6 days a week for 36 hours call it part time and still try to get you to work on your day off, never a flexible schedule. Slave wages, don't appreciate there workers. you will never get fulltime, if it's up to them they rather work you 6 days a week for 36 hours like a slave.1/10 don't waste your time with them unless it's your last option."
bad,employees had dirty hands and bugs were all over an management was more worried about saving their own behinds then keeping up on store
bad,Barely any hours. They changed the schedule without your knowledge. Not so great hours.
bad,"I would bag peoples grocerys and help them out with the carts, go out and get the carts from the cart area, do returns take the stuff back to the ale is what on, people my age or younger working there, management was nice, i liked the breaks even it was 15 mins."
bad,I wouldn't recommend this company to my worst enemy. Fred Meyer has absolutely no redeeming values as a place to work.
bad,"I would never work at a grocery store again, they only gave me enough hours to pay for gas to get back to work."
bad,Horrible Management there was no means of advancement at this job. The managers were unconcerned about the well being of the employees. I would not recommend working here for anyone that would want to pursue a job in customer service. The Kroger company would not be happy with the way the employers treated
bad,The hours are horrible and they do not pay you enough for the hard work that you do. The management is awful and do not believe that you should better yourself by going to college worst place to work. other Krogers are probably better
bad,Working for the Kroger Company is frustrating.  The rate of pay that employees received does not come close to the work that employees put into the company. There is rarely any recognition for the hard work that is put in day in and day out.  Employees do not receive the respect that they deserve.
bad,Loved working with the public and I loved baking. Being a Bakery Clerk at Kroger has gave me great experience in decorating cakes and cupcakes. The people were very friendly and I got along with everyone.
bad,It was the shortest job I've ever had due to management and the unfairness of that place.
bad,Nice for a teenager living with thier parents not at all for a adult with bills
bad,"I learned how to handle money, cards and checks at a register. How to assist customers with needs and learned wonderful customer service."
bad,I don't have much to say about kroger except i disliked every minute of it.
bad,They will lie to you to get you to apply and take the job you are offered (not the one you want).
bad,"training is lacking if you get trained at all"
bad,"This job is only good for a temporary setting."
bad,HORRIBLE place to work.Managers repeatedly lie to you.   Workers treated like dirt.
bad,I enjoyed some of my coworkers but honestly everyone do not get treated fairly....when I was there for 2 years I was constantly told that I could be in a different department it was different departments that wanted me there because I was a fast and hard worker. Everyone else that was not there longer than me got to move in different departments before me and some of my coworkers kept asking the managers how come I did not get to become a cashier go to deli bakery floral become a stocker go to produce or even the frozen department.
bad,the hardest thing was to get used to finding all products. The enjoyable was to greet all customers
bad,"Your day starts off with putting on yours boots and hair net, hard hat, gloves, lad coat. Its not a hard job, you work on an assortment of assembly lines that are going at a fast pace. The management in my opinion wasn't great, something could and should have been do differently but was. Its one of those place where you really don't  know when the work day is going to end. I was hired to work 8 am to 4 pm but many day I was still at work around 6 pm. As far as the co-works go its mostly women, who were nice in some ways and mean in others. The hardest part of the job was the cold and not knowing when I was getting off. And many time I would have to work on a Saturday, then the following week Monday or Tuesday would be cut short. Which in my opinion defeats the propose of working the weekend."
bad,Would not recommend others working for this company.  They play favorites with their employees and disregard issues when they are brought to their attention. Rather than deal with issues I was having I took an approach that cost me my job although was proven was wrongfully terminated. I am not disgruntled employee but instead a victim who did not deserve what I got.
bad,They don't seem to care for their employees as much as they should. Hard working employee's are unrecognized. They only notice when you do something they don't like.
bad,"While working at kroger kwik shop, I attended work on time and dressed appropriatly while greeting customers and making sure the store was in order. Management was very disrespectful and did absolutely nothing to insure that cashiers were properly trained therefore leading to monetary loss on their behalve and associates dont get breaks ! Lunches are 30 minutes but they never allow associates to take said breaks."
bad,not my favorite job. no work life balance. No time off in management. Can and will work 6-7 days a week. 10 hour plus days.
bad,"good for first job, a typical day is kissing the customers butt"
bad,"I worked in the warehouse, so take that into consideration....This place was the worst 12 years of my life. I cannot think of one good thing to say about it."
bad,"Disorganized office.  No accounts assigned, so no ownership. Too many ""other duties assigned"" jobs."
bad,worked my shift and went home. the managers didn't really care about anything that was going on with you at the time
bad,"Fast paced, Learned a lot from management, working as a team, a co-worker dont come in, ordering and working backroom as well as shippers"
bad,"A typical day is getting yelled at by customers, yelled at by managment for customers yelling at you, sudden shift changes, and reduction in work hours if you don't kiss up to the boss."
bad,"worst company ive ever worked for, have no desire to help their employees to move ahead, backward management."
bad,Not a good place for advancement or job security. Not a good place to work.
bad,the union dues that are collected because they are job protection are a joke at least at one kroger in KY i can't speak for the other kroger stores but wouldn't work for them again
bad,"the job was horrible"
bad,"low pay, long hours, no life and over whelmed. do not work here. they are hard on employees"
bad,"Let me see how good this will turn out !!!"
bad,it sucked I never felt like I was ever going to move up in the company and they treat their employees like they aren't much of anything
bad,"Management was awful, I was in school and they called me in all the time"
bad,i hated it. no one spoke english. management was hateful and made work heck
bad,Most of the front end floor supervisors are immature and push their authority around.
bad,no room for advancement and low pay. poorly managed. aksjdhfjkashdgkja;ghdaf;
bad,"They treat employees like children, pick favorites, cover up harassment."
bad,"I was never trained, I was put on the floor to do my job and had no clue what to do, Then my cart supervisor told me to only get small carts, later on that day my boss was furious at me because I did what I was told. Terrible Job, Terrible Training, Terrible Job"
bad,"the only good thing are the people there and the fact that they are forced to work around my schedule, the job otherwise is not great"
bad,"Not impressed with the company, I feel like it is falling down hill."
bad,Kroger wants you to do way to much for what they are paying then when that's done they want you to do more.
bad,"A typical day at work would be doing what u have to do in your department while being short staffed and being yelled at to speed up your work performance. Then they wonder why Whole Foods is a superior place to work "
bad,"Poor management. HR does not cooperate, unprofessional and disrespectful to employees. 10% employee Kroger discount is big lie."
bad,"horrible place to try to make a living off, no advancement and they treat their workers like your not another human."
bad,"very backhanded way of handling business. do not value employees, but how much the employee can do."
bad,The worst company I have ever worked for. Never a day went by that I did not want to be there.
bad,"I currently have a part-time job as a fuel clerk at Kroger. My duties at work is to give excellent customer service, open and close store, handle debit, credit, and cash transactions, problem solving, answer phone, complete daily reports, lottery, and clean pumps. Kroger is a great company for high school students to get a job."
bad,"I learned how to bag. Typical day as soon as i clock in i go out to the parking lot for an hour and shuffle in carts, then after that help customers with bagging and making sure register area clean."
bad,"A typical work day included:"
bad,I have meet a lot of good people while working there. Would have liked to learn different departments.
bad,I made friends there just not what I really wanted in a job and I didn't care for the management team!
bad,management is terrible they dont take your needs into consideration
bad,You don't even exist to the management unless you did something wrong.
bad,"I worked here for three weeks and they never put me in the computer system. I got paid for the first week through a pay advance. The second week, I went to get my check and they couldn't give me a check because I wasn't put into the system. The third week, I went to get my check and I still wasn't in the system. I quit that day. As it was, I was working 8-9 hour shifts and wasn't receiving breaks or lunches and I would have to wait an hour to an hour and a half just to use the restroom. This was completely unacceptable, especially when this is a ""Union"" job that only pays minimum wage."
bad,Had too many chiefs telling everybody how to do things their different ways.  Very confusing atmosphere.
bad,"people were rude"
bad,"enjoyable part of my job is customers..when i make their birthday cake a part of me will live on forever because everyone takes a picture of their cake that i made for them..hardest part of my job lately is they are making me work nightshift and i no longer am doing cakes, i am making cookies and unloading trucks that comes in 5 times a week and the trucks consist of anywhere from 100-125 pieces, i am almost a senior citizen...it is very hard for me.."
bad,This company by far is one of the worst companies to work for. The management is terrible and could care less about their employees. They put all the wrong people in charge and they lose employees quickly because of this. They are so focused on numbers they stress their employees out but never offer them any kind of help.
bad,Slicing meat and preparing food to be served for purchasing.
bad,I kind of hated every second i worked there. It was my first job though. From having others jobs i now realize management there was horrible. It was very terrible! Always got the bad hours too.
bad,worst company I work for wage is terrible and you have to steal other peoples hourse just to make a BAD paycheck
bad,mean and rude co workers  bad management not good pay bad hours. 
bad,Managers don't discipline any employee for being disrespectful and they allow other eployee's to take hours away from there co-workers
bad,"I would come in, and people were always calling in. So i was always alone to do everything. We would have a empployee call in everyday for a week and a half, just because. They didnt care. The Manager was lazy and did absolutley nothing all day. I never got a chance to work with her because she was always gone talking to people. The Hardest Part was dealing with other managers who got mad for something you didnt do. They just dont care, and they treat the coworkers like dirt, Its a horrible place, the worst i have ever worked.Best Part, was I know i did my job, and i got to go home to a beautiful kid everyday."
bad,Cleaning restrooms and bagging groceries was a typical day. Management needs more improvement and not friendly at all. Hardest part of the job was dealing with negative managers and negative customers.
bad,"Hourly Management was good and cared about the employees and customers, Salary managers only showed concern with corporate. Typical work day consisted of customer care which was the best part of the job, the costumers. associate looked out for the most part for other associates, that's one thing that made this job worth having.  "
bad,Your job is never safe. The employees are not treated fair. You have to do more work because they don't hire enough.
bad,"This is the worst company to possibly work for."
bad,"poor management "
bad,After breaking my left knee on the job they scheduled me weird hours no one else worked. Work till almost midnight then need to be in early in the morning. As far as work I had never had a bad review. I was constantly bugged about my eagle tattoo that I had when I was hired. I was there nearly 7 years and the first time I sold a 26yr old cigarettes I was fired. This or any of Krogers conveince stores are not a good place to work. There are also no lunch or 15 minute breaks given. you work your entire shift.
bad,"bag grocery for customers, walk them out to there car, give every customer your attention, and make them feel welcomed, to come back agin."
bad,"everything i experienced at this job was not the way it should be, i would never recommend someone to work here"
bad,"I worked for 3 weeks at a store in Houston. Was hired as a PT cashier. Orientation was a joke. It was several hours of ""feel good"" videos and flip charts, then several hours of mind numbing computer based training, that had NOTHING to do with my job."
bad,"Probably the worst job I've ever had. Been there for about a year and it lives up to it's name, pick n SLAVE. Have minors work 8 hour days and working up to 5-6 days a week normally, even during school. Harsh supervisors. Just go to iga, trigs or piggly wiggly.. "
bad,"A typical day at work was making sure the customers got the most out of their experience in our store.  I learned great people skills, I learned how to deal with all types of people, and I learned how to be motivated on the job.  My management and coworkers were all great employees and friends.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with adversity when something went south such as an unhappy customer.  The most enjoyable part of the job was making great friends and meeting all sorts of people."
bad,"Ive worked for 2 different Krogers, and they both have been a joke! If your not in upper mangement, they dont care nothing about you, better come to work when your sick or else your getting fired!!! Had a flu and couldnt barely make it out of bed, called in and was told that was unexceptable, like I knew I was gone catch the flu!!! Really ""Kroger""! They just want your money and the other workers dont care about the quality because they know people stiill going to buy it!!! SMH "
bad,"i hated it there, everyone was rude, they won't work around any schedules, they don't pay enough for what you're expected to do... it's a horrible work environment."
bad,"Management took hours from the employees and made our checks less than what they were. No one believed the employees, forcing many of them to quit. "
bad,People treat you like poo and it's nearly impossible to move up. 
bad,poor work environment. co workers worked form themselves rather than help others.
bad,"no room for advancement, poor management, never got breaks, customers were extremely rude, have to work alone, poor co workers"
bad,"Never got a break but got called into the managers office regarding ""not taking my breaks"". I told them that every time I went to take it I was called back to my register and someone else was allowed to take theirs. I also informed them that I was not happy about only getting 6 hours of downtime away from the store. I kept getting over time because even though my shift had ended they wanted me to continue working so others could have a break. (not fair right) so my shifts generally were from 6am-11pm. That is to much for any one person honestly and you would think they would have treated me better, but no. Then a week later my hours were cut to 4 hours per week. I went to find out from the manager about why my hours were cut and he stated that first off he wasn't happy about how I was being dropped off and picked up for my shifts and that I did not own my own car. Then he said he was on top of hours being cut and I wasn't the only one and the customer service manager and manually altered the schedules to give her friends the most hours and the hours they wanted. The following week this was not fixed and again I had 4 hours on the schedule and again the manager said he would fix the issue. Following week I showed up ended up having being asked to stay longer which turned into a much longer shift and the assistant manager came and took over the register and told me to go take a lunch break because I had been there so long so I started my way to the clock to punch out for lunch but didn't make it because I was paged to return to the front. Apparently she could not handle the rush"
bad,"The job is okay for the pay but the managment was like high school kids in charge. If you were not in with the ""in"" group you did not get any hours. Hours were not gaureented unless you were in the 'in' group with the manager or assistant manager. Only thier friends got full time all the time. High school drama in the work place..."
bad,I was a cashier at Kroger. I had a horrible experience. The management was not helpful and I was treated terrible by my higher ups.
bad,"Company core values were not enforced at all in the pharmacy. Management did not enforce code of conduct or pose any consequences when rules were broken(example- comming in late, cussing at other employees, using personal cell phone). In the two years I did work there I was never shown a policy manual."
bad,"A typical day at work is stress, being blamed for things that you didn't do, and a manager crying because her stress is 10 times higher than yours and she can't handle it. I learned that this job has no motivation for growth, because it looks like managers get treated like toilet paper and then thrown away. Management is corrupt and there is no motivation to progress, no raises for loyalty to the company. The hardest part of this job, it to maintain their outrageous expectations for sales, protection plans and events. Then if you can't do the impossible, you lose your job and get replaced with someone else who will also eventually lose it because they are just human too. The most enjoyable part is days off, even though they still call you all the time to ask you how to fix a problem. This job has not been kind and needs a new management makeover with people who actually care."
bad,Management doesn't know how to talk to people and the pay is terrible.
bad,"Constantly had hours that I worked but was never paid for. Went to management, and they swore I only worked what they'd paid me for. Work like a slave and barely make anything worth staying for. If the job wasn't union, you might actually make enough to live off of. If you are looking for a job where you can make actual money to live off of, you're probably better off slinging burgers."
bad,"normal days were doing the baking and making the donuts was fun. alot of nice people to work with.I still shop there and see my friends.of course the money was great.there wasn,t nothing hard about that job,it was great."
bad,"poor management, was left with other people's work, treated me very poorly through my pregnancy. No good thing came out of this job"
bad,The management gave me a hard time. The hard part of the job was gave me a dirty job as collected all carts while it was hottest outside...
bad,i not work them again
bad,This company will not give you any hours they like to work people 20 hrs or less per week.
bad,Management does not know what is going on. Unrealistic Goals. They expect to much in a little time.
bad,"Good for high schoolers, customer service skills are lacking, managers power trip and think they are successful when they are not at all"
bad,After time the job takes a tole on your body. You have to work on Sundays which is wrong .
bad,very low pay was only paid $6.75 for being a floor supervisor
bad,Not enough pay at all for all the work that you do. They don't really care to promote you even though they said they would.
bad,I worked for Kroger for almost three years and it took me at least a year to become a cashier and it was taking at least another year just to do something else. At the store that i worked at the baggers would just walk around and take for ever putting things away. The managers would not care if the baggers did what ever they want and they did not care if they just sat there and did nothing while the cashier was bagging the customers own items or even sometimes if the customer was bagging there own items. I would not recommend kroger to any of my friends
bad,"Too much work, not enough pay, not enough people to do a job, expected super hero status never accomplished, every move micromanaged. Working for Fred Meyer Jewelers corporate office is like going to the dentist to have teeth pulled with no pain pills. Unless you enjoy being micromanaged because you are too immature to manage yourself, your breaks, your lunch times and your duties, then you will feel like a monkey in a cage with no way out. It is very difficult to get a promotion or even a move to another department because of red tape worse than the government."
bad,"hard work with very little pay,hard work.i would never work for krogers again"
bad,needs more caring and compassionate management concerning good employees
bad,"typical day at work is helping customer everyday, what i learned is always have good positive attitude , since ive started at ralphs everybody has been nice, now i feel like there not treating me with respect and there is one co worker who is calling me names, the most enjoyable day is seeing different people"
bad,I worked at kroger for seven year and the pay wasnt very good but i loved the fact that they allowed me to come from school and work on holidays and in the summer.
bad,"The Kroger Marketplace in Lewis Center Ohio is a terrible place to work. They make you feel like you are important and your family is important...but you soon realize that none of that is suppose to be important. They pay you minimum wage but expect you to work your but off for them. You may ask for time off but may not get it. The management is terrible and when you first start there they make you feel like you can come to them but you soon realize that you can't,."
bad,"A day at Kroger was extremely difficult, took management a long time to notice good potential. I found nothing enjoyable except getting along with some of the associates."
bad,I order baby food and make sure the shelves were full.
bad,A typical day at work is being degraded by management.
bad,Management is TERRIBLE and the pay is even worst. Workers of Ralph's work VERY hard and get paid terrible and get treated even worst. There's been customers who left the store when they were in the middle of the line with a cart full of groceries because of how management treats their staff on the sales floor in front of the customers. Very unprofessional and a miserable company to work for.
bad,it has been all down hill the last few years.hour cuts/less help/push' push' push. I think their moto is good is not good enough. you never here what you did right. but management will sure let you know if something is wrong. if some one asked me about getting a job for the m id tell them NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.
bad,"When I worked, I stay in one position for over 5 years that ispart of the reason why I left the company, especially the minority do not have a voice in the company."
bad,"Worst place to work when you're 16-20 years old. Kroger is pretty laid back, but if you're a young female it isn't really the job for you. It got me the car I have today for, so I'm greatful to had this job. Kroger just wasn't my cup of tea."
bad,"put items/foods in bags, get and pushed carts from parking lots return in the lobby."
bad,they did not pay there employees nearly enough. they do not offer any positive incentives about the job very hard for you to move up in company
bad,You are able to get hours but you are expected to work regardless of anything happening that is major or life changing
bad,I have nothing to say about this company. I was told that I had to quit my job if I wanted to go to my father in laws funeral. It was out of state and they didn't want to give me time off. Underpaid and Overworked!
bad,"Was not happy working here, working environment was horrible, co-worker morale was poor."
bad,"More people work in the afternoon shift than the morning shift. By the end of the day there are too many people working and not enough product to sell. You are required to work whenever, and where ever within the department and that is not fair. You need to be compensated for the wide knowledge of the department. Pay is very low for the amount of required work."
bad,"worked for kroger 2010, manager was disrespectful, and unprofessional,she ran the store into the ground"
bad,Bad hours
bad,"One of the most poorly supervised and managed organizations I ever experienced. No communication between management and employee level. employees are treated like children and not adults. Pay is only minimum wage, yet management expects top performance constantly. first year increase is only 10 cents."
bad,Managers are cruel. They don't care about any employees as people. I've never felt so worthless at a job.
bad,"management don't care about there employees, all they care about is the green that goes in there pocket when they screu the customewr and employee"
bad,i had a great time worked there 10 years helped people in floral dept bakery dept meat dept seafood dept all over
bad,I was at this job September - February. I was let go for No reason and thats what I was told by the manager.He told me that he did not need reason and was letting me go the day I got back from my 3 day suspension.I wasn't allowed to get a copy of my paper that I signed for my suspension because it was (Kroger Policy) but no one could show me it in the handbook. If you want to work for somebody work for the real Kroger b/c they are affiliated with krogers and that's why they don't want union because they do what they want to do. They are unorganized and I would never work for them again.
bad,this was a very place to work because i was a bagger and i was young so i basically got treated like dirt.
bad,"I’ve held several roles in management, including Human Resources, Risk Management, special assignments, and store management.  This company used to care about people.  But now, there is no work/life balance, no signs of appreciation, no positivity.  There are unrealistic expectations and threats.  They have terminated people in vast numbers across the company, people who were great, loyal, and in many different roles they worked hard to get to!  People who had 30 plus years!  Some divisions fired over 100 members of management.  We already work 50-60 hours a week and their plan is to cut more positions, meaning our 60 hour workweek will increase to even more, just to get the job done.  I’m talking about salaried management so no extra money for living at work!  I‘ve finally decided that I can’t continue working for a company who puts such little value on its employees.  Looking for a positive environment!"
bad,This is an alright to start to gain job experience. They hire people in easily though there is no room to move up nor is there any point in letting management know you would like to move up. I was told that when I started I would be moved up two weeks after and I never was even after mentioning it to management several times.
bad,Management lacks true management skills. They forget to pay you for working Holidays. Not much room for growth and an overall disgusting store. Maggots were all over the pet isle due to expired pet food. Employees were lazy and the shift leaders spent more time watching YouTube videos than working.
bad,Terrible culture and work environment.   Leadership puts company profits above all else including employee safety and health. Micromanaged and expected to make up holiday hours when the company was closed or a required meeting took you away from your normal 40+ hours in your store.
bad,"they only care about making money. workers are completely disposable and it shows. the company does not care about their employees, and extremely high expectations for very little pay. i strongly recommend against working for this company at all costs"
bad,Honestly on of the most educational places to work. With that said in my honest opinion one of the most strict and absurd places that does not take employee well being to heart. The management should be thoroughly revisited and reevaluated as it clearly lets you know if you are not wanted or welcomed as the direct management does not vet the new employees. You can see the absolute look of surprise and disgust in their face when they first lay their eyes on you. But if you want to learn about pharmaceuticals and being a great pharmacy technician this is the place to go. But I wouldn't count on being happy there or having longevity as an employee if you have a backbone or conscious. But if you can waive the two it's the right environment. ;-)
bad,"I worked there for a little over 2 years and have never seen such a bad work environment. Do yourself a favor and don't work at this Kroger store. I was made full time after the first 10 weeks of working there and my hours was dropped. I was working in the deli for my first 6 months and was treated unfair. By unfair I mean I was being written up for things I was never told about. i.e. Certain things I was suppose to clean that I had no idea about. When I came in on the days I had off the same things that I was getting written up for were not done and no one else would get written up. I moved to overnight grocery when I got fed up with the focused targeting that was against me from the Deli lead. Things didn't get better in overnight grocery. About a week after I started on the team the store manager called me over to an aisle and asked me what was wrong with the display. I said, ""I'm not sure I don't see anything wrong"". He started yelling at me asking me why the cans were fronted like they were. Which the way they were was the one I thought they were suppose to go pulling things to the front to make it look full. He responds by knocking all the cans onto the ground. Forcing me and the grocery lead, to pick them all back up off the ground. I should also like to inform you this was around 8 in the morning and there were customers in the store looking down the aisle trying to figure out what was going on. The writing up didn't fail to continue either I was being set up when conditioning they would push things back making it seem like I didn't do my job and they wouldn't ever allow"
bad,I worked at Kroger for about two years and ended up leaving due to the lack of pay. It was an easy job and it allowed me to progress in my public skills.
bad,They work you hard for your pay. The medical deductible is very high. No room for advancement unless management likes you. HR manager is unfair and unkind. Nothing positive about the layton dough plant just only when you clock out at the end of the shift
bad,"If you’re in high school or college it’s a great place to work because as a part timer you almost have more rights than a full timer employee. But getting full time is harder than heck. Company is very money driven for higher ups and not the little guys and there is obvious nepotism in the work place that can leave you feeling like an outcast. Was great for 1st 6 months while everything is fresh, but after that eitbecomes monotonous"
bad,This company has taught me a lot. Its all a money scheme. Money Money Money. Follow the money and push anybody out of the way in order to get it. Careful who you trust.
bad,death threats car bashings  rudeness to the extreme name calling racial slurs were all part of my Kroger experience.  Never again. Management didn't take an interest in maintaining any discipline but strung up its sacrificial lambs.
bad,Doesn't have any loayality to employees who has been with them for more than 20 years. Terrible management all stores are very under staffed real dont care about the customer just the bottom line
bad,"Kroger was a good place to work when i started ,but now it blows.A typical day begins with unloaded truck waiting for me up against the wall to tight.They pile the pallets real high and everything on the pallets not according to aisle.the warehouse can not stack properly.With products coming in damaged off the truck.The people are nosy,ignorant,and backstabbing,and do not care about anyone else but themselves if thats what it means to care only about yourself.The managers act as if the place is being run right if it even is.Good luck working here."
bad,I wouldn’t recommend anyone work for Kroger! They don’t pay you ANYTHING to have you work like a slave and have rude managers. I chose to work here thinking that would be a great start but I genuinely despised going to work there.
bad,I used to like the job when I first started but when the good manager retired the worst of worst of managers took over it was the pits of H.e.L.L. wouldn’t work here again if they paid me 18.00 an hour. With really good benefits included ...
bad,"I work for kroger for over 15 years.  In 2017, the company decided to get rid of more than 30 newly hired pharmacist. Also, they cut hours of staff pharmacists down to 32 hours weekly"
bad,was offered a part time position with opportunity for full time. Change in management and store policies were made and the opportunity for full time was taken away.
bad,Kroger does not care about its customers any more than they care about there employees it's all about  cutting  back  and saveing payroll! Getting  8hrs work  in 4hrs time!
bad,I didnt think when I first started it would be as bad as it was. Honestly between the cutting of hours and staff. It's almost impossible to get stuff done on a good basis.
bad,"I had started right when I turned 15. At first, everyone was easy going, and I got a long with everyone greatly. Then, after about 2 months of working there, everyone had turned on me. It was to the point that I didn't get paid my full check when I worked, or I was just completely screwed over. I didn't even have any benefits on top of that, so it made things worse. When everyone was slacking on the job, I was the only one working without any special assistance. Eventually, I had to just quit. I was being racially profiled, and that did it for me."
bad,Poor management lack of care for employees. Can make up things that are not true and work there employees to death and don’t care about it. Would not work for them.
bad,"The pay was horrible, the managers were horrible, and the hours were horrible. This is the worst job ever, they cut my hours all the time which means I couldn’t make any money."
bad,I worked my tail off for Kroger!  You don’t get benefits for a year.  I worked so hard I broke my foot and then I had to fight tooth and nail to get compensated.   Absolutely horrific place to work
bad,Kroger has no work life balance they expect you to start off part time and wait around for us to call you to give you hours. There are many other companies who offer better benefits and better pay.
bad,Management doesn't treat everyone the same. When you are asked for your opinion and if it isn't what they like you are treated differently. When a manager doesn't like you they treat you different and you get picked on.
bad,"If you like working like a dog for an unappreciative, semi racist and unorganized company.. then this is for you. No teamwork, expect to do a lot of big trucks on your own. Always have company/corporate visits but no one listens to the cons you're facing at work and need help changing. They just want to make sure their money flow is still going. This company like most could care less about their employees.  . Only good pay if you work for there for 60 years of your life. You think they would realize that they drive good workers away when they treat you like a slave and let the horrible workers get away with everything. Unfortunately, this is one the only companies that will work with me while I'm in school for my degree.  I hope to leave asap, this is no place for me"
bad,"Run from this job"
bad,"When I first started working there it was okay, but as the years went on we were always understaffed to an extreme. We rarely had baggers or help and management was always trying to give what few workers they had more and more tasks. In the end, I was a bagger, customer service worker, cashier, and occasionally manager, all for the pay of a cashier."
bad,"Hostile work environments with violent staff that management would do nothing about. We were worked to the bone and often asked to work doubles, or to close at 12 that night and open by 6 the next day. Terribly understaffed and not easy to get time off or scheduled hohrs during your availability. I was worked full time as a part time worker for months and given no compensation. Would never work there again."
bad,Kroger expects miracles from people that they pay 7.50 an hour.. used to be a decent fun job not anymore..spend most of my time training people that will work there for 2-3 months until they find a better paying job which isn't hard at all
bad,The store is beautiful but could use different managers. It's too many chiefs and not enough Indians one will tell u something and another one will ask why no communication.
bad,I worked overnight at Kroger for about two years. The work and co-workers was straightforward and almost enjoyable if you get into the right headspace of organization. The problem was when a manager was transferred from another store. He would borderline harass the staff by yelling in their faces and on a nightly basis someone would get into an argument with him. Several of us complained to other managers and nothing to my knowledge was done about the situation. I decided it was not a good fit for me anymore so I got a different job. It really just boiled down to overall poor management communication.
bad,Underpaid and overworked. The management is horrible. Your opinions do not matter. They are also racially motivated. It is not about your work ethic and they are losing really good workers
bad,"Over worked and under paid. "
bad,"I was working there making under minimum wage. I told them I had work related experience so I can get a raise. I waited 4 months and still no raise. I contacted my union members representative and the General manager numerous of times but no one helped me. And to make matters worse, they didn't work with my schedule. They told me they couldn't accommodate me and they knew I got a newborn baby at home"
bad,"I worked for kroger for almost 5 years and left much happier knowing i didnt have to go back to this horrible place. Bad management, way to high of expectations, no work life balance, garbage employees who dont do there joband get rewarded for it.never again would i consider this place for employment."
bad,"I started at only 4 hours a week. Then my hours went up,  then down. I am back down to only 4 hours a week. From the month I started there, til now. I have only grossed a little over $3700! I have a 17 year old emotionally challenged son. And 2 dogs. I am barly surviveing."
bad,I worked produce department fulltime was hired by kroger corp to do 123 visa card ....I won a 40k car from sweepstakes and was fired and went down 16 per week...
bad,"This is just a job for when you are in high school, once out of high school try to get out of kroger. Some of the people are nice to work with can make lasting friends."
bad,Will never work at this company again. They treat you like servants. There is nothing else to say. Upper management do not appreciate what the people do when they work. We are the backbones of the company not upper management.
bad,"You can work there for a very long time without making what other retailer start paying at. I started years ago on minimum wage and half a decade later I was still making less than $11 an hour. Vacation time is nice but if you call off sick expect to be harrassed over it, I've even been told I was faking it even though I call off less than 3 times a year on average."
bad,I got bait n switched at the interview to a different position. The lady flat out lied to me about the pay and I wound up in a hostile work environment. I hated just about everything about their organization and management that went out of their way to mess with me. I wouldn't recommend them to anyone.
bad,"There are no bright spots working in management. Upper management, associates and customers will cause PTSD. By far the worst job i ever had. For starters there is no work life balance period. Upper management only takes care of the people they like and they were bias, racist all the above. Get ready to put your running shoes on as soon as you get to work  i used to log 15000-20000 steps a day. In Georgia its a union based work environment so you know what that means associates get away with alot. They constantly miss work, come in late and argue back with management. There will be no respect for you as ASM. Im not sure how it is dealing with customers in other states but in Georgia its the equivalent plunging a toilet so you there is a bunch of blank involved. They cut pay for ASM's when i was there and gave us more on our plate to deal with. I had at least 6 different store managers during my time there and could only deal with one. Other ASM's are cool to work with but they claim to hate the job but they stay with kroger. Working there will weaken your spirit. Im much more pleased with my new job. If you love yourself find a different job."
bad,"Kruger isn't for you if:"
bad,"-physically demanding, expect bruises."
bad,The environment was nice. The people u get to know are great.  The employees are nice for the most part.  Management needs to be worked on and fixed. Be careful who you trust. Just a lesson in life to live by.
bad,"Well first, I put on my application that I was ALLERGIC TO CINNAMON and management placed me in the Starbucks located inside the store. And when I got done with all my training, I was told that us Starbucks employees must try all our drinks for the season so we can explain them to the customers. Understandable. Except I’m allergic to cinnamon. My manager shoved a pumpkin spiced latte in my face and demanded me to try it. After about 15 minutes of explaining that I’m allergic and I mentioned that DURING the hiring process and ON my resume, she told another manager that I have to leave the Starbucks and must work in a different department. They moved me to apparel. Where I recurved NO training whatsoever. And then I left for SCHOOL. I did the correct paperwork for a school leave. When I came back, THEY SAID THEY FIRED ME FOR NOT SHOWING IP!!! POOR MANAGEMENT!!!!"
bad,"Not a good company! Division/District management micromanages everyone to the point that it drives away good people. You are criticized over and over and receive very little praise and never a ""thank you"". The core values are nothing more than wall decorations. They preach ""uplift"" while tearing you down. There is no life-work balance. They have increased starting pay by over $5,000/year because they cannot keep managers. If you want to work for a company that belittles you and will work you until you have nothing else, then Kroger is the place for you."
bad,"Management at Owens (Kroger) was horrible.  They only concerned themselves with making a few people happy.  No appreciation for hard work and loyalty.  My customer care was noted to be top of the field, which came from customer reviews, but management only cared about the money not happy customers.  Bad attitudes (which should have been left at the door before they walked in) were evident and really reflected on the whole shopping experience for customers and employees.  Just overall I could not tolerate the disrespect given by the management at Kroger."
bad,"There is too much to do and not enough time to do it. Management are lazy and don't care. They are just looking for someone to blame. Horrible environment, awful culture, employee turnover is very high for a reason."
bad,"If your over 50 you'll get treated like a red headed step child. You'll get stuck doing the stuff no one wants to do. Management plays favorites. The culture is immature. It doesn't matter that you can run circles around the younger co-workers. Do yourself a favour, go apply somewhere else. I quit as soon as I lined up another job."
bad,Overall Kroger was a good learning experience. Management was good and bad it depended on the manager. There was lots of inconsistency. The pay was ok but benefits were good. If you do get to move up you are over worked and never really appreciated. Kroger is only about its customers not it own people.
bad,"The managers are POOR LEADERS talk behind your back, the person they talk to comes back & tell you, it is a hot mess, most of the people there has been there for 20 plus years complain All day, All the time but don’t want to leave."
bad,They hire department heads that are incompetent. They let customers treat employees however they want and when you explain to a customer the policy and procedures they override them right in front of you
bad,Run as fast as you can. DO NOT WORK FOR KROGER!!! It was the worst work experience I have ever had. They treat everyone terribly from hourly associates to salaried management.
bad,"A typical day was fast paced."
bad,"They have raised the copay on perception price 3  in less then a year, took our life insurance away, work hours suck, management doesn't  care about it employees"
bad,This site is a joke.wouldnt post what I wrote until I removed all of the negative things I wrote.whats the use of having this if u can't post the truth..do not work at store 129.the grocery manager is horrible
bad,Kroger is fairly one sided and the people who work at customer service always lying to customers like the system down and it’s no opportunity for advancement. Paulette and Lisa are the main problems of everything they never wrong and they talk behind people back and lie on you to the manager about what you did and what you didn’t do just to cause you to get in some trouble and they all gather together and talk amongst each other but when a bagger do it it’s a problem they do not follow the lot schedule regularly they are inconsistent at best
bad,"a typical day would be stocking cigarettes, serving the customers. Keeping the environment in which i worked clean, and making sure all papers are filled out correctly."
bad,"No education, training or support within organization.  Fast pace environment.  Hired for one position and ended up doing the position of five.  Not only are you a cashier, you are a bagger, a supervisor, a manager and stock person.  Supervisors are not trained, or educated, for their positions.  No career advancement at my store location."
bad,At first I was excited to have the job but after the initial probation period I was treated very poorly. I progressed from just simple tasks to contributing to several of the daily tasks. I volunteered to go to the closing shift to help balance work and home. It was at this time I was loaded down with a multitude of other assignments that prior to moving to closing shift were completed during the day while the area had the staff to complete. I was made to feel inferior and worthless when I couldn't keep up on my own to complete tasks that normally took 2-3 people to do.
bad,"I really don't want to go through talking about this again but I gotta. It's been awhile so I'll go from memory. I put food in bags and when it was time I went outside and pushed the carts to their correct area. I learned that I never want to work in a job like that ever again. Management was something else, don't remember too much but I did not like it at all. Never really noticed the culture at all. The hardest part was bagging because it got so boring after hours of doing it. The one thing I can say I enjoyed was pushing the carts, I got to feel the fresh air outside and get some exercise while I was at it."
bad,"Kroger doesn’t care about the employees,they don’t even give raises as promised. They only care about the money and front end. The review are correct."
bad,Too many wannabe chiefs and not enough Indians and hours to go round. Always pulled form department to help check then get yelled at for not getting your work done. Over time is a nono even if theres still work to do. If your hurt or sick they dont care even when they know of food people working while throwing up in trash can and going back to work. No real training theres never time sink or swim. Most things are overlooked if your a slacker but the hard workers get stepped on. Unless your lucky enough to get locked into 40 hrs but they make sure it rarely happens and will drop you to 32-38 hrs before it happens. There are rules but its ok if your in with the boss' then its over looked.
bad,"At first working in clicklist was easy, simple and fun and then management changed all the rules around making it seem like it was your fault for grocery out of stocks. Then after transferring to a different department drug GM, it was cool until new management came in and turned things around. Good luck if you plan on working at Kroger, management not fair and they don't work with your school schedule especially if you're an online student. Don't trust anyone, period!"
bad,"It was a learning experience about the industry I could have lived without. I worked in a department with four people, but only two of us were productive. The other two were supervisory employees and store management did not care. The two of us that did work, worked hard and were made to feel inadequate by our department supervisor and were threatened with disciplinary actions, regularly.  Hostile work environment."
bad,"I worked for the fuel center, and it was awful.  They never wanted to give us our breaks if we were alone, you had to beg the store to send anyone down. We were told to put a sign up and go to starbucks to use the restroom, but no one would say that officially.  I held the title of fuel manager, but was not paid as a dept head. I was responsible for the paperwork, schedule, everything that a manager did, but they refused to give me the salary for it. The fuel health care was a joke. The so called dental insurance covered absolutely nothing."
bad,Dont become a department head...corporate will make your life miserable. They think they can run the stores from behind a computer. It just gets worse and worse every year
bad,Pretty awful place. Management is non existent and nobody really cares about anything. They just walk around gossiping and playing favorites. Management changes often.
bad,"Save yourself some time and work literally anywhere else. I’m telling you, it’s not worth it. You are unionized so I guess that’s something. If you like spending your life at work with little compensation then this is the job for you. If you dislike your children take this job, you’ll never see them again. If you enjoy back breaking labor and being treated as less than, then what are you waiting for? Kroger has the job for you."
bad,"Pay sounds good, but when you factor the number of unknown hours that you are expected to work on a work week, especially when you are required to close on one day, and open the next morning, and minimum hours are 50+ weekly, the pay very rapidly gets diluted.  External employees are not welcome in management by other cut throat management employees."
bad,"The  Kroger that I’m currently working at is very, very poorly."
bad,People who work at Kroger are subject to stressful working conditions low salary and too much work put on them. I worked in Meat department bad conditions
bad,Corporate and management doesn't care for their workers at all to the point were most workers are overworked and under compensated. The last 3 mangers I have had in the past 2 years couldn't figure out how to schedule at all. at one point I was working a 40 hour + week on split days off and a mix of graveyard shift and morning shifts leaving little to no time to rest after your shift.
bad,"What make Kroger stressful place to work at is the mangers. There were a lot of favoritism. You can't use headphones while working but some people were allowed to. Sweatpants are not allowed but again few people wore them and no one will say anything until you do it then it's forbidden. Disrespectful mangers they won't appreciate you no matter how hard you work. THE SCHEDULE IS NOT FLEXIBLE. They will tell you it is, bit it's really not."
bad,"The managers expect more than is necessary of a minimum wage, new hire. Let alone someone who has been working there for a while will more than likely never make it past being an assistant manager. They are very unprofessional and quite rude to their employees. If someone doesn't do their job, then they expect you to puck up for them."
bad,"The only good parts about this job were the nice regulars who showed genuine gratitude towards our service and my hardworking coworkers. Other than that, pay is garbage, a lot of associate theft going on, awful lack of professionalism, management constantly neglected the needs of particular departments and did not make any effort to hire more people when clearly some departments were horribly understaffed."
bad,"This is not the job for you they what part time not full time people part time they  push you around they big book on"
bad,"Management refuses to accept phone calls for absences and reports them all as no call no shows."
bad,"Working for this company has been the worst professional experience I have had since entering the work force. I spent over a year at this company and it got progressively worse as time went on. I received less than one day of training before being thrown into my position because our store was short staffed due to such a high turnover rate (I would soon find out why this was the case). Management will NEVER have your back, be willing to help should any problems arise or be understanding if anything should happen in your life outside of work. Although I had awesome coworkers (we honestly had to keep each other going most days), this job did not contribute to enhancing my professional skills in any way. I have absolutely no regrets about leaving this company."
bad,Suspected to do everything in very short time. Management is quick to report if you did something minor wrong. Like not staying to finish job when they wont even give you more hours to finish.
bad,In one year they have made me feel horrible. They would lie to your face and treat you as if your always wrong. They don't show appreciation and understanding of the work issues. They make you feel hated and a disappointment. They are lazy and does not know how to act professionally.
bad,"Years as a PT (part time), Only busy during holidays, No time for family, Constantly Running to hit daily percentage. Poor management, if you are not considered a favorite employee, expect no help."
bad,Getting to work it was always stressful due to the disorganization. Was harassed by management and no action was taken. The workplace was tense and unwelcoming.
bad,"Working for the company for 4 years I have seen some pretty awful things. Plus, your hours are based on seniority so the newer you are, the more hours you get that no one wants. Or, if you are part time, anyone full time has more seniority even if you have been there longer. They tell you hours are flexible which is a lie. It’s a union company but the union doesn’t seem to care about the employees so it’s a waste of time and money.  The more you promote the more personal life you have to sacrifice."
bad,Everyday that I would go into work I dreaded doing anything. Every manager that works there was rude or didn't know what they were doing. They don't care about anyone and will treat you like your'e worthless even if you've been working there for more than 5 or 10 years. The hardest part about the job is dealing with how the management will screw you next. MY most enjoyable moments were when i left for the day and knew that i was done with Kroger for that day
bad,I've worked here twice now and I would not recommend this job to anyone. The management style is atrocious and they don't care enough about their staff. They don't pay any mind to your availability when making the schedule. They work you on holidays with no holiday pay unless you've been there for a year.
bad,"This is a Cut throat micromanaged company. They are All about numbers, quality needs improvement. Makes new unethical policies that continues to produce a toxic culture."
bad,"I worked here for 7 years in Mooresville indiana and it was the worst experience. "
bad,Terrible hours company doesn’t care about employees and only cares about what the customer has in their pockets. 10+years working for this company and glad to be out of there.
bad,"No comments"
bad,"poor store management will not take care of issues and nothing is confidential and will not fix things that are broken, too many clicks in head of store employees and managers, does not change fryer oil like should be, and they don't go by guidelines in deli"
bad,Horrible place to work especially if you're young. Managers talk to their employees anyway and treat them like children. Unfair scheduling and conflict  amongst coworkers.
bad,"I enjoyed solitary duties like cart wrangling where I could simply listen to music and do my thing without having to interact with people too much or handle food, however one of the managers was hugely micromanaging how the cart-pushers do their job and made me stop doing it.  Led to me having a workplace injury and subsequently quitting due to minimum wage workers (rightfully) not having enough craps to give to bother throwing out broken containers.  Also, they totally ignored my request for a schedule change despite it not being optional and led to trouble in my personal life.  Typical of a large corporation."
bad,"I would not work for this again. management is awful to the employees. Department leads do not like to work so they make everyone do their work. Not at all a good company,"
bad,"Workers comp is a joke. Work life balance is ridiculous. If you have to take time off for any reason, you get major side eye. If you call in sick, even with a dr note, you get yelled at. It was a good fit at first, but I would not recomend this job to anyone long term"
bad,"Worst job I've ever had, there were 5 other people I started with and now there all gone. If you don't get 100% on there standards you get fired. I wouldn't recommend this job to anybody I'd rather do construction to be honest."
bad,management was terrible overall reason i left the turnover rate was high people were leaving left and right i dont recommend this job to anyone with a life this is a time consuming job and stressful to boot
bad,"Kroger was prone to change schedule without letting the scheduled person know., had unequal treatment of employees, and would never promote others to a higher position."
bad,"I worked in at Kroger for approximately 3 months back in 2016.   The pay was bad but I thought I would at least get a decent amount of hours.  That was not the case.   I worked in the cheese shop and was constantly harassed and discriminated against by my supervisor.  Other staff in that department were witness to it as well.  I addressed my concerns with management and human resources, but to my disappointment, nothing was done.  I ended up quitting and have gone there to shop in the past, only to hear staff vent their frustration due to low pay and low hours.  Most staff have to work 2 jobs just to make ends meet.  "
bad,Very stressful. Lack of help to accomplish job. Upper level leadership terrible. Cut troat. Back stabbing though out company. Would not suggest krogers as a place to work. There's no family life. Work all holidays @ weekends.
bad,"went from 40 hrs per week to 30 hrs per, no longer salary but hourly punching a clock, no sick time, very little overlap of pharmacist help, have to plan vacations up to a yr in advance , in 2019 loss of 32 hrs personal time, no paid holidays,  and past losses include loss of stock options, pension, went from 2 bonuses to 1"
bad,"New executives are ruining what good culture Nashville had, you will see the company continue to struggle for help. Kroger never had issues staffing store until recently and it will get worse, the new management groups will not stay once they see what the job really entails!"
bad,Wanted a part time job in between school they had on organization and scheduled me for full time. managers wouldn't listen when I complained about it and only wanted to talk to me to put there work on to me instead. managers were mean and unresponsive if it didn't effect them in anyway. was given little training or insight as they threw me on to someone else's post alone.
bad,"Management is a chaotic mess.  Lack of communication and education is more than clear.  They really need to work on both hiring and retaining employees.  As it stands, they're just awful.  Would recommend avoiding them."
bad,Not even a chance for a pay raise at this position and it felt like i was a slave to the entire management team. would not recommend working her e to the worst of my enemies.
bad,"Worked for this company for many years and I loved it, but now they are struggling to make money and the employees and customers are suffering. They recently let several pharmacist go and made almost all of their assistant managers go to 32 hours per week with a 20% pay cut.  "
bad,"If you are going for your first job its good. Otherwise its horrible. They teach nothing, and the emplyees are all self absorbed and rude. I still hate to go there because of the service provided. If you are looking for a happy workplace environment keep looking buddy."
bad,The store I work at had terrible management. They never called me by the right name even though I always had a name tag on. They were rude and very arrogant.
bad,Kroger wasn't a horrible place to work and I still continue to shop at Kroger stores but my experience was less than satisfactory. My department in the Deli was hostile due to the other workers being frustrated about the high turn over at the store and thus treated every new person like they didn't matter. I also attempted to pick up hours and learn other department skills in an attempt to be more of an asset to the company and was shut down at every turn. This left me feeling that there was no hope for advancement.
bad,The manger has no clue what shes doing and has to ask other workers what to do. A few great co worker other then tha the whole experience in gernal not good at all.
bad,"While working at Kroger, I was treated fairly by more co-workers but it  was my managers that mis-treated me. I did my jib and worked very hard every day that I was there. I never had any complaints."
bad,"I wrote a lengthy and detailed review of Fred Meyer Jewelers Corp. Office in Portland, Oregon, and so did many current and former employees, only to find that they've removed their ""Indeed"" profile and linked it to the larger Kroger profile. It's just like them. Hide behind the walls of the big brother and pretend like they're not the worst in the industry. If you just delete it, they'll go away. Likely due to the large amount of negative reviews and employees calling out the insane amount firings, fear culture and abuse at the FMJ corporate offices. Under pressure to quite the truth? "
bad,"It wasn't the people ( co-workers) at Kroger's, it was the management team or so called TEAM, they don't take account of any of the ideas from employees and act as if  the employees are beneath them. If it wasn't for the customers and employees there wouldn't be a Kroger's for them to work and they might want to remember that."
bad,Typical you started part-time they do not hire full-time employees you have to beg to become full-time your told when you're hired at minimum wage that based on work experience they may pay you more but they never do pump your head up with lead position we will train you but there are no training classes that you can take to be certified basically promise you the moon work you to death and then never deliver all the leaves are lifers with bad attitudes and management doesn't want to be bothered with you
bad,"I was a high school student who they overworked and consistently scheduled on my unavailable hours. Sometimes, they would even schedule me during school hours even though they were fully aware of my status as a high school student."
bad,"They have a program called feed the human spirit. It included everyone. The company tries to uplift the employees, but they do not care that they have families. It is a miscible place to work. The company does not follow union seniority. You have to fight for that is yours. You get blamed and in trouble if something else did not do their job."
bad,I would never work for Kroger again. They overworked the staff they had. They would try to fire full time people to be replaced with part time staff. Management border lined being bullies. I hated the time I spent there.
bad,"After working for Kroger for a year they dangled a promotion in my face just to get me to work harder and then brought in someone else to take the position."
bad,The worst job I ever had in my life ! They don't care about there employees at all !!!! I was treated like  .... Whole management got changed since I left . I don't even shop anymore in Marion Kroger.
bad,My manager was also very short tempered and almost got into a fight with an employees father.  He also get overwhelmed quickly and brings it out on everyone else including customers.   When I announced I was leaving he replied in a group text with everyone from the front end with “didn’t know you were leaving lol peace” so he clearly doesn’t value his employees.
bad,"I worked in the pharmacy as a technician. We had a great staff but I still wouldn't at all recommend this job unless you were just trying to get some quick healthcare experience. "
bad,"No benefits, lowest pay for doing some of the most works. Management doesn't know what theyre doing. Only good thing about the place is some of the people you meet."
bad,"Worst place to work unless you are absolutely desperate for mediocre benefits. malicious and repulsive ways of management are encouraged by company. Anyone who has worked for the company more than a year or so knows exactly how distorted they are under the fake smiles they literally threaten employees with daily. I watched the cycle of FM's twisted ways over the course of years, many stores, and many different management teams. I would never let my children or family members work for them, run far away and work for costco etc if you really want a retail grocery job worth your time."
bad,Current employee @ Compton camera in trucks point system that’s sucks management doesn’t work with u there out 2 get u ur just a # dental ins sucks ..
bad,"The management there is horrible and does NOT care about you or know your name, they are no-shows for interviews, they do not care about your well being or family issues and why you might be late, they are a horrible company to work for"
bad,"The customers are rude, the management is rude, they'll overwork you, they'll tell you you're in line to move up and then not follow through. All you need to work at kroger is to be alive. Might be an okay first job if you never want to work again, because if I worked there as a teenager I would have given up on humanity."
bad,"This was another temp to hire job, the pay was ok got paid every week that was a plus, the training process was terrible, I assisted customer's with their Kroger plus points"
bad,"This Company would be more enjoyable if the management was better I loved the company but hated the management. They treated me horribly. I been cursed at disrespected, put down, treat like a flunky or slave. I hated working there pushing carts. They treat there workers horribly. That's why I quit. Its only a matter of time before a lot more people quit. I would not recommend this job to anyone that has a college degree or high school diploma."
bad,"management horrible horrible hours horrible customers only accept if in desperate need of weekly paycheck dirty, old people everywhere not even exaggerating"
bad,Other employees are very rude.  Act like they never see you.   Even this way with customers.  Managers are the same.   Kroger expects you to be a work horse with very little pay.  Will pull you in other depts. To work because they dont want to hire enough people.  More work less people. Looks good on store manger come bonus time. Would not work back at kroger if they paid me 50.00 an hour.  Not that they would give you many hours anyway.
bad,Worked my butt off for Kroger and was treated rudly by people that have been there for years. I would not recommend that anyone apply here because theybwont hire you for 11 an hour good luck getong 9.00 an hour.
bad,You can do better at a fast food restaurant then working as this place. Managers never around and dont care about their customers. They’re the cause of endless drama and horrible at time management. They are also extremely forgetful.
bad,Was placed under gossiping management whom attacked me for uniform guidelines that they failed to follow. Various department managers put off work until the last moment.
bad,"My experience at Kroger has been pretty rough. The pay is bare minimum, benefits are good though. It seems to be a trap. Alot of people have been there for 10 or more years and have the same quality of life as when they first started. Not all stores are the same from what im hearing but if you have a bad store manager you should just transfer if it is within your means to do so, I am sure some people get ahead in Kroger but mostly its an inside game, If they like you, youll advance if not, they will henhouse you to death, Stay away."
bad,I enjoyed my time that I worked at Kroger.
bad,"Poor pay.  Similar companies pay st least $5 more an hour.  The work load is too high for the pay.  You will get a cost of living raise and that's it's.  It's a ""Springboard"" job.  Use it for what it is.  Management is weak.  Bunch of ""Yes Men"".  They provide just about zero training and they will promise to help train you but they won't.  They also have an extremely high turnover rate."
bad,"It is ridicules how fast they expect you to work in the warehouse as an order selector. I would literally run as fast as I could for 8 - 10 hours a day and still not reach their time quotas. I never wasted a second to rest or even say a word to anyone while working and I was still let go for being too slow. I even lost 10 pounds in one month from all the strenuous labor. I'm not out of shape either, I've been exercising and working out for years. And every other job I had I was praised for being a very productive and fast worker. They usually hire about 12 people at a time and keep maybe one of them."
bad,No real hands on training
bad,Please don't do it. I would not recommend anyone working at Kroger. You will be over worked for sure and you will get other people's shifts dropped on you of which you have to choice because there are not enough workers to begin with so you will end up with three four peoples work for just you to do.
bad,Working at Kroger was not the best experience. I had a manager that made the job extremely stressful. Constantly yelling and making you feel very uncomfortable.
bad,They are unfair with the full time people they constantly complain about most everything your not allowed to call in sick unless you get a doctors note even if only miss one day
bad,The typical work day was not bad but of course some days are better than others. Most of the day were stressful to an extent but not to overwhelming. The issues were manageable and most of the time easy to come to a solution.
bad,"Punch in bag groceries, customer service, and retrieve carts."
bad,Fast paced critical of other plays favorites to.others let's them.have days off or hrs wanted have clicks and they hard on you if you work expect more than should be allowed
bad,"Poor management, everyone wants to be in charge and does not work as a team. Managers blame employees for poor sales and customer complaints. Management assumes that everyone will do whatever they ask without question, and will not listen if the employee has concerns or complaints."
bad,"Disregarding the fact that kroger no matter the branch is low staffed, workers are tasked with the job of five people regularly. The pay is terrible for the work put out and management prefers speaking through people as opposed to speaking to you. In a reasonable world, management wouldn't be to busy to speak to it's workers, especially the hiring managers and human resources department. The job is bright and promising from afar but it's not what it looks to be and most workers including myself treat the job as a jail sentence as opposed to a place of employment. Lastly, hiring managers prey on your insecurities and woes. Mentioning financial need or hardships seems to give them license tp exploit said hardships. And this is not just one bad experience I've worked at two kroger branches. It's just a terrible place to work."
bad,Kroger is a good job for high school aged individuals. It teaches you work ethic and how to communicate with the public. Many roles can be played at kroger which you learn many different skills.
bad,I literally try to avoid shopping at Kroger because I feel like it is a sweat shop.  I felt bad for my employees. Corporate environment.  Upper management telling middle management to tell the workers to hit their goals.  The majority of the employees are miserable and can't make any type of living working here.
bad,"One reason I loved working there, the polite and loyal customers we had. They were what made me stay for so many years..."
bad,"Front end is the worst department to join. "
bad,"The biggest problem was they asked me if I wanted to work union or not. I thought working union was a good thing. You have to work 90 days before you get a union rep, but you start paying dues right away. At 88 days they let 17 people go. I found out that we were all union employees. Apparently, union is bad at Kroger."
bad,"Competition, enjoying aid an assist customers. Employ like family. Gathering on special holidays, exchanging, gifts. Sharing the pain, grieve together. Everyone works asa team."
bad,I hated working here in the summer time. I never got enough hours and I didn't think i was getting paid enough. I never learned anything new and I hated my manager because she left everything for me to do for her.
bad,"Stood at Self Checkout 8 hrs/day"
bad,"At first I thought it was an ok job, but the people that work there are mean, cranky, and don't seem to really care about you as a person. Very stressful and quick paced. They are always under staffed, due to people quitting or not showing up to work, and you are forced to compensate for their losses. Definitely do not recommend this job to anyone who doesn't like to have to pay and make up for others mistakes, and to people who don't want to have to bag 7 lanes in the busiest part of the day by yourself."
bad,"If you'd like to be treated like a 2nd class human being and be paid poorly then sign right up. Favoritism, managers that expect you to be a robot, this job just flat out sucks"
bad,Kroger brings new meaning to Skeleton crew....I have seen people walk away from my deli because there were not enough people to server them.  So dont work there
bad,"Upper Management is disconnected from the employees. They don't want to deal with problems. At Kroger you can come in late,call off as much as you want and nothing is done."
bad,Not enough help. Store manager ruining the store..........that's about it. I would recommend a manager level change for that store. Oh well. Doesn't matter now.
bad,when i worked at Kroger it was not the best job ever i was told that there would be a review every 6 month. But this never occurred. And i was left at minimum wage indefinitely.
bad,"no upward movement."
bad,"I do not recommend working here. Cleanliness is poor, passive aggressive co-workers (almost like high school), managers do not care and would rather deal with drama than that of getting rid of it, and you learn that even salt looks like sugar."
bad,"I was harassed and bullied relentlessly by coworkers. Write ups for no reason. This has been by far my worst experience. It's not worth all of the trouble and literal *** they put you through. For some people it works out well, just make sure to be besties with management."
bad,"the atmosphere was ok.  It was an ok starting out job while in High-school.  I did not enjoy the mangement, nor did I like overworking with little breaks.  I wasn't very flexible and I spent less time with my family"
bad,depending on what you expect it could be a good place. if you like to follow everything by the book it will be a great place for you. if you think outside the box and try new things to make improvements don't expect advancement
bad,"In the one year I worked for Kroger I learned the only people the company serves is themselves. If you are not corporate or top management, expect to be overworked and underpaid. The management is awful; they put their work burden on lower level employees and rarely give you credit."
bad,"After 15 years of service. the company deleted my job, then they took my 15 years of service and started me back as a checker with min pay. They told me I had no senority. It was very devastating and life changing. I wouldn't recommend this company to anyone ever!!"
bad,"The managament does not care about their employees. They play favorites and unless you suck up to management you are automatically on the ""bad"" list. I was constantly tormented by coworkers on a day to day basis. I was the victim of rumors and even when I reported my concerns to management they did nothing. This is not a satisfactory or safe place to work. You can not confide in anyone without repercussions coming back to you."
bad,Through the few years that i was employed through Kroger Co. I seen that all employees fall victim to the union that our store was under inwhich all employees whom have been there for sometime were granted advancements and threatened positions that they could use however they wanted involving being late to work practically every single day and waste countless hours socializing with other employees without punishment.
bad,Whatever you do don't work for Kroger bad pay and bad hours. i was a grocery clerk and i got put in deli in stand or just be moving around the whole store. bad place to be
bad,"I wouldn't recommend that anyone over the age of 25 with no recent grocery store experience work history. Because you're going to start at the bottom (7.65-8.25). They play games with your hours, like for example you have to work a total of 12 weeks consistently to get moved up to Full-Time (35+ hours per week).So they'll schedule you to work between 35+ hours for 10 weeks then knock you down to 30 hours just so you won't get moved up to Full-Time. Because if you get moved up to full-time you get bumped up 20 more cent. And when your yearly anniversary comes up you get a quarter. Kroger's is somewhat out of touch with reality when it comes to their employees but hey you do get what you pay for (low pay for lazy bs employees)"
bad,"Absolutely disgraceful as far as the culture and attitude towards associates. When asked a question by a superior, your answer is just an excuse. Kroger refuses to see the truth. This company lies to itself to get the results it wants. Countless programs are rolled out that only contradict the last and previous programs. This company wastes so much money when all it needs to do is pay its associates. It's no wonder the customers are shopping elsewhere and retention is so low. We treat our people very poorly."
bad,"My work days are very stressful. (It seems like most other ""good"" employees feel the same way; rapid, constant turnover at this store.) I feel continually harassed and insulted, most especially by the top two management team members.  There are however, a number of fellow employees who look down at me and even insult me on account of the position I fill.  There are an insufficient number of workers in the utilities department and management seems totally unwilling to - even obstinate toward - correcting the situation.  This particular department is continually treated so badly though, it is almost impossible to find anyone who wants to work in it.  Ex.  This department (I have been told) is allocated 204 hours a week. Currently we have only 2 employees in it! Both of us were in other departments previously.  When previous employees suddenly quit their job both of us were approached and pressured into moving to this department (We were told that we needed to move over here or consider leaving the company.)  I myself, feel like my job is constantly being threatened, though they of course never take such action.  Safety is also a huge issue; especially in our department.  We constantly work with dangerous chemicals.  Only a couple of months ago did management post a few of the MSDS's for a few of the chemicals used in this and other departments.  They have refused to provide safety equipment that I have needed for work that I feel like I have been forced into doing.  They have even set up very dangerous situations for employees: (Ex. my coworker is autistic.  They had him using"
bad,Since Kroger is a unionized company you get paid very little in comparison to other places like Walmart. The managers were ok honestly but the problem really boiled down to the amount of work you have to do and the customers you have to deal with on a day to day basis isn't worth the paltry amount of money Kroger will pay you.
bad,Kroger made me sign a paper when I was hired on that stated that I CANNOT make more than $7.25 ever. I was promoted and worked there for well over a year and I never got a raise. I wasn't allowed to because they make people sign that paper as a requirement to be hired.
bad,"Lack of Team, management always Passes the buck and the duties to lower ""class"" while writing people up for Silly things like forgetting the Trash one in the booth."
bad,"A typical day of work consisted of filling the meat case, wrapping, making product and cleaning. I learned customer service and meat cutting and safety. The management was not very good at all. Very unhappy workplace culture. Hardest part of the job was working with certain people. Most enjoyable part of the job was the customers."
bad,"This might be the worst warehouse I've ever worked at.  After two days of training people are put out on the floor with electric pallets jacks, very unsafe. Also the incentive program they have in place causes for an unsafe/aggressive workplace environment."
bad,Everyone at the location I worked at always had horrible attitudes and our lines were always super long because the workers were taking their time and not moving at a fast pace.
bad,"Management and HR is extremely dysfunctional and disorganized, and communication among management, supervisors, and general employees is non-existent. They also do not respect us as employees. Everyone there seems to hate their job and is always in a bad mood, which makes for a negative work environment, and does not make work enjoyable. I know that not all Kroger stores are like this, and I really hate writing such a negative review, but they are just my honest thoughts."
bad,"I was hired as a clerk and was willing to work overtime and pull extra shifts, yet management was cold to my work ethic. I wanted to be promoted and other employees supported my initiative, yet management was unsupportive. Not to mentioned I was harassed by my department fellow employee. Left due to this incident. There were some nice people - they were hard working and I felt bad for them."
bad,"Extremely busy."
bad,"No benefits. Company rules and policies are only enforced for certain personnel. When you bring issue to your supervisor against another employee, your hours are cut the following week. Continually hire people so them do not have to offer benefits to part-time employees. Advancement is not based on hard work but who you know and how much butt you kiss."
bad,"They work around your schedule unless you are on stock crew, then they don't. There a way to many managers and bosses and no one communicates sufficiently. The pay is not accurate to the job and the amount of stress put on you. I had many moments where I was like, this is a just a grocery store, right?!? However, you do meet lots of new people, I made lots of great connections in my three years there, met my boyfriend there! It just is a very stressful and depressing place to work."
bad,The whole entire job sucks and nobody likes there job there so everyones attitude is awful. Unless it's the absolute last resort don't work here. Management is also awful.
bad,"I would not recommend anybody work for the Kroger Corporation or any of its subsidiaries. My experience was extremely negative and very unpleasant."
bad,I have been working at krogers about 7 years and truly regrets it now. Im still a part time employee that's get scheduled only 20-25 hours weekly which is not enough to pay my rent and other bills to survive.
bad,This is a terrible place to work unless management likes you. I was not treated fairly and neither is other associates. We work our butts off and still get yelled at and written up. Its all about who you know with this company. I was there for 16 months and still only made $8.30 an hour
bad,"I'm not sure what the other deli person meant by ""conversating"". Don't they know the proper term is ""conversing""? I worked in the deli. Half of the equipment is in need of repair. Everyone thinks that they are an assistant manager. Kitchen is FILTHY!! No training is provided. Half the crew works while the other half play on their phones. It sucked so bad I walked out today. I only made it two weeks!"
bad,Kroger isn't a terrible place to work at but it isn't a place you will be able to move up at. The management isn't bad but if you are new they wont cater to you. My co-workers were super nice and very helpful. I did learn a good bit about how to scan and price items as well as make them down.It taught me about what customer service is an how important it is to always be there for a customer no matter the need.
bad,"Go and do carts every other hour. Clean around store. Bag customers groceries. Hard to change positions. Management is mostly nice. "
bad,Only thing Kroger is doing isn't taking care of the employees  I'd rather have some where else to work I want to be in a different state
bad,"I was a manager with Kroger the parent company and one of their other divisions. While the other divisions are ran differently than the parent company, much better in my opinion. The Kroger Company has little value for their employees paying as little as possible and making the benefits next to impossible to obtain by hiring as many low hour part time people as possible resulting in not being able to meet the hour requirement."
bad,"A typical day would consisting of working on a cash register greeting everyone as they come to your line.I learned not to come in when called in unless a member of management calls you and clocks in or you will not be paid.The management walks around only when the corp. is near, the co-workers work either to hard or not hard enough which makes it hard if they are slacking. The hardest part was working as a florist with someone who is lazy so they put all the work on you and only getting 12-20 hours per week/month.What did I love about the job I love meeting new people and making them smile or happy."
bad,"I went to work, interacted with coworkers and customers, and did whatever I needed to do that. Hardest part was going to a job you absolutely hated every single day. The only enjoyable part was my coworkers."
bad,The management at this store particularly does not keep an associates personal information to confidential. There management of people is all over the place and never know what's going on.
bad,"I never knew my schedule. I'd go in and ask about it but no one, not even the managers knew where it was. I never knew when I was supposed to come in and work so they had to call me at inconvenient times."
bad,"Compared to many other entry-level jobs in the market, Kroger employees are underpaid (i.e., you pretty much always start out at minimum wage) and overworked. Management isn't promoted from within, so they normally don't have any grocery store experience whatsoever, and if you're in a store with a union, they pretty much aren't allowed to do anything to help the employees, like helping you stock, bag groceries, run the register, etc. and they don't know how to do anything they expect you to. Not management's fault, though, that's a union thing, so management doesn't really realize that what they're asking of you to do in a day's work is pretty much impossible for someone to do, like unload, sort, and then stock an entire truck with maybe one or two other people people in 8 hours."
bad,"- Merchant led organization, not marketing focused"
bad,Typical busy learned about different meats and cheese Management sucks Co workers some was able to be lazy and do nothing while others had to work hard. The hardest part was doing inventory every month
bad,"If you want to join this company I advise you to make sure they have everything the promise you in writing or a phone call on their recorded phone line.  They like to make promises just to keep employees working hard even though when you wish to re visit the subject they have no record of what they said.  If you do this and know how to play their game then you could have a successful career.  Also if you see anything unethical it is better to keep it to yourself. I will quote what my manager said to me , ""well I have not received a complaint about it so I do not see it as an issue."" Ethics shouldn't need someone to complain for us to uphold them."
bad,"Worst job I have ever had.  Poor training, Negligible to employees.  Work from slackers is tolerated and then pushed upon good workers with minimal expectations of people refusing to work."
bad,"I would not advise anyone to work at Kroger, unless they enjoy working in a stressful, unrewarding, management dominated environment. The only good thing about Kroger is job security, They are open seven days a week, eighteen hours a day, and three hundred and sixty four days a year. To me that is a perfect example of pure greed."
bad,"Ralph's gave me some reasonable experience.  Unfortunately, the training was weak.  I enjoyed the fast pace environment, the cleanliness of the store and many of my co-workers.  However, management was not clear on expectations and the mentoring was week."
bad,"The job itself is so easy and making your percent for the week is easy. The schedule is okay if you get on the right one, but the management is AWFUL. They are a bunch of middle schooler, and the co workers are as well."
bad,"It seemed like the company's rules and policies only applied to new hires, and many were only brought up after they had been ""violated."" Also, training was completely abysmal and after your first day you would be treated as if you knew everything about the job, 80% of which had not been covered in training."
bad,There are no fast way to move up. you only get a $0.05 raise every 6 months and that's if you're with the union. Managers plays favorites. Department managers does nothing but complain. I HATED going to work because it was always something that was wrong.
bad,"For me a typical day at Kroger is being at self check out running 6-12 machines, helping customers find products/prices that they are looking for, being patient with customers, making sure the customers get a fast check out and their bags are bagged the way they want them. Working at Kroger I learned to have patients, run a cash register, keep a clean work space, and how to multi task. My co workers are super fun I have never had a bad day with my co workers because we are all like a family, but management is hard to deal with and sometimes I feel like they want us to do their job on the front end for them. The hardest part about my job is when management tells us that we have a limit on something and we try to enforce the limit if a customer has a problem with it and wants to speak to a manager when we call management up to the front they tell us to just give it to them and as cashiers that are doing what we are told to do it makes us look bad because management really never backs us up, but the most enjoyable part of my job is when i help customers, talking to my co workers, talking to the customers, and there was this one day I was talking to a customer and before he left he told me that him seeing me smiling and happy makes him want to smile and it made me feel really good to know that I made him feel that way."
bad,"Very poorly managed. They have no clue how to run a company! The operators on the floor are all extremely nice and cooperative. The management staff from operations, HR, to plant manager have no clue on how to run a business or treat the union staff!"
bad,"they use you do not care about you no job loyalty or security the only benefit is the weekly pay they expect you to be perfect and when you aren't your constantly scolded by management everyone are zombies and the most a manager makes there is 40,000 a year so if you think your going to benefit with this job think again"
bad,"I would not recommend anyone work at Mariano's. The managers were biased and often times they seemed racist. The African-American employees I encountered there often worked harder than everyone else, but they were offered the least opportunities to advance in the company. While others who were not as hard of workers seemed to advance past African-American associates, who worked there for longer periods of time. Not only that, but whenever the African-American associates complained, they were fired shortly thereafter. These reasons lead me to believe that Mariano's was not an equal opportunity employer and not a good establishment to work for."
bad,worked in the fuel dept. the so called manager didn't do her job but had others do it for her and considering how long shes worked there biggest gossip queen ever. the main store does not care about furl dept employeses if they have everything they need including air glad I got out when I did
bad,"The Most enjoyable Thing about Kroger is the People you meet while working there. "
bad,"I've been a department manager for 10 years. I make too good of a wage to just quit or I would. I work every holiday and every weekend. I get chewed out by customers and management alike for things beyond my control. The company purposely understaffs the stores in order to save on labor. If you're not willing to do the work of two people, you'll be replaced by someone who is. "
bad,"* I work 45+ hours a week"
bad,This place has become a joke over the past few years. I've worked at more that one Kroger store and what they are hiring as store management is not good for business because they are not customer friendly and they do not take care of their employees. All Kroger cares about is what publix is doing in Tennessee they don't realize it's the little people that makes a company great and if they don't change publix will take over in the mid south. Our union is a joke too they do not represent the workers in a problem they get management side then will bring in the person that has a complaint then after that if that person makes a mistake they get a write up after 3 your gone. Not good
bad,"Kroger actually was a horrible job. They hired me and my friend and made us unload the whole truck every night. Sorry workers and pay, long hours as well."
bad,"Kroger is by far the worst employer I've ever dealt with, and it is not even close. The typical day (3rd shift) at Kroger consists of you, an entry-level worker, running an entire department. Without you, nothing will get done, you are thrown an ungodly workload, that can be accomplished nightly, but you will be hauling everything you have to complete it. In the morning the management will greet you, with no ""good job,"" they'll just say, ""Sup"" or ""Hey."" "
bad,"Ok there are sooo many problems at the location I worked at. "
bad,it was literally the worst job ever with the worst pay I might add.
bad,"Like the summary says, Kroger will work you hard and never offer any form of encouragement or adequate compensation. Masochists please apply."
bad,"Assisting & Interacting with Customers, I Learned To Go Above & Beyond For The Customers Needs. The Management Team Really Wasn't Interactive As They Should Have Been With The Workers,My Co-Workers Were Pretty Nice & Helpful. I Didn't Find My Job Being Hard & The Most Enjoyable Part Of My Job Was Knowing I Help Put A Smile On Customers Face Each Day."
bad,"I've worked with all sorts of people before but this takes the cake; never in my life have I had a higher up constantly try to provoke me because I put forth extra effort. The work itself is hard, most of your co-workers are friendly but the management is beyond poor. You don't address issues nor do you threaten someone with their job on the sales floor, it says more about the management staff than the employee. Overall I would not recommend Kroger is a place of employment to anyone because the lack of ethic that's across the board."
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of opening the deli, cooking foods to set in the case, slicing meats to order, Taking and recording temperatures, and cleaning."
bad,"my job was my life.  i love cheese & will never stop educating myself to learn more every day about cheese."
bad,"When you work or a company for more than a year, you expect to be appreciated for your work. Instead, this is a company whose practices are just shy of being comparable to other large retail companies. They'll bring in other full time employees rather than promoting employees to better positions. They'll punish you for trying to better yourself despite following the guidelines laid out by governing bodies and union contracts. If you're a teenager, looking for a first job, it's fine, but if you're looking for a job where you think you're going to be happy, go elsewhere."
bad,This job is good if you need a part time job during school and don't expect much from your employer. There is little compensation and you are just a number to the corporate world.
bad,"Negative management, No opportunity for advancement, treated like children, pay scale does not equal level of work."
bad,The job itself was ok. But the District Manager was horrible.
bad,"Would never have wasted 10+ years here. Worked with some of the most ignorant self-centered people, and denied advancement. Words of advice: DO NOT WORK HERE, EVER."
bad,"The company went way down hill in the last few years.employees are only a number now,the company doesn't care for their employees,very few fulltime and no benefits for their partimers.They move their management or fire them ."
bad,The workplace was not keep professional and the advancement opportunities were not the same for everyone.  The advancement opportunities were very bias
bad,"The managers are disrespectful. Customer is always right even when they're wrong. You don't know your work schedule until the Thursday or Friday, heck sometimes Saturday, before the new work week starts, and the work week starts on Sunday! I've had customers talk to me disrespectfully and make racist and sexist remakes to me and then complain about my service! I even had one manager wrongfully threaten my job and publicly humiliate me! While closing a whole department with just myself and one other person I had a manager page me to the front desk. I stopped working went to the front desk and she's not even there. While asking the woman at the front desk where she is I hear her page for assistance in the backroom. She called me for absolutely know reason! I saw her later that night and she walked by me like she never even called me!! I'm halfway gone and the don't even know it! So beyond feed up! I would never try to get a friend on here!"
bad,"I only worked there for a year. "
bad,"Every worker for themself.  Awful place to work. Tried to give a verbal one month's notice and was told, ""No!"" Gave a two week written and had it handed back to me. Breaks aren't enforced and you're encouraged to work off the clock. Bad management all the way from the higher ups to the dept heads"
bad,I have been with the Kroger company for 4 years July 8th 2013 and im not making even 8 dollars an hour and there isn't any opportunity for advancement and very few incentives to remain with the company.   
bad,management didn't follow through on their word and job was very stressful.
bad,"The management doesn't care about it's employees or the trouble they are having outside of work. Management should also be able to do everything that they have their employees do. When you ask a the store manager for help and his response is he don't know and then goes to find someone to help you, means he probably shouldn't be management."
bad,"Your worked like a slave and when your paycheck comes you always feel the urge to laugh or cry. They squeeze every penny they can out. They dock your hours if you ask off, I asked off for half a day for a dentist appointment and my hours were greatly affected. They do go by there mission ""Customer First."" But so much so that they don't care about the employees at all."
bad,"Unhealthy environment to work. Mold in ceiling, a/c ducts, floor mats, carpet. Supervisors/Managers do not care if employees are harassed by other employees. Do not take action to improve workplace in any way. No breaks, no lunches. Got in trouble if doing required training."
bad,Love the job as a cashier Kroger in redford plaza. management was out of control meaning very disrespectful.
bad,A very friendly environment. Very diverse cultural atmosphere. Fast pace environment.
bad,"Everyday I come in bag food everyday im the only one up front all the time,, all the baggers don't seem to take. I learned that customers are always first. My co workers are rude, mean. The manager doesn't seem to care when there is a prob. lem between co worker. I love coming into work and seeing customer smile.. haven't have a raise yet"
bad,A typical day at Kroger is a day full of gossip and poor supervision and management.
bad,"This companies senior officials, goes against all of the values that they have set forth for the employees. This company is posesed with accountability, which is funny because their meaning of accountability is taking responsibility for everyone else's actions including yours. The last definition I read said accountability means taking responsibility for your actions and not others. This company does not care about work life balance. A very stressful working atmosphere at all times. This company has a great turnover rate. By this I mean that a new employee may last 1yr. with the company before being terminated. And last but not least, this company never pays unemployment in any circumstances. Not a very good company to work for."
bad,I paid for my own certifications after being promised reimbursement. The females were catty and unprofessional. I was hired on telling them that I needed specific hours for daycare and when I was working I was told there were no “mommy hours”. I have been informed of awful things said about me to customers. Just an overall non professional field. Most days I didn’t get a lunch and taking a break was impossible. I wouldn’t suggest it.
bad,I have visited other Kroger stores and observed their culture.  The Kroger company can be great for what they offer if people in positions of authority follow their guidelines.
bad,Ths worst managers I've ever worked for besides the Apparel manager she was awesome but it was like being in high school where it's about the popular crew you hang with
bad,Kroger co. model is give great customer serve as they cut peoples hours for denial they health benefits.....least amount of staffing to do twice as much work …..all a long paying rock bottom prices in payroll
bad,No room for growth. Company constantly uses people. They cut hours and expect the same amount of work done. They hire and maintain bad employees and expect the good employees to pick up their slack.
bad,Fu kroger.You will drive only 1/4 of the time the rest of the time you are a janitor. Co-workers will watch you work and management turns a blind eye.horrible
bad,Unfortunately was not one of the best places I've worked at. They were very inconsiderate and could've been more fair to all employee's. Very unkind towards male employee's.
bad,"The company is failing for a reason.  No one knows what they are doing in the district office.  Issues are ignored, no one knows what to do or how to do it.  Tons of meetings and conference calls.  Upper management loves to hear themselves speak.  Literally, tons of speaking engagements to pump you up about working more for free.  A bunch of alcoholics running stores.  No concern for safery."
bad,"After almost six years working for Kroger I was only making $12.10 an hour. The work environment is a disaster. If you are a good worker you are supposed to do everyone's job. Managers walk around criticizing everything, talking down to everyone, and are rude. "
bad,"For starting out as a first job ever type, it can be a learning experience. Having said that, management is quick to micromanage and undercut you as an employee, you have to do other people's work, often limiting the ample time to get your own work done and the overall atmosphere is very toxic at minimum."
bad,"Hostile DM in Nashville District 1. Unprofessional- ridicules, belittles. D1 is understaffed, but store managers are expected to achieve standards that only a fully staffed store could meet. However you can’t hire ppl here because Kroger has ruined its reputation with workers whom they treat like trash."
bad,Nothing is ever enough and corporate officials flat out tell you to your face your best is garbage. Hiring manager rude and vulgar to job applicants who try to follow up on the status of their application.
bad,Honest feedback from a overworked and seemingly under appreciated associate. Extremely dedicated worker who has experienced a variety of environments with Kroger. Has gotten to the point I no longer appreciate my efforts nor do I feel my efforts are appreciated.
bad,"V. P. Will lie to you, the manager do not care about you or your family. The company is not the company I started with. It's not about the employees but about the customers first. Employees make the company run and we get no respect. No bonuses for the employees but for the manager team the president and v.p"
bad,"The pay was horrible, the managers are horrible, the working conditions were horrible,find a job somewhere else it wasn't worth the little pay that you get."
bad,The job is fast pace all the time. You have good benefits. Not able to move up in the company that is the down fall. the company is doing a lot of changes. have a lot of work to do and little time to complete it.
bad,"Everything was fine before they fired and relocated all the managers. had 3 managers when i started 1 stayed the entire time i was there 1 was fired 1 was relocated, the main manager that relocated was my best boss I've ever had. The one that replaced her was easily the worst boss I've ever had no matter what u did she never appreciated anything. She wanted to change things that didn't need to be changed and complained when u changed them like she said to but her bosses didn't like it. It was always the low mans fault and you get paid nothing working there for the things u have to put up with in the toxic environment it is now."
bad,I loved my job I was a baker at 862 but the store had poor management  I was so stressed because poor people in there places in the store my bakery manager didnt have a clue on how to run the bakery department I work for Krogers for 15 years I wanted to retire from Krogers but that didnt happen
bad,It's all just always about Kroger and making money. Nothing else matters. And corporate is highly unstable. The only good part is that there are other workers to be miserable with.
bad,The Pharmacy Manager was a horrible person and you liked to degrade people. I reported her several times and nothing was done about it. When you go through so many pharmacy technicians you know where the problem is. I ask for every other Sunday off so I could go to church and she deliberately work me every Sunday until I resigned.
bad,"Not a great company to experience, they consistently have put part-timers at 40+ hr/week and pay and treat them like part time. Easy to get promoted, but mostly because their turnover rate is sky high."
bad,"The work was easy but was released due to ""not being focused"" meanwhile i was doing more work than the manager and my other coworkers the grocery manager was sleeping with a coworker so i and one other person was left to pick up their slack along with getting our jobs done"
bad,Everyone hates working there. Manager very disrespectful and they expected me to close down the meat and seafood Department by myself my first night there.
bad,"I worked for this company for a number of years many years ago. Went back for a time while I was between jobs a while back. The company had changed a great deal over the years. I recently resigned."
bad,"Favoritism is very common here, Work experience/skill level/ and overall attendance doesnt matter for promotions only if your bestfriends with the higher ups, regardless of documentation they will claim that they ""have their reasons"" even when it doesnt add up or isnt true."
bad,Kroger when I started in 2008 was excellent but in the last 2 yrs I was there new manager came in and ruined the morale.The pay was great if u stocked at nite. Cashier and courtesy clerks were paid the least.
bad,"Kroger was a very stressful and fast paced environment. Body aching positions of work and constant tasks asked by poor managers. Overall, retail in grocery is a no go."
bad,"The company in general not bad, but the management they had sucked."
bad,Do it for the experience .. It means the most. People will yell and shout but remain calm. Always keep busy and your day will go fast. Work at other stores
bad,They will nickel and dime your work experience to pay you the least amount of hourly wage. Management knew I had a full time job besides Kroger and yet was still scheduled over 30 hours a week. Upper management is very rude and have no people skills whatsoever. Shift supervisors were rude and spoke to people like they were incapable of breathing on their own. Human Resources will not help you
bad,Immediately you're listed inky as part-time. You have to accumulate 1200 hours to qualify for benefits. There is no employee benefits at the pharmacy upon hire. The discounts are ok. Some of your peers are ok. The management does not care if you're having a serious personal emergency. The management have no clue of their employees and scheduling correctly for high volume days.
bad,Corporate and management likes to pass down very tedious and sometimes unnecessary rules and procedures. Management usually doesn't back up the associates. I won't speak on all Kroger Stores but the one I worked at was a horrific environment morale wise. Not one associate seemed like they wanted to be there. A very miserable atmosphere.
bad,"Overall, the job isn't that difficult. The worst part about the job is the people you work with - particularly those who have been there for many years. Apparently the company changed its retirement policy to only those over the age of 65 being eligible to qualify, regardless of number of years worked. This led to a lot of unhappy workers, and a terrible work environment, especially if you're a young person who doesn't work in  the front - expect resentment."
bad,The management only listens to the kiss Up.'s whether or not the information is accurate they play the blame game  they say they investigate issues but it is always bias
bad,"Only one competent manager in the store at the time, and the others worked against you constantly. They made it difficult to go to work, and made it even worse as they barely trained you and when they did it was bare minimum."
bad,First you get hired promised on what your pay is then find out that was wrong you never get any training from management only training you get is from other employees why pay a manager that can't do there job especially training on what they expect you to get accomplished during your work schedule.
bad,I was promised to get more hours. That’s the whole reason why I left my old job I’m only getting 12 hours a week. They also taking over $30 dollars out of my small paycheck.
bad,"Everyday when I go to work, I am singled out for everything. Management is always looking to get me in trouble. They don’t care about employees. They think we are all replaceable, which is true. How I am treated goes to show how management treats employees. I have worked there now for 4 years, and I don’t plan on staying much longer. They’ve fired me once and I’ve gotten my job back since then. Most recently I was threatened by management that they would fire me due to insubordination since I refused to put on my apron. The aprons irritate my neck."
bad,There is a lack of leaderahip. They run around with no clue no one can make decision and people of leadership just hide out and provide no direction. It has good pay as long as you dont mind working in an environment where you have to wonder what they are thinking on a daily basis
bad,Koger was my first job. Although my manager was great the supervisors were not. I had no problem dealing with customers I learned to deal with all kinds of customers. besides my manager management was not good at all. It was drama here and there and management just didn't seem to have a grasp on how to manage and handle problems at all. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the supervisors money would come up missing and I honestly feel like he supervisor had a hand in it and were blaming the workers. I honestly wouldn't ever work there again. A typical day is simple if closing I just provide great customer service took count of product cleaned of the pumps and locked up product. If mid day shift just provide great customer service clean off a few pumps count my til and take account for cigarettes and lottery info.
bad,"Kroger was my first job, so I thought that it was a nice first place to work at, but I was dead wrong. The pay doesn’t match the work that you do, the management is subpar at best, and I have been working there for two months and still have yet to receive my associates Kroger card after asking if I could acquire it. I do not recommend anybody work at kroger."
bad,I do not recommend working at Kroger. Every position is under paid with bad benefits. Management shows up unhappy and the employees have no morale. The customer base can also be tough
bad,Tramatized never again  no love no hope you go in their to fail they don't want  you to make incentive an the pay is not 1860 it's 1550 and any infraction will take your incentive
bad,Management opportunities...... you might be a store manager in 15 years if you're lucky and you must know someone.  Very politically driven A Union driven company. Everything is based on who you know not what you know.
bad,They over work you and put you in fear of losing your job everyday.  They pay is nowhere near where it should be.  A very hostile work environment. Stay away from this company!
bad,"This company has lost its way. They are running scared because of competition. It has turned from a company I saw myself retiring with, to a company I feel is out for mine and everybody like me’s jobs. It is a bully environment, where management is threatened with write ups and being unemployed. The stress is unbelievable. Stores are expected to have 3 managers to run it, but only have 1 to 2 managers and are still threatened with write ups when you miss 1 task in your hectic day."
bad,"They are not honest about everything from the start managers in departments are terrible because if you call off or don’t kiss their butt you pay , like cutting hrs, working 9-10 straight then only getting 1 day off . Love the actual work but the management and people there are terrible they lie to suck you in and then it’s nothing like they say."
bad,"Management focused on things that had nothing to do with customer service, for example: they would rather us be cleaning registers than taking care of long lines of customers. I got written up and put on probation for doing what my direct superior told me to do, which was one of the reasons I decided to seek employment elsewhere. This job is only good for high school students, since they do work around your availability - the only good part about this job. I got paid very little for what I did. I say this because I was not only a bagger, but I also did accounting, ran the front office, ran register, did file maintenance, and more. Throughout my 3 years of employment, they only paid me minimum wage; which I understand that that’s what I started out as, but I think I should’ve gotten paid more because of the responsibility and tasks I obtained."
bad,The store manager is a sexist pig. I don’t recommend anybody work there. They expect so much from a person when there is very little help. The store manager was very cold and rude
bad,"No matter how much prior job experience you have, they’re still going to pay you as close to minimum wage as they can- which isn’t nearly enough for all the BS you’ll have to put up with. No one stays in the same store for more than about 8 months before being transferred by corporate or just straight up quitting."
bad,"They are very unprofessional they do not honor time frames and acted a bit racist they do not explain things and nobody does what"
bad,I hated the job. Management was awful and they treated you like dirt if you were not one of their favorites. It didn't matter how hard you worked if the manager didn't like you. Very bad environment.
bad,Working here was fun as long as the people you were working with weren't terrible which was most days. I asked to be put in a different department several times and was always promised they'd transfer me soon. Other people with less seniority were transferred and new people were hired for positions i asked for instead of me. The store i worked at definitely works off of favoritism and i do not recommend that anyone ever work here.
bad,The management does not care about anything. They treat their employees horrible. Would not recommend working at Kroger-Stores anywhere. After working there I barely shop there because I am so annoyed by the way they treat their employees.
bad,"Nothing to rave about..."
bad,"I can't say anything good about kroger, so I won't say anything. "
bad,They do everything for the customer..but employees are not treated half as well.  They don't know how to run their stores .management needs more people skills
bad,"Working for Kroger was not fun but I can say that it gave me the retail experience I needed to move to Wal-Mart. Kroger is the first place I learned how to run a cash register."
bad,"All I have to say is, DON'T EVER EVER THINK YOU'RE GOING TO GET 40 HOURS & INSURANCE!!! "
bad,"as a former employee  the typical day for me was being cussed out and yelled at for needing help while the two managers laugh and talk most of the day, management does not do anything to help their employees when there is confrontation that is getting out of control. There were few enjoyable thing in this store ( that were not even in my department). i did not look forward to going in because i was called fat by one coworker on the daily and another who would call me stupid and slow. Along with working there, managers never teach you how to do half the stuff you are supposed to be taught. I do not recommend this place."
bad,"To those thinking about working at Kroger,  you might want to reconsider after reading this post.  First of all,  management has always been bad but it's by far the worst it's ever been.  Management is steadily becoming dismissive,  they give no support to concerns you might have in store,  they don't respect flexibility, and passive aggressive/aggressive.  Part time employees gets screwed the worst,  as we are forced to carry most of the productivity of full time who take ""lazy days"" in pulling their weight or ""no shows"" and management does jack about it.   Imagine getting 20-25 hours a week doing the same bulljive as full time employees should be doing but twice as much;  it not only weighs on you physically but mentally as well.  Management wants you to get their work done be ""happy"" your employed.  Well,  I will soon put in my 2 weeks before the next holiday cycle.   I like a weekly check and benefits like the next person but I don't like being a pushover and a doormat to management and good for nothing employees."
bad,This was the worst place I've ever worked. Period. Do not seek employment unless you are desperate. It is a toxic environment. The management allows employees to treat each other poorly. They were a bunch of degenerates.
bad,"Must work inconsistent schedule, unable to live a life outside of Kroger. Will work long hours with little to no reward. On call a minimum of 14 hours per day. I come from management but this is across the board. Would not recommend.."
bad,"Quick to throw you under the bus. Have no conscience when it comes to looking out for their employees. Have you do work of higher positions but won’t compensate for the pay of that position, most management is lazy, you make a small mistake and it can’t be forgiven and your gone like a fanny burp in the wind. If you need a temp job sure go for it but long term then no"
bad,"They don't really care about their employees. Any semblance of care is actually just them looking out for themselves and their turnover rate. They lied about how much they would pay me and when I called them on it, the pay offer in my folder had been changed. Long hours for not enough pay. Not worth anyone's time unless you are a high schooler looking for a first job."
bad,"Management at Kroger picks favorites and if you’re not a favorite, you’re practically just a number in their system. I’ve had multiple occurrences of people with higher titles, such as supervisors and MANAGERS, talking about me to my coworkers behind my back. The work environment is very childish and elementary and it would be nice if corporate would take a closer look at who they’re putting in charge of the store."
bad,Not a good play to work at. thy will work you to the bone if they can. You're better off working at any other place that actually cares about their workers.
bad,"I was hired about a year and half ago to be a DrugGM associate to turn around once I was hired,  I was ripped from that department to be forced to work front end part time!  I didn't quit like many would had done because I needed 2nd stable employment but reminded miserable and unhappy at the shady move.  I asked why I couldn't work DrugGM, management claimed they were overstaffed there yet once I did my note comparing with those in that department I found out they did cuts and management believes only 3 people can work that department.  It's not possible if 2 are full time with similar schedules and 1 is part time and the part time gets yanked from the department to do bagging!   I've already put in my 2 weeks they wanted me to stay but after asking could I work GM one last time my store manager walked away from me cold."
bad,"Unless you like repetitive drama, being worked like a robot and talk down to like a child then Kroger is for you!  Between the management being in it for the 60-80k/yr salary and not caring about the store and its associates, no stability within management team, infighting,  instead of putting one on the schedule they resort to callins that causes you to lose hours down the road,  micromanaging over simple work things and abusive tongues at employees;  coworkers who gossip endlessly about the same foolishness when you enter the door,  lack of team work, no shows and scapegoating - I'm at my rope!  Thank goodness most of the customers I've encountered are good natured or I'd be done."
bad,"Very unprofessional management, I was coming up for my insurance and pay review, and they switched my hours to prevent me from obtaining insurance. you have to work 90 days straight to obtain insurance"
bad,I will never in my life work there again the absolute worst place to work they underpay they screw up your hours and they make everything your fault if u call in they threaten you with your job if your truly sick they are not sympathetic above all the Hartley bridge Kroger is never to be recommended as a fine place to work you will hate life working there.
bad,I would never recommend no one to work for Kroger unless you in school and just need a little money in your pockets. They don’t care if you’re sick or not and what managers sit and talk about people behind their backs. They don’t answer the page when called for
bad,"Physically demanding."
bad,"If you are injured on the job, and are not with the union, you will be terminated without question and your workman's compensation claim will be denied out of hand. If you have joined the union, you might be protected in your job, but the claim will still be denied unless you hire an attorney and fight. Very poor management and most of the staff are on some type of drug to handle the sometimes 16 hour days."
bad,You are expected to do more than your job by one manager and yelled at for it by other managers. Job is very stressful. Breaks are not guaranteed.     I could say a lot more.
bad,"Managers are unfair... most are bullys...  unless your a brown noser ( which I am not)...you'll never make it at a Kroger store..."
bad,I worked at kroger for two years and no advancement  what so ever! Seen alot of nepotism ! I got a produce position and someone couldnt come in another department  so i took over for a week and they hired a kid who dad is in upper management to take my spot! Had to put up with management  constantly not being professional! No comunication at all!
bad,"I worked part time, worked 40+ hours a week yet was still refused full time. I worked every job the front end had to offer, including supervisor, and still made $8.50 an hour. I witnessed employees get fired solely for being sexually harrassed, only to find our manager has having an affair with the harasser."
bad,The pay was laughable and benefits were ok. The store management does not respect the associates and the union protects lackluster lazy employees. Avoid this company.
bad,"The one in Ypsilanti that I worked at, very poor management. Management was rude to customers, customer complaints will go unheard. Poor working conditions, and i wasn’t paid enough for what I did."
bad,"My biggest issue with working there was the lack of communication. We were basically the bottom of the totem pole so we were often the last to know pretty much anything, and that was because someone mentioned it rather than actually telling us anything important."
bad,"Working for frys was a great start, but the future was untold and it was hard to work and go to school at the same time. Learning the retail side of the pharmacy was a great experience but there was no room for growth."
bad,"Ckmapmy has bad ideas for customers and employees, allows employees that are full time to steal time and products, no care for hard workers and to liberal"
bad,A typical day is spent bagging groceries and cleaning the store and sometimes detail cleaning early mornings. I also did a lot of cart pulling and needed to provide good customer service.
bad,"Kroger is a good job for someone in high school or college, but not someone with bills and responsibilities. If you got hired full time at the starting rate(8.75/hour) you would be earning under the poverty line. Ten cents a year raise is pitiful. Not enough people working in each department. Managment has no idea how to schedule or handle their employees. Their ideas and equipment are extremely outdated"
bad,Low pay management is trash no respect to employees for the hard they do i have thirty years of experience in retail.Kroger is a union place and they don't get the workers better pay
bad,"do not work here, the FRONT END has a terrible manager (kelly) the rest are nice. half the time my breaks are late. And the manager is rude, selfish, and conveniently not around when its time for my break."
bad,Working for Kroger has been a terrible experience for me. I have worked from 4pm to Midnight just to be back the next morning at 5:15 countless times. The hours are inconsistent and easily spread among employees that don’t do their jobs.
bad,"Management is up their own butts and the butts of corporate. Don't expect to be treated fairly, you're lucky to even get any time for breaks. Managers threaten your job if you aren't able to do it, like for health reasons. They only play favorites with those who will brown nose them. You're better off working for someone who will show you some real decency and some respect."
bad,Poor management.  No breaks.  Rude customers.  No open door policy. And it just made for a terrible company to ever work for. I hated going to work every day.
bad,"Forced to work 10 hrs a day or get your job threatened,  told you don't have a life and your family isn't important. Management throws the work load on certain workers and makes sure other workers aren't working to hard."
bad,The management and employees were poor performing and I never felt as though I could easily get along with anyone. I never received good communication on what was expected.
bad,"On average each day at Kroger entails trying to do my job while constantly being worried about what I'm going to get scolded for that day. Each hour before the store opens and the managers start coming in to gather around and berate the associates is more and more dreadful, no matter how hard you work or what setbacks may happen they DO NOT care, they will tell you that you are slow or that you don't do enough even when you are giving it your all. "
bad,Gross lack of guidance or training from management. Pay and benefits are very lackluster. Hours are sporadic and unpredictable. Very little opportunity for advancement.
bad,"While I was there the management was terrible. They treated their employees terrible. Just wanted the job done and didn't care how. The hours sucked and no matter how many times you asked to get more or about problems going on within in the department nothing got fixed, it seemed to just get worse. I definitely wouldn't recommend going there, it has a high turn over rate and that's for good reason. It's for sure the worst job I've worked at."
bad,management treated my department bad would tell us to do things that we werent suppose ti do they didnt care talked behind our back and laugh at us would yell at us all the time
bad,"brookings fred meyer is a nightmare.poorly managed , ignorant human resource manager. no pay incentive for long term employment.the harder you work the more you get craped on ."
bad,just don't do it the reason they have such a high turnover ratec is it just kept getting worse and worse. Manger isn't  held to the some stander as the average employee. They just keep taking more from the employees so the can give more to the shareholders. they told us how they had a record year it was the best year they ever had. so how did they thank us they gave a .25 cent raise for two years.  there just keep stacking more and more on everyone. they make it well know  that they don't care about you and you easily replaceable. if you need a job i guess it put money in the bank but i wouldn't try to make a career there.
bad,Terrible culture with poor upper management. Was not given the tools to properly perform all tasks that were given. Has the worst communication of any company that I have worked for. No regard for home/work balance.
bad,Management needs more training before they get their own store and they need to know who overrides who. We need more time to train people in the departments also. There no PTO or sick pay so basically there is no excused absences. We get vacation but not enough for the time we put in. Raises happen once a year and I didnt even notice on my check.
bad,"Once Kroger took over the store it quickly went down hill. they stripped the company culture, and made it a boring place to work, without a personality"
bad,"I worked at Richmond location  and I was aware of it’s reputation but, I had no clue how bad it really was until I started working there. Big mistake! Most employees are too busy socializing instead helping customers, that’s one of the most common complaints from customers and they are absolutely right! At this store especially, it’s not about your job performance or your work ethic, it’s all about whether you fit into the clique. And if you don’t forget about a positive work environment! It’s about customer service, it’s not a social club where the most popular rules. On a daily basis I had to hear most employees on the front end commenting on how horrible most customers were instead of adjusting their own attitudes accordingly. That’s part of customer service! The last straw was being placed in the middle of a conversation between a cashier and a supervisor about a new employee that hadn’t even been on the job but two days. The cashier bluntly calls the girl a snowflake and stated that she doesn’t think she is going to fit in there. I saw another review where the lady stated that the manager should be ashamed of the store...Well the entire management team should be. I encourage more customers to step up with their complaints. The level of complaints are ridiculous, but warranted."
bad,"I enjoy what I do. I enjoy the people I work with. However, I do not enjoy the culture of bullying done by management. The management has taken away extra incentives that we used to receive. The management and the Department Heads give us conflicting information on the same subjects."
bad,I moved back from out of state to return to what I thought was a strong company. The company decided to reorganize. I was laid off. Most of my fellow pharmacists have left due to downsizing.
bad,"Poor management, constantly understaffed, low pay which contributes to manpower problem.  Unrealistic performance expectations; department should be staffed by 2-3 workers during the day but lone workers are expected to keep up."
bad,"Corrosive is the best word to describe the Production site that I work. Hard work, integrity & accountability are not rewarded. Terrible management, a real 'Boys Club' atmosphere and making sure completely incompetent leadership is not held accountable for costly decisions is a daily experience. "
bad,This job though it might seem like a good job in the beginning is absolutely the worst job ever. The store is under staffed and the management/ hr won’t increase pay to get more workers or to give a incentive to stay with company
bad,"Kroger does not care about employees.. Kroger needs to be put out of business, management ignore employees and treat them like dirt. Everyone who is hired, quit 3-4 days later"
bad,At first I enjoyed my job here. As time went on management flipped a three times for the store manager which had the trickle down effect on the lower management. It seemed they didn't much care about the employees moral or financial well being. I always had to fight for hours all of the time. This last summer they cut hours before the fourth of July. My friends that still work there are still fighting for hours. The turn over rate is very high also.
bad,hated working here worked me like a dog for so little pay and they kept moving me around to jobs i didn't even know how to do. The only good thing was it as weekly pay
bad,"If I could tell eighteen year old me anything about working at Kroger, I'd tell myself to look for a better job immediately and not waste 5+ years with them. Through my time and experience at Kroger i have found that the employees at the corporate and management levels only care about themselves and the money going into their pockets. I have now been dealing with a rate or pay issue for over three months. Human resources signed off on an agreement to fix the rate of pay and give me back pay which was awesome, however two months have passed since then and still no rate or pay change and no back pay check, when i voiced concerns over waiting to receive back pay checks (I'm now waiting on four separate back pay checks) and my concerns of feeding my child with partial pay checks, I was told by my manager that ""thats not my problem."" That shows me that not only am I not valued, but neither is the well-being of my family."
bad,"The company has changed and there is no longer any ""green"" management.  It is all threats and verbal beat downs. They want robots as managers and do not want anyone using their brain. Follow the program even though it doesn't fit every situation."
bad,"I worked for this company for 9 long years and in ‘09, it was fun and I enjoyed my job, then new CEO’s and such took over and it become nothing short of a stressful mess. I absolutely do not recommend working for Kroger."
bad,"I've never worked anywhere more unorganized or incompetent in my life. None of the management does their job correctly, is prompt, or listens to any of their employees."
bad,Noone appreciates anything anyone does they will write you up if they just think you broke any rules i would recommend staying away from kroger very stressful company to work for
bad,"Worked for the company just under 7 years. Never a happy day working there. Most management doesn't lift  their heads to say good morning or respond when you say good morning. One day the front store manager and the pharmacy manager got into an argument and said some harsh words then the store manager stormed off. Came back about 15 minutes later and decided the pharmacy was going to do what they call, Select a schedule . After being there nearly 7 years and always coming in early or staying late to help out whenever needed I had to work 2 to 8, 3 days a week and work every Saturday  after working full-time for nearly 7 years. Another technician that has been there for 29 years also, had hours cut. The entire Pharmacy, no one was getting 40 hours. The technician of 29 years is not working 34 hours a week and I was working 30. The  Manager said "" we are not here for the employees,  we are here for the needs of the store""."
bad,"I was underpaid for my experience going in. I was also passed up for the position I wanted because HR wanted a man in that position. My availability was ignored, and I once had a manager print off and post a revised schedule mid-shift just to force me to stay an extra half hour. "
bad,"The Kroger company is struggling.  Sales are stagnant.  There is no work-life balance.  A manager is required to work a 50 hour week and you end up working the equivalent to 60-70.  The pay for the average employee starting out is 8.50 an hour. While starting pay for a manager is only around 35,000 with a potential bonus.  However, it is very difficult to acquire the bonus.  Managers are required to close till 11 and then open at 6:30.  What makes this difficult is the average 45-60 minute commute.  They rarely place you at a local store.  They can transfer you to a store up to 45 miles from your home.  Most managers lifespans are under 1 year. While most median employees never make it past 3 years.  These are just a few examples of the issues Kroger has.  It is not a place that I would ever recommend anyone to work."
bad,"Very stressful work environment. Was able to advance within weeks, however, that meant I was responsible for allowing others to take breaks when I would not get them. Reason was the upper management did not assist with the front of the store when needed."
bad,horrible place to work the managers are horrible and the associates are horrible dont work here ever you will regret it the pay is horrible and the hours are horrible
bad,The store I worked at was horrible. So many people quit without a two-weeks notice because management was horrible to their employees and screwed people out of hours.
bad,"Not a very good company to work for. Management stabs you in the back and protects few employees. When issues arise, they don't care to hear your side of the story."
bad,"Kroger's Marketplace Clicklist is a place where customers order their groceries and have them waiting for them. The associates were not as fast paced as they should have been, did not care about the product being given out."
bad,"I been with the company for about 5 years. In this time, I was harassed, told in no uncertain words that I was useless, and was not doing what needed to be done. The managers have been there for a couple years for some, even as early as 6 months. Since my working there, I seen at least 5 new managers come and go in a 6 month period. The turnover is very high. They treat you like they own you, and that you are replaceable, insignificant. Anyone could do your role they would say. Countless coworkers I worked with said they hated it, and some even were depressed and began to get panic attacks over having to come in. Unless you actually threw up in front of everyone, they don't want you to leave for home early, ever. They lied to my friend to get them fired, and they are never pleased with your work. They will always hold you back 10 minutes past time to leave on average, with at most being over an hour for me. They frequently forget your breaks until hours later, and only offer the bare minimum required by law. The union rep even told me and a coworker directly that kroger sucks, and more expressly told me I just have to deal with it. Long time workers even have told me it gets worse and worse. Expect each action to be questioned, and if you are not performing to their desired level of ring tender time, which no one at my store did, you'll be talked to about performance regularly. You even so much as have a quick word with a coworker and no customers around? Don't get caught, you'll be talked to. And the customer always has your job in their hands. Unless they're blatantly spitting"
bad,Management had terrible attitudes and hated people with medical limitations. Refused to move me from the being a grocery cashier after if was discovered that i have a severe and deadly food allergy.
bad,"Being a Clicklist selector is possibly the worst thing that I’ve ever done. My store is horrendous. The managers are horrible, they don’t care about their employees, they don’t help us when he desperately need it which is often and they don’t look at your availability. The employees aren’t helpful towards the people in clicklist, in fact they down right hate us. Most of the clicklist selectors don’t know what they are doing and leave all of the work for others and leave before we are even done. This job is so stressful that I get physically sick from it. Just the thought of walking into my store makes my head pound and my stomach turn. Do not ever apply for a clicklist job or at least not in Richmond."
bad,"The (smaller) Kroger in Nacogdoches, Texas was run by an ancient team of oppressors who sat under the management, but controlled them through seniority. They consistently took advantage of their scheduling power to smite employees they were unhappy with. "
bad,"Kroger (Parent company of Fry's food and Drug) is a very competitive place to work and talk to people on a personal level."
bad,"The job wasnt hard, but management and coworkers were trash. Pay was horrible. It's definitely not a job you want to have if you're grown and have a family to take care of, Job is meant for teenagers"
bad,They pay their employees properly.  The HR lady can't enter information correctly when it comes to w-2 information. She also didn't put in my direct deposit information
bad,DO NOT WORK HERE - All they care about is numbers - People are leaving weekly with no new hires - Happy days are here again sky's are bright and clear again
bad,"Regardless of your age, background, experience,.etc,.. if a manager doesn't care for you, you will get no decent schedule, and no respect.  Kroger may be able to claim being 'union' but employees receive the lowest wages of any grocery store chain and you receive no benefits until you are there for nearly a year due to low hours."
bad,this job was stressful and the management was terrible. the workers were hard to work with and they barley trained you. you bascially had to train yourself when you have never worked in a deli before it is very difficult.
bad,"Accountability culture and work load is abusive and inconsiderate of Staff. Racially discriminatory, poor retention of minorities, nepotism of family and friends, cut throat and disrespectful."
bad,The work was hard not to fun. they required very hard work with very little talking. they wanted to squeeze as much work out of you as they possibly could.
bad,Management does very little for the workers. Hours and scarcely given and pay rate is not guaranteed. More than once I've been shorted on my checks. Hours can be taken by anyone above you in the system.
bad,I have been at my Kroger store for many years and it seems that management are not leaders. The company seems to be so pro customer that it really doesn't protect its employees. Working here you are constantly asked to do multiple jobs that are not yours. They spend more time trying to quickly clean up the current mess and never trying to solve the reason the mess keeps happening. They attack their employees on performance but don't offer any solution.
bad,I was fired for doing what my supervisor told me I could do. Enough said. This was at the Broadway store. Very unprofessional and somewhat dangerous place to work.
bad,"Kroger owned Fred Meyer's company views you as an interchangeable cog more than a person. They don't care about your family or personal life at all even if you hardly ever request time off and/or work over time. If you work for this company you might as well be willing and ready to give up most of your life and have it revolve around them. For example... they are happy to change up your schedule and hours on you randomly (even if you've been a loyal, rule following employee) if it benefits them in anyway. HORRIBLE company."
bad,"I do not like to work again. They stress the technicians too much,and they do not care about them. Even though it was nice to work in a retail pharmacy, I hate to re work there."
bad,"Slow store that was completely run off food stamps. If EBT went down, the entire store was empty except for around 3 customers. Place that was run by college kids and high schoolers. Very poor management when I was there which caused high turnover. Management was why I left, I ended up doing every department because everyone was quitting but I only got barley above minimum wage while my manager got $20 an hour for us to do his job."
bad,This is the worst management culture I have ever been a part of in my professional career.  The stress and pressure associated with this company is unacceptable at best.
bad,I worked at a few Kroger stores and went through plenty of managers and they all suck. Management only cares about themselves. Customers steal and trash the stores. Employees are high school students that refuse to do their job and no one does anything about it.
bad,"The management didn't care about anything important and here was almost no opportunities for me to help in any way beyond what I already did. Overall, I'd say if you want to be treated with any respect in a job, find a different one than this."
bad,"almost all employees start out at minimum wage, you gain a 15 cent increase each year you are there. The management staff doesn't care about the employees. The employees fight and argue constantly and try to pawn their workload off on others. They don't adhere to your work requirements when you are part-time. Issues are not dealt with when they are reported and the manager of the dept is allowed to punish you for reporting issues. Advancement only happen for the people who know other upper level employees. Overall it is a very stressful and bad place to work."
bad,"The frontend is a mess there is never enough help on the evening shift, my direct boss's hide in the office always doing some ""reports"". They never have any of the breaks given when I arrive, so I have to be on a register upwards of six hours of my shifts. The other departments don't fair any better-expired tags or products everywhere all the other employees refuse to help customers always bringing them to the front end. The cause of all this, in my opinion, is the union, they prevent people from getting fired, I have seen people steal, get fired then come back with higher pay. It is all just bad joke how its all run have a problem with, management of a store just send them to another store."
bad,"They play favorites when promoting. If they don't like you, even if it has nothing to do with your work, they will cut your hours and deny your vacation."
bad,Kroger in itself is a secent company its bramches such as loaf and jug are a joke and should be avoided at all costs as far as employemnet goes. I never worked at king soopers or a grocery store but their convenience stores were a joke.
bad,It was one of the worst places I've ever worked. The other employees within the bakery/deli were ferocious. And the manager was obtuse and only concerned about his vacations that he was constantly taking.
bad,A typical day was crazy busy. I learned customer service skills. Managment was rude. The hardest thing was collecring varts. i honestly did not like anything about working at kroger.
bad,for such a big company you would expect the management to act accordingly. But they behaved very poorly. Management was a big click. if you weren't in you could never ask off or get a good scheduled.
bad,The company is going through a down turn and everything is changing and the company isn't recovering. The turnover is incredible and they are having to take dramatic steps just to keep people.
bad,"They just don't pay fairly, I started at krogers at minim wage and after 2 years I still only made 7.45."
bad,To be such a big company it didn't care about their employees or family. had to work weekends or you were bullied by management. they would cut your hours if you missed for any reason they desired.
bad,"Management is absolutely terrible, they don’t know how to even run a store correctly. They continuously prove how incompetent they are, especially the store manager."
bad,"The management are all hateful and will attack you if you even do one minor thing wrong. That left me with just my few coworkers in my department to rely on and out of the 7 or 8 coworkers, I could only trust 3 or 4 of them. The others weren't that kind to me, really. The management is the biggest thing wrong about this place, and I honestly think that Kroger needs to rethink on who they give these roles to."
bad,managers and supervisors besides one hated working at the job felt above all didn't show care too workers nor did they help with learning on the job i had too learn all on my own with help from employees
bad,When I was 17 got paid minimum wage for 2 and a half years very very very very unorganized place expect way to much out of you like their going to give you a 5 dollar raise
bad,"My experience working at kroger was horrible that managers were rude, and they did not truly care about the customers. I would note recommend Kroger to anyone."
bad,"I Would not send my worse enemy to Kroger to work. Department heads have way too much work for an 12 hour shift, let alone a normal 8 hour shift. Never provided with decent help. Too much micromanaging going on. Store managers expect impossible goals to be achieved. Would only recommend this company to people who are super high energy level folks. Upper management only cares about the almighty dollar, not the customers they so claim to put first. This company takes hardworking people and burns them out. BE WARE!"
bad,Management is not good. Act as if every employee is disposable. Not very straight forward with what job you are doing.Managers would come in late everyday.
bad,"We were expected to work sick or hurt, also expected to stay several hours late with no notice and waive overtime. Department level management seemed to be completely in charge and there seemed to be no oversight from store management on how they treated employees."
bad,"Moving into a management role is salaried, so with the hours per week worked all the managers in-store (with exception of the store manager), end up making less per hour than department managers.  Expect to have no life outside of the store, as the MINIMUM expectation was 50 hours per week (and often ended up being more than that).  Not worth the stress and time for the absurdly low pay."
bad,"Unfair pay, no hours, and stressful workplace as well as you work hard but dont get paid as much as your work is worth. One week i only got $97. I requested full time but they lied and gave me a part time. Not reccommend at all"
bad,"Nobody ever did their job, the manager was rude, the different department managers were never there to do their jobs. Everyone lower than management was treated poorly and they never took account to the schedule you provide"
bad,"Nothing happy about working here. Extremely slow work environment that made you want to spend your whole paycheck on your breaks on nothing. We had to take 1 hour lunches, and that was way too long. I would rather leave that hour early..."
bad,"The management at this store is absolutely awful. Management is cut-throat, days off are hard to come by, and you feel like you are walking on eggshells the entire time. It's like a little high school with people constantly gossiping. Schedule changes are made at any given time, with no warning in advance. I worked at multiple Kroger stores and loved it... the morehead store is just garbage. I recommend Kroger, just not this Kroger. 0/10."
bad,"No help, no overtime, impossible standards to maintain with loss of associates. Management  never excepts responsibility when they make mistakes, instead they blame others."
bad,"I wouldn't work for Kroger  because the training is horrible, low pay, no benefits and bad Managers. And also you tend to feel belittled often.so personally it's it's a horrible place."
bad,learned that management is only interested in their own success and the interests and concern of workers is not taken into account.  management sees nothing I do well but pounces whenever I have 'done something wrong'
bad,"People didn't work as a team, they always want to talk about people, couldn't work with the schedule you need, didn't care about the employees, the mangers don't do nothing"
bad,My years at Kroger have become more stressful and unrewarding. You are pushed beyond the limits of one person. The expectation of employees is unrealistic due to the means they give us.
bad,Colleagues instigate gossips and rumors that create a hostile environment which is a place that should not have any relations with colleagues as people create high school drama out of boredom. Productive workers get punished by poor management who intends to take advantage of productivity by assigning more work to diligent workers and give less work and the luxury of having less work to those they like. Unprofessional and I would not recommend this to anyone as their first job. People are better off working at a restaurant as a first job.
bad,"I have worked for the company for many years. I have seen too many co-workers struggle with the lack of pay, go without food, lose homes and worse. I have lost faith in this company and don't wish to be associated with it any longer than necessary."
bad,Store managers and department managers are horrible. Very disrespectful. Pay isn't enough. Department Managers are lazy. False promise of advancement.
bad,Wasn't very fond of my position. Management was terrible. The work hours were unfavorable. I was never scheduled many hours but was always called in. I don't like the fact that I don't know what days specifically I'm working ahead of time.
bad,"The turnover is the highest I've ever seen and the managers are constantly wondering why.  Employees who have worked there for years and want to work full time are constantly denied so that the company doesn't have to pay them benefits.  Instead, new employees are hired and quit after a few months.  They constantly abuse the union/non-union system by forcing non-union employees to do the work of union employees for less pay.  This company is disgusting.  The people who work there are cool though."
bad,Management is a joke at least in the deli department area and grocery area if you like bullying in the work place and gossip then this is the ideal job for you.
bad,"It has been a while since I worked at Kroger, but the management was terrible at my store. Multiple store managers would be transferred on a regular basis, and each one had their own ideas for how they wanted it done, so really, it was not a great experience. In my sub dept., my manager should never have been in her position in the first place, since she could not handle the stress it gave her almost every day. Also, if I were to do something in a different order compared to the norm, then it was apparently the worst thing I could have ever done according to her. Our dept also had our hours cut, so I was not even able to work more than 20 hours a week, even though I was working much harder than other employees in the dept. All thanks to the terrible seniority rules they have. Apparently you can be terrible at your job, but if you've been around a minute longer than the hardest working employee in the entire company, you deserve more benefits than them."
bad,"Rumors all around the store throughout about the apparel department manager made it very difficult to maintain any amount of respect for that person.  His management skills were lacking and lazy to say the least as he was unwilling to meet his responsibilities as a manager.  Several employees had filed complaints about this person and no action had been taken to rectify any issues within the department.  The department employees were severely underappreciated and understaffed. "
bad,"Schedules could change with a days notice, no room for advancing as the company goes off a seniority system, so no matter how good you are at your job someone who has been there longer then you will be promoted before you even if they are not as productive or skilled."
bad,company doesn't care about their employees. I was forced to work in the file center while there was a water leak coming out of a pipe with live wires. the place could have burst into flames and the entire fuel center could have exploded with me inside. management told me to just chill and take care of the customers.
bad,"i could not handle how disorganized the company was, the pay was not worth the headaces you will receive. but everybidy has there own opinion so we will see"
bad,Krogers Is a job for teenagers. your check secures gas and food don't know about the bills. Your consistently moving around like a chicken with no head. Very bias on position changes. Not worth the time.
bad,"No work life balance "
bad,"Responsibilities required providing outstanding customer service, bagging customer groceries, assisting customers to their vehicles with groceries if needed, sending back unwanted items, clearing all needed shopping carts off of the parking lot in a timely and efficient manner, cleaning aisle spills or debris, and janitorial duties."
bad,"Solid, profitable company. Everyone living will forever have to eat. Company need to focus on being more people oriented. No work life balance. Low pay"
bad,"Lousiest pay ever, no raises, overworked and underpaid and its a shame. It could be a nice place to work with the right changes. Forget your life, Kroger comes first, never get your time off approved or plan a vacation...."
bad,Kroger did not have any benefits and the manegmers at the Kroger I worked at were aggressive and seemingly uncaring.  I would not recommend working at Kroger.
bad,"the pharmacy at xtown Kroger is a very negative place to work and I probably the same for a lot of the customers. This is due to the employees in the pharmacy being extremely negative, loud and abrasive with other coworkers and customers."
bad,kroger is a good place to work if you like retail. The hours are long bu t the pay makes it worth it. there are opportunities for advancement so that is great.
bad,You may be good at assisting with customers purchases at the cash register.  But nobody tells you from the very beginning what is expected if more than 2 employees on a shift.  Like clean your aisle and bring candy up to front of box.  Customers recognize vehicles of employee so they come in or not.
bad,"I'm a student, and my manager asked why I couldn't work 7 days a week, 8 hours a day, and then got upset because I refused her. Customers were rude, management was terrible."
bad,"Daily routine can be stressful it is a union environment and is very unstable"
bad,"If you want to constantly have to worry about a knife in your back Kroger is the perfect job for you. Managers that smile hiding lies behind it, even co-workers looking to advance want you out of the way. I don't recommend this job to anyone. "
bad,Kroger does a great deal for the community.  The level of stress is high and high turn over.  Management is a revolving door.  The food industry is exciting and fun!
bad,The coworkers are absolutely amazing . The management is horrible. Overall my experience here is teaching me valuable life lessons although they have some work that needs to be done with the management.
bad,"A typical day at work started at 5am. Got the deli display ready. Learned how to slice deli meats, rod chickens, set up various displays. Got along very well with all of my coworkers. The hardest part of my job was working too hard for too little pay but I enjoyed being able to assist customers and use my customer service skills."
bad,"Was told something was going to happen and it didn't. Not happy at all. They tell you what you want to hear and when you make decisions based on that, they don't uphold their end to the bargain."
bad,"The office is severely understaffed and headcount reductions continue to occur, which leads to more workload on staff. Management has no concept of work/life balance and working over 50 hours a week is pretty typical, if not required in order to complete tasks."
bad,Kroger in White House was a terrible experience for me personally. Not willing to move me to a different department due to several medical conditions. Management was very rude throughout my career at Kroger
bad,The type of company that will send you home in tears on a daily basis. A company who cares deeply for its customers but not it's employees.
bad,"First off they are union, which has its pros and cons."
bad,"great place to get started in retail,hard to balance work/life, great employees.fantastic customers. clean well lit stores, inventory always kept as full as possible"
bad,Management doesn't care about you or your life outside of Kroger. Managers are rude and abrasive. The only perk of working here are the semi decent super cheap benefits.
bad,"I don't have anything nice to say....so I probably shouldn't say anything at all."
bad,"my day to day "
bad,"A day at Kroger's starts with customers first. Kroger's is really big on greeting, engaging and satisfying their customers. The management wasn't the best. Some managers were more polite than others. Our staff did a great job at working together as a team. Some of us are still friends and keep in touch."
bad,"The wage is no where near enough to live on, no room for advancement and a one year wait for benefits. I would not recommend employment here to anyone."
bad,"The sales/customer service part of the job was great! I always had an awesome time interacting with customers and helping them walk away with that one thing they couldn't live without (Diamonds!)"
bad,I work alone with no help. The store directors walk around to make sure I am doing my job and put more work on me but never lifting a finger beside straightening a thing or two. They expect you to do everything and without help and you'd better not go overtime. They push all workers like slaves so they can earn their nice bonuses while the ones that do all the hard work get nothing but a $2 giftcard. Majority of co-workers are nice and really hard working people. They are the only thing that keeps me from losing my mind working here.
bad,horrible. treats employees bad and pay is not good. not much hours. management will control and bully staff to get what they want. expect customer service but treats staff like trash.
bad,"Horrible place to work. Management is horrible! Was told by area manager that dedication don't matter! They work managers to death! I worked 12-18 hours, called in on my days off! Not enough staff. Can't keep anyone because they only give them 20 hours a week then wonder why the store looks horrible. I enjoyed working with the associates. The expectations are to high for the little pay you get. If the associate don't get the conditioned properly it's automatically your fault. You have a huge closing list to get done you don't have time to always check on everything. I learned that no matter what ideas you have its never good enough. And they will take advantage of managers. I missed to many school activities because I always got called in."
bad,"Low pay, with even lower raises, no hours. this job is only for teenagers who need gas money. there are no benefits for employees and no one gets family health care insurance!!!!!"
bad,I would go in at 2:30 pm and get off at 10:30pm. I came in and cleaned and cut meat and did customer service. My management was not the best.
bad,"There was a lot of miscommunications when it came to perform work according to plan, lack of teamwork. I learned that trust can be easily broken when working with stubborn management with closed minds not willing to listen to others ideas."
bad,Some coworkers started slacking and night crew responsible for their slack. Not that friendly vibe. Some employees aren't friendly to customers. Some coworkers put blame on others when they didn't do what was their responsibility then management gets involved. Management doesn't speak to other coworkers when they were told about something happening in work area. Some employees don't go on breaks due to all the things they have to get done before the end of their shift. The hardest part of job is trying to have a nice work place and day. The most enjoyable part is the smiles on the customers faces.
bad,"Kroger Company is a respected grocery store but the store doesn't respect it's employees. I found myself working 8+ hours, while still in high school, losing money to the union and performing the jobs and tasks of my superiors."
bad,"I learned customer service skills"
bad,"Not enough hours to run department, taking department heads and leads out of there departments to fulfill someone else department."
bad,Assist with removing carts from the parking lot. Offer customers carry-out service at the completion of transactions. Stock and reorganized display items on the shelf.
bad,"Don't look for work at store #445...EVER. Management is horrible, store is terrible, customers are extremely rude and management sides with THEM. Too much fraternizing and too little professionalism...If you value your sanity, please, don't work here."
bad,"I worked for Several of their stores, and the mindset was always the same, ""Sell the groceries, don't tell anyone if you're being harassed, all we care about is our sales."" "
bad,"Hired to work Customer Service in Deli, but basically a janitor to clean up after the morning crew, not doing anything in the morning to help out the afternoon crew. Management is hopeless in helping you out. I really don't know if they really care about customer service."
bad,"A typical day at work was always dealing with chronic under staffing and faulty equipment. As a manager, I willingly and did shuffle my personal life to accommodate the needs of my department. I came in early even overnight after working all day. I went in on days off. I was available to my staff for inquiries even on my days off. I put off vacation time for months The staff was usually very demoralized, overworked, and stressed out.I was sent to different assignments to fix issues and they were always the same issues. As soon as progress was made I was sent to a new more challenging situation.Although, this did teach me a whole new level of multi tasking it also taught me how important developing a team is. Even skilled labor was brought in at minimum wage at least till their experience was verified. As my original Merchandiser used to say, ""You get what you pay for!""  Although corporate training was a long arduous computer based marathon it had nothing to do with specialized departments.As a department head, I was given only a 4 hour,""on-boarding"",training shift with little if any notice. Usually, I was so under staffed there was very little opportunity to give the new hires the attention and support they would need to be successful. I was given very little ""training"", it was much more sink or swim. That is fine for me but is not optimal for most associates success.Having moved to variety of situations my most dependable and productive staff would always show such appreciation for the knowledge I would share. This showed me that not only was I hungry for strong leadership"
bad,"If you have a job do not quit it for a job at Kroger State Avenue."
bad,"I was trained by my manager so I could replace her when she left. Upper management told me I was too young for her position, so they hired someone 40 years older than me who could not remember anything. I did his COMPLETE job - ordering, merchandising, production. After a month, I went to speak with management about it and was ignored. I spoke to my old manager who told me to write a ""sales"" inspired pitch to him and I got a head turn, but they still expected me to do this persons job while I made minimum wage. When I put in my 2 weeks, they offered his job to me and said they would transfer him to a different store so it wasn't awkward. They offered me a $10 raise and I was interested. When we had the ""on the record"" talk, I was offered a $3 raise with another $2 in 6 months - this is huge for kroger who gives a max of 10 cents a year or 40 cents a promotion (was offered assistant deli manager position for 7.75 an hour). I denied and moved on. Sales dropped tremendously. I even had corporate people visit me at my new job and tell me there was always room for me if I wanted to come back."
bad,"When I was first employed here, our people were GREAT. Later, management changed and it became extremely difficult to go into work."
bad,"The company doesn't care how little areas their employees get as long as they are not considered full time and they do not have to provide benefits. Loved most of the bosses there, but not work only getting 14 hrs a week as an adult. How do they expect to have serious employees if they are not willing to be a family orientated business??"
bad,"Kroger's is a company that does not stand behind their employees. Management will tell employees to do one thing and when a customer asks for a management after following their directions, management will always side with the customers."
bad,"For the amout of negativity and drama you deal with, the pay, benefits, and 401K are not worth it."
bad,"I was not informed of what position I was going to be in, Nor was I fully trained for it. When the work became to much for me to handle, i went and asked the GM for help, his response? ""It's your job, you signed up for it. Suck it up."" How rude, right??"
bad,"There are great opportunities to advance if you are hard working and have a positive attitude."
bad,Productive and fast pace nice work place . Wonderful people. loved the customers. loved cake decarating.and baking.Their was alway s something to do
bad,"Well, to start off... Krogers at first was an ok first job till I worked there for a while. Jumping into big compactors and working in the bottle room was just plain out nasty and they was making me do stuff not even in the job title!!!"
bad,"Its my first place of employment and I have been here for almost a year now. The only good thing i can really say is that my coworkers are easy to get along with and they are all hard workers. But I will say that it is one of the worst places to work at that I can think of. The management is really bad with everything, there's no room for advancement, we get no benefits and really bad hours and pay. The main front end manager treats her employees with little respect and dignity and never gives us our breaks (i have worked many days with no breaks). We go through so many baggers here because we get treated like dirt. If I didn't work in a small town, i would have left the place months ago."
bad,"Worked long hours in the beginning, but once the year mark was reached hours dropped to 4 a week. Schedule began changing late in the week with no warning. Often got called and asked why I wasn't at work, when I wasn't scheduled prior to the change. Caught many coworkers sleeping, having sex, or otherwise not doing their jobs, but these things were ignored by my GM manager. Between the poor hours, horrible co-workers, and refusal of a 5 cent raise (I had worked enough hours for one), I turned in my 2 weeks notice to the store manager."
bad,"They will lie to you about getting a raise or just ""forget"" to give your raise because it is too much work for them. I had to force my boss to give me one while he was lying to other employees and then they ""forgot"" to give me two more! This is all while they lie to you about career advancement opportunities."
bad,Work hard management don't care weekly checks etc you work very hard for the money
bad,"I worked there for 2-1/2 years. I did my best to advance within the company, especially since I had a great deal of relevant experience. However, their ""level"" system and need to pass countless computer training sessions, made that impossible. We were so short staffed, your managers would never allow you any time to complete training, which had to be done on the clock. They only promoted white males, who used to work with Dominick's. I had a ten cent raise in the entire time I was there. I was insulted and called racial slurs by several customers, but my manager refused to stand up for me, and tried to make me apologize to the customers."
bad,"Co-workers did not seem to work together, but against one another, often stabbing each other in the back.  I was often criticized by co-workers as being an over-achiever.  Co-workers only shared information with their ""friends"", leaving others ""on the outside"" unaware of important information needed to successfully complete work detail.  Bad mouthing of supervisor was the ""norm"".  Management seemed unaware, or didn't care--I don't know!  Those promoted to next upper position often favored ""friends"".  When management wasn't looking or left out the door, the overall environment changed immediately.  My co-workers suddenly quit working and they all went on breaks together, often leaving me to do more than should have been expected, often leaving me unable to keep up with serving all customers at that time.  Working at Kroger was a rude awakening as to what some co-workers are capable of doing.  I watched many co-workers shopping on the clock, visiting with each other on company time, or visiting excessively with customers/friends who happen to be shopping there. I noticed a lot of favoritism and nepotism within the entire store.  I didn't believe this was a good management practice.  I felt there was an alarming turn-over rate of employment.  Few hours, low pay and no benefits is usually the reason for that.  However, I enjoyed meeting and servicing customers, many who still recognize and talk to me today."
bad,A day there will make you very stressful. I only  learned how to cut meat in the it should be cut. Management was ok but did not have people skills. Co workers did not want to be there and and did not want to do the work that was giving to them. the hardest part was dealing with stock. The most enjoyable part was making a customer happy.
bad,"After being trained in as a Cashier for a new Mariano's store, I was expecting to be able to have a more steady part time job than what this one turned out to be.  My last week there ended with only 12 working hours in the week.  The schedule I had & not knowing the future schedule until the week before just wasn't worth the hassle so I ended up leaving & taking a job at Starbucks.  The best part of my day at Mariano's was talking to my co-workers who were always doing their best to help each other.  Almost everyone there was very nice!  About the only time I really saw the managers in the store was when they were running past me.  They looked stressed out most of the time so never much had the chance to interact with any of them.  The hardest part of this job was working at some of the restaurants in the store where I was sent sometimes to fill in.  No training basically just thrown in a position & expected to know what you're doing.  The pay wasn't enough for their expectations."
bad,Good customer service experience with the company over the years. 
bad,"Hours fluctuated weekly, pay was low, managers did not respect the employees"
bad,"I worked for Marino's for almost a year. I started as a general team member which basically meant you did almost anything they asked in every department. The management was terrible. They were very rude and disrespectful to the employees, they were not respectful to their employees time, especially those who were still in school. The store manager was racist and the assistant store manager was sexist. I eventually moved on the the Produce department and worked for the Salad Bar. I learned how to carefully cut fruit and assemble catering orders. All my co-workers complained about working for Mariano's but they still provided exceptional service. I really enjoyed working in the salad bar I just wish the management was more tolerable. "
bad,I actually worked this job while in college. After I graduated I moved to another state. The hourly was really low; benefits were ok. I was in college then and it worked nice with my schedule at the time.
bad,"Ample gossiping and insufficient professionalability. The Huntsville, AL store was a very good place to work at. This was in respect to the management and how they carried themselves ,of course. After transferring my position to another store in the state of Texas I was extremely consternated to find the disgusting way in which the management carried themselves in the most unprofessional way that I have ever seen people of authoritive positions carry themselves. Gossiping, joking, making fun of their subordinants. This was a truly sickening and most miserable place to work at."
bad,-Bad Managment
bad,"Worked with Kroger for 2 yrs. No job advancement, you have 32 other stores bidding on any job postings. Older employees, ( that have been with Kroger 10+ yrs), have better pay because of older contracts. The newer employees start off around $ 7.00 and it takes 15 months to get any benefits. Very poor Management Team @ the Barboursville, WV location. I have worked as an Manager for 13 yrs in the Food and Retail environment.( Sears,Wal-Mart,Wendys and Burger King). I have never seen a management team, like Barboursvilles Kroger, walking around the store with a coffee in inhand and another with a "" spit"" bottle for his chew, on the sales floor everyday.I will NEVER tell anyone looking for a job to go to Krogers in Barboursville, WV"
bad,"Fun, able to work with nice people, busy at sometimes.... Some of the employees at times were given special treatment, but that is common in most jobs. I worked in the office before leaving Kroger, that was ok, stessfull at times. Dealing with people can almost always be stressful."
bad,"Huge Disconnect between corporate and the hourly staff. Running stores on skeleton crews with too many expectations and not enough staff, nor hours available to hire."
bad,Everyone is looking out for themselves they do not know the meaning of “teamwork” you don’t get recognized when you go above and beyond. Wouldn’t recommend.
bad,"Kroger is constantly focused on their sales and customer satisfaction. Very little regard for associates recognition, awards and inclusion. The shareholders run the company. Managers aren’t trustworthy."
bad,"I started off thinking that this was a decent place to work. Now I see it as no more than a means to an end. I simply do not like working there anymore. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad place to start off at. It is, however, not a place you want to make a career out of."
bad,"High accountability for paperwork, reports, and customer service"
bad,"Good job for young people or people trying to get back in the job field, not a life long job. It served its purpose for me while I was in school. But management is horrible and always changing."
bad,Pro easy money Cons doesn’t pay good and employees are rude. I worked there for 15 years and it got to the point I hated coming in at all. The management is horrible too they are not consistent and don’t care about their employees
bad,"Management plays favorites sometimes you get a good one, most are terrible. Unobtainable standards.  No hours for employees and no work life balance unless working is your life.  Want your availability to be 24 7 and good luck getting holidays, weekends, or any requested time off.  Overtime can also be forced on you and the union is a joke after the last president left.  You are better off fighting for yourself"
bad,This position was eliminated a couple of years ago as a part of restructuring a.k.a. put more money in corporates pocket. Now they have fired lower management and this position has been recreated to pay someone half the pay to do the job of a manager. Company sucks! Wouldnt recommend!
bad,"My job at Kroger was an easy job. But due to bad management it made it possibly one of the more stressful things I’ve personally endured. Multiple co-workers were very slow paced and when brought up to management literally nothing was done, And When we’d complain to corporate about the handheld devices not being returned to the office they’d never respond or acknowledge the problem."
bad,"OK job if you don't mind working 60-70 hours a week...….and you will as a salaried manager...... since resources are continually depleted at store level and support level.  Every office support level and hourly paid level cut-back ends up on the backs of the 4 salaried store management team.  You can't accomplish what is expected in the 70 hours a week....so stress levels are very high."
bad,This is a union based company which provides job security. The store level management at this company is unwilling to work with your personal life as far as work schedules are concerned. They expect you to meet incomprehensible deadlines and/or time you no matter what your position is. Store management and Kroger Pick-Up supervisor uses intimidation techniques and micromanaging.  Luckily management changes every few years but district management does nothing to remedy the situation.  Turnover rate of employees is extremely high.
bad,"Workplace culture centers off those that have done the time, not on the overall work and atmosphere of the group.  Nepotism is rampant in this job and benefits are next to non-existent compared to competitors.  If you are starting your career with some experience, DO NOT START HERE.  It will make you depressed and stressed, which isn't what life and a job are about."
bad,"empIoved my job, but they take full advantage of you, once you start improving and learning your specific job.  The front end Supervisors are always bad and disrespectful also the FORGET IT, YOUR SURVEY IS HAS BAD AS THE KROGER'S I WORKED AT."
bad,"Summary says it. Poor management at this location. Currently seeking other employment because of workplace abuse/bullying. I have a team lead that involves herself in my personal life, speaks poorly of each of us, but never to the person directly, always to whoever else is on the clock. She's predatory, and has not once, but TWICE abused a co-worker with mental disabilities and used their high impressionable personality to spread rumors and discourse in the workplace.."
bad,Unions have ruined this company. Forced management to become defensive and ignore decent workers.  There is zero reason for organized labor to be in a grocery store.  Protects only the lousy workers
bad,"Kroger feeds.the human spirit through lies, fear, and intimidation. Be prepared to be treated as nothing more than an inconvenience to obtain a better profit margin."
bad,No good for advancement. Takes to long to get a full time position. Hours are terrible. No overtime. The union is strong. You have to work in multiple departments to get hours
bad,The job pays low for the amount of work you do But the workers a great on the flip side  Which made a easier work environment   Management not very helpful
bad,If you need a job then take it but as soon as you get a chance leave. New hires were being paid 3-5 dollars more then people who been there a year plus. Drama nothing but drama. Managers dating employees. Managers hitting on underage employees. Racist store manager. Management will not help you!
bad,"When I first started working there, it was great.  But after so many managers,you get one that sucks.  Dept heads, asst dept heads and management  do not listen to employees. If you complain,  you get more work put on you.  There is favoritism with certain employees and you are not treated fairly. Been trying to transfer since January,  never happened,  so I quit."
bad,"I worked 3 different jobs at my store, bagger, cashier, and a Drug/Gm associate. All 3 were bad in their own ways, but understaffing and overworking of employees is prevalent in every department. Management was useless, only enforcing the rules that served no actual purpose but to made the employees miserable.  "
bad,Nothing bad I just will never work there again management is not all the way together there it's sad place to work and that is all I wish everyone luck if they do work there I saw a lot of ppl come n go in the short time I been there I'm hoping it get better than wat it is
bad,"none, would not like to submit a review at this time."
bad,You are not guaranteed hours if you are not full time. It is hard to earn a full time position. Hours are constantly cut and you are expected to do work of 2-3 people. Usually under staffed due to hours or employee turnover. Stressful work environment. Over worked. Not paid enough for the daily expectations and work load. No benefits for part time and not allowed to have availability.
bad,worst job i ever had. was expected to come in with my car stuck in 10 inches of snow. they were unprofessional and i hated my life while i was there. gave me carpal tunnel. if you are gonna work there dont stay long
bad,The work conditions become to dangerous. The pay was not worth staying and it was becoming very harmful to my health I would not recommend this job for anyone
bad,I talk to most people I know in and out of workplace and most people don't recommend working there. As for co-worker's they all looked miserable and exhausted from the high levels of stress and customer interactions they have to deal with. I was working there for 2 months and never felt more mistreated in my life.
bad,put in countless hours of hard work and dedication to be walked over and treated poorly by management in my time there at Kroger. Out of everything in my job experience I've dealt with numerous misunderstandings and poor communication skills with my associates.
bad,The company has changed tremendously within the last few years!!! The morale and respect of the local stores are very HORRIBLE now!!! I use to Love my job and the company and now I  literally HATE working for them and hate going to work!! I'm currently looking for new employment  outside of the company.
bad,"Good place to work of your an butt kiss, I put years into that company and got crapped on by management and the union is useless. Management doesnt give a dam as long as they get there bonuses"
bad,"This is a very blind leading the blind company. No training but all the responsibility!! The turnover is worse than McDonald’s! This is a job for children, no one with any dependents should even waste their energy with this company."
bad,"No support to do your job right from people above store management, and increasingly high standards without the tools or staff to complete the job at hand the way it should be. Training is a joke. They drive out the good workers in place of drones. Do not recommend AT ALL"
bad,"Would not reccomend anyone work at kroger if they had any other options. It wasn't worth it. The work is tedious, overly micromanaged, and overly critisized by a management staff that only cares about their bonuses instead of the employees that make them happen."
bad,the schedule was sporadic with large amounts of over time do to poor management. The work life balance is hard to maintain with every changing schedule and swing shift being a common occurrence.
bad,"Kroger gave me a great opportunity in that I was only seeking part time work as a cashier.  I advanced rapidly and offered full time employment in a company that does not actively seek such.  However, the pay, to me, was not matched to the stress of the work and many long time employees were not happy as in the past.  "
bad,"As a young person just entering the work force, I found the environment at Kroger to be quite chaotic. Lower management is disrespectful and upper management is clueless"
bad,Under paid. Over worked in deli. Not enough work time  in other areas to make up for the low salary.  The managers lack integrity and honesty and an overloaded with deception. No respect for your time.
bad,"Working at Kroger was by far the worst job experience of my life. Management didn’t respect availability what so ever. When I talked to my store manager that my front end manager kept going outside my availability, he started talking me down and telling me Ive become an “inconvenience to the company.” I wanted to laugh when they acted confused when I put in my two weeks notice. They make it seem like you can chose your hours in the hiring process.... thats a bunch of bologna."
bad,"While the work environment itself wasn't necessarily stressful compared to some other jobs, at my time of working there a lot of the employees were very lazy and neither supervisors nor management seemed to really want to motivate anyone to work harder, since the two employees who did work hard picked up on the slack while some of them would sit around in the break room or hide in the supply closet, meaning if you were one of the two employees who had to work hard you had to do the work that was scheduled for at least 5 people. Sometimes even with a list of duties laid out for some of the courtesy clerks, it wouldn't get done so it would still fall on you to perform that job. "
bad,Kroger is overall a bad choice for a job option. Management is horrible at communicating to their associates about scheduling and time off. Associates are consistently bullied by management (called into an office and being yelled at for fun and being told to do things out of the job description
bad,"The district managers that run certain regions are incompetent. The lack of business acumen makes the job stressful because the competition is gaining market share and Kroger leadership panics and doesn’t have a plan so they panic and make store level management hate their jobs, which shows in job moral and performance. Horrible place to work! Don’t do it!"
bad,Not a very good place to work. I worked in the apparal department and would be bullied by coworkers and savataged.  I would do everything I was asked and would have coworkers come behind me and make a mess of what I just cleaned. I have a peanut allergy  and my coworkers that worked in the same department as me would leave peanuts on the floor in the dressing room all the time and they knew about my allergy.
bad,"no matter how much you work or how much you give, they don't seem to care. it is all about upper management. raises and pay scale are weak at best. I was disappointed."
bad,Expectations are way too high. Mangement expects the same amount of work to be done whether its 2 or 5 people. High turnover rate. Time Shaving (pay attention to your pay stubs). Upper management is very disrespectful. They talk to you any kind of way. They talk about you behind your back. Regular employees are all nice for the most part.
bad,"I work in the pharmacy which is constantly understaffed, overworked, and abused by patients.  Most days are spent performing the work of 2 people, training new employees that quit within the first 6 months because it's overwhelming and not worth the stress, and being micromanaged by corporate policies that change regularly.  The office wants employees to be up-to-date on current promotions, backordered medications, standard operating procedures, but there's no time between filling thousands of prescriptions and asking patients to sign up for this or donate to this to read the weekly 4-5 page newsletter.  I'm supposed to sign patients up for auto refills, auto notifications, iOS/android app, and medication syncing program, verify name, dob, address, phone #, and insurance every time they walk up to the pharmacy while answering phones, questions from random shoppers and new hires, and counting meds all at the same time.  Too many metrics, not enough help, and not enough money to be worth the stress!  Don't waste your time."
bad,"It was a decent first job, but very difficult to advance or move up. There are many other employers that pay better and offer opportunities to move up or change departments."
bad,Kroger is so under staffed it’s really sad don’t seem to care still expect same results with not enough help. Pay is pretty far behind other company’s .tell you one thing then change with out warning
bad,Don't work at the kroger on george dement road. Most managers there are lazy. Clicklist is the worst department. If you don't want to work with lazy people don't work there
bad,"You are expected to do the job of 3 people and only get paid for one. New want a be , managers train here , constantly giving you orders , constantly telling you to work faster, harder, or get wrote up! Union can do nothing,  just make your time there tougher if you call them for help, no breaks and they only care about their paychecks not the company not you! And then you have the customer treating you like a lower class citizen,  if you are not a brown noser you won't survive."
bad,Kroger have poor management the pay sucks and they treat like your in boot camp it great for high school students.and it great that you get paid every thursdays for the week and the paid period is it start on sunday through wednesday.
bad,Never was treated fairly and was always being over worked and fussed at when you don’t do something according to the very unrealistic schedule the heads of Kroger put in place. It’s very poorly run wouldn’t recommend
bad,The management is not supportive. Basically you have many priorities and not enough time to do any well.  Then you are in trouble because you didn't do the impossible.  Every day you felt you may be fired.  You are constantly told that you don't do a good job.  They don't want to hear that you are overwhelmed.  Everyone is job hunting.
bad,Worked here for 6 months; decided to change my status from full time to prn due to another job offering me much more. I was unknowingly” terminated” because they asked me to work a day that I couldn’t. I wouldn’t recommend anyone to work here unless you don’t have any major bills.
bad,My management changed about 1.5 years into my employment and the situation has gotten so much worse after that. No hours. Low pay. Just so done with this place at this point.
bad,"I recently worked for krogers and my Manager was completely unprofessional  and a complete bully. would tell me I was doing great to my face then turn around and tell upper management that I was doing horrible.  purposely gave me horrible hours, scheduled me on days that were preapproved before starting my employment that I was not available to work, talked bad about me and other employees to customers and other associates, and used my personal out of work situations against me to twist and lie to get me fired. This was by far the worse work experience I've ever had!!! lied pushed and nagged upper management till they finally fired me just because she didn't care for me or my past and used it against me. Upper management was also very unprofessional and didn't even address me with any of the complaints the Manager had made against me, or address me before they fired me. My Manager sabotaged my employment on purpose instead of coming to me like an adult and respectfully addressing the issue's  she was having with me. I would have respectfully moved departments or done whatever was necessary to address the issues and make her feel better. But instead went about it completely unprofessional and completely blind sided me and ruin my employment at kroger's. I would never recommend nor work at another krogers ever again. The amount of disrespect, lies and backstabbing that goes on there is ABSOLUTELY ridiculous!!! Other then that part of my job experience at krogers, it was AMAZING. Not everyone is a horrible person, and the customers are amazing! Some of the employees are very easy"
bad,"Management is horrible, the pay isn’t worth it!!! I work in the pharmacy, since there I’ve had multiple racial discrimination behaviors from one of my managers, on top of that I was fired! Long story short Krogers offered me my job back. I ended up taking it because it’s hard trying to find a job."
bad,You don’t get trained in any position. They make you work no matter what your availability is and the managers always change and have no experience in the departments.
bad,"They start at an okay-ish wage, but raises are small. There is such high turnover that they can't even keep a skeleton crew, resulting in associates doing two shifts in one. Okay for a summer gig or if you just need a first job before doing what you really want to do. The higher ups only seem to care about shareholders and profits."
bad,"Out store has been through three different management teams since i've been there for a year and a half. Some have been really nice, but seemed to get replaced by management who doesn't care. I went from working 25+ hours a week down to 8-12. New hires start off at 11 but since I got hired before the pay increase I'm still stuck at 9.50. They expect you to do way more work than what you are being paid for."
bad,"-No work/life balance"
bad,The Kroger Company does not value their employees. It's a hard place to work Lots of Favoritism. Very Poor management.  Always Understaffed . Inconsistent hours. Short breaks. Low wages.  Union issues .Unrealistic expectations.
bad,"i wouldnt recommend working on night shift with a bunch of guys because from my experience it was nonly fun for up to 3 hours than the atmospher change to hostle and childish,"
bad,"Worked for Kroger for over a decade and watched it crumble within the last 6 years or so. Overworked and underappreciated. Management it's almost nonexistent. The minute your pay tops out, they start looking for a way to replace you. The Union is worthless. The level of corruption in this company disgusts me and most of the people I worked around."
bad,"worse company ever, only good thing is benefits. if you wanna make $8 a hour to do $20/hr work all day and never be appreciated, only expected to do more until you burn yourself out every week. if you finish your work they'll make u pick up someone elses slack too dont worry. i know a ton of people they phased out and just found ways to fire them because they were on a better tier contract than they offer now. now they hire you in at like 8/hr and you top out at like 11.50 after like 6 years. Good luck being able to afford anything on that salary. Management is like 85% people that know nothing about the job and just tell you to do things that contradict what your supposed to be actually doing, most of them have 0 experience in the company."
bad,"Worked there 28 years then suddenly suspended for 1 mistake after I notified management of same.thing other employees did everday people under me shopping on the clock, smoking on clock, stealing I was a.department head picked.up ever one.elses slack and they don't care Kroger 602"
bad,We meet our numbers and they don’t really care about the employees as much as they say they do. They just make sure we meet our numbers daily and stay focused.
bad,"I spent 40 hours a week in this place letting my CSM schedule me outside of my availability because they said it was ""inconvenient"". As well as the hr manager told me along with another supervisor she had been trying to hire our replacements because she didn't like our age. Even bending over backwards and staying late or coming earlier anytime someone called out , they still treated their employees awful."
bad,"It was just very unorganized, no fair treatment from management ,they didnt appreciate there employees if and then you had a problem they never would help with the situation"
bad,"I was made to work the entire store with no formal training whatsoever. Managers and supervisors were outright insufferable, especially the front desk clerk."
bad,"Everyone is overworked and under paid. Most employees were miserable, and it was evident in their work. The company is notorious for under-staffing, and therefore each employee is required to do the workload of four people in the same time limit of one shift. Working overtime is forbidden because most store managers would rather have their payroll hours look good than have consistent and high quality products. Working for a big company does have its advantages, but if you would like to work for a company that has integrity and actually cares about their employees well-being, this is not the company."
bad,"Kroger is a high stress job, does not matter your position. They want one person to do the job of three. They do not recognize a job well done, rather they focus on the oversized work load. They do not put their customers or employees first."
bad,"I loved working there in the beginning but when my supervisor left things began to slowly go down hill, then the managers that I loved left and the new store manager didn't care for anyone there."
bad,"the meat manager at the Appleton Ave  Pick n Save location  consistently speaks to workers in derogatory comments, gripes and complains about workers behind their backs.  Monitors work to find only errors not accomplishments."
bad,"Pay is horrible, no balance between work life. No room for advancement. Only good thing is you have job security as they are union. Other than that its probably one of the worst places I've ever worked. There hardly any help."
bad,"stores will vary in treatment of employees, but for the most part I have been treated with no respect, the company pushes how important customers and employees are, but do not practice it in daily operations. entry level pay is minimum wage regardless of what their advertisements for employment say, and hours"
bad,"My supervisor was very pushy and contradicted every order she gave. The manual labor was not worth the pay. If you didn’t do something a certain way, you got written up. I worked to many hours for not enough pay."
bad,"I did not enjoy working for Kroger. Maybe others have had better experiences there, but I certainly did not. The work was monotonous, boring and tedious. They jerked me around all over the store. I would not reapply."
bad,"The job was simply that, just a job. I did not really enjoy it. The pay was very poor compared to other competitor. I can do basically anything on the front end but raises where only six months."
bad,Kroger store is not a good place to work and I wouldn’t recommend anyone to work there. Also I was getting such low pay. I was making “$50.00” a paycheck
bad,"Hard work means nothing at Kroger, the only thing that matters is length of service. They are not a fair company to work for and the union is useless!"
bad,"It started out to be a good job at first. I was getting plenty of hours, I was heading toward moving up in my department and then out of no where it all stopped. My manager was removed from the department so then I was removed without warning. By doing that I ended up getting 20 or less hours a week instead of my 40 a week. Eventually I was forced to quit."
bad,"Very stressful! No support from your bosses here! Not a fun work environment. I would not recommend this place as a place to work. Most new hires quit, or want to quit within weeks. Work is very hard and pay is well below where most companies start out. My job pays better then most but takes years of service to get."
bad,"The management is currently extremely poor, not to mention sexist. Women and men are definitely treated differently. Men can do no wrong, while women are dirt under the manager's feet."
bad,"Sadly, the Kroger I worked at was very poor in terms of management. The was no room for advancement, work hours could fluctuate wildly from week to week, and an overall feeling of unhappiness was shared among all employees. Head manager was very unsympathetic when sick days were requested. Overall, I would only take such a position as a last resort."
bad,"Sometimes store may be ridiculously busy and packed with customers, and other times there may be barely anyone in the store at all and the management will start sending people home. Work hours after the first week on the job plummet often times there you work only one four hour shift every two weeks."
bad,They expect too much work without enough help period. They don't treat you as a professional. they want to see if they can find something to write you up on so if they want they can just get rid of you. the communication is horrible.
bad,"Kroger is one of the few places that hire young people, they start at 15. While the job is doable you will hate your job. The only highlight being your co workers if you are lucky. Low pay, Harsh work environments (Immense amount of time outside in the sun) , very short breaks."
bad,Supervisors were often biased when it came to rotating people for shopping cart retrieval. Employees were not motivated to work and would slack off during their shift. The manager showed little to no sympathy towards workers and focused only towards higher level workers.
bad,"Too may people in the wrong departments, not enough people in the needed departments, favoritism, lazy workers with no consequences, lazy lower management, many forced to pick up others slack, unfair treatment of employees,  lack of organization, too many issues to list."
bad,Management was frequently saying things about employees behind their backs. I was told when I was hired that they were looking to fill a management position and that they intended to give it to me. Once I passed the required probationary period I was told they were interested in someone else for the position and would be using them.
bad,"If you need a job do NOT work here you usually get less than 12 hours a week but if you're like me they'd give you 30-39 just so they didn't have to make you full time with benefits. Management sucks extremely bad they have no idea what they're doing and most will be nice to your face and than talk smack behind your back like kids ""It's really bad"". They don't care about they're workers at all no matter if you take shifts that they need to be filled even if you've worked 8 hours that day and you're nice to the customer and go above and beyond in your work and to satisfy the customer. They also allow people to take your hours if they want them. For example i was given 23 hours one week which was a lot for me at Kroger because i was used to getting 12, they allowed someone who had just gotten 40 hours last week to take my hours because ""he wanted them"" so i wouldn't even get $80 on my paycheck usually if you worked 16 hours you'd get like $90 but that's it. Oh yeah and also i wouldn't shop there neither or at least don't put your stuff in the carts because utility clerks are told to get the trash from around the store and put it in the carts and you don't have to wash them after nor do you clean them with anything also don't use the bathrooms because the utility clerks there are not even trained on how to properly clean anything as well as anyone on the front end at least you're not trained well at all you're just kinda thrown in and they hope you don't mess anything up. Also I've been threaten by people above me that they were going to take my hours if i made them mad. You also"
bad,"The benefits suck, upper management doesn’t care about you, we’re open most holidays and the pay is atrocious. The amount of work you’re expected to do for less than $10 is laughable."
bad,"although excited to have a union job, kroger does not compensate its employees fairly. even with experience, you will make the same as someone who has never had experience, do not expect to have a livable wage."
bad,Was expected to do way more than you should in a short amount of time. Pay was horrible and only 5 cent raise every 6 months. Very under appreciated. Only plus is flexible hours
bad,This company is the worst place on the planet. The management picks favourites and harasses the rest until you want to die or quit . No matter if you're a hard worker or not if you aren't liked by management you're screwed. The pay is not worth the amount of work you have to do and still get zero appreciation.
bad,"A typical day at work was dealing with angry customers, and getting yelled at for things that weren't your fault. I learned how to deal with annoying customers with a smile. The management was terrible because they had no care for their employees. The workplace culture was annoying because of all the drama. The hardest part of the job is when there would be too many cashiers and not enough baggers. There was not an enjoyable part of the job."
bad,"Working at Kroger was fun. But the management was poor , they lied to me and didn’t give me a chance to work it out. The manager was basically saying he owns me so I quit that same day."
bad,Not the worst place in the world to work as the job itself is easy enough (when management leaves you alone and not intentionally prevent you from doing your job). The only good thing really is the employees there are very friendly. Management there really aren't qualified to even run a candy store in all honesty. The pay ain't even worth it.
bad,A typical day at work includes few breaks and multiple expectations and deadlines. The hardest part of the job would be the amount of work given and the time you must complete it in.
bad,"My work day was that i would come in when they have me scheduled, and i would work for a 8 hour shift, I would bag customers grocery's  and I would push carts ."
bad,"This was not a good workplace to be employed at. They play ""favorites"" with every single decision they make. I would not recommend this job to anyone except maybe my enemy."
bad,"My job as a Clicklist Selector is nearly always stressful. The low hourly wage and poor benefits mean we are always struggling with fewer people who do less.Management does not communicate properly with each other and as a result on two separate occasions I arrived to work at 5 A.M. only to discover that I must wait two hours to actually begin work.On the plus side, Kroger employees are very cheerful and friendly. The hardest part of the job is picking groceries in time for pick-ups."
bad,It is just a job. Co-workers are great but could have better management. Management changes schedule without discussing it with you which I thought was against union policy.
bad,Absolutely no room for REAL management advancement with this company. Company constantly altered hours on your schedule without letting you know ahead of time.
bad,I finally got my percentage up after a work related injury of coming off light duty and I got terminated.  management is poor there. tehy hire &  fire
bad,"Picked orders in the freezer and produce departments. Very physical position, manually lifting up to 80lbs frequently all day. No work life balance. If you have a family, be prepared to never see them. Most positions are 10hr shifts, 4 days a week but they can and usually mandate you to stay up to 3 hours extra per day with only a couple hours notice. So you never know what time you will be home. They also can and usually mandate you to come in on your day off with only one day notice especially during the holidays so you can't ever make plans on your days off. They try to make up for it with compensation."
bad,"very stressful, management very poor. You get treated very unfairly, no hours. Never happy even though paid can be good. The union does not fight for you even though you pay them I wouldn't recommend working for this company."
bad,"The company has a staffing problem that starts from the top down. The executives do not care about the employees. Everyone is deemed as replaceable. "
bad,"Working here sucks in every conceivable way. Stay far away from this company because the work is tedious, management is incompetent, and the pay is downright pitiful."
bad,"Poor management , low pay for having to do lots of work. Management judges hourly employees unfairly . Pay is super low. Some of the co workers are very unfriendly towards other co workers.bit wasn't right."
bad,"I applied for a register job since I had years of experience-- they had me bag and do janitor work instead. Hours are not flexible. They got angry when I told them my schedule for school, and when I told them I only wanted 20 hours a week. Their response? 35+ hours a week, no rescheduling, no off time."
bad,managers are unwilling to work with you on hours you don't ever get off when your suppose to. Missed the bus home ad-least 8 times. none of the managers are willing to help you get off at a decent time. you would be posted for 5pm to 10pm but never get off in time i missed the 12 am bus 8 times which is the last bus you can take until 5am the next day. i walked home in the cold winter night 8 times before i decided to start ion things early so i could leave on time for once. I had even asked numerous times that if i missed my bus if the anyone could give me a ride and if he was there josh would give me a ride no one else. the work environment sucks the only people who get treated nicely or praised was the customers. about the only good time i had there was when i was working at the seafood department ad least there i got of in time unlike the deli or cashier department.
bad,"No typical day"
bad,There is NO work life balance....expectations are not consistent with resources available to attain objectives ........ If you want to be a stock person and a cashier then become a manager
bad,"Personally, I dislike Kroger. I have some really amazing coworkers, but the job itself is physically taxing and management is poor. They really don't appreciate your work there."
bad,"didnt like it, highschool job ONLY. Really didnt appreciate employees, berating managers/ supervisors, favoritism for young women mostly. would not recommend"
bad,The workers at guest care/customer service are very inconciderate about their workers. Dont care about how they treat them. Are rude to customers and workers.
bad,The managers is horrible.including the store manager and district manager ..if the supervisor get mad at you they cut you down to 12 hours.. No teamwork..
bad,"Rate of pay completely unacceptable & the store was horribly managed, manager was seldom present & when he he was still completely unavailable, They kept my hours just low enough so they didn'[t have to provide benefits."
bad,"not a great place to work, to cut a long story short. they also lie to you about promotions to make you stick around. ask any employee what they honestly think and I'd be very surprised if they said anything positive"
bad,Having bad training. Not having things in order. Not keeping a eye on all employers. Blaming other for stealing. Employees taking advantage of new workers.
bad,"although most of my coworkers were great, and the job wasnt bad, the store manager was terrible whether it be putting you down or sexually harrassing you over and over telling you that he'd have you fired before you got the chance to turn him in."
bad,"I gave everything to Kroger. I expected it to be a place of the future. It's a great place if you want to pick orders or not stand out, but they push change in offices but don't push it in the way they manage. I learner more from a middle aged woman that works as the unit manager at a Honda supplier than I ever learned from 20 classes that Kroger sent me to or the 3 supervisors I had ever taught me."
bad,Very overworked. Lots of overturn. Manager would watch us from her house. Stressful work environment. Hard to get days off. No call ins unless your dying and have a doctors excuse.
bad,"false promises are made here"
bad,its a good part time job for school kids you have people that works for kroger and will not train you at all because they feel like they dont have to help need employees that starts there that are willing to work
bad,The scheduling is terrible no set schedule an will decrease your hours even if your a good worker so you can quit . While management barely does anything other than yell over the intercom
bad,"Low pay for hard working/long time employees, not enough employees, over work good employees, bad management. "
bad,"Typical day at work is consistently busy, fast past"
bad,I work in the deli at kroger and it is one of the worst places to work the customers treat u like garbage. Also some employs think they are the boss and tell u what to do and in fact an employee and one of the managers is conversating behind everyones back trying to take pictures of things we didn't do basically try to go after us and report them to the other more authoritive managers and it is a horrible place to work.
bad,At first it was a very stable job and a good place to work. Over time as the years went by and no advancement was ever placed on my behalf. I grew to realize that Kroger wasn't all that it was cracked up to be.
bad,"This place sucked. I would be told to work off the clock to get stuff done so as to not affect the overtime, but then get yelled at for doing it. The managers didn't help you and started to take away everything we had."
bad,"Productive environment and customer service driven. Kroger is a great place to work. Always in stock and moderately priced. Great Meat and Produce Departments. Customer Friendly Atmosphere, Employee Empowerment"
bad,"Worked for Kroger for 2-3 months, during that time, was called several times asking why I did not come into work on my scheduled day. Once they pulled the time clock punches they find I was there, they  just never checked. No training, management did not talk to each other or do pass ons. No full time, would of had to wait a year to get insurance, but even then would not cover spouse, just employee."
bad,They let their employees get sexually harassed and do nothing about it. They only care about their favorite employees. You pay union dues for job security and in case you have issues at work and they do not help you when you need help unless your summary. but as soon as you miss a day of work with a doctors not you're the one that gets fired. I do not recommend working here. it is a horrible company to work for. I do like their products but i do not like their management.
bad,My manager was good but the amount of work wasn't equal to the pay they was given. Only wanted to give 15 to 20 hours per week. couldn't live off that. co-workers where great but to much work for the amount of pay
bad,"Management has become really horrible. "
bad,Only the managers get the good benefits and respect and do not practice the company ideals that to which they hold the employees .
bad,I liked the supervisors there and the work was not bad but they don't pay live able wages  and never give you good hours i have always like to shop there but now knowing that they don't pay there employees well makes me want to shop there less.
bad,too many hours and not enough pay. work schedule was very inconsistent and changed too much. Co-workers sometimes didn't even show up or on time.
bad,it was good and bad more bad than good i got payed and worked until i found better take the good with the bad have not shopped there since
bad,"I enjoy working with others I have always enjoyed the food and hospitality field. The management at most places like this is about the same. Always great co-workers, Not enough time in the day to everything . Working with others and meeting the customers is the best part."
bad,great benefits; treated like a second-class citizen by management and customers. No room for advancement in the company unless you know someone.
bad,"Very political environment, in the majority of cases the wrong people in management positions. promotions depends on who you know, not what you know."
bad,never work at the kroger on old national WORST place to work poor management skills nobody on the same page. then the customers come with there attitudes and want everything free.
bad,The management expect you to work hard for no compensation. Hours are very low and you have to plan for them getting lower as management likes to cut days off your schedule without warning. The most enjoyable part of the job is going home.
bad,"Co workers and customers are great, its the management style that is not so great. When i first got the job i told them i needed Saturdays off for personal reasons, They agreed and now they are telling me that if i don't work Saturdays they will stop scheduling me completely. Also my manager specifically told me if i don't go back to school she will only schedule me 4 hours a week, Also she doesn't care about anyone but herself she will schedule herself then leave someone alone for almost 7 hours during their shift. Which if we are alone we are not aloud to take our breaks or even have the basic human right of going to the bathroom without getting written up."
bad,"i would clean, cook, and stock with no help every day the others would goof off with each other, management is bad and don't really do anything and they treat you very bad yelling at you in front of customers, co workers don't really like to work if there is no manager, having to do it all alone cooking, and running out with helping customers. the customers are the most enjoyable."
bad,"This company does not live up to its reputation nor its promises. They neither give you the opportunity to advance but also actively try to keep you from advancing. "
bad,They are very friendly but they are don't want to pay you what you are worth with the skills you have.
bad,"Kroger is a company that changes their minds -- about everything -- every three to six weeks. All decisions they make are based on the fear of what competitors do."
bad,This store is located in a very small town. The most enjoyable part of the job were helping customers. I also enjoyed keeping a clean and sanitized work space. This particular store had scheduling issues often leaving one employee to do the jobs of 3 to 4 employees. Co-workers were friendly to customers but many times it did not seem sincere and acted as though they did not have time for them. I was shocked by this. Co-workers continuously pointed blame to others to protect themselves. My experience with this particular store was not a good one.
bad,"Management is shockingly unfriendly and cold for a store that bills itself on friendliness. They are very eager to let you know what you've done wrong and punish you, but anything positive is sporadic and insincere at best. Infinitely more concerned with the bottom line and numeric results rather than employee or customer satisfaction."
bad,good job if your 16 and have no bills to pay you start out with great hours then they cut you down to ten
bad,"Kroger was a good company to work for at first but as time progress they start too treat you any kind of way , Talk too you any kind of way , cut hours and show favoritism to some employees , and give them hours , I am fed up and i am looking for a job that well treat employees fairly and equally  and appreciate my work"
bad,Learning experience and cooking and baking and ordering and stocking and helping customers and just multi tasking
bad,"The union does not fight for the employees. They sit back and take an hour of your life each paycheck. They do not give you health benefits after working there for a year and a half. They just send you post cards stating you declined benefits. When you try and tell them you do want benefits, they tell you to wait an additional six months. "
bad,began shift after school chill customers friendly environment
bad,"Typical day at work was complete horrid and hectic."
bad,"Greet customers and handle cash, checks and credit cards transactions. I learned how to build display, place orders and print report from a handheld scanner. My co-workers was very nice to work with. The hardest part of the job working every evening & holidays. The most enjoyable part of the job meeting new people."
bad,Bad management. They no regard for the employee and their families. They're always looking for ways to make the job hard for the employee.
bad,"Worked for the company for 12 years. Walked out the door 3 1/2 years ago and never regretted it. Was an excellent place to work till new store manager took over, apparently the new wave of store management."
bad,it was okay to work for only thing i enjoyed was being in the union
bad,Never knew when you worked and called at the last minute to work. There was no enjoyment in the job
bad,"During the time that I was employed there was an extremely vindictive PIC, Jen. She took everything personally and acted like she was your ""friend"" until you did something she didn't like. She was extremely nosy and went to great lengths to find out details of your personal life. I finally had taken all I could after being required to work on a day I had used as a vacation day. Granted I did quit without any notice, but Jen put me in the corporate system as ""non-rehirable"" which has been following me since 2008. It has kept me from getting jobs that I am over-qualified for and has left me jobless for over a year."
bad,i will not work for kroger ever again they do not value their employees and advancing in the field means you need to be friends with management and not be recognized for your work instead
bad,"I was ternimated with no warning thanks to oversight and lack of action from several managers. the job was fine for what it was, but the union was a joke for how much that i paid for it on each paycheck. Nothing was done by the union OR the managers over my situation."
bad,Management sucks they don’t care about the employees..never understanding..and they don’t back up their employees when there’s a problem in the department..
bad,The kroger on perkins ave in Perkins township OH. Is filled with an ALL WHITE MANAGEMENT TEAM THAT ATE A BUNCH OF RACISTS.............................
bad,"My first three weeks with this company was spent learning the ropes and meeting the staff. Upon introducing myself to a department manager, I was quickly met with a hostile response! I was only 15 at the time! What jerk does that to a friendly kid!? As much as I learned about the job, I learned more about the people. Customers and co-workers (mostly...) are friendly, but my problem is with management and the union. Store managers try to be your friend just to stab you in the back later. I have been discriminated, and witnessed favoritism with management, and the union doesn't have your back like they're supposed to. Great job for short-term, and I made the biggest mistake thinking it was a career. 15 years of my youth wasted going nowhere. Don't throw your life away here, I learned my lesson."
bad,They pay rate at which I was being paid was enough to support me and my needs. How ever the boss of the front end was very rude and disrespectful and gave me 8 hours a week.
bad,This company doesn’t have a good core of people to help it work efficiently. Need to stop running everyone in to the ground. Also raise the pay scale.
bad,Work in the pickup department. Verbal arguments are the norm as well as confusion and the complete lack of effective management. I got hired here thinking the pay was high for the workload. The pay is nothing worth the constant stress and demoralizing work and disapproval even though there is nothing more you can do. The only reason I continue to keep this job is because this is the highest paying job for being in high school.
bad,I worked in kroger for over a year and at first my months where great and i had a understanding manger but there is a lot of internal staff issues such as unnecessary drama
bad,"I hated working at Kroger on State here in Saginaw Mi!! I liked it at first! It was fun and I liked the money, but poor management and lack of communication! This was my first job and my mom said it was the worst first job anyone could have!"
bad,"Where do I begin with this one? The co-workers are just about the only thing that's good about this job. Heavy work flow is common because of understaffing- an issue that wasn't isolated to my store or my department. The big wigs don't hire enough people for the store to run effectively and then have the nerve to tell you it's your fault the store didn't hit their goals or projections. Management all tends to be lazy and un-enthusiastic. Not to mention, they're very unhelpful. I can't tell you how many times I've asked a manager for help only to get a shoulder shrug. Customers tend to be rude, disrespectful, and degrading towards the employees."
bad,Management is horrible. Corporate uses scare tactics. Department heads are always stepping down or leaving do to stress. People feel they wont have jobs in a few years. Everything they used to do to boost moral is gone.
bad,"At first the job was stellar, besides how fast-paced and busy it would get, the old management was amazing about us getting breaks, treating us right, etc. Then the new CSM came in and it was downhill. She is the most childish, unprofessional, arrogant person I have met in that setting."
bad,Kroger was great for benefits but work life balance was awfu Management was ruthless and inconsiderate and non-empathetic benefits were the only thing that was helpful. I’m
bad,I have worked at Kroger for 5 years now. In the past year they have dropped the hours of each department. Each department has to run with less workers but wants more work done. This is very hard for a service department like the deli. They also fired hundreds of store level managers witch in return crushed the moral of store managers giving them more work. that is something the whole store feels and leads the hourly employees moral down. no one is happy now. the customers will suffer now.
bad,"With the new culture at Kroger, if the job isn’t done  you’re not allowed to leave. A lot of upper management do not care about what is going on at home, even if you don’t have a babysitter. They expect the most...with little no respect."
bad,"It was very difficult to manage customers appropriately considering how management had new rules and peculiarities to tend to. Not only was told to not start checking out customers until all of their items, I was also told to ask for their Kroger card BEFORE I could start getting their items checked. This often meant spending too much time waiting while the customer might have gotten upset over the fact that I would have to stand there doing nothing."
bad,"After 31 years with the company, I wish I had chosen a different employer. Kroger Pharmacy was once focused on keeping the customer happy and gave more reasonable staffing allowances than competitors to allow us to do just that. However, Kroger is now just another oppressive, metrics-driven retail slave driver."
bad,"On a typical day at Kroger doing my job, you get to deal with people complaining about different things in the store. You also get to assist people in sending large amounts of money all across the world, which is never fun. You have to be really careful doing this job, because who knows what that person is sending money for. I wouldn't recommend working here because they seem to treat people horribly. They don't treat them with any respect. They just started laying off some managers recently, including one of our best managers, who was there for 17 years! And they just laid him off like that? That's not a good thing to do to people. That is not how you treat people. Not to mention, I've been there for 5 years and I don't make nearly enough money to show for it. It's been really hard being able to even cover my rent each month."
bad,"-Type Of Day At Work  usually  I do from 6-8 hours a day doing  condition  Making Sure The Floor Is Set For The Others To Be Set For Day "
bad,"It was an experience I'm glad I didn't miss but won't work there again. I think it was the store I was located in even though the employees were very friendly and helpful when needed. but the hours and ""un-knowing"" of each schedule. U request certain hours and you get everything but what was requested. When kiddos are sick, they don't seem to care if you aren't management."
bad,"extremely high stress environment, unorganized management and leadership. full time employees are taken advantage of and overworked. extremely underpaid job"
bad,"They cut out hourly associates hours and put more work load on the salaried managers.  You rarely get time to do all your work each day let alone have a lunch.  They micro-manage every little detail, top heavy on upper management outside of stores (district managers, coordinators).  Stress levels run high. Went from taking care of customers to pure  number hitting.from"
bad,"is good for the beginning few weeks, but they motto about family one is not up to standards,  they will don't care about you, and they don't help you at all for work"
bad,"Really miserable work environment. In indy it is the lowest top pay in the grocery field. Make day 1 at target costco amazon walmart what takes years to get here. McDonalds has higher starting wage. They blame on union, union blames on them. Or they say its because of great benefits, but you have to be there 5 years before they offer you their 'gold' plan. Union makes it so nobody is fired outside 90 day evaluation period unless they steal. Union takes 3-5% of your pay but you want to be in it since the union and local HR go to lunch together regularly. If you work, you will be one of the few that does, they will treat you ok but let most not do the bare minimum while expecting more and more. There is a group of managers who are not assigned to stores that come through constantly to 'check' you and enforce whatever the new redundant acronym program they are testing to keep those managers employed. These managers are rude to customers and employees, very entitled, provide nothing toward improving the company, and absorb massive saleries, taking away what should be worker pay increases. Youll find them eating in the conference room on company money most of the time. Managers are constantly rotated due to corruption every year. Some years you get a good group, others bad. Your job is heavily dependent on their approach to power so if you get a bad manager expect to be abused and avoid them for a year. They assign sections of the store to one assistant manager, usually hire from outside, so if the manager of your area is off the other manager will be clueless and wont help you."
bad,The store manager sucked. He woukd scream at you and cuss you out and tell you how bad of a job you were doing. Other employess were amazing and friendly. The job is only hard when the management doesn't know how to order product and over orders everything.
bad,Lazy customer service desk associates. Unorganized management when management transferred from a different location. Breaks are never on time. Associates are not held accountable for punctuality. Courtesy clerks (baggers) are treated terrible. And are all unhappy. Rightfully so. Morale is non existent.  I could keep going. But I’m guessing you are getting the point.
bad,Had trouble with getting enough hours for health care . They Dropped  it for months then wouldnt qualify because the small amount of hours even if I was available. Trouble with favortism from unprofessional supervisors . They didnt seem to be consistent with employee relations.
bad,None of the managers ever did anything. Corporate was awful. They constantly showed up and enforced terrible front end rules that did nothing but anger customers and their employees. No one in the company cares about employees.
bad,"Where do I begin? Managers are trash and demeaning, co-workers do the absolute minimum and blame each other, every minute I spend there I die a little more inside. I’ve worked here for 7 years so far and my god, what have I done to myself? But there is one thing I would like to thank Kroger for. They have forced me to go to college to better myself in order to do something that I would love to be doing. So if you want to find the motivation to get your life together, get in here and learn whatit is."
bad,I am in great need of a career change. I have a passion for Landscaping and routine Groundskeeping in a club course type of environment. I have various skills in operation of necessary equipment to complete any assignments given daily.
bad,"While Kroger may be a good place for people to shop, the exact opposite can be said for how the place is run. The management, whether it be top level management or supervisors is poor at best. They treat their employees as though they are below them and do not offer any positive feedback for any good work performed. Instead, they berate employees over simple, miniscule things that any other normal person would either overlook or not prioritize. Everything Kroger employees do is based on customer satisfaction, which management takes to extreme and unreasonable levels. If a customer comes into a store and starts getting frustrated about something that an employee may not have done, management will always believe what the customer says and will not give the employees any opportunity to defend themselves. Also, if you do a great job there, expects management and supervisors to asks you to perform other people’s jobs for them. As a bagger, I would often have to move between five plus checkout lanes by myself as well as clean up empty cart garages by myself."
bad,"It’s a job but I wouldn’t stay there forever."
bad,This company treats there employees poorly tell them to think out of the box and be creative in departments that it applies and the tell them it is wroung. They encourage there management to keep a high turnover by cutting hrs to Increase there bonuses. The fewer people on the floor to run the store the bigger the bonuses.
bad,"Kroger places unrealistic expectations on employees while giving no hours and hiring no one. They set employees up to fail from the very beginning because they do not allow proper training. "
bad,Working at Kroger’s I’m at a store that hard it’s a big store it’s $1 million store I went there just to help them out and now I’m stuck there driving a long ways to work every day I wished I could get out of that store but the store manager said nobody is normally they started out good at Kroger’s now it’s gotten not so good managers that’s a whole big deal that’s what they put in ahead over manager
bad,Work life balance for managerial positions are not great. You have to work over the 50 hours to get things done. Not ideal if you have a family. The pay does not reflect the amount of stress and work a person have to do in a daily basis.
bad,I do not recommend working here. I loves working here until management pulled me aside and told me they didnt care about the employees and there lives
bad,"It's went from something I enjoyed to something I can't stand doing in my life anymore. The environment has become to hostile. The company preaches be uplifting, but in reality all they do is beat you into the ground. As an associate it wasn't as noticeable, but once I went into department leadership after about a year the company drastically changed and not for the better. Suddenly nothing was good enough and they began to strip away things like associate bonuses and other benefits."
bad,"under paid, under appreciated, greatly overworked. Would not recommend to work here unless it’s temporary. Very stressful, too high of expectations. The managers talk badly about workers behind their backs. So understaffed that working OT is unavoidable. Kroger keeps increasing their demands for what they want done in a day but we are still the same number of workers. It’s ridiculous."
bad,"Kroger at first was a good place to work. Stayed busy and was often tired at end of day, but still enjoyed the atmosphere. Now, they are only thinking of increasing sales and not of employees overall mental/physical health. They add more demands daily and do not supply any kind of relief in achieving these demands. They expect managers to do nothing but include their hours in the departments overall hours. This prevents in the ability to hire anyone new to assist in the increasing demands of the company."
bad,"Pull the days paperwork, scan for holes, put on order, stock product. Learned organizational skills and public relations. Management is horrible. Workplace culture is scary, store becoming more dangerous.Hardest part of job was dealing with irate customers. The most enjoyable part of my job was dealing with happy customers."
bad,Scheduling was always off. Either you have too many associates or not enough.  They will leave you to handle entire pick up area alone.  High turnover.
bad,Kroger is where people who think they are too good for Wal-Mart go. Deceptive pricing tactics attract the most foolish and entitled customers. Management was horrendous and benefits didn't kick in until almost a year of employment. Employee base was split between people who worked there for 40 years and people who would only work there for 40 days. It is not fun to be in the middle of this
bad,"Overall, a poor place to work if you're looking for a career. The wages are very low, especially the starting wages. Associates working there for 30+ years are only making between $16-$17/hour. Management is a joke and expect miracles from the overnight grocery stocking team. They also don't provide any new equipment to properly make your job easier to get done. It was far too stressful of a job than it should be."
bad,Poor hours and poor team building skills through the store.meeting new people everyday was a pro I guess and they paid weekly you have to get 40 hours a week to get benefits and be employed for 1 year
bad,Management doesn't care about their employees. You are just a number to them and they won't give you the hours you were promised. They change your schedule whenever they feel like it or need to fill a shift.
bad,"The Kroger company is a very competitive company.  Most jobs at the office are contractors.  I worked over 30 years with the company and was not even considered for some jobs within that I applied for.  My day included taking orders and shipping out orders.  The most enjoyable part of the job was making sure the customer received accurate orders and in a timely manners and relating to the customers.  The hardest part of the job was working with grumpy customers and coworkers that did not work as a team.  The workplace culture was fun because we were allowed to participate in birthday and anniversary celebrations and sample sales."
bad,This company expects too much from one person.  They do not support their associates or offer help to achieve goals.  Their is no appreciation of anyone or anything.
bad,If was very boring and the lay was low the staffing was really rude and unprofessional. They weren’t upfront with things half the things they lied sby
bad,"Took a very long time for them to work around my hour requirements, and even then didn't seem to fully grasp the concept of part-time student positions. When they finally DID compensate, it seemed to work well, but management still seemed cold and uninvolved with employees. Not a positive experience overall, and caused occasional pain from prolonged work for low pay."
bad,"I started out as the Deli Cleaner. I did well with time to spare, so I was asked to clean the bakery until they could hire a new cleaner for it. I was promised it was temporary, so I agreed. They never intended to hire a bakery cleaner. Slowly I was asked to help in multiple departments. After that, I was asked to help customers on the floor. Then I was asked to sub in for missing courtesy clerks whenever they needed me. At this point, I would do nearly 5 different jobs in a single 4-6 hour work shift. I was constantly rushed around, scolded if anything was less than perfectly cleaned. I was scolded for being slow at returning carts despite never receiving proper training to do so. The tasks piled up on me until I decided to stand up for myself and tell them that these tasks were impossible in such a small and uninterruptible time frame. I was being paid minimum wage, plus a heavy union due was being subtracted from my paycheck despite having no recollection of consenting to it. Working 5 different jobs nearly daily for less than minimum wage? I cannot recommend this company to anyone after such a poor experience."
bad,When I work i give it my all 100% at work all the time and do different thing and do everything that needs to be done and my boss said i didn't do anything and i'm too slow
bad,i worked there 2 years and never called in or sick never a raise. i always did above and beyond. sometimes worked 4 hour shifts and sometimes 8. i know enployees there for 15 years still not above 15 an hour
bad,Manager did not take into consideration personal life of associates. Was a full time student and pregnant and lead continued to make scheduling errors.
bad,"Kroger is a good first job because it teaches different responsibilities and tasks and has a somewhat team environment, at the same time there is opportunity to work individually"
bad,Under staffed low hours rude management toxic enviormemt hated it wouldn't recommend to a friend small kiosk you work almost. Everyday for only 20 hours
bad,"When I transferred to Fry's from Kingsoopers, it was so radically different. The managers at my store were cut-throat, and saw you as just a number. If you had a problem with anything, HR would never help you."
bad,Some management was understanding supportive while other were not I was let go due to missing a few days will my department lead could call off days on end so they have a strong base to seniority they also said they would work with me on the fact I didn’t want to work every weekend I worked every weekend I didn’t like to work nights all the time from day one nights as the closer
bad,"Coworkers are largely welcoming, with the exception of a select few, while management is almost entirely out for their own interests. Poor work/life balance, little to no consideration to those pursuing higher education, as profits are more important to management. Almost no value placed by upper management on those at store level other than store managers. "
bad,"I just really hated it there. It sucked, would not recommend unless you're desperate. I spent most of my work day crying when I was pushing carts in the cold or rain or pretending to be happy whilst providing customer service. The management was okay, but not the best. The hardest part of the job is the fact hat it's retail and retail sucks. At least we got discounts though."
bad,"This is a horrible place to work. As a stocker you will be extremely overworked and underpaid. Especially if you work at a high volume store. Kroger does not give enough hours to departments to complete truckloads, plus complete everything else they want done.  Then they go crazy if you get 1 second of overtime. Every year Kroger comes up with new unnecessary task that is suppose to make the job easier, but instead only makes the job harder. They fight the effects of problems instead of the cause. At my store we practically be running to try to complete our task. I hardly ever get to take a break and Kroger does not care. No matter what you do or how hard you work it's never enough. Management will hammer you in the ground for every little thing without any praise for all the hard work and good you have done. They have unrealistic expectations and they know it but refuse to acknowledge the truth. They talk to you any kind of way with no respect. Management is constantly preaching good culture and positivity when their actions are the complete opposite. Hard work does not pay off here. You move up by favoritism. I have seen the best workers with the most experience get pushed out and the worst workers with the least experience move up. It's politics. High turnover rate. They don't pay enough to keep quality workers. If you get a job here prepare to be slaved out. This is just the half of it. I can write a whole book about the nightmare of working for this place."
bad,I absolute can not stand this company... The managers if they dont like you they will shove you out and they all stick together!!!!!!! I hate this company
bad,The work isn't bad but management is terrible and they trap people working there at minimum wage because they cant afford to leave the health insurance.
bad,"This review is for pharmacy. They used to be an ok place to work for provided you could find a location where the rx techs weren’t toxic (not easy), but they have so drastically cut hours for both pharmacists and techs that it’s impossible. We cannot do the workload with so few people. With the constant interruptions of phones and customers coming up I can’t get anything done without more help. Of course no overtime not by 5 minutes is allowed. Especially since so many customers want to take up a lot of time, too often in a VERY nasty way. They want me to be a psych ward attendant and simultaneously a lightning speed,accurate data entry and insurance biller, receptionist and inventory specialist. Never a minute to catch your breath, literally not one minute, and you’re always behind and never meeting goals. Forget anyone ever explaining your benefits, or anything happening out of your pharmacy prison. You can’t leave it to go to the office or take any time out of your slave assembly line. Usually can’t use the bathroom when you need to. Yes you do get your breaks and lunch; good luck enjoying it while your stomach is in a knot. I am capped out at $18.50/ hr (starting pay is way less) and I wouldn’t work here for $25 an hour the way things are now."
bad,I like working there but they have poor management.  The . money is not enough for the job that you have to preform. No set schedule and no set hours .
bad,"This company does not seem to have a sense of direction. The management is very poor and acts as if the employees do not know how to do their job. The job itself is very easy to learn and understand, however the management is the biggest issue. From not allowing paid time off, to schedule conflicts, management could be improved."
bad,"They will take advantage of you if you let them. The managers are useless and never help, never come up with a solution they just expect you to figure it out yourself. They overwork the people that actually do their jobs and follow procedure and coddle the ones that don’t. Don’t let them take advantage of you"
bad,"Terrible managers, hires anyone who can walk, the pay is awful and employees are overworked. Every establishment nearby had a hire salary and did much less work then the managers assigned to the people working for them."
bad,help customer wrap meat service counter. clean service counter at night? put meat stock out on floor date and marked down meat items to be reduced for quick sales.
bad,I don't care for the direction the company is going. the policies and procedures are constantly changing and it is difficult to meet the unrealistic expectations of the company.
bad,"Management does not work with lower level employees, they do not listen to their needs.  Micromanagement is their latest answer to running a productive and customer friendly environment."
bad,"I was hired , but Kroger expected ME to pay for the background check!! Also very low pay for working in a pharmacy as a tech. And only 15 to 20 hours per week if I was lucky!! Glad I didnt take job!! The two pharmacists were very nice."
bad,"Started out good then Kroger kept implementing bad policies, and transferring out the good managers I had,  Till it became a horrible place to work.  I did enjoy some of the people I worked with and store management jobs where fun.  Health care was bad too."
bad,"Wanted to die. Over worked and underpaid. Almost no training provided, even for management. Almost no advancement if you don't kill yourself. Hard workers can rise fast but then are quickly overwhelmed due to lack of training."
bad,"good pay, but management not always the best depending on departments "
bad,"Everything was terrible.  The salary was decent - when calculated over 40 hours.  As a manager, I was never able to only work 40 hours and after the calculations using 55-60 hours it just wasn't worth the stress and headaches trying to also raise a family."
bad,"i do not like this job because you barely get any hours and the supervisors do not care about you they are very disrespectful.  They"
bad,"My store was managed poorly.  You either did everything you were told without question, or you were shunned until you decided to leave the store or the whole company."
bad,"It's okay for a first job for anyone really, but it isn't necessarily for everyone. I wouldn't go back, but I'd also only recommend to someone in high school."
bad,I wouldnt work here if I didnt have too.the management lacks focus and human decency to care about their employees. The lunches are only 30 mins even if you work more then 9 hours.
bad,they do not care about your job they never let you finish because always cut hours and we never finish the job and they expect everything done and perfect but with not time to do it  they give you brake and lunch time because is against the law.
bad,"Low pay, low hours, terrible management, as well as just terrible horrific people. I'm baffled at the amount of hate one person can have for their employees. Wouldn't work here for even double the amount I was getting paid."
bad,Minimum wage for part timers. No flexibility with hours. No future here. Management is ok. One of the worst jobs I have had. It was recommended to me as a good place to get insurance however if you are part time you have to wait 9 months to get insured. I did not know this fact prior to being hired. They put a lot of pressure on you for quotas and only pay you minimum wage. I do not advise anyone to put themselves through the misery of working here.
bad,"The bad outweighs the good.   If the managers don't like you, want you, fail to meet their ""expectations"", or do something wrong they will demote you, transfer you to another(to crash and burn), or move you to another position/dept. you don't want(so you quit).   Seen it and heard it happen to others."
bad,Racism is strong here. Management argues all the time. The workers are messy. You are constantly on your feet all day. They do not allow you to have long breaks.
bad,"When I first came in for an interview I knew I wasn't going to last very long to be honest. . My training was mostly videos then we went to the floor to get the full experience. It was chaotic and short staffed. That was basically how it was working there, always short staffed.  Literally the worst management ever. Very unprofessional."
bad,Kroger does provide steady income.  Co workers are great. The Deli is always short staffed and management creates a hostile work environment.  Difficult to leave work at 10 pm and return next day at 5 am
bad,work 8 hrs straight with 2 15 min breaks so not enough time to eat. train you for 5 minutes on the handheld.  Do more and more but not given any more money.
bad,"The managers would schedule hours you explicitly said you couldn't work on just to create conflict. Also, the associates were very unprofessional. The work environment was toxic because people would talk behind other's back, confront others with hostility, etc."
bad,"Job security is great because no one wants to stay there. That's the only positive thing about it. Management would yell and cuss out employees in front of customers. There was little to no training, and then complaints because you didn't know what you were doing. It was the worst place I've ever worked."
bad,"This is a good place to work if you're in high school or college."
bad,You never know how many hours you'll get. Department jobs asking for too much for a single employee to do at one time. If the position happens to be decent then you're hours will usually be low.
bad,Management is horrible! If you have issues or want more hours it goes in one ear and out the other!!!
bad,"I work as a Cashier I get to clock in and start the day by opening my register and checking out groceries through my lane and talking to customers which I enjoy doing. The only down side is that management doesn't care, I don't get the pay I want, and my raise is a joke."
bad,"Management is rude and pushy, they make it obvious that they do not care about their employees. they bring employees spirits down. compensation and benefits are good."
bad,Manager does not work with anyone regarding to schedule.  I have been there for 3 years and no more than 16 hours per week.  I work overnight which i do not really like but I do love what i do.
bad,"This is hands down the worst place I have ever worked.  Low pay,  never enough help,  and no teamwork.  Save yourself the stress and find another job."
bad,"I had a terrible experience working with Kroger. I was unappreciated, treated with disrespect and the management cared less about the people that worked there unless they were friends with you. They only cared about customers paying for their products. I will never recommend this company for a friend or anyone. Worst mistake of my life!"
bad,"Very stressful,expect you to go 90 miles an hr while upper manangement leaves dept out to dry. Store understaffed,items not on shelves to fill orders.Customers rude in the aisles,w/no backing from management."
bad,Horrible management and just a very toxic environment. Most of the adults that work there are very immature. You arent taken seriously and your opinion isnt really valid in any situation.
bad,Worked here for a good 5 years.. seen my share in management come and go.. I used to love working here. But with the ways management dosent back us up on what we were told to do.. Its not right. Then when your not only doing your job they ask you to do 5 others. They dont listen to anything you say.  Currently we have on 5 baggers and 3 of them are quitting. Raises are a nickel every 6 months. Horrible company to work for i would NOT recommend anyone i know to work here. Co-workers are awesome tho.
bad,It should be criminal how little Kroger pays it's store and corporate employees that are not upper Management. The call center schedules your breaks for you and you are harassed if you take your break outside of that schedule. You might as well not have health insurance because it doesn't may for anything until you hit a very high deductible.
bad,There would be days I wouldn’t get paid I would have to catch it myself and if would get weeks for me to get paid for that day. The pharmacy manager is rude!! Do not work here.
bad,My managers were awful and they were liars. Barely gave me hours. The workers were messy and often pick on people and bully them. They were unprofessional around customers. JUST AWFUL!
bad,"Days included properly rotating stock from the coolers to the sales floor, and ensuring that anything that is out-dated isn't sold to customers. "
bad,"it was an okay place to work,i worked in the daytime ,overnight shifts and the people that i worked with were very cut throat and try to get you [me] in trouble"
bad,"Work is very repetitive, you do the same thing every day. I learned how to use and clean the slicer and deep fryer. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers"
bad,"Joked around with Kroger employees, staff was funny. We all made sure that the customers/patients where treated like family. It is a fun place to work. Meet new people. Typical day, treated patients ordered supplies, joked with my co worker, maintained a clean environment, catching up with emails from the company. I worked hard. When you are alone & the only person that registered patients. it got very hectic. I maintained my control and if they where upset, I would try to talk to them, if it wasn't for them, I wouldn't have a job. Learned EMR ( scanning patients information into the computer) Learned how to order and stay of top of the supplies we would need. Culture, the patient always gets treated like family even if they are not nice and wanted to complain. The hardest part, when patients would yell or talk to me in a bad way about something I can't control. I love people. It touches me deeply when a patient has came in and was really mean & rude, then they stop by with cookies or things that they made for us and say I'm so sorry for treating you bad. You really must love what you do."
bad,"We once had someone forced to wait 40 minutes to get medical attention because management didn't want to drive them to a hospital five minutes down the road. We were constantly understaffed and barely got the breaks required in our contracts, and when you complained about needing to get in even one fifteen minute break they turn it back on you and say it is your fault. The store manager at 380 in Hillsboro, Oh has a fowl mouth and an even worse temper. It was a terrible work environment."
bad,"-fast working environment, stressful, no teamwork."
bad,"The management will destroy your work reputation if  you are vocal. Never mention pay or ask how much will be paid. They are connected and will destroy any future job opportunities you may try to receive, even if it's a rumor they will hire and fire you based on feelings. Good luck you gonna need it  racist but slick with how it's displayed.  But you can't change people."
bad,Hated it Gross fat Manager who talked about everyone behind their back very nasty had a roach problem in the bakery got locked in freezer informed manager and nothing was done
bad,Not a team environment as I was promised. The staff I worked with were bullies and very rude.  I have never worked in such a negative environment. I dont recommend working at this pharmacy.
bad,Well I was wrote up for having a medical issue and now i'm on 90 day probation and won't do my direct deposit so i still get my check but i give it to the bank.  and the managers are rude disrespectful.
bad,no comment i just didn't like it there it may be different for someone else a typical work day is what it is i learned that cashiering at kroger is not for me high school maybe even college when i was there management was horrible  but that was about 8 years ago versatile the job was easy no challenge
bad,"Sweat shop.  They do not care about family life issues.  They treat employees like slaves, just another body to serve their will.  They expect you to submit to them, but in turn they do not care about you or your family."
bad,The pay is horrible and I dont understand how anyone supports their families off the pay they have. The management is poor and they dont give lunch or restroom breaks to people who work in the Fuel Center Booth
bad,"Horrible place to work these days you can trust no one, i wish i had better to say the mangers do not care about you as we'll they will stab you in the back it's not comfortable no fun"
bad,"If you can not find a job this is an excellent place to work.  In addition, if you are a person of color you must brown  nose to make you daily work life easy.  If you lack pigment then you just need to show up for work regardless of quality of the work."
bad,its a job you have as a back p or need extra money not for someone who has bills and kids. mangers dont care what you have going on. they eat and walk around dont help bag or scan when line gets long then nags at yu
bad,This was my very first job. I did not like it but continued to work for this company for over 2 years. The most enjoyable part of the job was the time did go by fast due to the high paced environment. I was responsible for stocking products and goods on shelves and to keep these shelves neat and organized. The hardest part was how exhausted I was carrying things way too heavy for me and receiving very little compensation for my efforts.
bad,"They fired me because I had neuropathy in my legs and tried passing it off as me being seasonal even though I was indeed hired on as part time, I'm pretty sure it was wrong."
bad,This place is the blind leading the blind..............one doesnt know what the next is doing and the communication is the worst...they take ppl off the schedule and then let them go with no explanation...
bad,Was hired as price changer on morning shift.  Without consent only gave me 10 hours a week to do price changing and moved me to graveyard freight.  Hated the job!!!!!!
bad,I honestly as a whole do like working at Kroger but the pay does not meet what we do on a every day basis. for example I'm basically a supervisor but I still get paid 7 dollars.
bad,"The management is poor lets just say that first; second, the breaks are so short when you don't have an 8 hour shift & when you do have an 8 hour shift you are constantly being harassed by the managers asking you questions like ""why are you still on your break? "" . There is NO communication between the workers & management. Lastly there is NO structure when I have to come in because basically they are finding things for me to do. It's a stressful puzzle everyday."
bad,"A typical day at work in the 'bakery' involves working in the deli; frying, spitting, and cooking chickens and cleaning up the mess that the previous shift inevitably left behind. Management is strict to a fault; I was written up for stopping what I was doing to help a coworker who was struggling. This excessive strictness leads to a poor workplace culture in which employees are reluctant to report problems or help one another for fear of being written up."
bad,"started there as a cashier, worked my way around the departments, then my final position was liquor manager. i learned a great deal of customer service on so many different levels. i learned how to to manage time, money, and employees.the hardest thing of my job was to not take wrk home with me.. my job was enjoyable, i loved being around the diverse,friendly customers and employees.."
bad,"Kroger had very good insurance, but that was about all. Horrible hours, you work what they tell you, no questions asked. one week you got 40 hours the next 15 hours, never guaranteed hours (not good when you have children)."
bad,They hire anyone in management. Some of the people hired in management are immature and unprofessional. Some people in management harassed some of the employees and one of them quit because she was a women and felt uncomfortable. And the supervisors are unprofessional and does not  set and example for the workers.
bad,Management doesn't appreciate all employees equally. Stressful working environment. It takes 4 years to get two weeks of  paid vacation and very hard to become full time.
bad,"Barely get a break, management expects you to do their job, take the brunt of customer abuse for corporate actions, high turnover rate, low pay, no respect...etc etc"
bad,I currently work here and the management changed about 3 times since I've been here. Also I still haven't gotten a raise and coworkers do not work as a team.
bad,"The workers in the deli don't believe in team work"
bad,Worked as a cake decorator. People dropping like flys because of the managements poor decisions on building staff or lack of actually. They loose staff and hardly ever replace. You work like its a holiday everyday for a year and then you get hurt and they wonder why. Employees stay in their own little groups and talk about everyone when they aren't around. Extremely immature personnel and then management talks behind your back to other lower level employees underneath you. Expectations are beyond unreasonable to attain and then they act like your a horrible worker. They are to worried about payroll to fill positions that are in extreme need. Save yourself from this situation and look elsewhere
bad,"Working at kroger was okay,it was and is a good first job pay isnt great. Overall the people were great to work with and it was a very safe environment to work in. The location also provided a lot of lunch options being in a shopping center"
bad,"Full time Grocery clerk's who work overnight should expect the work/life balance to be quite difficult, and to work overtime constantly or be asked to. and working 8+ hour days with a 30minute break because ur scheduled for 7.5 hours."
bad,"Overall this company will work the dog out of you. There is absolutely NO WORK/LIFE BALANCE!"
bad,You apply for a job in bakery and end up working cashier all day.  Not enough pay for all the work you have to do.  Management does not care about the employees
bad,"The managers are completely useless and most of the employees just blow off work until the next shift comes in so it's a never ending cycle of passing the buck on to the next guy. If you're looking for a productive work environment with decent pay or fairly consistent work schedule, I strongly recommend you seek employment elsewhere."
bad,"Kroger wasn't a horrible first job. Management seemed to not know what they were doing at times and the pay rate is not even close to good enough for someone to live on, but for a high school student looking for some extra money, it's not horrible."
bad,"A typical day at work was pretty routine."
bad,"Not the place to be if you want good pay and chance to move up in the company."
bad,kroger wants eployees to do multiple jobs for little pay. meanwhile the company expands. the pay is not great. although the company is very diversified
bad,I worked at Kroger several years ago during the summer.  It was just a part time student job. My job in the U.S. Army was more of a serious position.
bad,"You would probably be better served starting as a bagger in the front end; it pays the same and has many more opportunities for advancement. Pays minimum wage with rare opportunities for raises of about 50 cents. They hire almost no full-time technicians, so no benefits for most of us."
bad,"Decent place to work, management wasn't very good, flexible with work schedule. My coworkers were great, they always helped me out whenever i needed it."
bad,Save yourself the agony of 2 years I and many others went through and work for better pay. best part of Kroger is its unionized so you have to REEEAALLYY mess up or be bad at the job to get fired.
bad,"There really weren't typical days for this job though the work was monotonous. Being looked down on and treated poorly by both customers and management is the norm. "
bad,Most of the people that work there are great. The work environment is not what I expected or recommend. The work is fast paced and at times overwhelming. The hardest part of the job is doing unto others as they do to you. You do not cross management.
bad,"This is a huge company, so maybe that allows them to put profits ahead of their employees' welfare. A typical day at work was a mixed bag, working alongside a variety of people, some of which were helpful and pleasant and others that were the exact opposite. What I learned from working there, was that as an employee, you were considered barely more than human cattle, and were treated accordingly. Never in my life have I seen a more deficient group of managers that were unable or unwilling to provide the necessary leadership and training to help someone succeed at their job. With that stated, the turnover rate is high, as would be expected when valuable assets, i.e. people are treated so poorly. The hardest part of this job was knowing that you didn't matter as an employee or a person, and also having a diamond ring that was from my Mom, stolen from the break room. The most enjoyable part of this job was the day I gave my notice to resign."
bad,"Greeting customers, Welcoming customers into the store, Checking out customers, helping customers locate items.Cleaning check lanes and returning items back to their proper shelves."
bad,the company has low wages and the managers were always moving around and my experience was horrible working for Kroger over all
bad,Generally the worst part about kroger is not the high management it is the choice in supervisors. I don't know what it is about them but at the kroger i worked at most of the supervisors were lazy. Sometimes i would come in to work after my supervisor was there for 4 hours and see little to no work done. It was hard to put u with having to make up for his lack of effort yet when the department does good he gets the credit when it does bad he lays the blame on the dairy clerks with no remorse for his lies. I know i work hard but there was a clerk that worked even harder than me I don't understand how he could throw hard working people like that under the bus.
bad,From open to close there was always too much to do. We were expected to do so much with absolute minimal amount of people to do the jobs. They trained me to be proficient in many cutting edge aspects of pharmacy but many times that was more of a burden. I did enjoy providing quality care to many of the Kroger customers. Kroger does compensate their employees well but the demand to meet expectations makes the work environment very stressful.
bad,You work hard and deal with rude customers all day. Managers are rude and unprofessional and they hire you with the promise of decent hours but then you only get about 10 per week.
bad,"I have worked here for a while now and hate it more and more everyday. The management is horrible. They always make you feel like your doing something wrong, no constructive criticism always negative.  They have no consideration at all. It's okay if your in school and only need an after school part time job. I wouldn't recommend working here unless you"
bad,Money is good if you're in management but your job is in constant jeopardy. Unable to discipline associates without permission from regional manager and vice president
bad,"Not too bad a company to work for in the short term but in no way a place you want to be for too long.  Whether its the management, the two-faced union reps, or the customers themselves it is like walking on egg shells to work for Kroger.  Extremely small bi-annual pay increases.  Will be deliberately kept just barely below the limit for ""fulltime"" status(denying benefits and senioriy, etc.)"
bad,Not a good palce to grow in. They dont pay well their  union sucks. You pay union dues to a union who does nothing for you very worthless...
bad,Not a good place to work out there in the fuel center i got fired for going to the dr. It was mord of a racial issue too cause i was black and also kroger is in the union and i still lost my job but they make you pay union dues out of your check smh crazy!!!! Stay away!!!
bad,"what I learned is managing groceries, stock items, managing a register, and helping out customers when needed. most co-workers are high school students who don't know each other very well. There are no hardest parts of a job except carrying a 120 lbs sofa or table to customers. The retail store has bad management and they always switch every 5 months. I don't have any enjoyable parts of the job since I have worked there for 5 years."
bad,"I have been working with Kroger for months now, I always am on time I have never called in. I work very hard and my manger tells me how I am one of her best and hardest workers and that I am her best closer. I know everything about the sea food and the majority of stuff about the meat. I know just about everything in my department. I have made it very clear that I want to get my classification changed from apprentice and my manager has told me weeks upon weeks that she is going to either train me to be a sea food specialist or meat and every week I am told that the next week I will be trained. I feel my outstanding work ethic and great customer service is not being taken seriously so I finally decided since Kroger will not take me seriously I am done taking them seriously. Its time to bring what I have to offer to a company that is going to recognize the potential of a young driven person such as myself. It was nice working for Kroger and I am glad that I spent my time with them because I have learned things that will help me in life and in my continuous strive for improvement in the job market but its time to go to a company that will take someone who works very hard seriously and Kroger simply will not take there employees seriously and they will take advantage of there hard work."
bad,"Busy place; Store MNG. is horrible- harassing employees, blaming workers for his mistakes, sexually harassing people, doesn't let employees to work peacefully."
bad,"A typical day of work started with grouping all the night-shift workers in the receiving room, breaking down the freight by isles, and assigning isles to each individual.  Cleaning up debris and conditioning the store was a collaborative effort that took place at the end of the shift.  This job has taught me how to greatly manage my time at work, and has also taught me better judgment in terms of workload per time.  The job has sharpened my ability to use my hands accurately over repeated use.  The co-workers at nighttime have a wonderful sense of personality, yet they all work hard and disciplined when intense labor is needed.  At the time of my employment, management was sporadic.  A new store and grocery manager came into lead, and not only did they not control daily operations, they were unsupportive and abusive.  The greatest skill I received from this occupation is problem solving."
bad,"typical day at work was spent behind register completing customer transactions."
bad,"Not a fond experience with kroger, I've been with them for two years amd have only got a ten-fifteen cent raise."
bad,Worst place ever. Very unorganized and no one is held accountable for their work!
bad,Not a lot of opportunities to advance despite ones qualifications. 
bad,"I fell like they are all about money , they don't care or thank their employes ,. They do not work with full time employees schedules. If you don't have seniority than you are not garanteed hours. Not a good place to work if you have children."
bad,"I learned quite a bit about automated retail pharmacy and the use of technology to streamline pharmacy processes. I was responsible for checking between 2,500-3,000 rx's per day."
bad,"A typical day would be spent on the counter serving customers and doing some cooking in the back, mostly rotisserie chickens, fried items and occasional fruit/veggie trays and/or meat/cheese trays. Truth be told I didn't learn much there, the ability to put on a front to customers or really anyone you must be civil and/or polite to was instilled while I served in the military, but unfortunately the military on a resume cannot be an all encompassing entity for work experience. The management was in interim, the regular manager as been out since I started there and was filled in by whomever was the highest ranking person on duty. My co-workers ranged from college students who were making their way through school, or full-timers who had been there for ten years or more and really had no ambitions in life, so they weren't the best to learn from and were often petty and apathetic about most things. Nothing about the actual work was difficult, but the hardest part of the job was knowing that you were serving no greater good, there was no rewarding feeling in what you were doing, you were basically getting paid minimum wage to exist. The most enjoyable part of the job was the hope that it would be temporary."
bad,"NO work life balance, management was the worst either they were not there or had no clue what was really going on in the department. Pay was not enough for the work they wanted you to produce or the people you had to babysit. Never got the credit for the what you did."
bad,Management doesnt care for anyone in this company. Store management as well as upper management. What was once a grocery store has turned into a complete mess of paperwork. Its not about getting the product on the shelf anymore. It is more about paperwork being up to date and hanging in the appropriate place in the backroom.
bad,-Fast paced
bad,Very good customer service . Work in very busy department high volume with fast pace..
bad,"Collected cash payments from customers and made change and charged purchases to customers' credit cards and provided customers with receipts.Cleaned parking areas, offices, restrooms and equipment and removed trash.Ordered stock and priced and shelved incoming goods."
bad,"Management will be nice to your face and then turn around and cut your throat. Go above and beyond in all aspects but voice your opinion and your gone, unfair. Management likes to bully employees even though its a union job. They think they are untouchable. Good money, benefits and employees, watch out for management."
bad,A company that dealt with severe growing pains. Many upper management not qualified for their positions. Took away benefits and wages to many employees.
bad,Working is Kroger is ok if you are in schol full time and dont have any bills to pay. Reason why I say that because you only would work part-time. The job is stressful the some of the customers are ghetto and rude. The management has a nasty atitude.
bad,"When I started Kroger was great, but over the course of 7 years it has turned in a toxic environment. You will be chronically understaffed with people with little to no experience and management will not give you the tools to succeed."
bad,"Very little hours "
bad,The company evolves and changes if you like random and to never know a work goal or ever be able to complete a goal kroger is the perfect place. The work goes from morning shift to night shift weekends holidays closed one day a year christmas day.
bad,"I personally would not recommend working at Kroger. Things that were said to me during the interview was not all true. I've never worked for a union before, Kroger does have a union. I work my hardest every day I'm there. Management expects way to much out of one person. My opinion, they don't appreciate how hard you work. They just expect you to and to be able to make miracles happen."
bad,Kroger‘s is a great family friendly place for customers only. Is basically the only job you can get as a 14-15-year-old. Quite honestly I did not like it there management didn’t do much some people were very rude including other employees and only pays minimum-wage at the time I was there completely not worth it
bad,"Always busy and one can hardly any breaks without feeling guilty. Management scoffs at our position and doesn't help when they should but rather doing other ""necessary"" tasks. Too much to do with not enough time and everyone is stressed about not being able to get their work done with the low amount of help we have."
bad,"Constantly working mid day hours, working through every holiday, highschool politics, constant stress, and misdirection from upper management, many associates just lost there jobs while several openings at the office were posted."
bad,"The other employees were friendly and nice to work with, but the management doesn't want to give you breaks that you're entitled to and you don't get many hours throughout the week. The pay is barely above minimum wage. If you're a student without a lot of bills who just wants to make some extra money, this might be okay for you, but otherwise, it's not worth it."
bad,"24yrs on the job, and I was down sized so they could save money. "
bad,Constantly over work you. Company is very disorganized.Good worker don't last because they are mistreated.If you have a family it's not priority only working long hours are.
bad,Kroger offers great health benefits but the quality of the jobs are low. Every month the job gets more tense and management gets more disorganized. Clientele includes the general public and you must have thick skin otherwise you’ll go home upset every day.
bad,wouldn't schedule me hours  even though I had to go to school full time. management is very unprofessional. although the job wasn't difficult having a good manager will make people work harder
bad,"This company does not care of the employees at all. If you do not want to give up your family life DO NOT WORK FOR KROGER. The company now is running ""Waste Integration"" program which has lead to several terrible decisions. You say customers first but that really means screw our employees. Working for this company was almost degrading and since I have left the company, most people from my town knew me for my position and have noticed how the department I was in charge of has done nothing but gone down hill."
bad,kept shelves full. watched inventory. used computer scans to monitor inventory. product mark downs. product discounts. customer service was required a lot of the time for minimal task.
bad,Never got breaks or lunches. Got wrote up for stealing Kroger time when i stepped outside. The management is horrific. Very bullying. Left me traumatised.
bad,I ranked job good because Kroger is a union environment. Very difficult to get rid of poor performers in this work environment. People who absolutely suck will get the same rate of pay for those who are phenomenal. And the union will fight tooth and nail to make sure you keep your job.  Kroger does not have a culture of caring for employees.  Sales and results only.
bad,Work / life balance is very slim. Upper management only cares about moving up in the business which then causes the hourly associates to fail. Never a consistent time of day that we are leaving work. Paid too little for the amount of work we put in. PTO is the only good thing about it honestly.
bad,Omg it's horrible they treat you like a dog the pay sucks they are only worried ab how you affect them. The dept head manager flirted with every collage girl and then some never trained me properly and was very very rude . I wouldn't go back and wouldn't advise anyone to put an app n there.
bad,"I was terminated for cashing a check for $127 that the company issued to me. I was one week short of 15 years. Hired attorney, sued, win my case. The worst company ever."
bad,The store is always short staffed and you are expected to do the work of 4 people and talked to like a dog when you can’t get it done. The managers are rude and none caring. Corporate is even worse. You are always stressed out.And just because you requested a day off doesn’t mean you will get.
bad,"New employees not adequately trained, not given enough time. Unrealistic demands with not enough labor. They’re constantly asking for more petty work when there’s not enough time or help to follow current standard which creates health violations. No power jacks so it’s back breaking to pull entire loads alone. Good luck with days off, it’s the dept heads discretion and if they don’t like you they misuse the schedule as leverage. Mgmt is rude to employees, berating and backbiting. If you can get to the break room it’s usually filthy and there’s never supplies in the restrooms."
bad,"Transferred from KY., Started at my new store in Ohio, day 1 was put in wrong Dept., Day 1 was not paid my correct pay rate. Had planned on retiring from Kroger, but after what I was put through from a lieing manager, I quit and found much better job."
bad,Work as ASM in Shreveport area. Long hours. 10 hour day minimum. Yes you do work over ALL the time! 55 to 65 hours a week at 47k a year salary average. Thats less than 15 dollars an hr. Might as well be department lead in grocery at 20 dollars an hour 40 to 50 hrs a week. Great coworkers and customers but no outside life. Promise you pto but you get none! Another ASM on vacation?  You work 6 daysd
bad,"Very micromanaged, no work life balance, inconsistent schedule, unrealistic expectations, too many hours, not focusing on selling groceries anymore, work is no longer fun."
bad,Kroger store 630 is terribly managed. The management work their employees who are 18 and up like slaves and it’s not worth the pay. Management also like to either talk to you like you’re a child or make petty threats for example I was threatened to be fired twice in one day from 2 different people and a coworker was threatened to be slapped by the head manager twice
bad,They don’t do right . They messy and Starkville Mississippi Kroger’s . I think the deli should get paid more . But yet the deli for sea food gets all the money . They knows better a light bill was my whole check plus gas to put in my car . They know better . This not right a 200 hundred dollar check not enough
bad,"When I worked here, everything in the orientation sounded great. But it's the people that work there that make the job. The morning work got put onto me as a closer. Not just something small, something that takes at least 45 minutes. On top of that, I had to rush to do the work actually meant for my shift."
bad,My hours were never reliable. I would be hired for one department and end up working in three different departments with no raise. They were understaffed and unprofessional
bad,"Management barely does anything, most employees have their own cliques and are rude to everyone else, get yelled at by old ladies who think they run the place, not worth it for minimum wage"
bad,I had worked for the company for 3 years started off as a conditioner even though I already had experience. Then a few days later was moved up to stocker within 6 months I became a frozen food manager then got switched to become a dairy manager. At first most management liked me because of course I worked like a dog and did the best I could. At one point a new store manager came in and ruined the store I was at after awhile I left the company. Few months later I went back to being a dairy manager again as they were without a dairy manager for a week of two and as soon as I go in I hear all this drama and all this some of the people that I worked with were mad I got the position and always talked mess. I only worked 2 months then got wrongfully terminated for not clocking out for lunch but the thing is theres multiple employees that do so. Didnt get a write up or anything just got suspended then terminated. All this with everybody knowing I was expecting a newborn baby on the way. There was some good upsides but the bad outweighs the good.
bad,If you like being treated very poorly then this is your place. Working hard and helping coworkers didn't mean a thing to anyone. Over worked and underpaid. union doesn't stand behind the employees like they should.
bad,Good management is worked to the point that they quit.  That leaves childish vindictive managers whom make you want to run screaming from building.  Everyone is pretty much miserable.
bad,"As a curtesy clerk, I always thought that it would be a great way to learn more about customer service but my experiences with the other employees have mostly been negative. The other employees aren't very uplifting and usually have nothing good to say about working there. When ever I have to inform front desk about concerns, they are very rude and hate dealing with things, not to mention they are very unreliable. Breaks are required my state law and I only get mine 50% of the time. I didn't even know the managers until 4 months into the job and then they changed. At first I thought it was great but once you work there for a while there is no motivation to do a great job at the things you are to to do because no one corrects or compliments you on it."
bad,"Although I was part time and it was a temporary job while I was in school, it was stressful and the management/leadership we had was awful. I felt like I was in high school again with all the drama going on. My front end leader loved to play favoritism and management did nothing to end that. If you weren’t a “favorite” you never knew what your shift would consist of, but let’s just say you’d count the second until you were able to leave. It’s always short staffed and management never takes the employees side on anything. Also, pay is awful. Basically, it’s a good temporary job while in school, but other than that it’s a nightmare."
bad,i had a doctors note for Wednesday and had to leave saturday to go to a family emergency they counted the wednesday as a no call no show even though i had a doctors note
bad,"Over worked and Understaffed at ALL TIMES. Not worth any kind of ""reimbursement"" they offer Interns, you will be their slave! Will work nights, weekends and holidays. Pay is not worth the stress of working there. If it's your day off, it's likely they'll call you and ask you to work, no work/life boundaries. Go work at a Private-Owned pharmacy, just don't do retail!!!  Kroger used to be an ok place to work at, but their management changed, priorities changed, and now instead of being employee centered, and caring about their employees, they only care about profit, and meeting company goals so they all get their be fat bonuses. And trust me, at Retail level, it's not worth it! Oh, and the pharmacy is non-union, so you have no one to fight for you or protect your job."
bad,"A typical day at work requires working non stop without a break as there is no time to finish all you tasks otherwise, unless you want to work a 12 h day"
bad,"No customer service job is a walk in the park, however in this city, Portsmouth, Ohio, it can be very challenging to maintain patience. Also, management is not helpful whatsoever. They do not have our backs when it comes to explaining company policies, and they just give customers whatever they want, making us clerks look rude and like idiots."
bad,"Everything Kroger used to be has almost been eliminated. I've worked for this company for 6 years and this is quite possibly the worst it's ever been, and showing no signs of stopping. Their corporate structure is rampant with nepotism, favoritism, and preferential treatment. There are several situations of people being gifted positions. They do not care about store level associates at all. They make constant decisions without considering store level impact, often asking far more of associates than possibly. The vacation scaling is abysmal, the starting pay is honestly garbage compared to many companies today, and your schedule will never be consistent.  And where as the health insurance is actually quite good (dental and vision included), you won't get it until you are full time, which they will sometimes actually work to prevent. Also they renegotiate their contract with the union every three years and take more and more benefits away every time they do. "
bad,There are some Kroger stores that are better than others. On a corporate level the company has a lot of hope for bringing the best to their customers but at a store level alot of stores managers are not too concerned with good customer service or well being of workers.
bad,"Worked as cashier, everyone uses same cash, and if it's out of balance they hold it against everyone. Rip-off union dues provide provide no benefits, they're really a thing of the past. Tried to transfer and relocate, and was turned down because of group cash shortage. It's a dead-end job."
bad,Average day is spend with my Manger whatever she doesn't have time to complete your there to finish up all her lose ends and working on the floor when it gets busy with other co workers doing production for next day like cooking making trays for catoring that is what I do in day and make sure the next day has plenty stock ready go so we don't get empty to fast.
bad,"They overwork us, pay us less than what we deserve, if you are sick or can’t come to work, they guilt you into working anyways, and overall awful environment. If you work your butt off, they still complain and say you aren’t doing enough. Managers get away with EVERYTHING yet you can’t even move your finger. Management is always on the customers side even if they full blown harass you. They expect you to work non-stop until you drop dead from exhaustion. You have to be here for YEARS before you even get holiday pay or work benefits...."
bad,Kroger is a good place to work if you can do things last minute and are capable of not needing a schedule a day in advanced. If you can do a job feeling invaluable and know you can quite possibly never move up and work for $9/hr then this is the place for. You!
bad,"Management personnel are mean, insulting, passive aggressive, and stressful. Definitely not worth the money they pay you. They will also move you to different departments regardless of what you signed on to do. Just don't work here."
bad,It is very stressful job. Never get answers. Starbucks was a separate and they wanted you to do what Starbucks said and Kroger at the same time. Both of them had conflicting interests.
bad,"Typical days were long and grueling 12 to 16 hour days for department managers and up. Very common for manager to have a very difficult time getting time off, Vacations were also challenging to say the least. Culture over all in the stores was very poor it was often related as over worked and under valued. The most enjoyable part of the job was trying to change the culture. Kroger has a saying customer first and thats great, to them it means employees don't matter in the in reaching  of that goal customers matter you are a number. I worked serval stores in 90% culture was the same workers hated there jobs and were jumping ship when they could."
bad,"The managers are not friendly to coworkers; treated poorly. Management is poor, as well as teaching newcomers. You do more than what is in your job description. Paid under minimum wage. Hours are not flexible enough."
bad,"As part of the Kroger system, We have one of the highest quitting rate for all departments. Being part of the pharmacy team the benefits is learning your patience and that's about all. The Houston division is unionized which doesn't allow much of anything if managers even care about the employees. The positive of Kroger is they will hire anyone and everyone to get a start in getting experience but once that goal is met employees leave without a second thought."
bad,Kroger needs to look at their management team and replace all of them! It would be so much better if they had real management. I enjoyed my job but hated the environment
bad,"Poor management Never helped me work out my schedule to work around college even though they said they would. Management never cared even if I talked to them about my situation they would always tell me they would fix it but never did. Most of the workers never showed up to work and managers never seemed to care even if they were behind, also never properly trained just threw me in the job on the first day with no training."
bad,"Kroger only cares about how much money they can make and what they can squeeze out of their employees. Typical corporation."
bad,I was hired as a Pharmacy Technician but because of cut back in hours I was not allowed to to learn and become the a person I wanted to be. Great company but so many cut backs on employee participation. I’m working in the deli just to make my 40 hours. I’ve got so much to offer and it’s being wasted cutting meat in the deli because Kroger is cutting hours.
bad,Kroger on stage rd in Bartlett is probably one of the worst management I have ever seen. They are very rude and do not care about you at all. The ask questions about your personal life that they shouldn’t be asking. Yes at first I really liked it then two of the front end managers started showing the new people how they actually are. Then the store manager was very friendly and nice but he left and we got a new store manager and she is very rude and is always yelling at people. Would not recommend this job at all.
bad,"Kroger is based out of Ohio, and yet I worked in a grocery store all the way in Oregon selling wine and beer. I got to know my customers and market pretty well, so it upset both when Kroger would move in and change around my stock based on sales in all stores in the country. So much for keeping local flavor alive."
bad,"Kroger was a very stressful job to work at, has poor management, some of the customers were very rude, unsafe working conditions, not very sanitary, and very slow to respond when told to fix something that's been broken for months. I didn't learn much from that place, I've been there for 2 years and they haven't even fully trained me. The pay was very bad they only increased your salary by 25 cents a year. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the demand with customers even when the warehouse continued to fail by providing us with everything we needed to provide customer service. There was nothing enjoyable about this job."
bad,liked what i did there. just didnt like the inconsistency of it. didst really matter how hard you worked. it all about favoritism. couldn't move up unless the bosses liked you.
bad,"The pay is good, however it's not worth the frustration and the stress. The management at Kroger are rude, and very nitpicky. You do get 10% off Kroger brands which is good."
bad,"Not fair with everyone, if you get on someone’s bad side they will hold that against you. They don’t treat everyone the same if they don’t like you they will not help you. I was in pain one time excruciating pain and I couldn’t leave because it was too busy they don’t care about their employees more about making other people happy and make sure we have no lines."
bad,This was my first job at age 18 and I did not enjoy the role because of the other workers and management. This is not a job I would have recommended to anyone.
bad,"As an employee that is friends with an ex employee, we've been constantly harassed by management every time we are in the store together. They will lie and throw you under the bus for no reason, and do not care about anything other than sales, despite being the best performing department."
bad,"The only thing worth staying for is the affordable healthcare they offer, but it takes a year to qualify for it. "
bad,Kroger can be a fun place to work if management cared about their employees. They have a high turnover rate due to poor upper management. I always made sure my customers needs were met.
bad,HR OR CORPORATE do nothing about any situation. What do we need them for !? To sit on their butts and do nothing !! Coworkers are worse than high school girls and the women were in their 50’s they clearly have nothing else to do and have no lives !
bad,"I was part of their grocery market chain in California my store was called, food for less. out of all there subsidiary, this is the worse one to work at"
bad,"Promised 5 day work weeks/45-50 hours per week.  Actuality, you work 60+ with zero appreciation.  Upper management refuses t acknowledge poor work morale and turns a blind-eye."
bad,Horrible work environment.  If you do not work according to supervisor's liking you will be workplace mobbed and HR will go along with it.  Too many politics.
bad,I started working here as a teenager. I advanced rapidly and excelled at my job. Only to be let down by management and treated as if I didn't matter. I would never work there again.
bad,"The managers. At this kroger location make promises they cannot keep, and allow part timers to be come full time when not needed. Many changes are requested of said managers and nothing has been done for months."
bad,"people were often leaving before their shift was up, management refused to take in employee suggestions, and often berated their own employees for doing as they were asked, employees often would gossip or talk about other coworkers, in general a lot of drama, the management did not know the workings of the store, when asked how certain things worked they couldn't tell you. Some co workers were friendly but, most people were either stuck there or were there until they finished school nobody really  wanted to be there, so it was a very toxic environment."
bad,"The job was a very fast paced situation where I was required to assist in breaking down all the trucks, then I was assigned multiple isles that I had to restock, organize, and prepare for the next day. I was also directed to assist the frozen department with their over night stocking job. When I first started there was 7 people on overnight stock and after 2 weeks it was down to 2 in overnight stock and 1 in frozen."
bad,"Pays minimum wage with the expectation that you will break your back to perform at 150%"
bad,"Management was horrible, they thought just because they had manager beside their name they could treat people terrible and lie to corporate and blame others for their wrong doing."
bad,Great job to be 16 and too put some money in your pocket. Workplace environment was relaxed and everything was a slow pace. No task was to difficult to handle
bad,"21+ years for the company and was indefinitely suspended over $20. While I agree that it was a lapse in judgment, I do not think it was something I should have been fired over. But in the end, the company wins. They don't have to pay me any more, and I can be replaced with someone who they pay less to do the same amount of work. This job really isn't worth your time, short OR long term. If you are looking short term, there are so many other employers that will pay you a better starting wage than Kroger will. Oh, and don't ever expect any sort of incentive based raise for work you've done. Unless you are in management, these raises do not exist. And don't join the union....not worth it. My dues were raised by $1 a week because they are having problems getting new members."
bad,"Kroger once was an employer of choice for me.  With recent changes within the organization their commitment to associates has declined.  Associates are unappreciated, poorly compensated and the company pays less and less towards benefits and charges more to the associate to participate in the benefits."
bad,"The union basically does NOTHING for us because the managers know how to manipulate the situation. They treat hourly workers like they're scum, abuse their authority, and have an ego like a surgeon. You manage a freaking GROCERY STORE!! Whoopdie dooo!!!"
bad,Kroger was a very bad experience and not a fun place to work. Other employees were rude and management had no type of attorney.  There's no structure what so ever.
bad,"Corporate cut everyone's hours and the hours were very inconsistent, working 20 hours one week and 30 the next. They would change shifts last minute only on the board in the back of the department and it won't update online, but wouldn't inform you. I was left closing alone as a very new employee. Work was hard, breaks were short, and pay wasn't worth it. Management was also unpleasant at my store. I learned a lot about the products though."
bad,"greet customers"
bad,Days went by slow. Managers did not manage. Replies were snarky.  Little training was ever given. Breaks were few and far between. Expectations were absurdly high for a position with such little relevance despite never giving the proper training needed to be successful.
bad,"I would like to walk into a workplace feeling happy and stress free , not with the new managers that work there though , automatically makes me feel stressed when they walk through the door"
bad,There will always be something to do. Maximizing production and minimizing gap time is pivotal here. Plenty of Overtime and Mandatory Overtime available.
bad,"The management are totally childish who act completely different behind closed doors. There was a manager from the one in Fruita, CO that spit in my face."
bad,"Work was quite easy. I stocked shelves with product assisted customers, and did occasional cleaning. The people were friendly and easy to work with. Employees were unfriendly and lazy. Management does not enforce any rules or regulations and allow employees to get away with low productivity."
bad,Management issues; low pay; poor scheduling; very little help for some departments that need it a whole of a lot more than others; also a sense of urgency from a manager/s that always seem to want you do things for them that they should be able or intelligent to do themselves the end.
bad,"just awful"
bad,working at kroger was very stressful. the managers did not care about their employees they only cared about themselves. The work conditions were paid and the pay was as well.
bad,A typical work day would include me interacting with many customers and employees to make sure we stay productive and the customers get what they need from their daily experience. They work place environment is very busy and sometimes hectic.
bad,"Was not trained properly and was not given a online login and then ask why did I not check it when my schedule was messed up, not a very professional place to work in my opinion"
bad,"Push you to do work that is not in your position. Management doesn't really care about you. They tell you not to do something, for example, talk to the other cashiers or baggers. We can be doing NOTHING. Yet we are told by our floor runners we cant talk, yet they talk to random people all the time. They have friends come in and start talking, yet they don't get in trouble even when it is busy."
bad,"Plenty of control issues,  one of the managers there stopped me from getting a drink of water out of the drinking fountain. An employee that still works there has threatened my family and harrased them."
bad,"I worked at Kroger for roughly a year, paid at minimum wage for the entire time. The hours was very slim, usually being about 12, as long as people who worked there didn't ""Roll"" you. To ""Roll"" is to literally just take other people's hours and anyone who worked there longer than another associate was allowed to roll them. It only happened to me twice ever, but it's a very very poor and toxic workplace perk, as it can completely ruin a person's payment plans. The management literally ignored all opinions given to them, refused any form of accommodation at all for people with allergies to bee strings, still forcing them to throw trash into infested dumpsters. Management had an awful attitude as well. Overall very very poor experience and could not recommend anything less."
bad,Out of all the stores that I have worked at only one store had a good manager. The management treats employees like garbage. They don't respect the needs of the store and the department managers. The Store manager goes out and gets her nails done on the clock and no manager works there 40 hour work schedule.
bad,The staff were terrible in my experience. You'd work every day for 3-4 hours a day and they'd expect you to stay longer without the pay
bad,"Made 7.25 an hr  no set schedule. Rude mangers, and employees. The breaks where so short and the customers are rude. Not worth staying more than a year"
bad,Management is ineffective and degrading to employees. Very little room for advancement. Genuinely do not care about their employees.
bad,Bad. I have worked for Marianos a total of 2 years while also attending school. the management does a poor job of managing schedules and ensuring the happiness of the employee which will translate over to customer happiness.
bad,"As a cashier you are told which register to go to by your supervisor, and told when to take your break and lunch. Learned that the customer is always right even when they are wrong. Customer First is Kroger's motto. Most co-workers are fun to work with except for ones who feel they are more than a cashier/bagger. Hardest part is not being bored doing down time when there are no customers. Most enjoyable is meeting new customers and hearing their stories and chatting it up with the regulars."
bad,"typical day at work is not eve doing your work its the manager work then there upset at you because your work isnt done."
bad,"The Kroger Co does not value employees. It values making money and people in high positions, but not it's hourly paid people who break it's back to keep it the place going."
bad,"Left for higher wages. Shifts were a bit demanding, but pay was the main reason for leaving"
bad,"Outside of the hourly wage, and the benefits package, I would not recommend this employer. Management has a general low opinion of production employees. This plant is a swing shift operation whereas you work 7 days between days off, and you move from day shift, to afternoon shift, to midnight shift every month. You work schedule allows for only 12 week ends off per year. Low employee moral."
bad,I saw no growth in the company so i left and found new employment with ranstand
bad,"great place to work, but not when i was there. i will not say the name, but a certain manager was how i guess you could say harassing me a bit much about some problems that wasn't any of their business and after i solved such problems he/she would still try to make problem out of it, but Kroger is a great place now because that person got fired later on."
bad,This Company is very diverse but has a tendency of providing unprofessionalism in tuff circumstances.
bad,"A typical day working in the kroger deli, mainly slicing our customers meat or cheeses somedays we're busy and others not so often but if we have a very minimum of customers we clean around the workplace, such as sanitizing the slicers clean around slices. also we put supplies that need to be put in their spot or just make backups (making sandwiches, etc) for the next day to be put out on shelf. I've learned how to use a slicer machine as well as an RF and also how to use and write in a PPST. Management is somewhat bad I really don't get the management we have in the deli their never on site even when theirs help need in the deli they won't help and they'll continue on doing what they were doing. My co-workers they work together at all everyone just does what they want to do and they don't communicate thats why sometimes things don't get all the way done or done at all. Nothing is really hard about my job everything is pretty standard.the most enjoyable part of my job would be when we have events at work when they show all of the departments appreciation and they have ll cookouts for us or celebrations with free food or gift cards."
bad,Overnight can be entertaining with the drunks that came in on the weekends.
bad,"It would't be a bad job for a teenager or a job for a college student. But for me, someone with bills, they just don't pay enough nor give you enough hours."
bad,Just need better communication between different  departments and building staff.
bad,"Kroger is a good place to work.  As a Customer Service Manager the hours are just not flexiable for my family, and I."
bad,"the people i worked with dont take their job seriously, and they dont think that new people should be trained correctly."
bad,"The Kroger company is not a bad place to work as a teen, but when you have bills to pay, you can't survive here. The work environment will make anyone unhappy over time be it the poor management, or the lack of appreciation. I have worked here for two years, and every day is like babysitting those with seniority. If you just started, anyone 5+ years will stand around while they have you work. The only enjoyable part of the job is the flexible schedule, but when it comes to any other area it is well below par."
bad,not enough hours sometimes id be the only bagger on the floor so i had to go fast as i can and not many shopping carts
bad,"Run for your life! Kroger is dead set on leaving old school red management in place. Corporate does little to get rid of bad workers because they are too busy pumping as much sweat as they can out of the good workers. They just recently decided to put on the mask of caring about the employees. Our employee appreciation days are laughable; we get old bakery goods (the same stuff they donate to the food bank). I am not above receiving past date food, but don't call it appreciation day. The company is too big for it's own good."
bad,"A typical day at my current job includes ensuring all my team players are accomplishing their tasks in a timely fashion, checking my cooler to make sure there is sufficient product to satisfy customer needs, and preparing the sales floor for a day of business and writing an order to bring in product on the next day. I have built and trained an effective and efficient team to create a smooth running produce department.I greatly the different personalities and helping team members with issues or problems they run into as they try to create an pleasurable shopping experience for our customers. The hardest part of my job is to reduce shrink (the amount of product thrown away because it has gone bad) and make sure my purchase to sales numbers are within the top 5 of our district."
bad,kroger treat there employees horrible they don't give them enough hour to afford the benefits. the floor managers are inconsiderate and the salary is barely enough to pay a bill. Lunch is never free.
bad,"I was pregnant at the time of this job so it really wasn't fun standing on my feet everyday, reaching and picking up items."
bad,the fun part of my job was interacting with the customers and co workers
bad,"i enjoyed helping customers get on there way on a day to day, as well as helping them find things in the store even if i was on break,i did not enjoy a manager getting physical with me."
bad,good job yet management has a big problem with micromanaging. great benefits and great insurance. other than that come to work on a normal day do your job and go homoe
bad,"It was too tight a fit. Change was difficult, in the sense that to become full time, you had to be approved by the union. Because the hiring was based on sales, small stores that needed help were always shorthanded, and large stores benefited.  I did enjoy the company of the people that I worked with, though. The lack of emphasis on customer service for new hires disturbed me."
bad,Cleveland avenue Kroger’s is the worst always only have 2 registers open they hide carts filled with food in manager’s office when their big bosses come so they be selling bad items and all the managers sucks!!!!
bad,they want a lot from you but dont employ enough people to get the job done they want only 3 people to put away a 1500 pice truck in 8 hours and if not done they make u stay late tyo finsh it they change your start time to benfiet them if u think its your day off they will tell u no that tomrow is ur day off even when the time clock wont let you clock in
bad,Wasn't what I thought it would be. The job was great but the experience in the store was not up to par the managers we're rude and the coworkers we're disrespectful.
bad,"After working for the company for less than 12 months, they are going through a restructuring. Honestly it should have been done sooner. People are being moved, fired, or the option of early retirement. The greater Nashville area is in desperate need of staffing both salaried managers and regular associates. Work /life balance is the worst I've seen in Retail. If you get a store that is not staffed, you will be doing the work work along with your own daily obligations."
bad,"Insanely oblivious to hired workers characters and behavior which effect actual great workers, zero reprimandations. Management unable to resolve daily miniscule issues, which would have better long term, scheduling correct amount ofemployees"
bad,"I can’t even count the number of times I’ve had someone look at me and say “Get our while you can kid” this place is the worst, it’ll suck your soul straight out of your body and pay you minimum wage for it."
bad,I'm a college student and had to change my availability once classes started. Was told when hired it wouldn't be a problem but once I told my manger she kept trying to get me to change when I was available so it worked better for her scheduling.
bad,"Super stressful. Constantly talking about being a family oriented company, but tell you that youre required to work a minimum of 50 hours a week, and if the jobs not done you cant go home. Say expectations are one thing then you get in trouble if you hit them, because it couldve been better. Not worth the stress."
bad,"I feel if management were better and cared for their associates then this review would go a different direction. This is a job for me to pay bills until something better may come along. Working here is like babysitting and being in high school. A lot of people I work with do not put in the amount of effort needed to complete the job and that hurts other workers do. This company has a bad habit of keeping dead weight around and only bicker at the GOOD workers for not picking up the HORRIBLE workers job up. It really interrupts your mental health. Too much gossip, not enough working. A lot of gossip will come from the associates who are 50+ years old and have been with the company for 20+ years because they have nothing better to do."
bad,"It's a nothing job that is built from the top down to take away all of your time. They will intentionally schedule you 15 minutes less than when you would get another break. You have to clock out to go to your break, which the break room is conveniently located on the other side of the store, so you spend 10-minutes of your 15-minute break walking to and from the break room. Also, you are not allowed to take off your work shirt on your way to the break room, and you are told you must always help a customer even if you are on your break heading to the break room. On a corporate scale, they are actively working in every way they can to get you to work the maximum amount of time without offering any breaks, all this with most positions starting at minimum wage or maybe a dollar or two above it. If you can help it don't work at Kroger, because they do not care about their employees in the slightest. They literally plan out their buildings and policies to work against the employees and not with them"
bad,"If you enjoy never knowing your end time come work here."
bad,I worked here for only a month as a Starbucks barista. It was very stressful at times not because of customers but because of mangment. I didnt get much time off and my paycheck was very low. They had so many fees and I had to be part of a union which took a good third of my paycheck.
bad,"Honestly only the worst get promoted there is zero communication between management and employees and it becomes impossible to put in any formal complaints because management will just ""lose"" your complaint and then refuse to do anything about the complaint"
bad,I found out that if you are a single mother Kroger's is not for you. Even if a task is impossible that you just get it done to the best you can sad. The up-and-down shifts I never understood those
bad,I stand by my original complaint about how they handle x offenders they have no compassion for x offenders I lost my job due to self surrender and was not allowed to come back even when I wrote them a letter from hail
bad,"Until recently, the conditions at Kroger were tolerable. The manager could be overly strict at times, but it was easy to just ignore her. But over the past month or so, it's gone COMPLETELY downhill. The second they gave us more self-checkout lanes, they slashed our cashier hours to the point where we're lucky if we have more than three cashiers at a time ON A SUNDAY. It's gotten to the point where our Front End leaders are incapable of doing their jobs because they have to help make sure the Front End doesn't tank. Corporate has made it abundantly clear that they only care about their bottom line. The employees are nothing to them but expendable tools."
bad,They took away my overtime that did while I was work and would not give it back even when they knew I did overtime. Management would never have my back when it came to employee issue.
bad,"I had to fight to keep this job all the time. I was continually lied on and had to prove the lies. This is a very dangerous company. A customer lied on me and wrote a lie to the president of Ralph's Market saying I made his little boy cry which was a total lie. Said prejudice and start a root in my store saying hr was going to get me fired. This was all over something free with a purchase. This customer did not want to purchase the item to get the free gift, he just wanted the gift. I told him no he couldn't just take the free gift he was then given the gift by another employee whom lied on me  with this man. This man was then paid for almost getting me fired. My district  manager at time help this man present this lie on me. See I was use in a embezzlement job by one of my manager whom had been stealing cash and thru Western Union when he used me to fraudulently send money thru Western Union by telling me I had to speak with a Western Union agent to fix a problem with our system. I was then suspended pending  what they found out. Well they couldn't stick the almost 10,000.00 dollars that she had me send to New York. Fast forward they were busted in a week a and I continually harassed by this company. Always transferred because they couldn't pin the lies and stealing on me. Oh yea one big manager took the rap for the 20 something managers. They fired a great manager of over 39 years telling him they no longer need his services. They are horrible and will take your life away. I was so greatful for all of my Union Reps at UFCW Local 770.Because if we wouldn't have prove every"
bad,"Kroger is obviously not the first place you think of when considering a job. However, with recent pay advances, the job isn't the bottom of the barrel. You will certainly work with people that will work the minimum, you will meet people who will work their hands purple (seriously). All in all, the pay isn't the worst, and the job is extremely laid back, a nice first job, past that, it's debatable."
bad,"Kroger keeps laying on responsibility after responsibility. Management doesn’t take responsibility for their poor management and blame it on “employee work effort”. Corporate makes needless changes to departments all the time instead of fixing current problems. After corporate and management lay on more responsibilities they don’t up your pay. You’d be lucky if you made anything close to $10/hr (excluding specialty training like meat department). The only good thing is that you get a week of paid vacation, but only if you survive a year there."
bad,"Stressful lack of support from store management and G.O "
bad,Horrible  place no respect for anyone crazy schedule .never enough help to do the job managers are the worst people and don't help you or thank you when you do a good job
bad,"This company is so unorganized and they are always changing things. No one seems to know what’s going on from day to day. Customers hate shopping our store because they have made it so cluttered. It’s like an obstacles course. The management is not very good either. Lots of people promoted because they are friends with the higher ups, not because they are good at what they do. Too much is put on the employees that can’t be accomplished without having way more people. Unfortunately the starting wage is so low that they cant get quality people."
bad,This company wants to be recognized as an employer of choice. Difficult to accept this expressed mentality when they shut down a plant with no warning and put nearly 500 people out of work simply to avoid the cost of updating equipment that should have been already replaced. Three quarters of the equipment in question dated from the 1950s. Very poor corporate management.
bad,"Kroger is not a good company to work for. The president of Kroger has high, very UNREALISTIC expectations for all workers, and corporate wise, everyone is LAZY, has no idea what is going on, and incompetent to do what job they're supposed to be doing. Specifically speaking about Mariano's, Kroger has torn apart what Mariano's was initially founded on. If you ask anyone who worked at Mariano's before Kroger bought the company they will tell you there is SUCH a drastic difference in employment work environment, store product, and benefit wise. Products get cheaper and are made different in order to save Kroger money, they want to turn Mariano's into the plain experience. Management has no sense of leadership, and little experience. Ever since Kroger took over, they have lost a lot of employees with all the changes. Kroger needs a new president. It is clear they do not care about employees, Kroger is a very money hungry company, and if you aren't willing to work 12 hour days and go by their book, they will cut you off like they have gotten rid of many corporate leaders.They push people who disagree with them out. Management is very racist too."
bad,when i first started it was great my coworkers were nice and helpful and they had been working in that position for years. store manager and supervisor were horrible...extremely horrible.
bad,There is never an option to move up in the work place and we are treated unfairly. We do not get paid enough when our work union takes $20 from us every week
bad,Most of the store was understaffed and company watched hours like a hawk.  Poor communication between the office and stores and those in the office tended to look down on those who worked in the stores.  Very weak union that was likely in the companies pocket.
bad,"Zero communication, follow-ups, “rules” change weekly and implementation of new programs are never thought out—left for pharmacists to figure out. All staff pharmacists are now part time and additional tech hours were never give as promised"
bad,"busy lines short breaks, easy training, weekly pay, minimum wage, easy to switch jobs within the company, poor benefits, not always off at exact out time."
bad,"The company is to worried about compition instead of selling groceries. There growing faster than they can keep up. Click list is the newest disaster. There’s to many new programs replacing other failed programs. More and more paper work keeps getting added to take up more of our time,so much waisted time spent on useless meetings. We’re constantly being threatened with our jobs “we will hire someone else” This use to be a great company to work for now it’s mismanaged and being run into the ground. If your in school and looking for a part time job this may work for you."
bad,"The company culture is terrible, and it gets worse every year. People are promoted based on favorites more so than who’s actually qualified. They’re having trouble filling management positions both salary and hourly because what’s expected of you isn’t worth the minuscule increase in pay. Store management doesn’t have much of a say when it comes to the way the store is run. All commands always seem to come from somebody higher up and store management are nothing more than messengers."
bad,"I worked for Kroger for almost 5 years before the company closed all their stores in NC. It took me about 3-4 of those years to go from $7.25 an hour to the max of $11.50 an hour."
bad,"the job was pretty okay, laid  back for the most part... it was calm, cool, and collected for the most part.. just stressful at times but that is expected in the grocery store..."
bad,"Management is lazy sometimes and lets trash build up,"
bad,"I worked as a bagger and was treated as if my job wasnt very important to the company. I was told it was important, but treated much differently. When I was hired, I wasnt told that I would have to get carts, which wasnt a problem for me, until I had to go out no matter what the weather was like and ended up getting sick often and was not given proper days off for being sick. I understand carts are necessary but workers' health is also important. Communication between managers and workers was very bad too and lots of workers were told one thing by one manager and something else by another. Everything was always stressful because I never knew what the current manager expected of me."
bad,It was coo at the beginning then they started messing my money up and not scheduling me but calling and asking where am I ? It was a lot at that Kroger’s !
bad,"Typical day as a Assistant Store manager depends entirely on your role. There are three different roles in this position: Human Resources, Merchandising, Operations. A typical day will require you to be able to perform all of these roles, and to do clerk work as required."
bad,"rude customers,short to no breaks, not enough help when store get busy. no team players. no discounts. no opportunity for advancement. working for hour shifts."
bad,"Had management around me no matter what I was doing, was also poorly treated. "
bad,No home work life balance the want u to put Kroger over your family. Too much street to keep up the the customer demand with very little hours.it works on your body
bad,I only worked for Kroger for a year and a half due to the lack of a work/life balance. I literally worked 90 hours in one week getting ready for a big event and when I wanted to take the next day off my supervisor wouldn't let me.
bad,"there was no enjoyable part of the job, it consisted of stocking shelves and answering customer calls and customer calls.  my coworkers were unfriendly."
bad,"I worked at store in Murfreesboro, I had the worst experience of my life working there. My manager never knew how to treat people. She still works there after numerous complaints by employees. My manager made me cry about everyday as I worked there. I would never suggest people to work for Kroger or at least at that store."
bad,"I had never worked for such a cut throat company before. Everyone is paid poorly, therefore turnover is high. I worked as a click list supervisor. Some days were easy, others were brutal. On the busy days you could expect to work at least 12 hours. Management was always down your throat but never willing to help out."
bad,"My first few months at kroger were decent, worked in produce, which can be hard sometimes. I showed my true effort and ended up being forced to be a cashier. It was fine for a couple of months. Then Management and Corp decided to make pesky little rules. Had to be at the register way down where we lock the doors at night. Customers had to walk across the store to leave which was annoying for both of us because I was far away from the uscan that was open at night. Got yelled at several times for talking to baggers when I did include the customers in the conversations. Now they want to write up the cashiers who dont perform to a certain percent. They want us to scan the customers items as fast as possible and rush them out as soon as possible. Management told lies in front of my face, rumors and gossip spread like wildfire. Be careful who you tell your problems to, if not everyone in the store will know. Helped close the store and basically saved it a few times and I got no thank you from management or anyone. Once in a while ill get $3 coupons, wow thanks. How about giving your employees a decent raise? Overall I dont recommend this job unless youre in high school or college that just needs some money."
bad,it was a very stressful job that was not worth what i was getting paid. the management team were incompetent. Job advancement is little to none. I had showed interest to move up and was not taken seriously even when i put in the extra hours and the work.
bad,It was ok for that situation is being that I was going ... so basically everyday after school at four o'clock I was there sweeping clean and doing everything else management wanted
bad,"good job for younger people with limited avalibility, low pay, poor management, wouldnt reccomend for someone looking for a career path, overall a teenager job"
bad,MAnagemnet didn't care for employees that much and not respectful. I didn't agree with how situations wee handled and how training was for the new comers.
bad,"management did not treat employees fairly. they expected way to much out of employees with out giving overtime or enough hours to the departments, management liked to play the blame game and not own up to their mistakes, payroll is also an issue. my check was short multiple times and I still haven't been paid for shifts worked over 3 months ago"
bad,The job itself is over demanding and you recieve little to no acknolegement for going beyond what is required. also the system is set up so that hard working associates must pick up the slack of lazy associates and no repercussions happen anywhere. the management does nothing almost the entire day and lets people slack off and even completely ignore their jobs.
bad,"working retail is very cut throat. A lot is expected of you with no appreciation in return. work place culture in some stores is better than others."
bad,Customer and empolyee are great assocoiates...  They know I m deaf...Love this job because of discount and people the hard part of works hours are so struggle and cant work as ull time and must work longer to becomefulltimeand have to transfer to another store
bad,"Nothing was done about s****l harassment, constant bullying and racism. Management included. Left over the absolute refusal to handle these issues. Terrible experience. The pay wasn't enough to deal with this on top of the customers and the fast paced environment."
bad,Way to much drama in the deli bakery most of which starts from the manager there. Jobs are assigned so unfairly. It's not based on the job you do it's more if you make the manager mad or not.
bad,"Kroger offers great benefits and pay but they lack work-life balance. If I could do it all over again, I wouldn't have worked for this company. I regret it!"
bad,I have worked here for 4 years. They have become more and more unreasonable over time. Less hours to do more work. This all started with management changes at the top. Now the company is bleeding and their stock shows it.
bad,You could not advance in this company and if you did you lacked experience and where overwhelmed cause you were not trained or lacked experience.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
bad,This place over works their employees and under appreciates them. They make you feel replaceable. There is no security and their standards are set way too high for such ridiculous demand of products they are pushing in and out.
bad,help customer unload there basket ring them up ask them how they doin a little conversation than send them on they way repeat process wipe down register
bad,"Work days are pretty easy. I learned customer service skills."
bad,"somedays it is alright some is not."
bad,Working there was pretty hard but I got the job done. Its was a fun place to work at I loved pushing carts and bagging foods. And I works really hard pushing carts.
bad,"Good company to advance, high expectations are placed on department heads and clerks. Fast paced with many opportunities to grow and learn many different skills."
bad,"I Applied Myself To Make It A Positive Experience For Myself and Customers. Thank You To The UnderCover Police Officers. "
bad,"Kroger (Fry's) is not a great career position unless you intend to go into the salary management. The union is weak and some benefits are alright, but most are limited and the company works hard to limit them."
bad,this job was very good at first but new management came in and mess the factory up working people every day for 12 hours a day lying.
bad,I was told if  I acted a certain way I would get promoted I tried but other employees gossip. I was not asked my side. Wrote up for stating facts about union. And told if one associate said I did not speak properly to them I would be fired
bad,"Kroger is a company that gives a bonus to the managers if they keep the employee hours down, therefore you are scheduled to a minimum of 16 hours.  They understaff the departments and the management is not realistic with their expectations of how each department need to be manned, therefore customers are not attended to in a timely  manner."
bad,"I have been working for Kroger for a little over 2 years and I honestly cannot say anything good about that company, or at lest the store I worked at, except that they have really good benefits."
bad,"Kroger is a good store to shop and work at but there is just too much drama, childishness going on in that store..... too many adulterers.... in that store."
bad,"This place is awful. They are the worst employer I have ever worked for. They have no respect for their employees. The head manager of the Frankenmuth store, belittles his employees, and has even called them stupid to a customer. One of the supervisors does not follow the contract we have to sign upon employment. You will not be promoted unless you contact the union, which is a very long process. The environment is miserable, and I see employees crying daily. A lot of the customers are awful as well. This job is extremely stressful, and not worth the pay. You start at minimum wage, and get a ten cent raise every year. They have stopped hiring full time employees and it is hard to get more than 20 hours a week. Many of the employees are also nasty and rude. I also have a feeling that the supervisor gives false information to other employers about people trying to get a different job. DO NOT APPLY TO THIS AWFUL PLACE."
bad,I loved the Customers and the job. The Management well it didn't matter what you know but who you know. Very political working company. The benefits were what kept me going. Pay was good too.
bad,"Pick N' Save is not a very good place to work, they do not treat employee's fair. Many times I was not put on the schedule for weeks, they would call me up and tell me I was suppose to work when it wasn't on the schedule that the employee's viewed. I got suspended from work because I called in one day due to an unexpected death in the family. They were not very understanding about high school activities such as dances, sport practices, sport games and tournaments, even though I gave them notice in advance. Too many of the supervisors would talk poorly about other employee's including disabled ones."
bad,"Short and Sweet.  A lot of customer interaction."
bad,Wonderful coworkers that are very helpful and encouraging. The management team members are very friendly but can be rude at times. The hardest part of my job is dealing with rude customers.
bad,Was a tempuary employee for ralphs until the stike was over.
bad,The is a review of the Kroger's on lake ave. It is no different than any other retail & grocery store when it comes to the actual work. The management is not so good as it seems more like a dictatorship. With a mountain or rules and too many bosses that can't seem to agree on how to run their store you will be confused and have any spirit slowly stomped out of you.
bad,"The Kroger Company has a very poorly run pharmacy department. Management lies to meet any goal they have. There are no lunch breaks for the pharmacist, expeceted to work long hours and get a lunch if you can."
bad,Work was always unpredictable..... appreciate every employee in all departments... loved my position.... no place to grow though.. Not every employee was a team player... but it was alrye for what it wuz
bad,"The work itself is not unenjoyable but the managers and coworkers made working there awful. The higher the employee, the more they are allowed to mistreat those under them and the managers do not wish to even acknowledge the problem."
bad,My typical day at work was basically like a security guard. I learned what goes on for security wise. I loved my co-workers and got along with them great. The hardest part of the job was standing on my feet for long periods of time. The most enjoyable is meeting customers.
bad,"Management tends to pander to favorites, and if you are not one you may be like me and not get a raise for 5 years running. Ever changing policies, especially during holidays make it difficult to give the necessary customer service which is the key to keeping the company the huge amounts of money it demands from its employees."
bad,"My experience in somewhat store-specific, but highly relevant to all those hoping to find employment with Kroger. I worked with the company from entry level to a leadership position of its Pick-Up department for three consecutive years, seeing employees and managers come and go over that brief time. I unfortunately had to leave on a sour note due to the severe and ever-growing disconnect between store-level employee needs and corporate values, which I will point out has seemingly very little value in its employees. Our department suffered for nearly the entirety of my time working in Pick-Up, with my job being very demanding and time-oriented. Every second count and when we needed help or needed any assistance with shutting off incoming orders, the sheer bureaucracy of having to call no less than five corporate level associates before being able to speak with our division lead to have technical help. I should point out that a vast majority of the time, we would be unable to get a hold of the associates we were instructed to in order to receive assistance, often not answering their phones or responding to emails or texts. If by some miracles we managed to jump through all of these hoops just to put in a request for a shut off, it would have been hours past the needed time frame."
bad,Too much stress not enough pay. Upper Management doesn’t care. Employees get treated  rudely by customers and management. Not enough workers per shift unfair distribution on new hires.
bad,does not care about your personal life and your family all they care about is the bottom line you never when your working do not reamend working here.
bad,Kroger was great when I first started. As I grew in the company it became very stressful due to no organization. Very fast paced work place. You may not get a break if someone calls out. The most enjoyable part of this job were the health benefits and time paid off.
bad,"Great at first, things changed and new management was complicated. Retail is changing. And many new ways of things that made doing the positions requirements very difficult. Employee treatment changed"
bad,"Too many agendas, no professionalism, the people that make the rules have never done the job to see if the policies are even possible to follow. Not enough time in a day to get the job done."
bad,The store I worked out was awful. I hear retail is mostly bad no matter where you work but at Kroger it was like a fever dream. The management were either a complete jerk to their employees or too naive (one of them was really cool to me). The hours weren't bad but everything else was just terrible. It mentally drained me everyday I had to go to work.
bad,The work environment wasnt bad just dont do night stock its stress fully and if you have low seniority you will be doing more work then the others and yelled at of you can complete the task by yourself while the others are working together
bad,"You are able to learn a lot at Kroger, especially if you get involved with money services, but the lacking career opportunities and low compensation does not make it worth the time and effort long-term."
bad,"Flexible hours, but hard to become fulltime. They will schedule close to full time but never 40 hours for many weeks in a role. Promotions are based on favorites."
bad,"no one knew anything. daily everything changed based on who was working in the pharmacy. they sucked would not recc as a good paying job. MANAGERS KNOW NOTHING,"
bad,"Kroger does not care about the employees, they only look at numbers and money and if you aren't meeting certain outrageous goals you are talked down to like an idiot! I planned on retiring from Kroger but during the last 2 years of no raises and being treated like garbage, i think I'll find employment somewhere else that will actually appreciate the hard work my team does!!!!!"
bad,"Always busy."
bad,"It has been a horrible 2 year work experience and thanks to constant policy changes it will likely only get worse, I work in the produce section of the 820 store in Ohio and will say at times a normal day is corporate sabotage mixed with inefficiency, a solid three people are able to constantly get away with doing nothing one of which is the assistant manager the other the third man backup, our number 2 is able to talk and socialize the majority of the day extending out simple tasks and only have to do the bare minimum on the department heads day off they are able to consistently get away with only doing mark downs basic paperwork and an order as the majority of their work for the day all while making 20 plus dollars an hour in a insanely understaffed department, on top of that management let’s the get away with it in fact the culture of 820 is after you reach management level you are above having to work and should rather bully someone else into doing it for you and if something doesn’t get done you start blaming employees that had nothing to do with it, another side to the coin is the pompous attitudes of some mangers for example when a store manager takes pleasure in being a jerk and an ahole  just for the sake of their own humor that store has a problem, I wish it ended there but I could say so much hopefully someone corporate sees this because I will say as a full time employee who is regularly forced to run themself ragged so their department does not fall behind and does not get swamped the 820 Mount Vernon Ohio store is a disgrace and the majority of its management is"
bad,The Kroger on old national is one of the worst stores to work at. They are ghetto & they always argue with the customers. The bathrooms are always dirty & the customers are rude
bad,The job was great when I first started but then new management came in and the store went downhill . Only bright side were my co workers and some of the CSM's other then that the head management really shouldn't have their jobs
bad,"Terrible management, short staffed, extremely poor communication and scheduling. Conflict rarely if ever resolved, even the long term staff there were treated poorly."
bad,The work didn't match the pay rate. I learned food safety and customer service. Management ironically have poor people skills and don't look out for you. The hardest part of the job was feeling unappreciated and not receiving rewards for hard work (pay raises). The most enjoyable part of the job..honestly..I got nothin'.
bad,It was a ok job but as far trying to move up the ladder it was a rough time trying to learn ever postion when a manager is trying to keep up at a low postion
bad,Very stressful working overnight no breaks and severely understaffed. There is also very poor working conditions. Don’t want overtime but they are understaffed
bad,Kroger 450 is a bad store they barely have any cashier in the supervisor are so disrespectful so is the mangers that work there.  my experience there has been rough on so many levels they barely gave me any hours .
bad,they will screw you if you arnt careful and themanagers are lazy. yes they are union but the union doesnt help when you need them. insurance is really good
bad,"Working at Kroger was very stressful, and the managers were never available to help when needed. All in all, it was a terrible place to work, and I would never want to work there again."
bad,"Terrible management, never told good employees that they were doing a good job, didn't get rid of bad employees, seemed to only criticize good employees, rules not very clear. Management cares more about customer satisfaction than safety of employees or customers. Always felt like they were trying to get away with everything they could, and be as unfair to employees as possible. Overall a miserable place to work."
bad,"I was hired in when I was 8 months pregnant. they were made aware of this before I was hired. When I went on maternity leave, they terminated my position and told me to reapply after my leave was up."
bad,"Upper management doesn't know how to do their jobs. If you have more than 5 years experience, you will be treated badly. The upper management team has no integrity, morals, or management skills, whatsoever."
bad,Unhelpful co-workers in the deli.  I quit after five weeks ...not worth the negativity... part or full-time. Manager not aware of new employee  proper training or how to access online schedules.  I took the job because I liked the part time hours. I was training deli workers on my previous job. They need more helpful trainers. Promised a three week advanced schedule  and did not know on a Wednesday if I had to work the following Sunday until that Friday!!!  Alot of other departments seemed happier though. Maybe workers are just tired because department understaffed. I understand.
bad,"helping customer"
bad,Awesome healthcare. Paid vacations. Awesome diversity. Kroger discounts. Amazing customer service staff. Facility staff always on top of fixing equipment
bad,management tends to show favoritism and listens to a lot of he said she said instead of watching and finding out the truth. this is at Kroger store #338
bad,"Management was bad, i got harassed out of a store by the general store manager. made work toxic for everyone. I worked with friendly people for the most part, but due to management issues the work always felt very tense."
bad,They provide little to no room to advance. They are managed very poorly and pays too little for the work provided. Average work days are incredibly busy and the management treated the workers horrible. There were little to no benefits for the work provided. I really enjoyed my time with my coworkers and had a great time despite all the negatives.
bad,Treat you like a dog and don't care about helping you improve yourself whatsoever. Management at the store level is complete garbage and wish i would have left sooner and not wasted my time there.
bad,The best part about working at Pick n Save was the fact that I was able to grow with the company during my time there. I also got to work with some really good people.
bad,Yes I worked at the Krogers in Noblesville Indiana and I was fired and I told them I would go ahead and quit. First those managers lie I had 1 actual day of chasier training having a week or so would be better if they eould have had someone there that was on there off day they could have trained me properly. I was fired over loyalty checks no such thing there and I looked online its loyalty cards and I was scanning those plus your employees dobt have the right attitude to work there getting nasty with me is not teamwork to me I know at least 3 that needs either wrote up or fired. New hires get treated bad plus teens dont need to tell other people how to do there job. I never have worked in a grocery store before I worked at Walmart they did not do all the things you do there back in 1999 yeah thats along time not ever runnning another cash register and even I had problems with people who hadore seniority than me who had worked there longer than me. But if I was to recommend your store to someone who needed a job No I would not for employment and Yes I did make a complaint with the Corporate office had a right to not only did you lose an employee who was trying but you lost an actual customer who has been a customer of Krogers for over 30 years thats me. Plus people getting mad at me is ridiculous see you hired a person who has a disability EOE wouldnt like to hear about this. I did see someone got by with over $21 dollars worth of food and didnt work plus a young girl who also works there I was told she cant learn her job and is still working there. But you up and fire intially
bad,The worst place I worked at so far. The workplace environment is ok. Sometimes fun. Everyone does whatever they want and only certain people get in trouble. The hardest part of the job is being treated as a lesser. Whenever i would call off(for real reasons of course) my supervisors would treat it as though i'm the bad guy for not being able to make it. I shouldn't feel bad about something happening that is out of my control. The only enjoyable part about it is the customers and a few co-workers who are easy to get along with
bad,"Typical work day for me is stressful because of management not caring for us or our customers. Because of the area, some customers are rude but managable. Co-workers were nice but there was always some kind of drama with someone. Rumors were spread quickly about anyone and everyone."
bad,Not helpful in teaching needed pharmacy skills.  I was given the wrong book to study for a test. Coworkers had their own clique and were not friendly with new people. Trying to learn the computer system basically on my own was the hardest part of the job. I was told before I was hired I would have on the job training which did not happen. Customers and a few coworkers made the job enjoyable.
bad,Lack of hours and pay could be way much better. Its a great part time job though.
bad,"bad manigment and hours, dangeraous work place and normal day at work is being rushed on every assiment given to you. What i learned was time manigment so that you would'nt be written up. Coworkers and benefits where the only reasons I stayed as long asIi did. The manigment treats you as a number and dose'nt care about your family or personal problems outside of work they are one mineded to production. They also have no problem firing people no matter how they've help the company."
bad,this company is a bad company to work for.  Warehouse is probably closing down.
bad,"I quit my job of several years where I had the most seinority out of anyone there to move to this job to be a customer service agent in their call center. I left for the pay. My bank account is a lot happier but I am not! This place is terrible. If you just get hired on you will work a 10:45am-7:15pm shift for a long time...It gets very old. There are older people that have been with the company for 20+ years that have all of the early shifts. And it is pretty much near impossible for your shift time to bump up unless someone retires or quits. Management is terrible and they do not care about you. Trying to get a day off is ridiculous unless you call in. They promote people that have been there for less than a year due to favoritism, they completely overlooked all of the people who have been there for years, causing the morale of the whole workplace to go down. Everyone is bitter! Everyone is nosey. You will feel people breathing down your neck or creeping around your cubical to ""make sure you are working"". Other agents will tell on you for the smallest mistakes, or checking your cell phone just in hopes of pushing you down the ladder so they can move up. Managers and leads are hypocritical, they will say don't do one thing but then they all do it. Such as leave early, eat at their desks,  etc .A typical day consists of me basically scrambling around like a chicken with its head cut off trying to find 10 claims to process during the day in my downtime. But beware! If you do not pull claims according to protocol you will get in trouble! It is ridiculous. Some claims may take"
bad,"They cater to the younger sector, and consider their school schedules."
bad,"very fast paced day dealing with many issues especially insurance and a lot of counselling on diet ,diabetes and anything related to questions not answered at doctors offices.giving flu and pneumonia shots.learned to be very patient especially dealing with very sick and needy people.learned to very empathic.keeping the teem of workers very motivated since we are always busy and moving real fast"
bad,The company is no longer family and employee focused.  The goal of Kroger is to do more with less.  More work with less employees.  More work for less money.
bad,they were rude and unfair . i wanted time off when my aunt passed away and they were very rude and unthoughtful about it . they were rude to me and my mother .
bad,The company started off good but its a lot changing with Kroger in itself. I don’t think I would go back but my job I loved and it’s a passion. I felt like management is good at all the communication amongst  mangers is off and they pick and choose who they want to promote it’s never based on others works ethics all the time.
bad,"Stay away, treat long term employees like trash. Dont value them, lots of turn over. Pay is ok to start, but for the long term they dont pay market value. Dump more and more work and expect you to get everything done. "
bad,My experince with frys has it ups and downs. Been to diffeent stores. Some store mangers are awesome and are bad. Some attend to play favorites. They dont favor you watch out. They will make feel like your walking on eggs shells will terminated you. The empolyees are awesome. I feel i choose the wrong feild. Every seven years or less they will tend to let go.
bad,Not enough people ever hired. Have to work multiple positions every day for terrible pay. All around stressful. Not allowed to have any overtime but expected to get multiple peoples jobs done.
bad,This job has worked with me through various times and for many years. They really works with me. In time of need they give me time off. We i need hours they give them most likely. It depends.
bad,"Gone in a bad direction.  Corporate has lost touch. Why bother listing reasons.  They didn't care when I was employed there.  Toxic work environment...There is a constant influx of new management that come in and beats up on employees that know how to do their jobs.  That is considered the new managers training period.  Kroger keeps this toxic environment going due to minimum wage to new hires and apparently low pay management.  They are pulling from the bottom of the job pool and that just makes experienced employees have to work harder.  They are pulling from a poor management pool as well causing even more stress to the people who are physical having to get the job done.  Management is a talking head that adopts the ""here's how we are going to run things this go around"" and they don't even believe what they are being made to say.  Corporate is always changing its ways of doing things.  Many times that happens before we even had a chance to get used to the ""last way of doing things.""  I've never seen a company spend so much money destroying itself.  The grocery store WAS a required place for consumers to go on a regularly basis.  With PICKUP service and more self service lanes it has now destroyed its customer base and not built it.  This company seems to have been influence by the industry to jump into the lead to evolve itself right out of business.  The employees aren't computers.  The company wants to do its business from an armchair. That required us front-liners to have to give them more computer input.   It is a physically demanding job.  They wanted more and more computer"
bad,I was excited to work there and it looked smooth for the first two weeks but the new management was poor and decided to fire me even though I had little to no training.
bad,"Money management, customer service, bill pay, answering phone calls. Taking care of customer complaints. Opening the store, bookkeeping and making sure the store machines are running properly."
bad,"I worked at the Kroger on Wabash. The slick management will find a way to screw you over, not a matter of if, but when.  the workers had to unionize for a reason. I was hired on the spot, never late, typically did more then I was asked to... I did a lot because I'm just a really good hard worker. "
bad,"A Typical day I was sorry about pulling out dates scan everything out and start prepping what I need to bake for the evening, do my orders for day, I love creating things"
bad,"Poor management, very understaffed, disorganized, no one works as a team, store needs a complete overhaul.... you don't have a good experience at this store. Who is wrongfully let go. Just because I caught pink eye from the store it was under doctor's care and unable to work for 6 days they let me go even with doctors notes. So don't get sick or they will let you go"
bad,"When I worked at Kroger, it was in high school. I was getting paid minimum wage and enough hours to pay very little bills. Kroger over works and there isn’t any real benefits for part time workers"
bad,"Relationships between managers department heads and employees are tenuous at best! Department heads are allowed to play with your hours depending on how they like you or not management will not step in and help, and only placate hourly employees to get them to do what they want"
bad,"overworked, not enough hours for the amount of work and tasks keep being added with more hours being taken away. very stressful. never enough help and if someone calls off theres no one to call in due to lack of hours."
bad,"When I first got hired they told me that it was part time. And he was right. 11hrs/wk. How do you live off of that? The job was easy and not too stressful. Low wages, like they thought that giving a starting wage of $8.25 was good."
bad,"You see all the signs in the store to start a career here at Kroger. Once you get in and hopefully accepted, you get into your department. Your department for here the produce is not very hard, it is mainly stocking inventory, keeping everything fresh and making sure your sales floor is presentable. Their pay is great for start. Howver, over my stay here, everyone in every department has got their hours cut drastically, making everyones work schedule random and sometimes too random and lean. For exanple, this week i have no shifts and some weeks i can get 5 shifts or only 1 shift. You used to be able to beg your manager for extra shifts, however the store manager is budgeting tight the hours now. so you could beg your department manager for extra hours, but they have to ask the store manager first and then mostly it is a no. Also, my department managers never answer texts, unless i spam call their phone and show up to kroger when it is not my time yet to make sure they answer. This shows you kroger is not the best place for best hours and pay. they offer lots of benefits like discounts, tuition reimbursement a lot of benefits. However, their scheduling hours are too random and lean like said. It is also because of the union rules that gives older workers higher priority than new ones. I would only come to kroger if you want extra cash while you have a FT other well paid job already or if you want to be guranteed a FT job at kroger for sure. Too random honestly and too much back forth talk. You could fight to go from pt to ft, but that is already too much time and energy to fight."
bad,I do not like this job because it’s always out of control. I want to get a job that is always organized and has a high rating from employees and has benefits to me as an employee
bad,I left in good standing with Kroger however my time there wasn't the best as they didn't have room for growth and will over work you for little  pay and they don't work with your life schedule
bad,"I was a bagger and cart person. Working at kroger isn't that bad, but at my location our manager favored the boys. He didn't make them really do anything while he breathed down the girls neck. It was annoying. It's probably not like that everywhere though."
bad,"Co managers are brand new and know absolutely nothing. They have hiring events to get more people then just cut everyone's hours."
bad,"I do not have high regards for the Kroger Company. An employee who goes above and beyond ends up working his or her job as well as others. Not to mention, the corporate sector cares more about making its stockholders happy than its store-level employees. I would not recommend working for this company, because you will feel like less of a person."
bad,Kroger is a good store but it pays very low and I can’t even save up enough money for a car at this rate I need a better paying job and better benefits to help me finish off school
bad,it was a cool typical day at work. I learned the different amounts to keep In the till. I learned time management. it was a awesome work place culture. the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to engage with customers.
bad,"Worked there when I was 17 and hardly had hours. Managers were irresponsible, I would come back from break and expect to be placed somewhere and they barely helped me I usually stood near them for about 10 minutes and then be placed somewhere I wasn't qualified. Before they had a big move over to a new store I remember my last shift at the store was at the flower place. I was trained to cash people out. not to blow up balloons and to arrange flowers. Worst place to work when you are just getting used to working and don't know how to stand your ground. I might work for them again if I really needed the money."
bad,I was happy at Kroger as I am retired and just wanted to do something.   No one got raises.  And departments were critically understaffed. Managers were indifferent and caustic.
bad,"Hold on wait i no your not thinking of working for a store thats just a worse as Walmart, Most workers act like high schoolers, everybody looks mad, co-works starting drama. Theres 3 managers but no one listens to them anyway. Overworked they dont pay you overtime unless you reach over 40hr. beware of rats on shelves. 10790 MacArthur Blvd, Oakland"
bad,"While I was working in my field, It was the best experience I had. However, I had to leave due to me being only temporary. I would like to have another spot at this store, but this time, full time, so I can have the opportunity to be full time."
bad,They do not care about their employees. It all about the customers being right there not always right. They make the cashier's the villain in everything
bad,"Hourly salary isn't very competitive. Always opportunity to gain more hours with NO over time pay, time in half. Not a lot of opportunity to cross train in other departments. Very low annually  raises."
bad,I have been working at Kroger the little clinic since 2012.  They have a good benefit packet. We see acute care patients. We are DOT certified.  We do sports physical and vaccinations.
bad,"It's terrible , don't apply. I don't see any good with being apart of such a messed up workplace. They should get real employees, instead of fake never doing any work type of people."
bad,"for a first time job it wasnt bad to start with"
bad,"Its all about the number of satisfied customers at the cashier level and not at all about product management such as weather the product is on the shelves or weather it is in stock for the customers. It is a safety hazard to work at Kroger, management has little care for associate safety"
bad,"This job IS NOT FOR ADULTS trying to get established after high school. Instead this job is for high school students. Making 7.35 an hour, I thought life was a joke. The amount of work you do in the deli is ridiculous. And to be making only that amount of money is ridiculous as well. Coworkers were very bossy and lazy. Management was ok. The only thing I can actually say I learned was how to tolerate any BS thrown my way."
bad,didnt really care for the company just really negative environment most of my Co-workers were pretty decent people and honestly i really didnt learn anything from that job
bad,I enjoyed working for Kroger if only temporary. I really like the fact that its only 10 minutes from my house. The staff was great it just wasn't a perfect fit
bad,"Addressed customer inquiries and concerns as needed.  Kept accurate inventory and ordered new product as necessary.  Established and implemented policies and goals for department."
bad,"I have work experience for ralph`s market in victorvile as a coradboard ripper and meat wraaper, but my job duties are collect cardboard boxes, milk crates, meat trades, plastic wrap, pallets, damage perishables, load/ unloading storage of returns, help stock diary box, and stock 7/20 pound of ice if needed as soon as possible."
bad,"Good money, crazy hours, no life. Great benefits and employees are cool. Supervisors should be fired. They are rude but it's a job. Good money, good benefit, hours suck, no life."
bad,"This job has to have been the worst contributing factor for my mental health in the last 3 years. The work is exhausting, the pay is minimal(3 years in and still only making 8.25/hr), upper management does not care about issues unless they start affecting the customers, and if they see you as reliable they will work you even harder rather than bother with cracking down on coworkers who actually are slacking off."
bad,"My supervisor was disrespectful and didn’t value me. I got okay pay, but not enough to deal with the drama. The customers were nice, but I wouldn’t want to got back."
bad,the staff at kroger’s was really rude and they took their jobs overly serious. they were rude to the customers and they were rude to the employees. i didn’t like the environment there at all
bad,refuse to work woth needed schedule. managers tend to talk about employees behind their backs and mock new employees instead of helping them. theu whisper to each other like high school kids.
bad,"I love every aspect about my job. I love the work, the people I work with and am over. But the one thing that absolutely ruins everything is corporate coming in for store visits. I know they have a job to do ensuring the stores are up to par, but when all they can say is negative things and offer no help to solve problems, nothing constructive, my people become extremely discouraged. I become discouraged. My people are much more productive when they are in a good mood and don't have some corporate higher up breathing down their neck, scrutinizing every little detail of their work, offering no constructive criticism. Corporate is supposed to help fix problems and provide encouragement to their employees, like how I am expected to treat my people. With kindness and respect. Correct problems when need be, and provide encouragement to do the right thing. Not just criticize their work with no help or correction to fix it."
bad,Managers constantly forgot I was a minor. I was given unworkable hours (during school hours) because many of the managers thought I looked older than what I was. Just a huge lack of communication.
bad,"For the low pay of $8/hr you have to put up with management babying you, treating you like trash, confusing you, and not giving you opportunity. They expect wayyyyy too much work to be done for $8 and when you work hard and try to get a promotion they shut you down. if you need to get a job to get by, as long as you have an attitude of not caring, than this is a great job to have but I would consider trying to go somewhere where they'll treat you like a decent human being and give you an opportunity to advance if you wish for it."
bad,"Not a place to work for mothers with young children. There is not work life balance. If you are part-time the pay sucks, if you are full time the pay is decent, the health benefits are great."
bad,"This is by far the worst company I have ever worked for. The managers do not introduce themselves and expect you to know who they are. They are always severely understaffed. Employees constantly call out and no one cares. They breach the union contract so read it carefully, IF they even give it to you. You’re supposed to get it within a week of starting employment but I met wit the union rep two months in and received the union manual SIX MONTHS later! Management lies about everything or they just do not know anything. There is no such thing as orientation or training, just thrown to the wolves. There is supposed to be computer training and as boring as it is, they make you take the assessment portion and not actually train. The veteran employees are the worst, not very helpful or friendly. Take the advice and stay away! You have been warned!"
bad,"The workplace is stressful because of the different variety of customers you have to deal with, every day someone is complaining about something or someone. It's like you're always being put in a situation you can't win."
bad,before i left they were changing everything to new set ways and they had a lot of hires before they brought in new management so it was hard to get used to
bad,"Easily the worst job I've had in my life, the management team chooses favorites and immediate supervisors fail to effectively do jobs and compensate employees needs, I would not recommend this job to anyone. There is not enough pay to levee the stress attributed to working here and the non-understanding management team."
bad,It wasn’t to bad to work but managers expected the impossible out of you. Everything was always in a state of crises and we alway had problems. The ceo would visit our store often and all the managers would scramble to fix what was wrong in their departments all at once when it could have just been simply maintained with daily tasks.
bad,My personal experience was neither overall good nor bad. My coworkers were great and the overall atmosphere was welcoming. The problem came in with rude management. I was put off schedule after asking to come in late to attend a college orientation. I thought Kroger was supposed to be supportive of youth and education.
bad,"I have learned to work with the job I have and be glad that I do have a job, but there are more opportunities and careers out there in the world to work."
bad,"I joyed working there for the short period of time. Honestly, a lot of things could have been better. I do thank them for the learning experience and training."
bad,This was my first real job. I felt like they could have done a lot more for their workers. They cut people's hours and made their workers do twice the work. They never wanted to hire people full time so they would not have to give them benefits.
bad,News flash. If key retailing was developed because other divisions do more business on less hours. We pay $7.25 an hour in Ga while everyone else pays $9 plus an hour. These people don't care if they loose their job..they can go EVERYWHERE and make more..so to get the same quality of people as they do in other divisions pay them enough to make it matter if they loose their job. . You will have more dedicated employees
bad,Kroger was the worst work experience that I have ever had. I did not receive the proper training that I needed. I would work 8+ hours without a break.
bad,"Enjoyed hearing the customers  stories and about their families, great Co workers to work with, great benefits plans and pay"
bad,"enjoyed my peers, I learn excellent customer service skills, management was very poorly, the hardest part about my job there was dealing with management."
bad,"A typical day at work was one I had to not for get to press the print papers out for the gas trucks so you can do the report on them, but I've learned how to pay attention to everything more harder now, the management rarely poor because they swiftly showed you, my co-workers was great, the hardest part was when you had to close sometimes alone, But the most enjoyable part was working with a different types customers making them happy and smiling."
bad,Can be a fun place to work with the right management team. Carmel was a high pressure location as they weremaking a unique store. They were offering products and services that aren't avilable elsewhere.
bad,"My over all review I learned a lot of things while I worked at the gas station. I learned how to run the register because that was my first time on a register at a gas station, so I really enjoyed working there and learning different things. I also had some great co workers, they really were nice and so was the managers."
bad,You can move up if you do a very good job . What I like about my job is I could meet new people.
bad,"A typical day bagging groceries, i learned to multitask. the most enjoyable part were the slow days."
bad,It was a nice place to work. Enjoyed working as a cashier. coworks were nice.
bad,"It was very unorganized cant even go to the bathroom. Management was very rude and I did not feel like I was treated fairly.For some it is a great job, for others I just do not feel like it was a good place to work."
bad,"It feels like a great job at first, but the produce department is a very male dominate department of the store and many of them are rude and dont like to be asked questions, but how is someone suppose to learn without asking questions."
bad,The Kingston Kroger in TN isn’t so good with the employees there. I wouldn’t recommend working there. You’re working harder than you should while being paid minimum wage. The managers weren’t so nice.
bad,The job itself was easy the schedule want I got hired in part time which I wanted. then straight to fill time then I needed a day off it was an issue. I didn't ask for full time. There supervisor was understanding and pleasent that's it. So I quit.
bad,"Management sucked, very rude & disrespectful. Never was a time the managers were nice they also treated customers poorly , while expecting the best from us ."
bad,krogers sucks  they don't pay good they don't focus on employees they don't spend money to fix things that need to be fixed they spend money on stupid stuff.
bad,Great company  very professional great environment great food great pay great training great communication great scheduling great supervisor great holiday bonus
bad,"Zero training, they only care about numbers and do not care how you get them. Managers swapped out non stop and they can’t even have trucks delivered on time. Store is constantly out of things and employees get screamed at. They are union but the union in oak ridge Tennessee is shady and totally screwed all their employees with a new “contract” which basically gives a one time raise to $11 and makes benefits impossible to maintain"
bad,This place is not a good working environment. The management will not work with you at all. The management does not care about your well being. All they care about is you moving as fast as you can
bad,The management were bullies and played favorites. I was fussed at for needing a bathroom break for medical reasons. There was no real training but in was expected to know how to do my job anyway.
bad,I love my bakery department. I love my bakery manager and co workers. But the store manager and co managers are a joke. They don’t care about their employees and only care about their money. They treat everyone like garbage. Especially in the meat department.
bad,kroger is a grocery store where you get groceries and people work there to have extra spending money. mostly children work there. you get a 5% discount.
bad,Managers worst ever my experience here was horrible bad pay and never worked full hours. Was let go due to not having a 100 percent work rate but a 93
bad,"There are some managers there that are decent but most are not fair, bias, and unless your really close with them good luck getting promoted because they don't care about seniority or anything like that."
bad,Supervisor violated me.  He was disrespectful to women and he disrespected his employees as a whole.  He didn't know his job and didn't know how to train his employees.
bad,I didn’t like working there at all the pay was good but a lot of people got hurt on the job because of production. It isn’t a safe place to work at all
bad,This company is horrible to work for. Poor management skills. Lack of consideration for others. No concern for others well being. Not a good company to work for
bad,Doing the first year in a half it was a good job but as we got new people they started to change and they started to treat us like slaves. They rate pay went us to 9.50 but they still wanted you to do things that you was not hired to do.
bad,Not enough hours; associates typically skip breaks and lunches in order to  meet unrealistic expectations of management; disciplinary actions are handled unprofessionally by management; hostile working environments.
bad,"This is a very fast paced place to work, very short staffed. Too many job duties are put onto one employee alone. The amount of work to be done makes it difficult to even take breaks. A lot of corners are cut in order to get things done. Management does not hold policies in effect when employees call in or do not show up or simply are not doing there job. There is no repercussions for unacceptable behavior. No proper leadership."
bad,Many of the coworkers were nice and good people as were some of the higher leveled managers. I would be given times I was physically incapable of being there and my notifications several months in advance were ignored and was told to call in that day sick. They canned me after too many sick days without a doctor's note. Notified 5 minutes after giving them the doctors note.
bad,Bad managment can really bring down a store. Dont work at store 698 unless your really looking to brown nose. Employees have been sexually assaulted here and nothing has been done to the person.
bad,Too much time spent in mandatory meetings.  Expected to work 10 hour days regardless of work load.  Very poor management.  Hands tied by poorly written union contracts.
bad,"HR allows racist senior managers to discriminately hire, promote, and relocate at their whims. Retaliatory culture. If you're hourly, unions will protect you, even if incompetent.  Unions will coach employees through interviews. Salaried employees are abused because they can get away with it. Reporting does nothing, they will hunt you down and drive you out.  HR allows hiring of friends and family. Backstabbing culture in this market anyway. Other markets may be better."
bad,"Do not work at the katy store on spring green blvd, Especially clicklist,manager thinks she is all that. Micro managed,talks down to you. Will not let you get 40 hours,will hire  more workers, just so you dont."
bad,"The pay is good, but believe me slavery lives on. Those that work, get more work. Those that don't want to work don't have to. Kissing butt allows a lot of lazy people the opportunity to get away with murder."
bad,Very poor management. No communication. They lie on a regular basis. They treat their good employees poorly. disrespectful. Favoritism. Dicrismanation.
bad,"A typical day was very busy running around and serving customers. I learned that people can be difficult to work with and customers can be rather unfriendly but it's rewarding to see people leave with a smile on their faces. The management was awful because they would chastise me for very nit-picky details that no other person would possibly perceive of doing. The workplace culture was more of a ""Game of Thrones"" feeling where everyone wanted everyone else fired or they had a problem that they would complain about. I found the workplace very undesirable but I needed to money, so I stayed as long as I did. The hardest part of my job was being able to close the department one night and then opening the next day. Some customers were difficult but retail has many things that are difficult that most people would have to power through. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing the regular customers that I used to have good conversations with."
bad,"Mgmt has their favorites. If you aren't one of them they will run you like an animal."
bad,"Well to start, If you like your weekends off GOOD LUCK, if you like yours days off split an rotated an in consisted,then this job you!! if you like being treated like a step child  DRIVER because your New then this job is for you!!! An if you don't have a problem buying the dispatchers COFFEE an DONUTS OR RIB EYE STEAK or PASTRAMI SANDWICHES to get favorable RUNS the this job is for you!! to be honest if you have young kids an like having family time,then stay away... though this was the TEAMSTERS promise LAND job turned out to be a NIGHTMARE!!! They BREED a really bad culture here about treating NEW DRIVERS like dirt, From CERTAIN MANAGEMENT, TO DISPATCHERS an SPECIALLY THE VETERAN DRIVERS, SOME VETERAN DRIVERS are Decent but a handful treat you like a DISEASE which is probably the MOST DIFFICULT thing i encounter here,but then the DISPATCHERS (CERTAIN ONES) NO NAMES, are USING NAMES like "" VOLUNTEERS"" when referring to PART-TIME Drivers. There's no respect to NEW PART TIME WORKERS!!"
bad,"No room for advancement because higher level employees sit on their jobs to accrue benefits. Manager jobs too stressful for the level of pay so people don't want to advance."
bad,"I had no idea what I was getting into, when I wanted to do bakery. Very poorly managed. One employee was the supervisor of both deli and bakery, yet never actually helped with bakery, very snarky. hardly any young people working, except the Dairy section, which I loved; however it was only temporary, due to an unreasonable probation I was given. I requested to just switch to Dairy instead, since the high schoolers needed help. Got denied, so I got out, due to understaffed weightload crushing me, literally. Don't do part-time for grocery brands like Kroger. Their system is outdated"
bad,"Kroger has a lot to offer but no one knows what it is. We have to dig to find what our benefits are and to understand them. They have a poor training regimine of just dumping a person in a position and it is pretty much ""sink or swim"" Such a sad way to do kids that are experiencing their first job. It makes for a very hostile work environment also when people don't know what to do in a customer service environment."
bad,"The worst job "
bad,"I worked as a Courtesy Clerk aka a bagger, and the management was always looking over your shoulder. If you got too far from the register they would say something, and other things. It was a very micro-managed job which I did not like at all."
bad,Depending on the department and the management will depend on how easy or hard your job will be. I had terrible management and no help so it was stressful everyday. i had no life you get called all the time when you are off. just a waste
bad,You will find most people quit quickly because you are asked to do about 7 jobs worth of work as a courtesy clerk causing you to have even more to do. Don't hold out for any chance to advance to a specific place only the deli is worse.
bad,Honestly it's a great place to work if you have the right people. I was treated very poorly by a few people but those who I didn't made the environment great and fun.
bad,in the beginning of my time at pick n save we had a nice manager that would listen to the troubles that coworkers had about other coworkers. but the new manager supports the workers that bully their coworkers and don't fire the mean coworkers.
bad,"This job was my first, and they did not live up to their promises. One day, I called in sick by the time they required (2 hours before shift). The phone was not connected and the manager (who was terrible) did not take that for a valid excuse and threatened to fire me. This terrible management isn't deserved and this place should be of shame."
bad,"Poor working conditions, no raises, union store. I worked here more than 20 years ago. Because of these conditions, I left for better employment opportunities."
bad,The work was great was stressful at times  how ever most jobs can be  love what I did great company  to work for they were there to help you when need
bad,"I'd like to preface this with the fact that I'm 16 and therefore protected under child labor laws. However, they did not obey those. I would often have to work 10hr shifts anole without any breaks. Luckily my mom was happy to bring me some food to snack on during my shift. I will never forget the time a customer saw me sitting on the pallets and crying while eating cold french fries."
bad,4 weeks before Christmas I was called into meeting and told my position was being eliminated. I was offered a severance package. Then I was forced to sign documents stating that I voluntarily quit my position in order to receive severance.
bad,"Kroger Pharmacy is one of the lowest paying pharmacy a technician can work at. If it weren't for my manager (which has nothing to do with pay, scheduling, anything) I would of left a long time ago. Corporate doesnt even give us enough hours to have enough bodies in the pharmacy to run, even though we have enough people who could work and expect you to have times in each queue of 20 seconds per order..."
bad,"I was a transfer from 550 in Bellevue making $13.80/hr.  I needed to transfer to Clarksville for easier access to APSU and less travel time.  I had to go to part-time, but I said I could work about 30 hours/week. "
bad,worked there for two years no promotion no pay raise regardless knowing how to cashier and other things needed to be done in the store and management was very poor too
bad,"This was my very first real job. That being said, I was in the middle of high school and simply needed the money. The people were considerate but either they were very lax or very strict. There was not much of a middle ground. That didn't help with the training."
bad,Hardest working most underpaid people you will ever meet. The incentive is an absolute joke. You will not receive it. The people are amazing. Company as a whole. Not worth working for. Save yourself and go elsewhere.
bad,To start Kroger's starting wage for all entry positions is 8.00 per hour. They expected us to minimize shrink (wasted / donated product) but at the same time expected us to maximize product that was on the tables to keep displays looking good. Lacked the necessary amount of equipment used by all departments.
bad,"Co workers make this company and all the hard work it entails worth it. I felt satisfied getting the job done and providing the best experience possible for the customers who frequented the store."
bad,"Had some good team players but, had few upper level management problems with new corporate procedures that were not helpful and made the job more difficult.  Main managers are great to work with."
bad,I didn't like this job. Only thing I liked were my co workers. they were the best co workers I ever worked with and would love to work with all of them again.
bad,"Kroger as a company overall is amazing, I love the store and it's customer service policies however my experience there was not so amazing. Inconsistent scheduling, constant schedule mistakes."
bad,"Managers were terrible mostly, have so many hoops to jump through to be promoted, no real incentive to keep you there for future advancement. Wouldn't recommend it to others."
bad,Management treats you like animals. Worked 3 years for the company and was training people with less experience that made more money than I did. Was written up on numerous occasions because I didn’t keep in line when management was breaking rules. Not able to speak your mind without backlash even if you do it respectfully.
bad,"The store wallows in nepotism. I worked there for nearly two years, and was promised a promotion and a raise by 3 store managers. Instead, my hours were slashed, and my pay stayed the same."
bad,Kroger was not always terrible. It started off really fun but slowly went down hill. Pay should definitely be raised there. And managermennt should be looked at.
bad,Company was not organized and was not treated well when became very I'll I had doctor's notes and excuses for all the time I missed I was honestly very sick .
bad,"I did not like working at Kroger because the associate were rude, didn’t get enough hours, was worked too hard for the money I was getting paid, and didn’t have long enough breaks."
bad,"Not for good working conditions.  Management & leadership was not there.  Dangerous environment, people hurt daily.  High turn over and employees watching offensive material on their cell phones during work hours."
bad,"Very low starting pay compared to all other retail grocery stores and you are treated poorly  unless you have been there 10000 years and Kiss ther behinds "
bad,I had several years in the Meat departments of the other store I worked at and the rate of pay at Kroger was terrible. Only 8.20 per hour which was not satisfactory.
bad,"There is good and bad there. I can be busy there being a cashier or there was times of not being busy at all. The hardest part is when things by customers should not be said but were and have to ignore it. What I learned was take everything with a grain of salt,The most enjoyable part was getting to know and talk to different people"
bad,"horrible, just horrible, unprofessional, unethical, discriminatory, i would never, ever work there again, I wish i had not worked there for the four years that I did."
bad,They expect so much and give so little. We were lied to about how hard and how many hours we would be worked and they were only giving us minimum wage.
bad,The manager are all fake the will us u til they until they don't need u anymore then will cut ur hours down to 15 hours a week where ur not even making $100 a week they pass great employees up for promotion based on their process for promotion because of family members or family friends getting the job due to favoritism they over work the good workers and promote the lazy ones it sad u can go there a s work ur soul out and before it is all said and done e u will be a bagger with no benefits and working 10 hours a week spread between 5 days
bad,"I was hired (as a temp) for administrative assistant work.  My work is nothing I have ever experienced as an administrative assistant.  With that said, I have learned and gained a lot of experience."
bad,"Ridiculously poor management which brings down the quality of everything else in the store. Constantly messing with hours and not scheduling people for the right places or times. Assigning employees to do work not in their description (backstock workers being made to condition the dairy department, etc)"
bad,"Well, That's a stretch.  However, My manager's manager kept having me pick up the slack of other departments that I hadn't been trained for.  Pay was minimal."
bad,"Very low wages even with experience, no discounts or free food on breaks. Labor laws are not taken seriously, Get left alone to do all the work when you co-workers just stand around, no management"
bad,"Job had awful pay for amount of work required in the meat department, especially since you had to be at least 18 years old to work there and are expected to live on right above minimum wage. My co-workers and I were kept late many times because management would threaten to fire us if we left before certain tasks were completed(tasks that were given to us 10 minutes before our shifts ended)."
bad,"Too much discrimination and favoritism. Seniority trumped everything. Difficult to move up and difficult for any cooperation on basic human needs. Always had to work overtime to keep up with demands, as they could not keep enough employees to manage needs met properly. Was disciplined for obtaining any overtime. Poor management on every level of department head. Average  level employees were however, generally of upstanding quality. Did a good job hiring people with good motivation and positive attitudes."
bad,"A typical day at work is good, I learned that this is good place to work especially when there are many of good people to meet. The hardest thing about this job is the salary. The most enjoyable part of this job is the sales."
bad,"At Kroger you will receive little to no training, and then be thrown onto a busy register on the weekend. Management is nowhere to be found when you have a problem , meaning that you have to just figure things out on your own. Overall, it was too stressful with not enough pay to make it worth it."
bad,"very difficult place to work long term, stressful and being treated just like a robot in a ""family"" environment is unfair, decent benefits but not until after working there for way too long"
bad,Interacting with the customers working on the cash registers and cutting deli meat and cheeses for the customers. I learned how to make sandwiches and wraps. Some of the managers are nice. It would be a nice to work if they would pay a little more money. The hardest part is that you would have to be nice to the customers even they are mean to you. You get to chance to meet new people and co-workers
bad,I was not pleased with the overall management of this company. From the sales associates to our sales lead were okay people and actually cared about you. I can not say the same for upper mangement.
bad,Kroger treated the younger workers not good and paid them at minimum wage even if they were promoted. The hardest part of the job was always having to listen to the customer complain because they were never satisfied with Kroger and their policies.
bad,"Kroger lacks appreciation for hard working individuals, giving promotions and raises to under achievers. Kroger does not give adequate training and resources to perform the job to their expectation level."
bad,i loved my customers and coworkers management is horrible and is always making you feel horrible they never appreciate your work and dont believe in anyone being sick.
bad,The management was very unprofessional. The spoke to one another very disrespectfully. They were very understanding of my schedule due to my son. I really enjoyed the quiet work space.
bad,"union dues, all for nothing. I am part time,40 hours one week,12 ,the next. You can't rely on this job , to pay your bills,but, you can scrape up some gas money. No benefits,no fulltime hours,. you pay into a union,that gives you nothing ! If you're some young punk, looking for party money,......perfect !"
bad,"I felt limited. I come from a talent based and creative work place. The pay was low, much to low for an adult person to survive on in California. Probably wouldn't recommend this company."
bad,The only way to make a living is to become upper management otherwise this is more of a place to work if you're still in school.
bad,"Horrible pay for a shift that was overnight. The same shift elsewhere was paying more than 10 more dollars per hour for easier work. I was paid 8.35 per hour before taxes. Union dues were also taken out of the paycheck, and for a 40 hour work week was only paid around 240$"
bad,"A typical day at Kroger was like any other typical day very productive and fun. I learned how to deal with angry customers, stock, do money orders, cash checks, western union. Management were very professional and organized. My co-workers were very nice and helpful. The hardest part of the job was when it was a lot of things to handle inside the store and I didn't have any help, I had to do most of the work by myself. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with all the customers, meeting new people, and learning different things that I didn't no at first."
bad,If you need a job they will give you plenty of work. It is not as picky as other chains. I think the newer system is easier to learn compared with other retail chains I have seen
bad,"While at Kroger I ran U-Scan, Customer Service Desk, Accounting, Cashier and Bagged. I worked 8 to 12 hour days and was very reliable."
bad,This Company was an amazing place to work for. Come in do your job and do it well. Attend to the amazing customers that come in that make you smile and enjoy your job. Help and maintain the way the store flows. I learned that just standing back and watching how management works really let me see what kind of manager that I would like to be. What I will and will not do. I have amazing co-workers. The best part of my job is them. The hardest part of this job is seeing what an amazing company this use to be and now its so hard to see. Everyone is set up to fail.
bad,"I do not feel that I was employed at Kroger long enough to give an accurate review of the company. Management seemed alright, even though it seemed like I was being called to come in on my day off all the time."
bad,"Forklift Operator."
bad,"horrible place to work at, now you get part time or less and favoritism is an all time high there. never ever work here, youll be thanking me later"
bad,The whole store and management is just terrible. I cant stand how they are. The management is really unprofessional there. The customers would complain about how the store looks and how the managers would talk to the people that work there.
bad,Come into work set up the merchandise and the have a co worker come into work about 3 hours later. Help customers pick out jewelry and take in repairs and sale items. If closing put Items in safe and recive merch and send out merch.
bad,This job is terrible and I would never recommend this job to anyone and there's that. Dont make me put more words again. Typical day was a work day
bad,"got inured do to forklift driver lack of safety , was in idle  he came flying down the idle turn the forklift right next to me , was picking up a pallet to move to the other side and bump in to  the pallet and smashed my finger in to the metal self and cut it wide open"
bad,"Typical day: Busy"
bad,"never went up on oay, very rude mean . Force to do anything they asked and never wanted you to move to a different department."
bad,I hated my job I had to do everything the manager didn't want to do and everyone was rude and no one would even try and do their job.
bad,"Worked for Kroger in the past and enjoyed it. Returned because I had a great experience first time round, but was SOOOOO disappointed this time. Terrible management, no one cared about anything. Turn around for crews was high. I will not return,,,,never!"
bad,This was one of the worst jobs i ever had. Everything was very poorly managed. The managers were not friendly and did not care about employees
bad,"Got fired illegally after workers comp claim, so i don't have anything to say about this company. But since I have to (to get to the next part) i guess i can say that the hours were nice. Being denied full time eligability for having the claim as well was a load of fun."
bad,"KROGER is an interesting place to work. There at Kroger you come "
bad,Only accepted this offer because they were the first job to call for an interview . training has been the highlight of my job experience here so far
bad,"On a typical day at work I would stock food, and help customers. The hardest part of my job was being on my knees for long periods of time stocking low shelves."
bad,"busy "
bad,The hardest part of this job was working outside in the pouring rain when all we were provided was a poncho that hardly did it's job. Being sick throughout employment here was not my cup of tea.
bad,"Kroger is an alright first job but it isn't a place for everyone. The management can be tough to deal with depending on who you deal with. Most of my coworkers are hard workers and try to do the best at the department they are in, however, management likes to move people around to fit there needs whenever they please without asking the employee if they want to move or not. The hardest part of my job is having a work list to do only to have to go inside the store to be a cashier even when not needed. The most enjoyable part of my job is that I get to sit back at times and read when it is slow enough and I do get all of my work done."
bad,They do not treat their employees well. I was there for five years and never got a pay raise from 8.10 even though I was running several departments and working full time.
bad,Time with company wasnt pleasnt. very poor management and customer service. Wages are low and compensation is limited
bad,I worked there for 3 years and made only .85 cent raise. The management had no idea how to run any department. They fire people for the smallest things but it's ok to do drugs in the parking lot. I would never recommend anyone to work there nor will I ever shop there ever again!!
bad,This was the first job I got when I was 16 and it was time for a change. I moved to San Diego and did not seek the option to transfer to a different store.
bad,I worked there for 5yrs. And I gave this job my all. The company is cheaper for it to be a million dollar company. The benefits suck and in certain stores they want you to put the job before anything.
bad,"worked in the produce, dealt with fruit and veggies all day. nothing special"
bad,"Processed deliveries, rotated stock, filled scripts, packaged scripts, processed the shipping of each script to the proper location."
bad,I worked in the kitchen as the only female chef and I was treated like meat to the men.
bad,"- Overly worked"
bad,"I like to be active and this job helped me to do just that. However, I really wanted to go to school and be in the medical field.  I stocked merchandise to the shelves and helped out the customers when needed."
bad,"talk to any of the employees working they, they will say they hate their lives"
bad,After leaving a full day of school I have to prepare myself for work in the evenings. I get to work and greet familiar faces that I normally see at Kroger. Then I go to the office to pick up my task list of things that needs to be done before I leave work. I would have to say working in the drug gm department at Kroger is a very hard job. In this department you do a lot of lifting and a lot of stocking. In my opinion I really do find that this job is no longer for me and the amount of strain it puts on me is tough because I am a full time college student. The one thing I love about this job is the people. I am a people's person and I love to make others happy and be able to assist them when a customer needs my help. I feel that working at Kroger you really do have to be a people's person because you see people none stop. But now I do feel that its time for a change in jobs.
bad,"Working the cash register. I learned how to handle money a lot better. Management were nice and stayed on top of everything. Some co-worker were friendly, some were not. The hardest part for me were not fully understanding what to do if a customer came in with something such as a gift card or how to void and item but I got the hang of it after while. I enjoyed it for the most part because it was fairly easy."
bad,"it started off good but at the end I did not like it, managers did not care for employees."
bad,"its a nice place to start off at if its your first job. its not a long term job, specifically the store I work at"
bad,helping people find what there looking for around the store.
bad,"the managers never helped you, and you never got fair breaks and or lunches"
bad,"Worst place to work period. Yet, everyone should do it once to gain a respect of what it is to be at the bottom of the totem pole."
bad,"to much work and not enough pay, not enough hours, no benefits, not a safe place to work"
bad,This was my very first job ever and I moved up fairly quickly and learned a lot from this job and made some very good friends here.
bad,"Unfriendly bunch of people working in the ""office"". Deal with seasonal employees as dirt - referred to me as ""her"" and ""she"" while I'm sitting in on the conversation. Had to ask them to use my name. Wouldn't go back there for any reason!"
bad,i was push cart in the store and clean up restroom and doing cashiers basic i was doing everything round the store
bad,Enviornment was negative including( some) Completed all my task and hardest part of the job was dealing with negative people.
bad,working at Kroger is like not having a pay check.Krogers hours arent always the best.There pay strank.
bad,This company does not pay you well or treat you well. I know someone who has been with the company for 35 years and doesnt get paid close to what she should or even gets the help or hours she asks for.
bad,"working with customers answering their questions and ringing up there groceries, handling money everyday basis, i learned different types of vegetables, co workers were rude only 2 were very nice and respectful, management were awful they were beyond rude,hardest part of the job dealing with the coworkers and managers, enjoyable part is being able to interact with customers"
bad,"You come in, take online orders  go pick the groceries out and put them in a cart. You take them out to your customers, and repeat the process. You have to be consistent or you will mess up."
bad,After being hired for full time at one location I was cut to part time and made to float to different locations. During my paternity leave I was pasted over for a staff position because “they didn’t know if I was coming back”. Then they were unsure of further cutbacks.
bad,I enjoy working there and it was good. I filled out a application and told them on my application that I had a felony and they hired me and let me work for about two weeks. Went through training and put me on floor paid uniforms and all and had a schedule and then I work. And weeks later here come HR and pulling me aside and say well we have to let you go because of your background. I couldn't do anything but 😂😂😂 because I put all that on my application and it wasn't not theft or anything. I just left and pick up my check in two weeks. Which I feel they could of told me before I waisted my time on that job I could of work somewhere else.
bad,"I absolutely hated working here, I feel like they picked on me for whatever reason bc I noticed they were promoting people to cashier so I asked about getting promoted and they said I had to wait until I was 18 bc I couldn't scan alcohol but there were people younger than me that they were promoting to cashier. when I finally turned 18, they still wouldn't promote me. they would send people on breaks and lunches before me when I got there hours before them. they would let me struggle on carts and not send help until the last minute then make me stay out there extra time but the second someone else went outside after me to push carts, they would send me right back out there to help them almost immediately after they went out there. they just were not fair at all. the pay sucked. everybody around me were getting raises every 6 months but when I asked about it, they told me they didn't know anything about it. im so glad I left, I had family that worked there so occasionally id visit to see them and they asked me to come back. sorry but id never got back to a company that treats their hardworking employees like trash. the only good thing here is that I never had any issues with my schedule being wrong. they were very flexible with my school schedule and they changed m availability whenever I needed it to be changed"
bad,"I earned my PTCB license before being hired at Kroger and when I began working, I was expected to know everything.  With time and helpful coworkers, I became very proficient in all areas of the pharmacy and now am a team leader in all aspects of a pharmacy technician.  "
bad,Some of the mangers are a little lazy in the sense that they do not like handling the customers when they have a problem. Most just try to avoid the situation.
bad,"Money is good but it drains your soul physically and mentally. if you are looking at becoming an order selector this is the place, however it is not for me anymore!"
bad,working at the grocery store it was a great experience it was fun to listen to the people the management was good a very great urban culture and great experience.
bad,Kroger’s is the one grocery store that you can save money and shop for less. Plus this store is committed to making it easier on shopping for the  customers
bad,The Managment for as scheduling was never a carrying person such a liar. They watch you like your a kid just a Very sad place to Work. Sad sad sad. I loved my co workers though
bad,a basic day includes rotating product disposing of an outdated product and replacing it with fresh product often handling ordering of replacement for thrown away stock
bad,hardest part of the job is getting the work done in the alloted time..with any overtime resulting in a write up.typical retail job.. worked all holidays and weekends.
bad,"Workers are rude , most times you have to work alone . Management never helps you until you get the union involved. There's a lot of clicjs  inside of the work area . Every Little thing you do you'll get put on blast about it."
bad,"have good benefits such as health, transportation, stocks, certification training on the computer. I love my customers and in a good neighborhood."
bad,if you are at the service desk this job is awesome...the management is not helpful at all
bad,I would tell other people that it reallya good job to have. The thing i would say that you always busy. You also have a great time having fun with your coworkers.
bad,different types of meats and cheese. serve different baksground of individuals
bad,"Fast paced"
bad,"I wouldn’t recommend the job only because of the pay, if y’all payed more maybe it’ll be different but 7.25 can’t feed a home for anybody! Other than that good job"
bad,"This job paid horribly, gave you no hours during the week, and the managers were no help at all. But overall this job was peaceful and slow paced. different from Walmart."
bad,very challegeing especially during the eveing rush I enjoyed working for this company during my high schoool days I learned how to work different machinery .
bad,"Kroger,has and always will be one of the mostgrowing chains in the retail community.I have no complaints I was taught a lot,by a lot of great people and I am thankful for the experience."
bad,Great workplace with amazing benefits. There is always opportunity for advancement. Company is constantly growing.
bad,Kroger simply was not for me. I worked nights and the management over nights did not care about anyone but themselves. They may impossible quotas and never cared about family matters
bad,"Kroger was a place new to me and when I joined it had a good HR guy (who left later on down the road) and that was it basically. The pay was bad and the hours were somewhat ok but the schedule method was god awful, out of all the jobs I had they had the worst scheduling system every. It was always done online and even though they claimed it was always “two weeks ahead” it was mostly only 1 week since the schedule was made on Wednesday but didn’t update till Saturday at 12am. Every day I had to check my schedule not out of needing to remember but because my store would make these changes last minute and if you didn’t show up because they didn’t tell you you would get written up followed by a “it’s not management’s job to inform you of your schedule that’s something you have to do” and even when they were caught doing this after taking daily screenshots to see they changed a shift the very last minute to say I worked the next day"
bad,I tried to change my availability so I wasn’t walking across town 2 miles at 10-11 pm as a 160lb 23 y/o woman in a town known for druggies and was told by my manager “Kroger doesn’t care about your well being going to or coming from work. He then went and scheduled me a 7 day week and then a 6 day week where I closed every single night.
bad,"Management at the ellenwood location are very incompetent. There's a certain lady who's first name starts with M and ends with A. She's a hoot. I dont think anyone can have job security while she's still in upper management. Other than that, the union rep is extremely friendly but her hands are tied as far as what she can do to help employees. I only recommend it if you have a back up plan or are going to school."
bad,"Working as a Courtesy Clerk (CC) and Cashier, I learned a great deal about the disorganization of Kroger. They speak a great mantra, but in reality they burn through employees with their inflexibility. Kroger refuses to work with schedules for employees unless the exact needs were specifically spelled out at hire. Once hired your schedule is whatever they choose to assign.  Should your scheduling needs change once hired, you will be unable to adjust your work schedule to accommodate. Expect to work at 6am, then 4pm, then noon on any given day, with no structure or consistency. Shifts may range from 4 hours on, but you cannot request the number of hours, days, or consistency you may need. Once you are employed the only option for change is reaching seniority, which may take a couple of years. Anticipate that manager duties are a mystery and communication is non-existent.  The Kroger employee website is a mess with broken links throughout, particularly links intended to provide a communication avenue. Managers will tell you to talk to another manager in nearly all situations as it is not their job. There is no accountability as there is no form of written communication offered. I loved the interaction with the excellent fellow employees that I had, and with the wonderful customers who would prefer consistency. Kroger has a long, long way to go to catch up with the current times for communication, flexibility, and employee appreciation.and advancement."
bad,"I learned a lot. This was my first job, but management did not handle things the way they should have. I found myself being blamed for things quite frequently but I put in the work and did my part while i worked  there."
bad,"Poor management that did nothing positive for their staff. School or personal life did not matter to management, work always came first. Managers would call you from their personal cell phones. You would often work more than 6 hours without a break, which is totally illegal. Several call outs among staff, which would often leave you as the only employee in the store from 10pm-midnight. Horrible place to work and is not recommended."
bad,"management changes too often to be kept consistent, there is a lack of support to customer service employees when being abused by customers, words are manipulated when given a new position to give you the impression of a raise and then the ""oh i thought you would get paid more"" when your rate stays the same"
bad,"Horrible place to work. No opportunity for advancement unless you know how to kiss up to the managers. They overwork the employees, never give enough help to get the task at hand completed. Management punishes the ones who work and constantly yell about overtime, then do nothing to the ones who stand around and do nothing and let them have all the overtime that they want.The union is useless. They will say that they will do something for you, one minute. Next minute, you get told that they never said that they could do that, you only imagined it. The pay is not worth the job. The courtesy clerks (or baggers) get screwed the worst...no raises unless minimum wage increases. Part time only gets $0.15 every 6 months. Full time gets $0.25 every 6 months."
bad,The story is way to crazy to put all in word format but to cut it short from start to finish this job is absolutely terrible. From management not know how to schedule or tell time correctly to the managers giving the stank eye when you start on your first day and believing you should know how things go in the store.
bad,I loved working at kroger i loved everyone I worked with but my dept manager he was lazy and no where to be seen always in groceries working would not work with my availability had me walking home 5 days aweek 6 am to 10 am they treat their people like cattle your a robot plain and simple and if you want any kind of home life run as far away from kroger as you can
bad,They do not pay much and expect a lot of work out of employees and they do not treat the employees fairly. They didn’t work with availability and they cut hours of you couldn’t work the time they wanted.
bad,"I worked there for a decent amount of time, the management was very unkind and poor. It created a very negative environment and tension among co workers. The enjoyable part of it was that as a cashier, at least once a day if not more, I could make someones day or make someone laugh. The person to person interaction was the most enjoyable aspect."
bad,"Its only okay if you dont pay rent. , bills , and plan on sometimes going without money for months. You only get 40 hours if youve worked there for YEARS!!! Good for kids 16-17."
bad,"A typical day at kroger is hectic, stressful, and disorangized. Management is no where to be found when needed. The work environment is messy and disorganized."
bad,"typical evening would come in and just get straight to work sometimes would start on the dishes because they would be in the sink from the day shift, would come help other employees if they needed assistance with customers if we got busy, i learned how to properly use the fryer and the oven, i learned how to properly claean the machines you cut cheeses and meats with.  Management was very poor they would sometimes not care about what condition it was left in when the evening shift would come in sometimes would be rude to employes.  workplace culture was very stressful store manager would be rude to the deli staff, wouldn't offer assistance when we were short of help and it would be seen that there were only two employees working that day.  The hardest part of the job was when we were short customers would be rude when the employee couldn't get to them fast enough, there wasn't anything enjoyable about working there"
bad,This job rewards those who dont do their jobs while those who do are treated beyond bad. The management is horrible if your a hard worker they will work you till you get injured and try to find a way to get rid of you during the workmans comp claim. Places like the deli are so understaffed that it becomes aweful just to go to work everyday
bad,"Great company to work for, but Upper management makes it hard for “managers in training”. They will ignore you if you ask any “work related questions”. I guess they feel as if you’re  a “threat” or coming for their position. Will fire you for “personal reasons”!!!"
bad,If you just go in do your job (very well I might add) you will not move up. I don't know what else I can say negative about Kroger. The only positive the the flexible work schedule.
bad,"(#447) Management is poor and shows favoritism. Pay should be higher. Don’t let your coworkers call out or you’ll have NO choice but to stay or get suspended/fired. Very unorganized and ran by people who have the slightest idea what they are doing. If you suck up, you may get decent treatment."
bad,"Over work you for such shiz pay, very greedy company that is being overshadowed by HEB. Expect alot of hours and constant mico managing. Yes, you are welcome"
bad,"There is a severe lack of communication between not only employees, but more importantly, management. You tell one manager something, and it never gets communicated to others. You are expected (and forced) to do other tasks even when you are swamped with tasks of your own. I personally, receive zero respect from multiple managers in this store. This place is more mentally exhausting than it is physically exhausting. The work/life balance is terrible. I feel like I'm at work more often than I'm at home. On the upside, there are many employees that have became life-long friends of mine."
bad,Hard work and tenure not appreciated or respected. I was phased off because I relocated while on maternity leave and they couldn’t even transfer despite years of meritorious service!
bad,"A very low paying job lower than average in all United States only 8.65 per hour say there a union job hours worked not paid for all hours worked"
bad,It wasn't right for cashiers to be getting paid more than the front end clerks because the front end clerks did more work. all the cashiers had to do was scan and bag sometimes The front end clerks would be outside taking carts in and bagging and taking bags out to peoples cars and sweeping and also making sure the front area was cleaned.
bad,Management was awful... They were never flexible with hours I was going to start school and needed mornings off for Wednesday-Friday and they DENIED me so I had no other choice but to put in my two weeks.... I was very upset because I worked there for years.
bad,I’m sorry the company was awesome but management was not i really don’t have nice to say about the place I worked but u do have stores that are great an well ran
bad,"The expectations of what can get done in a shift in the bakery and deli are completely unrealistic, especially for the closing shifts. In fact, the expectations are so unrealistic that there are people quitting in these areas every week, crying during their shifts, etc. This is retail - it shouldn't be that stressful."
bad,no advancement and no full time positions seniority based but does not follow the seniority guidelines. Over worked and under paid. Not a place to move up in the company unless you are considered a favorite
bad,Kroger is a male dominate culture. They have very few women in management. They are very circuital of women. They want women in the front of the house and the men want to run the store They dont train very well and most cashiers they hire cant count back change. They blame all the time people but never do anything to fix the problem. Its a bunch of males walking around like peacocks and but do not take responsibility for the lack of service and lack of training people so desperately need. They hire scape goats.
bad,Management tends to expect things from employees without advising the employee then punish employees for not doing what they expected. Employees are expected to run other departments as they are very understaffed.
bad,"Just used for new store opening, not promised what told, union not for me but joined and they did not get me the required 20 hours a week hang tags for shelves but constantly told to slow even though shelves were being changed everyday for better customer service so had to find correct items for tags"
bad,Good job for a teenager or a first job. But not somewhere I'd recommend to anyone over the age of 19. I don't even shop there after working there. They just don't care about employees.
bad,"As a supervisor, ive never worked with a company who allows their management team to ignore their employees below them unless for write ups. Yelling at employees and co-managers on the floor in front of employees which equates to the high turn over rate."
bad,I would not work there again. They single one person out to do all the work and to me thats not fair for the amount i got paid. If i got paid more I would’ve stayed.
bad,Not good if you have bills. But would recommend for highschoolers. They didn't  want anyone calling off and management was really strict. They wouldn't let me get any overtime and sometimes I would only get 12 hours a week.
bad,Managment is highly uncaring in regards to employees. There were many times I went an entire shift with no break. From start to finish. I was left to close without proper training my 2nd day on the job. Training was very limited and usually left til the last minute. The scheduling was horrible. And the paybwas an insult.
bad,There was always too much work load for one person. Always understaphed. Work pace was way too fast.  Poor and lazy management.  Large turn over on employees.
bad,There is no room for advancement. When I thought I would be able to advance the positions were completely eliminated and now I'll never be allowed to move up no matter how hard I work or how much time I put in. There's no room to grow. The pay isn't fair for the workload or the stress we are put under to perform. Programs for employee rewards have been restructured with unattainable goals so we will never get rewarded even if we have great customer reviews.
bad,"Don't - just do not do it unless it's a position other than front end cashier"
bad,Kroger is not a good company to work for. Upper Management never responded to employee complaints or offered promotions within the company. The pay was way less than what you can make at another pharmacy.
bad,Not a single manager actually cares. They see you as easily replaceable. I had a terrible experience with a co-worker and am completely biased because of that.
bad,"I enjoyed it at first, they didn't place my at weird times to work, but about a month in I was being scheduled during school, and even after countless times of me explaining I had school and classes doing the day, it did not stop them from scheduling me during classes. The manager yelled at me on multiple occasions for not coming in for shifts during school, and soon after I quit. Many other aspects also effected me, as they often messed up on scheduling which caused me to work very hard because there were no other country clerks called into work. Many more aspects made working there even harder."
bad,It wasn't a pleasant experience working at Kroger. It would be times that i had worked more hours in a week than i was allowed due to employees calling off. The job was stressful and it didn't pay enough
bad,"Managers don't know how to do their job"
bad,"I liked working at Krogers, they worked around your school schedule. But would not hire full time, they  would not hire anyone full time, they did not want to pay the benefits"
bad,Long hours. Mostly  working 12 days straight before getting a day off.  No job and life balance. Low pay for the work that you do. No opportunity to move up and make a career .
bad,"no teamwork, manger are more concerned with making friends then seeing production being meet, only willing to give 20 cent raises, get back stock and push it on the floor for sales"
bad,"I worked for the Starbucks Kiosk in a very busy Kroger store. We are essentially a restaurant functioning in a grocery store. As such we were always held to rules and regulations that did not apply to us or were very difficult to meet due to the workflow of our day. Not only that, but our needs for coverage were never addressed adequately. We would frequently work multiple hours alone. Not taking breaks or being forced to close the kiosk in order to take breaks. They would schedule lots of people for the daytime and then when it came to closing when we needed someone to pre-close (basically clean the entire kiosk) we would have two people. Often during the busiest grocery shopping times, after work hours. "
bad,"Would have enjoyed working there, however, one manager was inconsiderate to employees needs. I started working on morning shift then was transferred to over-night shift then to another department in the store."
bad,If your in school and need a job to work around your school schedule Kroger is good for that. Otherwise for a grocery store its okay place to work but the pay isnt great
bad,"We were underpaid, asked to work without regards to our school schedules even though when hired were told that they would be flexible and understanding."
bad,"Kroger is one of the worst job experiences I've had in 43 years of employment. 90 percent of managers are young, inexperienced, have no business skills, inept, unknowledgeable, have no common sense, and no people skills."
bad,"Lucky the manger when i was working there is gone. The coworker felt like family and had great teamwork. There is no room for growth, they work you like a slave and get paid nothing."
bad,I hate it. You barely get hours. Management is the worst. It’s very easy but yet unorganized.  I wouldn’t recommend working here if your trying to get on your feet. Or if your in college
bad,"It would be a nice job for someone who is still in school. Its a part time job, which isnt good for me because i have children to take care of and also have a lot of bills. Kroger has switched me from deli department to the front department as an cashier. I was basically forced to work as a cashier. I do not like it. By them switching me has messed up my pay and my billing arrangements."
bad,Typical work day includes bagging customer groceries or ringing up customers purchases when needed. Otherwise the day is spent performing janitorial duties or gathering carts out in the parking lot and bringing them into the store. The communication between management and employees could be better and the culture is dilapidated an in need of repair. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers of course.
bad,"The management at the front end is the worst I have ever worked for. Because of how awful they are i have been looking for another job after 1 week into my employment at city market. The work place is hostile and unfair, favorites are a huge role. Absolutely the worst job I have ever had."
bad,I enjoying working and assisting the customer that entered into our store.  The other employed are not team player and willing to help others.  The store improvement as for better communication and offer positive enforcement.
bad,"None productive workplace with bad management. 95% of employees are depressed, over worked, and underpaid. A typical day at work consists of completing everything on time, management adds something extra to do, then yells at you for doing what they told you to do. What I learned by working at Kroger is that almost everywhere else pays more, and offers a better work environment. Depending on the day management can be good or bad, it all depends on which manager is in. In other words, manger A picks on bakery, while manger B picks on deli. Workplace culture hinders the work environment greatly at Kroger, often times cutting into customers needs pulling away workers at inappropriate times. The hardest part of the job is to complete everything when management adds new things every day. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the enjoyment on the customers face when I hand them their product that they ordered, as well as the customer interaction."
bad,didn't like it as Kroger is going under and more and more stores are closing down there was an 86% turn over rate which did not help. Plus my manager was always breathing down my throat
bad,If you like to make decent money but never see your family this is the job for you. You better be single and prepare to deal with constant labor issues. Workplace culture tends to be very negative.
bad,"Would never work there again, have seen some serious issues in that organization in regards to disrespect to their employees. Pay is awful and everyone who works there is miserable and stressed out to the max."
bad,"I think Kroger would be better off if they increased the salary from $7 to maybe $10/hour. A typical day for a florist is to work on the truck if it is a truck day, then water the plants, and make arrangements, and bows as needed."
bad,"Like I said in the last review. Management doesn't know how to manage a team. They do their own thing and don't help there on people."
bad,"No grocery store can keep people. That's why they have a Union to protect employees from their employers. Marianos has been absolutely the worst place in the world for me, but I'll try to make this review unbiased as I can."
bad,They want you to work whatever hours even if you have a set schedule. They dont pay well AT ALL. if you have a problem then you better just figure it out yourself because no one will help.
bad,Originally working for the Kroger company was fun and I enjoyed to go to work. I became friends with my coworkers. Eventually I became the manager over my department and some of the other associates had a problem with that. Instead of my managers having my back and supporting the way I managed the department they had listened to the gossip and got involved with it. I quit because I knew I would have been treated better working for a different company.
bad,the managers and customer service managers abuse their power and have their pick of who they want to help and who they want to give hours and days off to. If they would learn how to do things the correct way then that place would be a better workplace
bad,This company is horrible to their students who attend high school and their other employees in general. They would work me above 25 hours a week while I was attending high school and that is illegal. They also never approve vacations and will not approve schedule change requests.
bad,"Unless you're just doing this as a summer job or as something to do during you're college experience and you need some money. The managers I had didn't/don't care how their employees are treated by customers because they plant in the customers head the ""they are always right""."
bad,"Help maintain cleanliness of the store."
bad,"A typical day at work was me going in cleaning shelves and refrigerators. Sounds easy, right? NOT! If you missed 1 spot you were getting written up, if you took too long to clean that shelf you were getting written up, etc. My co-workers were definitely nice but the management there was horrible. They were never really around unless it was for a write up. The hardest part of my job was again being away from my son cause I worked nights so yes I got to put him to bed but then I'd have to sleep all day so I'd hardly get to see him during the day. I really didn't enjoy anything there except my co-workers."
bad,"The worst management on front end anywhere. Completely rude woman in charge. Beg for ur break, days off needed, even have to nag them when ur shift is over"
bad,"A typical day at work for a General Clerk (What most individuals over the age of 18 get stuck working as at some point in time) is hectic and completely terrible for the pay and benefits, if there are any."
bad,They do not want to give full time. They do not care about their employees. you can not support yourself on what they pay you.I do not think people should apply for work there.
bad,"manager didn't care about workers and would send people to work outside in 105 degree weather for hours at a time retrieving grocery carts (or even in snow/rain). manager gave special treatment to her children who worked under her and with the other cashiers. pay was very low, schedules were purposefully made to maximize work time while minimizing break times. supervisors/managers are very rude and have an attitude which emphasizes the dispensability of workers."
bad,Beside meeting some few nice customers the rest are complete idiots when the slightest thing do go their way they want to get the manager. And the managers are freaking jerks who will threaten to fire if you don't something when and how they want you to do it.
bad,This job is really not me I would to find something different. This jobs wants a little bit too much . They don't really pay much for everything they want in this job. Little of training is done while being employed here.
bad,"A typical day at work included running a front-end register and having face-to-face contact with customers.  I totally enjoyed my customers and helping them in any way I can.  I found that being kind and patient goes a long way in building a good rapport with people.  "
bad,My experience at Kroger was one that was ruined by childish management which in turn caused an all out one on one with all employees fighting to get a raise that never came
bad,Preparing food for a full bakery dept. I learned how to decorate cakes and cupcakes. coworkers were not fun to work with. No room for advancement anywhere. part time workers are treated like garbage.
bad,"Kroger is ok to work for. One of the good things about Kroger is that if your called in on your day off, it's considered time and a half. I like the people I work with."
bad,"I worked here during my senior year. I didn't have much work experience so I took whatever job called me back. I absolutely loved it at first then a couple weeks later it turned into drama, lazy management. They worked me until  4:00-11:00 pm on school days which never gave me anytime to do my homework. Also some of the older employees acted immature and started drama."
bad,"on your feet allday, "
bad,Ok for a part time job. Management was bad. I worked in overnight stocking so it was what you would expect from this job.
bad,Dont even bother relying on a schedule.... they will not follow it. Basically you stay until you are done.
bad,"Ive worked for Kroger in 2 different states and I can truly say that the Kroger in Redford, Michigan is an extremely better place to work than the Buckhead Kroger in Atlanta. The UNION is garbage and the employees are even lower... the pay never increases and the only thing worth working there is the Sprint discount and the Discount for shopping at Kroger"
bad,"They drop me from 35hrs to 15 so, they would not have to pay benefits. They told me I would at least 30 to 35 hrs. Not true"
bad,Pay is the only thing that seemed to be a benefit of the job. Very poor attitude by most people that work there
bad,"kroger doesnt pay good being a union job, work us like dogs have insurance with krogers also have my son but he is only covered for sickness nothing else this sucks."
bad,"Working at Ralphs Market was by far one of the worst jobs I've ever had. The management was crooked and rude, they didn't stand up for their employees(I had a customer throw a basket of groceries at me and the manager on duty didn't say a word to the customer), and they don't go by the book. The shifts we all only four hours and they don't give the hours to the people who deserve them, they let a computer do their scheduling completely. The main manager is a pansy and will say anything to get the customer happy."
bad,No consistant management. Not consistant weekly schedule. Co-workers were friendly.
bad,the manager was rude and annoying I got fired because of a stupid reason and never given a second chance
bad,I didn't like the fact that the company short their employees pay after working long hours. Another bad job experience.
bad,My experience at Kroger has been different due to different management teams. I learned how to do a lot of things store level which included the hiring  process. My co workers for the most part were nice and we formed a family. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers who are not understanding to the job functions we have and management not being supportive. The most enjoyable things about working for Kroger is establishing bonding relationships with co workers and loyal customers.
bad,Great for high school kids or college kids. For adults it made me feel unimportant and couldn't grow. 
bad,if you want to work for min. wage and work to death this is the job for you Kroger Grocery!
bad,Kroger was an alright company to work for. I had a few issues with management when it came to raises and such. Management seemed to be unprepared and all over the place quite often. My coworkers were great and for the most part the customers were as well. The hardest part of working for Kroger was the fact that advancement seemed non existent. 
bad,The best part of the job are the employees. They really got your back and stick by you. Even when managers harrass you.
bad,In all the years I have worked for big companies this by far is the WORST!!! It is so sad as there is a few wonderful people that work there but the rest need to GO.
bad,Management does not communicate with staff. You have supervisors who have a total disrespect for those older than them. Management never gave enough time when it came to having to work overtime.
bad,"I worked here for a year and a half. Other than helping customers, I cleaned, made fresh coffee, restocked shelves, accepted can returns. The other assosiates were pretty nice, and the people that came in were almost always nice. The problem there was the manager and her assistant manager. I got constant harasment and downgrading from them after I had worked there for about 6 months. Eventually they found some stupid reason to get rid of me."
bad,"Wages are very poor and the work load for a single employee is that of three or more. In addition, when a candidate is selected for a promotion, they start wages at the very bottom and it takes at least two years just to receive a full $1.00 raise. Management could care less if you have any concerns regarding your job function or needs for schedule accomodations."
bad,"Well, they offered me $12 an hour. Then when I hired on they said I only make $9.80 an hour. Lot of hard work for that kind of money require you to do a lot of things a lot of heavy lifting a lot of rushing around. Management you seem to want to understand how hard the job really was they just kept firing and hiring and a short three months that I work there. Being new to that type of job. I was the one that the most seniority. In 3 months"
bad,"HR treats associates like kids and make new rules on the daily, which are posted after breaks and never verbally discussed. Managers and supervisors are never on the same page. Driving to work only makes me bitter now. There’s much more to tell... take my advice and stay away from MTZ"
bad,I do verytough work for minimum wage. Unless u have been there for 30 years you receive very little benefits. You need to hold down anothet job and they really dont work with it. It is union but the union let's the company set the pay. Like I said the union is useless and then they take money out obypyr check.
bad,"Company gives very low page wages. You are expected to work at a very high pace and their is no sense of accomplishment. It is just a stepping stone job. If you want to go up the corporate ladder here you must have good network skills, because hard work is not recognized here"
bad,I’m a number to my store and all they talk about is sales and cutting hours and not meeting corporate numbers or getting their bonus. They make millions and can’t pay us right.
bad,"Work duties were inconsistent daily. Management was very stressed and this was passed down to others. Work duties and hours were not consistent on a weekly schedule; this was the hardest part of the job."
bad,"The career center was more engaging than the actual position itself. Management and coworkers made it hard to want to go to work. Very demanding, high expectations to to multiple jobs all at once with very little recognition or gratitude. Disorganized management"
bad,I have experience racism at Kroger and I was harassed every day for having heart problems which caused my condition to get worse . Also payroll problem
bad,I was a Meat Clerk which for the most part involved serving customers so my day very routine just smile and ask how could I help them today so overall it was a fair work environment.
bad,the baggers had no clue what was going on and all of them avoided the back row. redvests had no clue what they were doing and one employee wasnt even a redvest and still got the vest and got to boss cashiers and baggers around. he had no place doing that and made everything harder.
bad,Highly  stressful  no help from senior  management when you get behind. No help with problems  when you get a chance to talk to a manager they blow you off because  they don't want be bothered with hourly  associated  problem s.
bad,"Not consistent with managment.   "
bad,Do not have Anything to say about the Kroger company or stores at this time. I would not go back to working for them. It was very dis-organized when I worked there.
bad,Friendly but Unprofessional people I would not recommend working here seems like they are not honest about the job and working here and work and life balance
bad,Even if you need a job really badly don't do it the work environment sucks and is so taxing on your mental health. All the employees are gossipy and spread rumors about everything especially bistro
bad,Schedule is never the same. The number of hours they give you vary from 18 to 40 for part timers. Management treats the part timers like full timers but without the benefit of being a full time employee.
bad,"I've worked at a Kroger store for a little over 2 years. I have been given more and more responsibilities whilst working there with no such luck of a pay raise. Working at this job is good for a short time job unless you've been there longer than 10 years. I've asked and insisted for a pay raise with the same result of ""it's impossible"" or ""it can't be done""."
bad,ok to work with th company.. employed since college. Will recommend that anyone that wants to move up can work with the company. It very important to work
bad,"When I worked at Kroger it wasn't too bad at first but then it became draining and some people who worked there were very rude. I never got a raise, EVER. I worked there for almost 3 years and I never got a raise. The only raise I got was a 25 cent raise and it was only because the union made them give everyone that raise, after that, there was nothing else. Could not stand working there."
bad,I did not enjoy my time working with kroger mainly because of the lack of managment and the poor quiality of what was availible. They were unfair to emplyess and did not take them seriously.
bad,"I’ve had better jobs but it was decent at the time. Pay absolutely sucked. 150 a week isn’t worth the headache of customer service at a gas station. The only real complaint I ever had was my supervisor at the Time was horrible, he talked to me and 3 other girls like a dog he picked his favorite and that was it."
bad,"If you work here, be prepared for horrible hours poor communication between managers and employees. They dont care about you or your family. If you try to call in, they will make you feel worse. They will want you to work sick. They dont care.  To be blunt, you dont want to work here."
bad,"I only worked there for a month and was already begging to leave. I got paid $9.65 per hour just so that people could call me stupid and act like I don't know what I'm doing. The management had no way of dealing with rude customers and often just gave them what they wanted even if they were wrong. "
bad,"A constantly stressful work environment with managers that belittle, yell and occasionally cuss at you for not completing tasks even if you do not have enough hours to do so. Kroger within the last year has started operating a sudo ""skeleton crew"" model and does not allow for overtime in most situations to be able to get the job done with just 2-3 people. "
bad,"The work environment is awful, your coworkers don't care and the management cares even less. If you have nothing else going then it's better than nothing. That being said I would not recommend making a career start here. You're essentially working twice as hard for half the pay."
bad,"Decent job to start back in management, just don't expect to ascend on your own educational merits, or prior experience. Classical case of ""tail wagging the dog"" when it comes to beneficial decision making."
bad,"I can’t speak for every location. But the location in which I worked had managers that cared about numbers and little else. They don’t care about the lives or well-being of their employees, only their customers and bottom line."
bad,management is not great. They are very short staffed but yet cutting hours however leaving us to deal with very unhappy customers when their prescriptions are not ready in a timely manner.
bad,"Kroger is a decent place for high school and maybe college students to work at as a part time job to earn some money on the side, otherwise it's not really worth it."
bad,The management and some employees very unprofetional.they party to much. They speak rude inapropreite to people including customers.the cashiers ask customers for money for personal things.alot of gossiping. Store restrooms are filthy.
bad,been with Kroger for almost 12 years and each year the job have become more stressful.From the lack teamwork to how things are ran on a day to day basis inside the stores.
bad,There is a core of employees that have been there since store opening. They bust the balls of all new employees and run them off. Only the worst personalities are welcome to stay or promoted to department manager. Do not disclose any disability even with documents —this makes you a target by management and co-workers. UFCW 99 — the union for Fry’s Food and Drug — is not on your side. Only rely on yourself.
bad,"Fast past environment, always busy, poor management. Easy job. Hardest part was some reports. Most enjoyable part was bubbly customers. A lot of hours were available."
bad,It pays fairly well. More if you stay for a while no other place pays as well. All of the stuff you have to put up with..... it's not worth it!.......
bad,"Working for Kroger was OK. They tried to hire people who knew what they were doing. Unfortunately it was sold and new owners were bad."
bad,"If you really need a job bad, don’t mind not getting trained properly, and getting yelled at for things beyond your control, then go work at Kroger. It is, easily, the most frustrating place to not advance or make any money."
bad,"Managers talk to anyone less than them like children and yell at them in front of customers. Managers do not care about health, they just want you to work. The management gets under your skin."
bad,"the managers are unfair, they dont help you especially when you are being harassment. they dont give you many hours and dont acknowledge your work when you do good."
bad,"in my 6 months working there (kroger hoover 11) , i had had a 3/10 experience. when i first started i loved my job , and then with the new remodel and the returning of an old manager i slowly started to grow more and more dislike towards my job. out of all four managers , 2 of them are fantastic. the other two ask for ridiculous tasks and treat employees very unfairly and pick on employees who don’t speak up."
bad,"If you don't want benefits right away, that's the place to work for, wait a yr for medical & 5 yrs for vision/dental. You want a place to work for really flexible & evening hrs that's the place to go too. I got more pay from my non-union grocery I work for, then here. The older store manager & the young asst manager were good, the other 2 were not. A store that needs to be open 24 hrs a day, not that store, doesn't have the customers & doesn't have the employees that don't want to work there, they cannot compete with walmart. They also lack in training & communication."
bad,"It's not a career by any means. Even as a full time employee in some form of management, I was STILL barely scraping by to make ends meet. And whenever there was an incident of harassment, management never really did anything to rectify the situation. I worked there for four years and I can honestly say that I had never been happier than when I finally left."
bad,Management over promises and under delivers.. They see employees as expendable and wonder why they’re always short on staff. You will be lied to by management to get you in the door. You will be expected to cover for anybody that calls off and be manipulated into doing it if you refuse.
bad,Too many duties for very little pay. Customer first clerk has too many responsibilities and is the least paid. Outside pushing carts in the very hot weather and cold sometimes all by yourself.
bad,The most difficult part of the job was getting assistance from management and the supervisors. Cashiers do not recieve enough training and their allowance on the register is limited given the fact that supervisors and management are slow to answer the call.
bad,"Krogers is a great company to work for due to their massive open opportunities to move up in different areas or positions overtime. However, i was unable to continue growing with the company because I could not support my daughter with the pay rate i waa given when i came back to work from maternity leave."
bad,"Work days were short, managers were rude and had contradictory policies, managers attempted to explain policies and then completely ignored said policies in the explanation."
bad,"If you want to put your life and goals on hold for just a scratch above minimum wage then this is the job for you.  Want a third party taking money from your check that are supposed to help but hardly show their faces when help is needed?  I've worked for the company for a decade across the us, each having their own particular flow. But each remains the same. Pay low, expect you to be on call despite only giving you 12 hours minimum.  As a manager it kills me to see these associates of mine struggling due to these practices, holding other jobs to make ends meet. The training is a joke. Sit in front of a computer and good to go. No coach no help just a check off the list and on the floor"
bad,"This company is living in the past with their ideas and culture. They have gotten fat and sat on their hands and now is playing catch up because of more aggressive competitors. They do not complement or encourage their employees to succeed and are very fast to point out an employees mistakes. Bad management that does not communicate with each other, very disorganized, and very slow to complete projects."
bad,Co-workers were completely rude and vulgar. They would berate me and two new workers. The manager himself was quick to push duties on others. And morning manager would berate all of us for bad work even when the job was done correctly. The environment was also dirty and filthy. Meat would spoil overnight and a dead rat was found behind cereal boxes.
bad,This company as a whole is just bonkers when it comes to treating their employees like humans. Don't waste your time as lower management is constantly swapped between stores so you don't have much of a chance to build work relations; constantly having to deal with a new store manager and assistant managers roughly every 9 to 20 months.
bad,"This is a good starter job, but not a good career choice unless you are in management. There is no room for advancement for the average employee and the hours are all over the place."
bad,"The job itself is fine, and typical retail work. The constant blame game between the store management, the union, and district management for low pay, staffing shortages, and refusal of overtime is very stressful."
bad,"Kroger is a very awful place to work. Having worked there for a year and 2 months, I was required to do many jobs with very low pay and no praise at all. There were hour cuts and many times where I was told to work numerous days with no break in between."
bad,Had no supervisor which is a requirement. Just came in worked and left. No follow up. A lot of slacking and doing nothing by other employees without discipline.
bad,"Signed on to a 50 hour weekly job with at least one guaranteed day off, after first week I was doing 40 hours of mandatory OT, one day off every 3 weeks or so. Just insane 95% turnover rate with awful supervisors. Very stressful, high paced and dangerous when you have several hundred people working 80-90 hour weeks for months on end. Made a bunch of cash tho"
bad,Kroger was a stressful job with not much oppurtunity and not much pay for the amount of work put in. There isn't much room to grow and expand in any given position.
bad,"the company overall is a good company to work for, its just the employees and the management that are the problem. they give people who are not qualified to do the job these titles of management."
bad,I was a good worker and  reliable but it was cut throat.  The pay was good for being a local  store and living in he same town.   But moving up is really not an option.  They don't like to hire full time
bad,"I only worked here for a summer but I was miserable. They said they would schedule hours 2 weeks in advance but they only ever scheduled 1 week in advance, and that usually wasn’t even accurate because they would set a schedule and then realize that they didn’t schedule enough people. They were always understaffed. I don’t think a single week went by when they didn’t ask me to pick up extra shifts. I did because I needed the money but it drive me nuts when they called me on my days off. There was a huge disconnect between employees on the main floor and management. In the short time I was there, several other cashiers were fired or quit. They went through tons of employees while I was there. Most of my other employees were nice enough but the customers....oh my gosh, you never knew if the next customer was going to scream at you or have a nice talk with you or ogle you or what. It made me super nervous all the time. They had the cashiers take turns working at the self scanning machines, and they throw me over there without any training and those machines were sooo old and they NEVER worked properly, and so many customers got mad. The only benefit I got was a small employee discount but it wasn’t much. Even the employee rewards system was pretty cheap. Main floor employees have no support from the managers, even when there are customer issues or cases of shoplifting. The security guard was only there a couple days out of the week and I did not feel safe there."
bad,"It's not worth it as an adult.managers are not sympathetic, hours are long, customers are rude, pay is awful, co-workers are okay.  Continuously treated like a child instead of the adult I am."
bad,"Typical day is very stressful and high volume, I learned I was worth more than 8.10 an hour, management was normally mean, coworkers were either way older than you and mean or way way older than you or mean, the hardest part of the job was working so much and making really nothing, and the most enjoyable part was I worked with one good person and that's really it."
bad,Did not enjoy working for this company. never offered a raise or advancements even after 90 days of probation. My fellow employees were always rude and never helpful. Everyone just seemed very sad and unhappy with their job.
bad,"a typical day there is average, I've learned to communicate better and learned cashiering skills. management could be better. no part was to hard for me."
bad,"The Company is stable, but the pressure for working at a job where you are continually being threatened with demotion and dismissal is too much. I was repeatedly told that if I couldn't get the job done they would find someone who would. When I finally stepped down from my position I was transferred to the busiest store in the area. It was an obvious attempt to force me to leave."
bad,When hired I explained I could work any hours except for Wednesday's after 6pm and Sunday mornings. I was consistently scheduled during these hours. The manager did not seem to care that this was conflicting with the terms I was hired under. I found other employment.
bad,they train you kind of. you work hours that change every week. you get paid every other week. its mostly hard manual labor. they ignore company rules alot.
bad,not a good place to work the employees are nice the management team is not. they dont do proper procedures at all times .very demanding for little pay
bad,"The call center is poorly managed and a poisonous atmosphere. Extremely high turnover. Ask a lot of reps and specialists, but don’t pay for what is required."
bad,"This Koger rotates their managers like the seasons. They were very unprofessional when it came to getting me started as a new employee. You are supposed to start wearing a blue shirt after a month of working there and a month later I was still wearing my white shirt, also I didn't have a cashier code until maybe weeks later. They started ""scheduling"" me for Saturdays (weekends I was usually off and I would go back to my hometown to visit family) so I come to work and it turns out it was an error in the schedule... this happened for a couple more Saturdays. People started quitting left and right, and hours were being cut out of nowhere. I had gotten food poisoning after eating there for lunch and customer service told me to take 5 minutes extra and get back to work, customers were concerned and complained which got the attention of my manager who allowed me to go home."
bad,"usually slow paced, promotions mean many added responsibilities with barely any pay raise, drama between almost all managers and checkers, unrealistic expectations from store managers for department heads and if you work with cash and someone attempts a robbery you will be fired because they claim you could be involved even if you deter the robber."
bad,"Job requirements are fair on paper.  However, my location consistently requires you to work with no breaks and sometimes no meal breaks due to lack of staffing.  Management does not seem to care, unless their superiors are in store at time.  Pleading to hire help falls on deaf ears, and you are told indirectly to deal with it as best as you are able.  Be prepared to work over your end time, and to give up your scheduled day off.  My location is a union store."
bad,"Working there was a good experience, just had a lack of work done. I can say that the customers there were very lovely towards us and loved shopping there."
bad,"The manager was hateful and seemed to enjoy making their employees cry in front of customers.  They did not want to switch my shift and insisted I work until 12 midnight even though I am in school.  Simply put,   I hated it."
bad,"I initially was hired at the deli, the job task were easy, I learned cutting deli meats and cheese, and then went on to the Nutrition Department. I was constantly told that I would receive management pay as the Nutrition manager since I became the manager shortly after I transferred departments. However, it never came and the management didn't seem to care if I would every be fairly compensated. The hardest part of the job was putting up with incompetent management for such a low pay."
bad,You were always told a different way to handle a call. Calls were closely monitored and used as training materials. We were marked absent rather we had a dr excuse or not.
bad,"No breaks were allowed, no matter how many hours were worked. The management was poor and uncaring. The management treated the employees unfairly at times."
bad,I could only stay working there for what seemed like the longest 6 months of my life. Negative atmosphere to work in and no control over young employees. I felt as if the young people ran the store. No discipline and no respect from other employees or managers for that matter. The worse place I ever worked inky 48 years of life and that includes the restaurant business as a server. I got more respect and help as a server for 5-10 years than I got there in one week.
bad,"This company has the opportunity and potential to treat its employees with respect but fails to do so."
bad,"Kroger provides a poor environment for it's employees. Morale is constantly kept low through ever changing rules, lack of managerial engagement, and constant complaints about pay by management. The non-pay benefits of working are good but that does not make up for the other problems."
bad,"I reported to work clocked in and I bagged and loaded groceries, I also stocked shelves withing the grocery store. I brought the carts inside and set up and cleaned areas."
bad,"you either had a really good supervisor or a really poor one each day, the HR and all the higher up management was really poor and favored their employees.  your works hours were very inconsistent, I was hired on for 25 hours a week and would get about 8-15."
bad,"This is a good place to work if you are desperate and have no life outside of work. There are no full-time employees - except for management - so the stores are often shorthanded/ short staffed yet you are expected to continue as if it were fully staffed - it makes it VERY difficult to work in. Also, you will be expected to come in on days off - stay late etc- so in actuality, you will work 40 hours in some weeks - but as long as they don't work you at more than 2 weeks of full-time work they don't have to pay full-time wages & benefits. The employees are really hurt- treated pretty poorly and it's just a bad place to work long time."
bad,"My typical work day will consist of me clocking in at 10:30pm "
bad,"I called corporate twice due to the fact that when I was scheduled to work an 8 or 10 hour shift, I was not allowed to clock out for a lunch or a break. Working for 8-10 hours without a break when you are standing up dealing with customers at the pharmacy drive through and pick-up counter caused a lot of health issues with my stomach, not to mention it's illegal."
bad,I have no comment really just want to forget that bad experience and move on to somewhere i will be appreciated. And give my best work to make it better for everyone
bad,"Kroger picks their favorites and those are the people that get treated well. If you're not a favorite, they basically brush you off and push you around."
bad,"poor training skills, and management, no room to move up in the department/ work place. Worker's are treated unfairly, Kroger does offer great costumer service."
bad,"The management is not good at all, at store level and corporate level. "
bad,"This store was very unorganized with training, scheduling and pay rate was unacceptable for the work you have to put in I wouldn't recommended no one to work at the Kroger's on holmes and mlk it is very ghetto and management doesn't take care of the associates"
bad,"Can not seem to keep the same mangier at any store for any period of time. and dos not take serous situations serious, dose not call the police when there is a thafet and dose not take criminal repertoires seruis."
bad,I worked at kroger while attend school.  Kroger overall meet my requires and allow me to go school.  I enjoyed working at Kroger.  I enjoyed the daily contact with the customers.  The position was easy to do.
bad,Kroger is not the place you would want to work if you are just seeking for a job because they don't pay enough for the hard work you are doing. Kroger is a place to shop sometimes not work
bad,It was very hard for me to balance school and work. Because of that I had to pick one and I obviously picked school because school was far more important.
bad,"Management is constantly getting in the way, very hard to get anything done while you're constantly being micromanaged, also Corporate completely got rid of any HR there was"
bad,This was the worst job ever. The supervisors and managers were very unprofessional and behaved like kids. They are very messy and like to keep up drama.
bad,"*Hopping from department to department helping out where we were short staffed. Assisting the customer with whatever deli related needs they have."
bad,"As stated in my summary, it is a good job for a high school kid, but once you move into management, nothing will ever be good enough. Upper management does not care about work/life balance. Everyday is like you are interviewing for your own job."
bad,I worked this job while in college and it was very hard to maintain school with this job due to my managers not working with me at all on scheduling issues. Work was not hard though.
bad,This has been the worse place I have worked at and it was not worth the trouble. You better suck up to management or you won't get far. Petty people all around
bad,Everyone threw everyone under the bus in there.  Hours were always different. One week you hould have 32 hours the next week you would have 10.  The manager of the department was oblivious to what was going on.
bad,Hardest part of the job is being underappreciated and working more hours even for a for a retail environment is most overwhelming. the culture and thee moral of the company is overall not good. A few stores here and there does great with team morale on occasion.
bad,Kroger has a horrible management. There is no advancement in the company. There is a lot of favoritism in the company. They do not work with the employees if they go to school.
bad,I hated working there felt out of place there only 2 blacks worked in pharmacy.. I don't recommend anyone that is a minority work in pharmacy they have it fixed the way they want it there.
bad,"Poor management never opportunity to work full time scheduled shifts never consistent not enough hours to support self worked every single holiday for 5 years never given brakes on time never enough baggers so cashiers had to do both had to sell constantly whatever cause the company was promoting at the time constantly having to ask customer for money towards that cause customers resented this very much not enough pay raises to little rating on reviews were not accurate for all you do for company had to wait 12 months to get insurance and then had to consistently work at least 25 hours or loose it which hours given was up to supervisor had to join union at 10.00 a week just to make sure you were treated fairly which no one should have to do. The Company you work for should treat employee with respect not humiliate them in front of customers. Training on registers were limited due to supervisors given more information on how to operate made customers wait till cashier could call a supervisor if you could find one to correct or change something on register, Doors to close to registers cold air constantly blowing on workers so you freeze while working. Shall I go on???"
bad,"I would not recommend anyone work for Kroger. The management is terrible. They are short staff in just about every department, it is not a fair place to work."
bad,When I started working there it was great and as time went by you can tell they play the favorite game there. They move up people that get friendly with managers rather than looking at who actually works hard. Wouldn't recommend working there at all.
bad,"The store that I worked for was a disaster. Not a good experience at all. That's all that I can say and needs to be said. If you're looking for a low paying, not very respectful, and plain miserable part-time experience, then work at this store. I did."
bad,"No chance for full time, no benefits, unreliable managers, managers are unprofessional, employees don't get breaks.union rights are abused and misused. People constantly being fired and hired."
bad,No advancement for the cashier. Low pay rate and they never kept track of it either. short 15 minute lunch breaks. 2 of them for an 8hr work shift
bad,"Working for kroger was horrible,worked there for a year and got fired for no reason.Was promised a raise never got it ,they take money out for union!! Late breaks n never got my lunches on time n forced to leave my lunch if the store was backed up. Gotten written up for working hours outside your availability. The store manager was racist and showed favor-ism."
bad,Expect a lot for a little Never get breaks on time. Pay raises are slow and very little. Union was never any help.  They work you hard and you get so little back.
bad,"Management is terrible. All the way up the chain, they don't care about anyone but themselves and will throw any employee under the bus if it advances them. Area talent managers and area vp's rule by scaring employees and making them think their jobs are in jeopardy. No one acknowledges if you're doing a good job, but will jump down your throat if you make an honest mistake. Communication is terrible between employees as well. Lots of drama in all of the stores. Pay is terrible, 10+ hour days are expected. Hiring managers will promise things that hey won't follow through with to get you in the door."
bad,"The customer service is not equal all around"
bad,"Hard WorkThis position is engaged in planning, implementing, coordinating, and supervising recreation programs, involvement in managing sports programs and special events for the community. Plan, organize, and implement recreation programs by overseeing a variety of sports and recreation programs, ordering supplies and collecting registrations. Work independently and responsible for overseeing activities at designated locations such as parks, baseball fields and other public facilities. Work includes weekends, holidays and evenings. Must work within very strict time frames. Maintains supplies for all athletic and recreation programs. Supplies and runs the concession stand as needed. Works within the village budget for Parks and Recreation and is constantly looking for ways to improve the events and maintain fiscal responsibility. There were only 7 events held in previous years and I have taken that to 22 for this year while maintaining the budget limits. Great customer service skills as well as great communication within other departments in the village."
bad,Kroger family of companies is an excellent choice if you are a teenager still in school. Tgey advertise flexible scheduling which is a lie. U have to beg to switch departments or positions.  Kroger is very unprofessional and only care about the happiness of customer not of their employees
bad,Unfriendly and unhelpful staff. Unequal distribution of work duties given to employees. Overall poor attitude and lack of work ethic displayed by most of the staff.
bad,"I opened with the Oak Lawn store as a first job. I saw it as an opportunity to gain experience for a future job. August 2016 will be my second year working for Mariano's. A typical work day: I will punch in, help customers, do my job to the best of my abilities with a smile on my face. Very often I am asked to do much more than I am being paid, and I will always be underappreciated. I have no choice but to tolerate terrible managers and some of the most unpleasant customers I've ever encountered."
bad,"They told me that I could give them my school schedule so that I could get hours that worked for me since I'm a full time college student but they told me since I was new that I couldn't have that right away because other people may have those times off. I thought that was really messed up. So they always scheduled me for when I had class, so I wasn't able to come into work because of class and I got in trouble for it. When I went to put my two weeks in you have to give them a written statement that you are leaving and when you want your last day to be. Well they lost it and it never got put in the system so it got even more messed up. Everyone there is so unorganized."
bad,"On a typical day I would just run the cash register and assist customers. Towards the end of my employment I was running the self services lane at the store so i would have to check IDs for tobacco and alcohol purchasers, make sure no one forgot to scan an item, helping customers operate the machines. The hardest part of my job was the store management. They showed little to no respect to any of the employees. When ever an problem was brought forward to management they refused to assist. The most enjoyable part of my job was frequent short breaks. It helped the day go by faster than taking a lunch."
bad,"Typical life of a store manager with a twist, You basically live at the store so you have noooo family life. Job is great for a single guy with no life wanting to make peanuts for a salary. They micromanage the heck out of you with monthly inspections and audits monthly. Now they added two monthly inspections to be up in your business even more with micromanaging. Glad to have left company!"
bad,"A lot of politics. No chance for advancement. Some managers don't want you to excel because they feel you will take their job, so they don't want you to learn any more than they know. Pay is very low compared to other stores."
bad,"The management is a joke and they dont treat their employees with any dignity. When they offer you a higher job they dont give you the proper pay raise, they just expect you to work crazy hours for minimum wage."
bad,"The company's policy on part time position needs to be adjusted."
bad,Work is fast paced. They want you to do many things at once and that can lead to stress. The job is easy to do just stressfull
bad,"Kroger only has two things going for it and that's the co-workers and being able to work with a school schedule. The management is slow to respond to needs of the employees, the pay is low, and the reward for the work you put in is also pretty low. I've learned a lot about how to work quickly and adapt to any challenges put in front of me. The hardest part of my job is adapting to new co-workers and the struggle of getting my voice heard from the management. The most enjoyable part of my job seeing the happy faces of customers that I have the pleasure to help and also my co-workers are amazing supportive and caring toward my needs on a friend level."
bad,"Work life balance there isnt any. Young managers hinder company's full advantage. Department has great potential but needs better management to lead them. There needs to be a better process involved for admin workers. posting out takes 2 years with no assistance of a mentorship program,"
bad,"unfair work area, management doesn't solve problems,and supervisors don't do there jobs. no one gets hours and the pay is not good and there is no benefits at all"
bad,very busy place always on the move.the part time hours are not good cause of no payroll.not enough time to finish mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
bad,"Low pay typically minimum wage, will work around a schedule if you're part time, biggest advancement full time at minimum wage, and expect you to give up your life for them aka no such thing as a good excuse to call off work."
bad,"Working conditions at this company was very difficult.  I was put on a position and after 5 minutes of someone helping me I was on my own.  Not what I would call training.  Very serious environment all the time.  That is why I was there but not to the point of not being able to get a drink of water or go to the bathroom..   If the manager said ""NO"" then it meant NO.  Could not handle this type of regimen."
bad,mgmt is terrible and hours are the worst. no team work .....ever. everyone there is negative and hates their job.  pay is terrible also. i felt taken advantage of.
bad,The associates all helped each other. The management team including supervisors were only helpful during orientation. Once on the floor its yourself and the people around you.
bad,"management was always complaining about their workload being too big, so they hand stuff down to me, a part time employee who already has a butt load of things to get done within the short amount of time I am there, and expects me to take on management responsibilities while still being paid minimum wage and less than 20 hours a week. also, they are union, yet when I asked who the store union representative was 3 different employees who have been there over a year said they have never met the person."
bad,maybe the worst job a ever had the the management was never available..co-works was ALWAYS no call no show like I said this was maybe the worst job I ever had
bad,Working for Kroger was the worst experience of my life. I have never worked for people who care so little for their employees. They curse at customers and make everyone look terrible.
bad,"This was by far the most unpleasant place I have ever worked in my life. Despite HR's positive outlook and messages to the associates and management team the Senior Management team cares about nothing more than the bottom line and will do anything necessary to get what they want or feel needs to be done to save a penny. All associates are constantly on edge in fear of being terminated or layed off. "
bad,"Management forces as much as they can on lees-paid employees. Most are lazy and rude, sit in their office all day, and are mad if you even request a bathroom break or have a question. Promise you ""raises"" and ""opportunities"", along with a lot of days off. They lie. Down to 5-6 employees and no help. Too much stress from a part - time job only paying 8.50 an hour, would be different if the promised raise would happen but this company is full of lies and empty promises. Started out as a nice, fun job and turned into a terrible stressful situation. No full time opportunities or benefits, and very few advancement opportunities, low pay, low future, just a dead end job."
bad,hard place to work. management is incompetent..ALL the way to the top. they don't care about you and the union just sucks you dry. insurance is good though. decent benefits.
bad,"Employees are very rude, many duties to perform for min wage."
bad,Usually began with counting cashiers and inventory. I answered inquiries about kroger plus cards.
bad,I had a very bad experience working with Kroger. It is more of place for teenagers.
bad,A typical day at krogers for me would be at the cashier station all day for about 4 to 8 hours. I learned how to co-operate with customers and help satisy there needs. The management was ok. If i had to give advise on how to make management better i would tell them to organize better. My co-workers i enjoyed them it felt like i was right at home. The hardest part of the job would be nothing. Everything was easy. My enjoyable part of the job was being a cashier.
bad,I have been working there for 2 years and I have been asking for floor supervisor position a little over year now and they gave it to somebody with less seniority and experience. I asked to go to other departments within the store and I got denied so I am unable to advance. The pay raise sucks. I just got my pay raise of 7.60 after a full year. We are not allowed to use the restroom or leave when sick. They forget to give you your breaks and when you ask the walk away. They will hire you part-time and will not give you full time. If you ask for hours they will cut them.
bad,Managers did not help and treated employees very bad. It was my first job and a very bad working enviroment on a day to day basis.
bad,"Working at Ralph's there were no surprises, the same things were done every day and nothing changed. I learned a great deal of life lessons through bonding with my co-workers and having the opportunity to advance taken away from me. In all honesty the hardest part of the job was trying to be appreciated, however that was also the most enjoyable part for me because it was a challenge that I feel like I completed."
bad,"Most of the employees are part time, not to many full time employees. Their has been a freeze on full time employees for years. The only problem I had was with the scheduling. I wanted to obtain another part time job,but due to my schedule that would be impossible. The shcedule comes out on Friday and begin on Sunday, hours varied from 7am to 10pm. As least as 14 hours per week to 26 hours per week. I feel that if maybe they had set scheduled hours, they would not have such a high turn around."
bad,"Horrible management, very immature. High turn around. Unprofessional work environment. Horrible pay. I started at $9.72 an hour and wasn't even at $12.00  after 3 years."
bad,"This was my first job outside of fast food and that i was really happy to have this job.  i was new to the Houston area, i lived in Spring.  My work schedule was fine.  The three weeks i worked, i reported on the graveyard shift.  My work schedule was Sun-Thur,  Friday and Saturday off, return on Sunday night.  I called in one Sunday night, due to me visiting relatives in Cypress and no one would give me a ride home to get ready for work.  i called my manager and he told me ok see you tomorrow.  i went in to work the next night and was told i was terminated.  "
bad,"This job was not what i expected their was no professionalism. The managers had favortism towards certain workers. No room for advancement it was very hot getting carts in summer with bees at garbage cans, and in the return bottle section."
bad,Everyone here is so negative and bitter and grumpy noone likes helping anyone there is no communication..i was almost locked in fulltime until a new srore manager came along and only wanted to give me 18 hours per week i cant support me and my 4 kids on 18 hours a week so i just quit if you need a job fast there is now an opening on night shift
bad,"This job has terrible management, with people who are completely unqualified for any sort of management position being in said positions. There is a horrible seniority scheduling problem, in which you may only get 3 hours a week. In addition, your breaks are always poorly times and incredibly short."
bad,"Unless this is a last resort to find a job I highly advise against it, theres no sort of leadership nor fairness from management to employees. Hours have been getting cut more every week and corporate still expects more from the stores."
bad,"They hardly train you, expect you to know everything. They don’t respect your schedule. There is a lot of codes to remember, and there isn’t much help when you need it."
bad,"The management never talked with you unless they liked you. And when they did they either would discard your concerns and send you back to work. They would also give the people they liked more hours and less to the people they hated. And if you worked that day and they didn't like you they would stick you outside, no rotations."
bad,"I have been a mechanic with kroger in Delaware for 9 months or so. It's easy work but very little work life balance. Your not respected, co-workers are like little kids, supervisor doesn't care about employees and there is no room for progression. Not a good job overall unless you only worry about pay."
bad,"The most enjoyable part of my job is helping people. The company has gone downhill, They no longer care about their employees or customers. They say one thing then do another."
bad,Lots and lots of work for horrible pay. It’s good for a first job but I don’t recommend it. I worked with a bunch of teens who didn’t work at all so I did all the work. It’s not worth it.
bad,Was a terrible work experience You had to be a part of a clique in order to advance.  I had the worst schedule & was often unappreciated & under-valued.
bad,They threaten to and fire people on a monthly basis everyone walks on eggshells here. The new manager is hard to be around. This place treats people as disposable objects
bad,You are just another number no matter how much effort or how good your performance is.  They don't appreciate any of their people or the fact that you put them first to accomplish their goals
bad,"when I worked there, part-time, it was an ok job to work. but the pay was horrible. I did not like working for the same amount as a bagger when I work around dangerous machinery. I have worked for them for 2 years while I was also working another job. at time the company would not let me stay off work when I was legitimately sick and forced me to come in regardless, but showed favoritism towards other employees and accepted their excuse on why they are not coming in. I hated the management and i actually had to beg to be off for my dads funeral."
bad,I've worked for Kroger for 21 years. They just don't appciate people or care if they get family time. They don't look at things as a whole anymore. Ok
bad,"Often times I wouldn't know my working schedule of the next Sunday to Saturday week until I stepped in the previous Saturday. Many days my schedule was changed the day of. I would head into work and be told to go home. Or doing classwork at home being called in to fill in for a shift. I was often thrown from department to department contrary to the schedule given to me. This never felt as though it was the fault of those who made my schedule, as the various assistant managers were the glue that held the store together. The true problem lies with the store's head manager and the size of the store. The store was too small to schedule enough Kroger representatives to compensate for the rush hours as when there's no business, there would have been a lot of employees with nothing to do. working for the company was very taxing on my health as a type one diabetic, as I often had to forsake my break for a few hours of my shift to ensure my department met Kroger's satisfactions. This resulted in several agonizing moments of incredibly low blood sugar."
bad,"Kroger is racial and company oriented. --for the betterment of Kroger"
bad,They start you at minimum wage regardless of your experience. Expect you to do the work of 2 or 3 people. Then ask you why you can't get your job done.
bad,From the beginning I could tell this place was a jumbled mess. None of the store managers are ever available to do their jobs. Getting in touch with Human Resources was almost always a NO-GO. I've had many people (myself included) who have been shorted money on paychecks due to lack of financial management. They want you to fail and I would recommend to look elsewhere.
bad,"Loved coaching and teaching others"
bad,"4 different store managers in 2 years "
bad,The hardest part of the job was working under my front end manager. She put a tremendous amount of stress on myself and other coworkers. Aswell as continuously threatening to fire me for petty reasons.
bad,"Kroger does not pay adequately for the required work. They are entirely inflexible about work hours and show little to no regard for their employees' own lives. The employees themselves are very friendly and cooperative most of the time, however upper management can be extremely manipulative and insensitive."
bad,"The job is okay. They higher extra people and dont give the people that are already there the hours. They love to give people management jobs without the pay. Starbucks is where i worked and the manager there did nothing but complain. She would threaten to quit but never did, and was rude to the customers."
bad,"Always understaffed, doesn't care about the employee health or well being, management is uncaring, customers can be great, but normally are just as stressed as the employee which makes them not very understanding, company goals are unrealistic"
bad,"Management showed favoritism. Refused to train me like they trained another employee. And our me in the front end for apparently rolling my eyes at a customer, which if he felt that he saw that he would have said so right then, and when they need my help asked me if I was ready to come back as though I was a child put on punishment. Thank you next."
bad,"The only reason I'm still working for Krogers is benefits. There is little opportunity to advance unless you brown-nose your way to the top. For those of us that do the dirty work and work hard, there is no chance to move up."
bad,"Have to search for l-carts to work off of, have to pull your own product to floor, have to be able to lift up to 50 pounds sometimes over your head. They do not tell you important things you need to know before hiring inand what all your job intails you to doin a certain amount of time"
bad,A typical shift at frys is very fast paced. More often than not work load is heavy because they are short handed. The hardest part of the job would be covering for absent employees.
bad,They do not care to have a work/ life balance. Its okay as a first job for High schoolers or a Summer job for College students etc. But defiantly not a place for someone who wants to build there selfs with a company
bad,"When you first start out you’re excited but then you realize everyone’s just there for money, nothing more. I worked at 2 different locations and management was horrible at both. No one really cares about dress code as long as you have a blue shirt on. You get a 15 minute break for working any shift under 6 hours and a 30 minute break for working any shift over 6 hours and they DO NOT hesitate to call you back early. Scheduling is a complete mess. All of my CSMs were HORRIBLE at scheduling. We always had to fight each other for hours. And the worst part was that every shift we were either understaffed or overstaffed, never in between because no one knew how to schedule people."
bad,I can only base my opinion on the location where I was employed. The management was very unprofessional. They were inconsistent with scheduling. They didn't seem too concerned about their associates.
bad,"No training for someone coming in the industry, no leadership development,  no support from management, no advancement opportunities,and poor communication from all departments.  HIGH TURNOVER RATE  FROM SENIOR MANAGEMENT TO SPECIALIST"
bad,It can be a little hard specially if you are lower rank person but it can be OK i don't recommend it unless you can be hard like stone and not care about anything but the job
bad,"For 15 years I had so much pride working for Kroger in Cincinnati. The last 3 have been a complete embarrassment and frustrating. Rodney has taken Barney Kroger's life work and turned it into a joke. Rodney and his time as president of Kroger will be the cautionary tale our kids hear in economics class. Daily threats, bullying and being degraded. Followed up with 60+ hour work weeks and 6 days a week. Vacations cancelled or shortened.  There is no work life balance when you can and will be called back to work at anytime if they are not happy with you store. Staffing cut ove the last 3 years but more work added. He tells the media he's added,  he has add ecommerce add taken away regularly from the existing departments.  Management has been reduced by as much as 33% per store, but work load increased."
bad,I’ve worked in different environments this is my first job in retail if your a people person and like receiving a paycheck apply now. It’s an easy job
bad,Kroger used to be a good company. There has been a change for the worse over the last few years and I believe it will be acquired or sold in the next couple of years.
bad,There is never enough staff scheduled to allow for a productive work experience. There are never enough hours to allow adequate staffing and ensure all employees receive enough hours to cover living expenses.
bad,Sidney Kroger’s is not a good store to work for.  Management does not care about their employees!!!!!   None of them even know your name. I’ve been there 4 years.   People are  quitting all the time. No organization in this store!!!!    No communication??????
bad,"I worked there for 2-3 weeks, in that three weeks one of the people stopped showing up, the assistant manager took off on vacation that the whole department wasn’t prepared for, and the manager asked me if I was interested in moving to a managerial position then. Huge lack of coordination or organization in the whole department."
bad,"You will rarely have an off day because they always try to call you in on your days off. When getting carts you are by law to only be out there for an hour on hot days, and they will keep you out there as long as they please."
bad,Well at first I loved it.  I thought I was investing in my future.  Then I realized that you are just a number to them.  They want you to maintain a running pace and for minimum wage.  Wanting a crazy amount of work done in a small amount of time.  Oh and No overtime!
bad,It’s ok for a first job but I wouldn’t recommend it. The managers suck and won’t be flexible for you unless you’re going to school then they will give you certain days off.
bad,"No work life balance, no communication and poor wages. You are not treated as a person and upper management does not care about anything but numbers. They say customers first what they mean is Paperwork and money first."
bad,The store I worked at was a mess at all times no one wanted to work together. Mangers never answer there phone. No help what so ever people don’t want to work
bad,"I have worked at Kroger for 2.5 years, I make barely enough to pay my sitter every week to watch my kids. Someone who had been there less time than me is making 15.50 after union raises this month, I wont even be at 11.50"
bad,"Here's some advice for those looking at Kroger as a job opportunity: If you want condescending, belittling, unappreciative managers lording over your every move, then this company is right for you. Of the 3 years there, I was only advanced to a different department once, got trained in a different state for said department, never got travel compensation, had my hours reduced, and was treated like I shouldnt have gotten the promotion in the first place. "
bad,My experience was managers harrassing you to quit every day.. I worked there 8 months didnt get a raise. They play favs. All the managers are bipolar.
bad,It wasn’t the place it’s self. It was fairly relaxed and a simple job. I had a good chill manager that helped me when I needed it and was respectful. But they was a manager that was completely rude to workers and customers. Some of the people hired there was not all there and I had to do their job for them sometimes(which wasn’t the biggest of deals) but just made it stressful at times.
bad,"Not a good company to work for, promises are made and I decide early in to join the union. However the union failed me, they didn’t fight for me. It was a waste of thousands of dollars — they do offer decent benefits. Some management are great people others though you really have to make sure you watch out for you. No one is taking the time to do that for you. "
bad,"If it doesn't benefit the company they will not work around it at all that's the only true reason why I left. I was in the department of fuel, and I had a very lazy supervisor when I would open in the morning the employee bathroom was trashed!!!!!!!! Trash wasn't dumped so all the pumps by the trash cans were overflowing!!"
bad,"Get blamed for others mistakes even when you're not there."
bad,"Minimal training, promoted fast, no room for growth after that. Worked in fuel center. Got the cap on pay after a year. If I wanted more money they told me I'd have to go on the store be cut down to 15 hrs a week and bumped back down to minimum wage."
bad,"I have worked at Kroger 4 times:"
bad,"Managers treat there employees as if they are dirt on the bottom of their shoes. The environment is toxic no one wants to work their and is shown in what they do at work.  No one in the store know anything. You can’t rely on managers to not lie to you.  You could be the best employee, all the customers have nothing but great things to say about you, your fellow employees could love working with you. But! Once again Kroger does not care about you.  This last  Christmas at my store the upper management came though and threw candy at us. Yeah that was it no thanks, no conversation not even eye contact!"
bad,"they work part time employees like full time. always declined time off unless you had high seniority. hours they gave took up your whole day i.e 1-10, 3-12am"
bad,"i have to work six days a week and most of my shifts are only 5 hours"
bad,"Terrible  place to  work, highly  stressful, management does not back up its  employees  even when they are  being  harrassed by a customer or threatened they tend to blame the employee."
bad,"This company has a tendency to hire new people and pass over their more experienced workers. The company is not flexible when it comes to scheduling,  choosing to rely on seniority.  I have had to provide documentation for each missed shift. There is no sick pay until after two years of being employed there, and vacation time is not given until after a year. All in all, a poor place to work."
bad,The management at my location is horrible. Since I been working there they done hired/fired about 4 different mangers. The managers treat us very bad.
bad,I have worked for Kroger for 5 years. It has gone down hill.  They treat their employees like dogs and let their customers do whatever they want. If you move to a new store they take away your pay and you start from scratch.  They do not care about your family life or health and ignore requests for time off.  This is not a pleasant place to work at all.
bad,"Pay is low, fellow workers are friendly but there are barely and hours given and there always screaming for help up front. not to mention by the time i left i was getting only 4hrs a week and would have to rely on being called in. even then that wasn't always reliable. I could barely pay my bills!"
bad,One day these two grown men came to my registrar and wouldn't leave because they wanted my number. I was not willing to do so they would not leave. I tol my manager about it and she did nothing about it. I did not feel safe. It took for a customer to step and call the police.
bad,"Worked for this company for five years, only got promoted to a cashier, and from that, was not able to be promoted, because management wanted to have their favorite workers have priority to not only the weekly allotted hours, but also higher positions such as supervisors, and front desk workers. Leaving the rest of us to have the ""left over hours"" which were maxed at 30 for a week, IF you were lucky. Just an overall corrupt company, who would rather hire new workers, than give their experienced workers the pay and hours they deserve for their hard work."
bad,"Cut throat leadership with favoritism who you like kind a culture."
bad,I did not enjoy working here. Nothing I ever did was good enough. They made me a customer service clerk but left me up there by myself after one day of training and without the passwords that I needed to do my job properly. If I had more hours then the person above me did he could take some of my hours no matter how many that left me
bad,The management at my location was terrible. Unwilling to work with people's schedules. Inflexible hours. The culture was terrible and no one there was happy in their jobs.
bad,Poor training and lack of follow up training. Broken equipment that never gets fixed. Be expected to be a bathroom janitor while you are scheduled as a front end cashier handling food. Not enough cashiers scheduled. No support in customer service to handle work load.
bad,"There is lack of communication with the managers. You don’t get a break at the fuel center unless you call for one(which is very useless). You’re stuck in a small kiosk for hours by yourself. If something happens at the fuel center, you’re on your own because the managers don’t know anything about fuel. Customers are really annoying and rude, especially when it comes to fuel points. There would always be something not working and it would barely get fixed."
bad,Deli management did not know what it was doing at any time. Went months short handed and when they finally hired someone else the person would call in every other day which seemed like it was ok with everyone else since they would have me cover for them.
bad,"My experience at Kroger was not a positive experience. Supervisors were unfair towards me and other co-workers in the store. The issues that I tried to talk about with management were never solved. Overall I wouldn't recommend this location to friends. Hopefully, management and how they operate improves for future employees."
bad,"I currently work as a Deli closer, I slice meats and cheeses, as well has handling rotisserie chicken and fried chicken, However, my store only staffs 2 regular closers and 5 regular morning clerks, they also refuse to give more hours to support additional closers, in fact seem more set on taking hours away. The management at my store is strict, and its their way or the highway, regardless of if it puts you behind, but if it does put you behind, you still have to be out of their by shifts end, no overtime is allowed. Training is nonexistent and food storage and quality is abominable. Additionally, there is no room for advancement, and even after 2 and a half years as a deli clerk, i only make $8.75, I've gone up 25 cents a year."
bad,"Lots of changing expectations based on a perfect environment and not taking into account everyday barriers. Lots of good people and customers, not much work life balance"
bad,terrible and stressful and the mangers made fun of my disability and they were bad at giving breaks way unorganized. and when it cam to carts the employees always stayed on their phone while I did all the work
bad,"Management is a joke here, if you speak up in this company you get punished, bonuses are not based on departments, it's based on the whole store, it's just a joke company"
bad,". Kroger has a very low hourly rate compared to Meijer's, Walmart,etc."
bad,I worked at the Fred Meyer's Deli for almost a year and by the time I left only three of the original twenty employees who were there when I started were still employed there. We got three or four different managers over the year and were constantly training new people because no one ever stayed for more than a few months(mostly because of poor management).
bad,"I worked for krogers all of 8 months and did not enjoy it at all. The main reason for this is because of the abysmal management who act like they could care less about there workers, other than that the job was okay but I still would not recommend someone to work here."
bad,"Always short-staffed, have to work in other departments to compensate for not enough associates scheduled, not flexible in schedules or when time off is needed, and management is not caring."
bad,"Long hours, 24/7 always attached to the company, even while on vacation.  Little or no recognition, you are only as good as your last few weeks dictate.  Upper management in logistics is extremely political, if you aren't a favorite, be prepared to waste away with little support."
bad,"This job almost singlehandedly brought back my panic attacks."
bad,Management will always blame you for the problems in the store or your department. An a typical work day will always include mad people that can't get what they want and in the end you'll be to blame. But if you like to help and don't care about people and what they say then work for Krogers.
bad,Poor Management of employees. Pay is not equal to the work required. Was required to work non-standard shifts.No room for advancement and not a friendly place to work.
bad,"Kroger distritbution was not my favorite place to work, as they cram everyone together and let them fight it out to pick the orders you need to fill. With limited room, and tons of people trying to fill orders, it becomes a terrible environment to work in."
bad,This was a high school - college job. They got hard worker and I received a paycheck. this company is not the best from the experiences I had there. Id hope others had better ones.
bad,"There are too many expectations in place that are unrealistic.  You are expected to get the job done and stay to get it done even on your off days.  Hardly no work/life balance.  The company values the associates more than their management staff with little to no recognition or incentives.   Positions sometimes to come up for only certain people to have ""something"" to do.  Next to impossible to get into HR and you are practically given one direction to go if you want to advance and that is to become an assistant manager at a store or stores that they see fit.  Moves are made very last minute which can jeopardize your home life and they do not care."
bad,They expect the bare minimum or less to stock the entire store every night with the least amount of overtime. Some shift leader don’t work but take credit for other employees work.
bad,The department I work in which is meat at store #529 is great but the management here is horrible and ran by an adult child. If she doesn’t like you or you don’t do what she says she becomes petty and childish like telling other managers to give you extra work to do and to “be mean” to us. She also has her “pets” who run around the store and try to hook up associates with other associates while trying to ask questions about your dating/personal life.
bad,"some of the front end supervisors were quite rude, they fired a new girl in under a week for not smiling enough. and wouldnt adhear to some employees health"
bad,Hard to get along with and not willing to work with you unless they benefit. Felt like they did not care about your opinion or happiness. Very negative work environment.
bad,"If you ever have to start out working minimum wage (most likely, you will), don't ever work here. EVER. Managers are bossy and self-righteous, money-hungry, and power-seeking. They all want to satisfy the customer, which is what I did so much, every day I worked. There was a particular manager that had it out for me. She didn't like me - I know that she probably wouldn't admit it - and she'd blame me for things in which I had no involvement. The store manager had an attitude that was unprofessional and childish - he asked to do an impossible deed. There are other jobs that pay minimum wage but have more respectful and professional managers."
bad,"Working for Kroger was a difficult job for all of the wrong reasons. Immediate co-workers were usually pleasant enough, but upper management frequently failed to address store problems and oftentimes contributed to them."
bad,"Just awful. Bad pay, bad work environment, poor work ethic from employees, unintelligent management. I would never recommend anyone I know to work at Kroger."
bad,"The work/life balance is never an option. Senior HR leadership is not about the people, but more self serving. Not to be trusted. Very political environment."
bad,This company does not care if you have  previous experience and basically start you off with the minimum as anybody else. Always doesn’t have enough staff working in the front end. Customers get mad at us for not having enough crew  working in the registers.
bad,I worked for two Kroger stores and it really depends on the management around you how your time goes. There is no such thing as regular full-time unless you're management or have been there a while. Kroger is run by it's career part-time people.
bad,"Mostly typing all day (days got long), manager didn't like too much talking or interaction with other employees ( seemed pretty ""touchy""). On-the-job training for the whole group together--sometimes hard o see with the whole bunch together.  Had to meet their guideline, and qualifications thru the Arnold Group working at Kroger/Dillions stores."
bad,"Working in the deli department, you have a long checklist to do while on your shift. However, you are paid pennies for the amount of work you do and it is very stressful. The good thing about working here is that you get paid breaks."
bad,"I did not enjoy this job at all. Eight dollars isn't enough to be paid just to ring up products and to be told how awful of a person you are just because you are doing a service for them, the customer."
bad,"You will work your tail off for 9-10 hours only to have a manager come in and tell you how terrible your performance is. You will be expected to do the work of 5-7 people with a crew of 3. You will be expected to perform the functions of a manger, for base pay. When a job advancement opportunity opens, you will not get an opportunity unless you are part of the click that management likes, both inside and outside of work, regardless of your performance and abilities."
bad,Management does very little for the workers. Hours and scarcely given and pay rate is not guaranteed. More than once I've been shorted on my checks. Hours can be taken by anyone above you in the system.
bad,"A typical day consists of approximately 5 or 6 associates taking on approximately 70+ orders. All associates are expected to have a task to complete at all times and, more often than not, breaks are not given. While I learned how to better deal with customers and their concerns, I do not want to continue working in this environment. Management takes ""customer first"" a little too seriously and a lot of the employees quit because of it. The turnover rate is sky high and the store itself is seemingly hopelessly understaffed. The department I work in is expected to fulfill more orders with fewer employees AND fewer hours because management continually cuts hours throughout the store, merely because another store, which has the number of employees needed, has better numbers. When I started working in that department, I was working approximately 40 hours every week, standing for 8 hours straight, for almost minimum wage. Another issue is the union that the store is a part of. Union recruiters would show up and pressure people into ""joining."" Essentially, a chunk of your paycheck is going to this union and you receive zero benefit."
bad,This place will crush your soul and leave you feeling alone and useless. The programs rolled out are half assed and poorly communicated and expectations are so high you're afraid of asking for help
bad,"Go in on time start bagging and then start other duties including cleaning bathrooms, mopping office and bottle return. Management did their part and ran the store quite alright. Workplace culture was fun. There wasn't really anything hard about this job. I enjoyed talking and helping out customers/"
bad,"the management is abusive, screaming at me. poor communication skills in management, poor"
bad,"Breaks? Haha! Doesn't happen. Consistent schedule? Nope. Union is a joke. It might be OK for a high school kid, because state laws mandate breaks and hours. For an adu5,all bets are off."
bad,The President of my division was very poor and into it for themselves and not the team. The made for a poor work environment. Last I hear the President was fired.
bad,"The other people working at the store were, (for the most part), nice and caring. On the other hand, the managers were absolutely horrible when it came to treating the staff with any form of respect. It did not pay well, even for the area, and the hours were horrible. They purposely would schedule people for 1 hour under the time limit for part time, so that they would not have to give benefits."
bad,"The Kroger on Hwy 278 is always been know to be racist,they have gotten better over the years, but the roots are still there,don't work here unless you have too."
bad,"There was always way more to be done than 1 person could handle. If someone you were scheduled to close with called out and nobody else was available to come in they expected 1 employee to be able to do the work of 2 or 3 employees no matter what and without extra pay. The hours were minimal, everyone was part time because the company didn't want to have to offer anyone benefits."
bad,The morale and the disorganization is lacking extremely. I am unable to work to my full potential with this company. The hardest part of the job was being unable to communicate with managers on a daily due to them being unavailable at all times. The most enjoyable part of the job was making friends with the customers and co-workers.
bad,If you want a job that just pays this is for you. You'll get your small weekly check that'll be gone before the next week's check. Don't expect much of a raise since its a quarter every 6 months. You're lucky to get a competent manager who doesn't have a favorite. If you do decide to work here at least avoid the front end and deli. Managers are always hounding you there even if you're doing what they ask. And if you do what they ask you're doing it wrong anyway so soon enough they'll tell you to do it another way. Baggers are just bodies to them and its the same with cashiers. Supervisors are paid the same amount as cashiers for 10 times the amount of work.
bad,I got frostbite from cutting frozen meat.   I cut my fingers and hands several times and had to go to the emergency room.  The people there dont really care.
bad,A typical day at work is doing what is asked of me and some. What I learned is to be more productive and orderly. Time management is key. The most enjoyable part of the day is I gain more and more knowledge about working in retail.
bad,During my work experience at Kroger I learned the meaning of bad management. Since I started my job at this location there has been multiple mangers within the company that have no regard for the employees.
bad,"I started this job very optimistic under a great manager. It was a very green environment but our team and specifically manager went against the grain of a now red culture."
bad,I love my job at Kroger but I need something with more stable hours and more pay.  I also need something with advancement possibilities.  It is a great job and I love the customers and the people I work with.
bad,Maintaining stock and display of deli product. Serving customers and fulfilling their specific orders to their standard.reading temperatures on produce and labeling.
bad,"Slow paced, boring job, with good people. At Dillions the people that I worked with were the best thing about my store. the worst things  out weighed them."
bad,"Management was never on time, never listened to his employees ideas, always passed work onto others. no communication with employees, and when communication did happen it was only to tell employees what they lack not how to improve"
bad,The company has a union option but it doesn't help any. You do pay union dues to be in. Management changes rules day to day to suit them. Avoid store 374 at all costs. They play favorites & penalize you for standing up for yourself or even contacting the union for policy violation. The only way to get full time is to have open availability 6am-11pm 7 days a week. If you don't average 24 hers a week in a calendar year then you don't get any medical benefits
bad,"A typical day working for Kroger Pharmacy was short and taunting. I learned how to communicate with customers in person, how to stock medication and work cash register locating correct customer for drive thru and inside sales. The management allowed inappropriate treatment of customers by other employees. The culture at Kroger Pharmacy was not professional or respectable to customers. The hardest part of my job was being associated with such behavior. The most enjoyable part of my job was I was doing what I loved and that was working with customers providing service to help and serve. The Kroger that I worked for had a Starbucks in the store, so that was awesome."
bad,Certain employees were allowed to participate in and continue in behavior which are considered hostile and intimidating in any work environment.  Kroger works to ensure Kroger's benefit and not the employees well being.
bad,They expected a lot from you .You get hired for one job and ten million jobs to do  and get paid very low salary. They never have help . This job was the most stressful job ever. The customers are beyond rude and disrespectful .
bad,"The best thing about working for Kroger was the ""all in this together"" mentality. Fellow employees looked out for each other and were always ready to lend a hand. However poor working conditions and unfair treatment made this a very high stress, low reward career. Management were nearly always looking out for themselves and could not care less if you were unwell, struggling to complete your work, overworked, or even, in many instances, injured. Favoritism was rampant and it was nearly impossible to advance to full time."
bad,I had a manager tell me to cook expired chicken or I would lose my job. I was promoted early so I could easily be fired for lack of knowledge in my position. Did not offer proper training. To any department.
bad,Kroger New Haven Indiana is a very poorly run store with no sense of leadership. Department heads have no education on how to operate a department correctly.
bad,"I like the people that I work with, It depends on the day, you never know what the day is going to be like, until you enter the store and clock in for the day.  I love the people I work with, but there will always be ""clicks"" of those that have been there for a long time."
bad,"At this particular location, the manager was a first time manager in her position. I feel it was a little much for her. She did her best. The sales was not often, and compensation was not well enough of pay."
bad,"Pays minimum wages.  No holiday pay.  Inconsistent hours."
bad,"cut throat, bullying,  management has a blind eye(s), turnover rate and employee compassion for the customer is lost, Employees just act as drones waiting for check. I'm very sad."
bad,"I had two supervisors and they never got along, they would always set each other up for failure, and nothing got done properly because they could never agree on anything."
bad,Becareful working for kroger....not everyone is safe by the union. Its full of drama and ran poorly by management. 2 hours of overtime almost everynight due to people's poor work ethics. They have favoritism and only let certain people get the good jobs.
bad,"You do not get paid much at all and you have to do a lot of training just to get paid a little more, which still does not amount to anything. There is no way you can live on your own and pay bills with just this job. It is more for people who need experience to get into either pharmacy school or medical school."
bad,They start out saying they work around your life after you been there a year then they want you to work when they want you. If you can't work when they want you then they start cut your hours. You do have good days and you have your bad days. You can learned somethings there but not a lot. The management are not nice and don't care about you or your life. The hardest part of the job if you see something you know it should not be happen and you can't say anything because if you do they are going to do anything about it. The enjoyable part about the job you might see something or some one might say something that will make you laugh.
bad,"The job is good for a first job or a high school job, maybe even the beginning of college. However when you actually have to pay bills you will be scraping by, slowly accumulating debt."
bad,I like working at Kroger however I wound up doing 2-3 jobs for low pay. I would not recommend kroger to anyone that is looking to just get a paycheck.
bad,i liked the job at first but there was no flexiablity nor consideration for outside priorities. There was also no communication among the staff. They would hire you and tell you you're full-time but give part-time hours
bad,"Kroger is a mediocre employment opportunity. The pay is not that great, employees do not receive sick time, and management is poor. No real social interaction between mid level employees and management. Overall I would not recommend Kroger as a place to work."
bad,"Kroger is a clean warehouse with a marketing strategy to maximize profits (as it should). It is a great foundation for individuals interest in operations, sales strategy, marketing or business aspirations"
bad,"I would recommend people to work at certain stores. When you first start everyone is so nice but as they get used to you they will try and plot, especially if they see you a hard worker. Everybody will want you to do something for them just because they see you breaking your back and it's not fair to you. They have jobs to do to but at kroger, maybe all krogers, seniority beats a hard worker. It's not fair for a hard worker to get paid less than somebody who's been there for a long time to just sit on their fat face."
bad,I wouldn't work there ever again even if its different now and a new company bought them out . I had a bad experience with them and i wouldn't go back and i wouldn't suggest any to work at pick n save.
bad,Kroger attracts many people to their low paying jobs due to lack of education and treats employees like trained monkeys. Low pay and negative working environment.
bad,Disrespectful treatment from manager. New hires getting paid two dollars more. Short breaks. Filthy break room. Do not enforce hygiene rule which males for working alongside some coworkers unpleasant.
bad,Management never suppots its workers and union is good for nothing but takingyour money if u go to manager about issues u will be told its bwing1 investigated yet not helped i was Physically assulted by a coworker and was let go while they were kept on. No consideration for personal tragedy if your house catches fire and u call in u can be fired.
bad,"The pay is poor and the expectations are too high. Many of the employees are great to work with, but the management isn't as professional as they should be."
bad,Don't schedule enough staff to cover the busy times of day then complain to you that you aren't making enough effort to make it work. They pay dirt and expect the world from you.
bad,Kroger does not pay well as a full time or part time employee. the management at the store i worked at did not care about the overall happiness of its employees.
bad,"I worked at the Dillons on 4th. Not much positivity flowing through here. Job was simple, however, they did not accommodate my needs as a full time student and didn't respect my needing to take time off to study for upcoming exams and finals, as school is VERY important to me. Managers don't know what they're doing as far as how to run a store efficiently while maintaining positive employee morale."
bad,"this job is okay for someone in high school, not much beyond that. the union doesn't really serve a purpose and the pay is awful, and if you are anything less than a supervisor they don't really go to bat for you."
bad,Typical day workin here is fast paced non stop in my department. Job is very easy and do able. Just dont feel like this is the place to help provide beyond my needs
bad,difficult to work with management.  Communication lacking.  benefits worsening with each new contract.  Luck and politics is needed for advancement more than skill.
bad,Management is terrible to their employees.  Some have tried to get me fired in the pas and don't care if you work their or not.  Beware of working at Frys Food and Drugs.
bad,"Poor management, Poor Leadership they dont care anything. The company is always making stupid chances. The hire manager doesnt care about anything sad"
bad,Kroger is no different  from any other company..I com to work to take care of my responsibility so I take pride in my j  because without it I wouldn't survive
bad,I learned how to manage stress while I was there due to the fact is was a major and heavy influence on us. I managed to learn many ways to help satisfy angered guests. The hardest part for me is when our upper management would seem to not care how busy we were and just add on tasks which just increased our shrink that night.
bad,"no overtime allowed, not enough hrs. to get job done, not enough help.  one store I worked at did nothing for the employees, at another store I worked at we were always being rewarded with free lunches"
bad,I wish I had a nickel for every time I got yelled at for things that weren't my fault. I was constantly criticized for not putting out product. The kicker was that I didn't put it out because we hadn't received any on the shipment which was MANAGEMENT'S job
bad,in order to get anywhere in the system you have to be off the right ethnic background and type of person.  if you aren't that then you ain't got a chance
bad,Everyday of work was a new day and could either be boring and annoying or chilll and nice. It is a union so good luck ever getting an advancement. The management made things stressful when they don't listen to what you have your schedule set to.
bad,Kroger has no respect for their employees. Low starting pay and pay raises are set at a dime after a year. The only chance to advance in pay is to be management which is an even worse job
bad,Held a job that other leaders where getting paid over 16.00 when i made less than half that pay sclae and i was held to the same standerd. i was treated like a seconed class huaman
bad,This job may have been more bearable if it wasn't for the hateful attitude the management addressed every slightest mistake that was made. This job at the Beavercreek location is a definite pass.
bad,Kroger was my first job and proved to be a great learning experience. The biggest downfall is that sometimes requests or complaints seem to fall upon deaf ears.
bad,"things have been changing for the worst very rapidly. lots of lies and unnecessary pressure, direction changes weekly. i ended up there when they purchased my previous employer, i wish i had not come on board"
bad,"I was told by the store manager I would get close to 40hrs, at least 30 to 35 and I was cool with that but I never got even close. Then I was told by my manager I would only get the left over hours. I'm like what the heck?"
bad,"I was responsible for getting all of the carts from the parking lot, bagging all of the customer's groceries, and for keeping the front of the store clean. I was paid minimum wage, and the pay raises were a joke. Every year you got a ten cent raise."
bad,I was excited about the job. I left the company for a better paying job. The experience taught me a lot about people in a public scene. The company has competitive prices.
bad,"This store claims do be a big family as they treat everybody like family. When they really treat you like the long distance relative they no one cares about. They try keep you in a part time position so they don't have to give you a raise. "
bad,"Very poor place to work. Bad management,many horrible co-workers. Many people miserable no matter what department. This company has billions but will only start people at the federal lowest payscale guideline. Publix at least starts what people are worth or/and above federal minimums. Job culture was so bad,turnover rate is exceptional. Some HR personnel like management were very condescending and rude,even when employees are asking for clarification or help. Most enjoyable some(3) co workers and getting out of there. Some co-workers were racially harassed with management turning a blind eye due to friendship."
bad,"Great Company"
bad,The pay for this job is terrible. They don't list the starting pay until after you sign papers. They work you hours that don't even amount to a good check.
bad,"Unionized company that keeps you stuck"
bad,"I feel employees are undervalued and underpaid. If you're not a full time employee it's not worth while to stay with the company. Was hired for one shift and forced to work another, because no other employee would take that spot. Everytime they would contact me to fill in because someone called off or didn't show, I would be the first one to say yes and help out. However, was still not treated fairly even with all the effort I put in. Even though I was hired on part time, when I requested a specific shift they informed me "" it was a request and they're not obligated to honor it."" I was informed if I was part time prior to hiring that I had more flexibility. Which wasn't the case."
bad,They do not work with your life schedule nor care about your life situations. Always low on staff in the front end. Low pay..............................
bad,"A lot of work to do for one person, if you cant work fast you are forced to learn how. im allowed to take breaks never have time to even if i wanted to take them."
bad,"Kroger is unfortunately a union company, so if you are interested in seeing hard workers burn out and employees that slack off still keep their jobs then welcome aboard. this type of work is great for first time employees just out of high school and the management jobs might be good for those just out of college. These jobs do not have room to grow so I would use them as a brief stepping stone and move on. Work life balance will depend on corporate or store level, as most- a salary position will not lend to a health home life."
bad,"I have quite a bit of time with Kroger and have been treated absolutely awful. Good entry level position, but nothing more than that. There is no life/work balance. Upper management doesn't care about what happens on store level, meanwhile most store management teams are working to help their employees. I have had some not so good managers, but overall store management teams have been helpful. There is always too much work and not enough hours. Corporate likes to add on additional required tasks then give no extra time for them. The people you work with are what matters and with corporate politics, its hard to remember that. They want us to give exceptional customer service, have plenty of product out for customers to buy, but further load us with additional tasks. It is a great place to start out, but after 5 years, it's time to move on. I wish I figured this out a bit sooner."
bad,"unloading trucks, break down pallets of merch, and stock shelves with fresh products for next days sales."
bad,"There is so much wrong with this store, and not just the store I worked at, its all of them. Management and the hirer ups just don't listen to any ideas on how the store could function at a better capacity."
bad,I worked at kroger for almost 6 months. I liked it a lot in the beginning then I got past my 60 days probation ( I was part of a union). Then I started to realize Kroger's true colors. The managers are lazy and the supervisors take there job for granted.
bad,"I have worked there 22 years! I love the people I work with. The job takes away from your personal life and job is difficult and demanding! If you call in with a legitimate sickness and have a legitimate doctors note, they put a guilt on you. They rather have  you there at work getting your fellow Co-workers sick, then calling in and resting and getting better doctors orders"
bad,I love seeing and sharing stories with my regular customers. I enjoy working with the majority of my coworkers. I've made some close friends while working at Kroger. I'm going to miss Kroger but I need to move on to better opportunities
bad,not really interesting to me. expected to much from someone who is a bagger and wasnt what i expected was not very fun or exciting
bad,"The hardest part of the job is, I feel like i am still in school."
bad,The schedule is changed weekly so you don't know when you work and you might not get days off you need. It is a fast pace workplace that has really no training or care for employees. The management really cares about their raises mostly. Some co-workers are easy to get along with for the most part. They show no thanks to the workers who work hard for barely any money. However connecting with the regular customers made me feel like I was making a difference.
bad,"Kroger was not what I would describe as a 'fun, productive environment' it was hard work, with little pay, no benefits unless you worked there full time (which they stopped hiring full time so they could stop giving benefits) with very sorry management"
bad,I was the floor cleaner and it was a hit or miss type of job either equipment was available or it wasn't on site for the night /day. I couldn't wait to get out of there at the time .
bad,"Working for Kroger has been an experience to say the least.  My day consist of Long Hours, Under Paid, Unrealistic expectations.  I can honestly say that I enjoy the relationships I have built, but Kroger out of control."
bad,"i have been at Kroger Corp office for 7 years now. In the past 2 years Kroger has taken steps backward on how they treat associates. When i started i was so happy to be with Kroger and liked the way they treated everyone with respect and dignity. It was truly an honor to work here and at Corp Office. Now it is a different world they are hiring only Interns, falsely reporting retention numbers, sales numbers are no where close to being honest numbers. Benefits have gone down to none existant expect for senior leadership all others are told one thing and another thing is happening."
bad,The days are busy customers are rude sometimes. Depending on the days can be good or bad. the mainly job teaches you good customer care how to deal with everyday people. The most enjoyable part of my job is clocking out.
bad,The management at Kroger's is horrible. The store manager does not handle work situations the way it should be handled. The associates are a bunch of kids that don't want to work.
bad,The store at which i worked was a great place to work but poorly run. The supervisors had not track of time and at times just stood there while customers are lined up on one check out register.
bad,"You are constantly treated like children. You have no say, nor do you ideas matter to them. They do not care about family situations. pay is awful. and no overtime at all . Horrible place to work."
bad,"a typically day would start at 8 and end at 4. i learned how to deal with racist people and how to bag and work at a fast pace, management was poor and the co workers was rude, the hardest part was pushing carts in the cold, the most fun was at night."
bad,"Management is bad at their job and have no care for other employees, but themselves."
bad,Customer. Always right . had i known i would have to work so hard i would have chose a place whos pay matches the labor. The work place is often stressful
bad,"Daily Routine, Same pace daily. However, they do manage to hire a few kind people with which to work alongside during your daily work routine."
bad,"Union never helped me.. i payed $10 a week, left because of how i was treated... work too hard to achieve nothing. Management never communicated with each other, made it a confusing work environment"
bad,"work environment was okay"
bad,I don't mind Kroger it's just hard to move up for some reason. Where I'm at managers don't stay long. Managers get moved a lot some like it some don't
bad,"this was my very first job"
bad,"This job started out steady with decent work hours, after six months of employment i built a healthy relationship with my management and coworkers.  Soon after this I i felt taken advantage of, my manager would call me in to work over time on every day off that i would get in my work schedule, which didn't bother me at first but after months of getting only one day off every two weeks it wore me down.  It got to the point where my manager would pressure me and guilt trip me into working for her when other employees would call in.  normally working overtime would be no problem but once you work an eight hour shift and your manager calls you crying Christmas eve to work an over night double you start to question your management.  Other problems i had were that i was given the responsibility of a manager with no additional pay.  These included taking produce and product orders.  I had no problem taking on these responsibilities as i was hoping to move up in the corporation.  Another problem i had working with this company was the fact that there were new employees making the same as, if not more than me even with my experience.   Other than the off the wall work hours my time with Kroger was pleasant.  My relationship with my coworkers was healthy and we felt like a family.   The most important things i learned working for this company are great time management skills, how to take product orders, and exceptional problem solving skills."
bad,Horrible place to work for. They will move you from days to overnight without your permission. The pay doesnt compensate for the nonsense you have to go thru working there. Moving up with the company seems like a good thing until you actually get a management title and then they own you. 60+hrs a week with everyone calling your personal cell phone at all hours of the day when you are off and getting yelled at by upper management when they dont even know what is going on. They don't get every department enough hours so that anything will actually get done without the manager working 12+hr days. all in all a terrible place to work for. Also be prepared to work every holiday and weekend and if you ask for a day off to stay home with the flu and get the biggest guilt trip of your life.
bad,"My hours are changed randomly every week, mostly without notice. A couple of my checks were missing hours or not entered into the system."
bad,"Most enjoyable part is being able to communication with customers."
bad,"Terrible nasty managers, favoritism, favoritism, favoritism, hate-full crude co-workers, but lovely, lovely customers. And the way Kroger treats their customers is outstanding but the way the employees are treated by management, and the way the employees treat one another is disgraceful, disrespectful, and disgusting."
bad,The pay is terrible and there is no work life balance. There is never enough staff. The management do not listen to workers opinions or ideas.
bad,"If you can manage to make it to a management role, you will be good to go. The managers can do no wrong, where the worker-bees get absolutely no respect, and do all of the work."
bad,"As a new employee the pharmacy manager was not willing to learn my name, speak to me directly (except to be snappy) or train me. Training was delegated to anyone who had a few moments to answer my questions. The rest of the staff was extremely helpful and kind. It is purposely implied that there are more hours, pay and flexibility than there is."
bad,The manager i worked under was extremely biased with undertones of racism. He did not properly motivate the workers and he did not communicate properly with all employees.
bad,Fun work place and somewhat supportive management. I learned something new everyday and when made mistakes they were fixed. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new and old customers and seeing their smiling faces walk through the grocery store. The exciting thing was the update of the remodel of the store 2 years before leaving the store of finding a better job positions.
bad,"If you're thinking of applying for management trainee, please take heed. Your previous experience and value is unwanted here. You must conform to the warped political culture that is Kroger management. It is a terrible place to work. The customers are awesome, and the associates for the most part, work very hard. Yet, they are grossly unappreciated. It's actually a little disturbing how badly they are treated. When you try and voice concern, you are told, ""you are management, don't get involved with them on a personal level."" To me, this is ridiculous. No wonder they're unionized. Hopefully they always will be, because without the union, these people would be treated even worse! I didn't even like unions until I worked for Kroger. Now I understand why they're necessary."
bad,"ok place to work.  Benefits were good, management had annual trips to a resort. Not sure if that is still in affect. Other than that, its a grocery chain full of rude customers."
bad,"a typical day at work starts with a fingerprint clock in. I would then go into the cooled back stock room in produce and once there i would check my book with all the required fruit i sold or had to make. I would count all the fruit i had on shelf, and check the dates of all my packed, cut fruit. I learned a lot about cleanliness in the workplace. Ecolab taught me very much about how things should be kept in the food industry. Management did not care about their employees what so ever. They would push even if you made your sales for the day, they were also very very rude. The hardest part of the job was the strain on the back and neck cutting with a dull knife than management neglected to replace after i had notified them many times about this. Also standing in 30 degrees for 8 hours while conducting your job was not pleasant either. The most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers and the feeling of achomplishment at the end of the day knowing i did my job well."
bad,Being hired for one job but being forced into another just screams mismanagement. Customers can tell by the atmosphere the type of shopping experience they're going to have and people who work there feel the same energy as soon as you reach the parking lot. Grabbing shopping carts can be a simple task however when you're by yourself with a lot full and customers coming and going faster than you can gather carts with help never available it become discouraging especially with management not caring at all. That in itself is the most miserable part of the day and the job just the lack of support but the criticism that comes with it on a daily.
bad,I am 23 years old and it was my first job. I have two kids under the age of five and I also have medical issues. I didn't work there long cause they let me go do to me having issues with my children and my health. Another thing that made me upset is that my second day on the job the had me working from 2pm to 9pm and I closed by myself. The person I was being trained by was not good at all and I did mostly everything on my own.
bad,"While I was working there, there were 2 new store managers, 4 other area managers transferred in and out of there, and you were lucky if you got 15 hours a week, and would not let anyone become full time. Overtime was never an option, and managers were the ones spreading the rumors. Pay was always minimum wage."
bad,Job is repetitive. Its a job so no reason to complain. Only problem is the managers and their inability to respect their coworkers.
bad,"Busy, people coming to store to get dinner for families. I learned how to communicate with people and my employers. Hardest part of job trying to help every single person get in and out. The most enjoyable thing was meeting new people."
bad,"You go to a training center to learn things that you could learn on the job. That's the first bogus part, the 2nd bogus part is that as a bagger you can't receive a pay raise. Meaning you stay at 7.25 forever. The front end manager hardly advances people from bagging positions so have fun!"
bad,Management plays favorites. The only positive feedback received is no feedback at all. Nothing was ever done good enough. Lazy co-workers were never disciplined.
bad,Slow Day pretty boring. Nothing I learned from Management. Co-Workers some are okay. Hardest part pulling the shopping carts on busy days. Most enjoyable nothing actually.
bad,My typical day was working the trucks three days a week. Helping customers and helping the front end by taking customers on the register. My manager wasn't much help for me. Loved my co workers were helpful and fun to work with. My hardest part of my job was trying to move up in the company and wasn't able to. The most enjoyable was helping customer with all their needs.
bad,"The managers get bonuses according to how fast you move.  They say things to you like "":move faster"" and ""keep moving""  If you are there for a while you will come to understand they have a system of keeping track of how many customers had to wait.  It is very stressful because so many people quit and leave you understaffed.  SO often you are left to check and to bag enormous amounts of groceries.  It will not matter if you are taking a small amount of time with someone with disabilities; they do not care.  They want you to get that person out of the way and on to the next.  I hated this place with a passion."
bad,"Store managers are expected to work 10 hour days and work 2 swing shifts. Managers are also expected to outperform their sales staff while conducting business operations as well."
bad,No Comment about this job. I didn't work there very long. All it taught me was that the Kroger Union needs to be worked on.
bad,"work a minimum of 9 hours per day, usually end up being a 12 hour day, 6 days a week. Most of the leadership are lacking a strong work ethic and push the work off on the those who do. most of the day is spent baby sitting associates who don't want to be there.  People who are not qualified but have a bubbly personality are promoted over those who understand the business and are more qualified.  Salary is less than any other grocery retailers even though they claim to be competitive."
bad,"Messy, poor paid and overworked position. No opportunity for advancement, especially if the management does not want you to advance."
bad,"Typical day at work come to work in the year I  have worked there I have never missed a days work never been late worked every weekend and Holiday "
bad,"When I started at Kroger I was 30-39 hours a week and was not attending school. When I decided that I wanted to go back to school and further my education I was cut to 20-24 hours a week. I made $7.40 an hour and had to pay my bills and for school. There was a raise that came through the union that I never received but people who had not been there as long as I had received it. "
bad,"I like dealing with customers different ones daily. Too many kids working and playing around."
bad,I would clean and cut the fruit and vegetables.  Mix and make all of the salads and dips.
bad,"I only worked here for a short time but it was one of the worst experiences I had. Management was unprofessional, and did nothing all day but walk around the store and let other employees do their work for them."
bad,Retail duties of varying responsibility. From deli work to grocery department.
bad,"12 to 20 hour days, not much recognition, not much encouragement, and not a lot of long term commitments from the company."
bad,"A day at work consisted off cooking,cleaning, cashiering, food prep and log entries all with one person at a time. We had no help due to management hour being thin, and over worked due to the fact we had to serve customers cook clean and logs with no help. "
bad,Company does not care about their employees. The District Advisor and Regional manager micromanage all aspects of the store operations.
bad,"Pick N Save will continuously push you to work harder but will always make you feel as if it weren't good enough. The co-workers there are ok, if you have a poor co-worker management will do nothing to improve their work habits or attitude."
bad,Very hard work to do.You learn a lot about the store. The management was not okay. The co-workers are very good people.The hardest about the job is Reciving but I learn It well about checking in truck. What I enjoy is the people.
bad,"Very long hours, not appreciated for your work. Upper Manager is not connected with store management. Training program is so-so, what you learn in training is not what is practiced in stores. Preference is always given to internal candidates regardless of experience."
bad,not much to say. hated my time there!!! very political and they love to play favorites.
bad,No one is ever willing to really work together and guide each other into the right direction. It is really hard to move up in this company.
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers. A typical day at work consisted of late hours and cold environments. During my time here I learned how to manage my time. The  section manager at this establishment was excellent. On the other hand, overall management wasn't the best. The hardest part of the job was being cold. My co-workers were enjoyable to be around."
bad,"Very unhealthy to work at this place, in a sense that your life will become very unbalanced, do to the fact that the schedule chances every week. Pay is terrible, flexibility is terrible, management is terrible in a sense that they will just give products or additional products away if someone claims that the product they brought was damaged or broke somewhere in the parking lot.  "
bad,good and bad days it was hard because i was just standing there putting the groceries in bags
bad,This job was great while I was attending school but there was a lot of drama between managers and associates. I always felt there was tension and everyone was unhappy to be there. That made the workplace very hard to work in.
bad,I relocated from the washington dc area and needed to work . So i applied to kroger from the time being until i can gain a position with another employer that better suits me and the skills that I have gained as well.
bad,Learned a lot help lots of people management were to busy talking on the phone to notice what was really going but i did hve fun
bad,"i worked at this same store for five years and the customers were great i loved them. i greeted them by their names and they were comfortable with that. but i had no benefits at all, the management and union are so unfair. but overall i loved the job only for my customers."
bad,A typical day for me as assistant manager would be coming in for a 12 hour shift to get the concessions up and ready for business. My duties included everything from cooking to taking inventory and unloading the delivery truck.
bad,"Fred Meyer isn't a stable company. They do not push advancement from within and has a high turn over. Policies and procedures often change depending on the situation, which can cause confusion for employees and customers."
bad,"Going into Kroger I was very excited to work around a lot of people as i am a people person. A typical day of work consisted simply of bagging groceries, assisting customers to their cars, and collecting grocery carts. The main thing I learned from this job is how to interact and make an impression on customers to heighten their shopping experience. Management was not conducted well at all, they don't view people as people, but just as an expendable asset of the company. Day in and day out I worked with 100% effort, but they would not edit the work schedule when they made a mistake and scheduled people during school. My co-workers were fun to be around and a good crowd, but all of the co-workers agree that dealing with management, and getting hours was the hardest part of the job. As previously stated, the most enjoyable part of this job was working around people."
bad,"They keep piling these great programs to make them money but keep your pay the same. Even if a customer is screaming and cussing at you, you are not able to defend policies and laws. Kroger, instead will give them a gift card to say sorry but never gives classes to us as employees to help deal with getting mentally abused by the customers."
bad,It was a great location and loved the customers most of the time.
bad,It is a great job for a person out of high school or college. Very flexible hours.
bad,This was mu very first job i started as a cashier and moved up to the front office and safe in a matter of mo. The job was very fast pass but easy.
bad,It was a great job for any high school student. Was not a great job for me with a child and a car and house to pay off.
bad,It is a hard place for new people to stay at. There is a lot of office politics and unless you make a friend that will help teach you the job then you’re pretty much on your own. Unless someone in management likes you. Don’t expect people to work with your schedule or get time off when you need. The schedule is used as a punishment if you make someone mad that makes it. It’s used to try to make it harder on people so they quit. It could be a great job but the people in charge except for maybe one.  Assistant manager. Good pay.
bad,"Company went against my available work hours. They did not abide by anything they stated in the interview. A typical work day consisted of myself working very hard with little to no assistance. Other employees would just joke around, be on their cellphones and basically do nothing."
bad,customers are fantastic cannot say the same for management they dont treat their employees fair management also they are very unprofessional in all aspects
bad,"5 years ago this was a great company to work for. Kroger invested in its people and cared about its people. Today, it’s process driven and Kroger no longer cares. Managers are underpaid and overworked."
bad,They don't care about their employees in the slightest. You will be worked to death with no consideration about your personal time. The pay is pretty low in comparison to other grocery stores.
bad,"Management tries its best, co-workers and customers can make it fly by. will stick you wherever they want. Started as a meat clerk, and it was fine, would sometimes be asked to go up front or work in other departments and often felt like I didn't have a choice."
bad,Its a nice place to work but the employees. Talk about other employees alot. And alot of people on power trips also the management are not very mind most times
bad,"Kroger is all about how the business looks on the outside. It’s never really about the main issues that go on on the inside. Many of the employees at Kroger are unhappy with how they are being treated. The store I’m at is always understaffed, causing a stressful work environment. Management isn’t helpful when there is an issue. Overall not a very good environment."
bad,Kroger has a great potential to be amazing. The problem is within the leadership and not focusing on the Core Values it Preaches. It is a Boss first culture versus a customer happiness. The closer you are to the division Offices the more it shows this fact. If you do well they move you closer to the division office where it becomes more about covering up the mistakes than fixing the mistakes.
bad,"This company was ok, till I was called out for something I did not do which, eneded my career with them. The union rep did not stand up for me.  "
bad,If you don't meet the quotas everything else is moot. When they decided to use a district manager that was not a pharmacist things began to go down hill. Management without Rx experience and the over saturation of new Rx schools/new grads have hurt the profession. Decreased job security and pay cuts.
bad,You’re so underpaid nothing else matters.  Customers are terrible and nobody appreciates anything you do. Hours were terrible. Coworkers were amazing.
bad,"Are you looking to work in a fast paced, union environment with guaranteed overtime hours?  Then this is the place for you. "
bad,overall my experience there was awful. Had managers breathing down your neck threatening to fire you and poor schedule managing. They wont listen to your availability and expect you to come in when you said you couldn't and get written up or fired.
bad,No raises stressful and they shut down our store  Not happy with the closing of the store.In our area it's hard to find a job .It took me 3 months to find another job it was a nightmare
bad,No loyalty to long time employees.  They would rather bring in new students to run pharmacies because they have clinical experience but there is a whole lot more to the job than that
bad,"When I began working there, I wanted part-time hours, but was okay with working a little over that. After about half a year, I was working 40hrs with non-/approved overtime every week. Sometimes I would be there until the store closed. Management was appalling and I've heard anger-inducing stories from Cashiers."
bad,"Worked there in high school to gain experience, absolutely awful pay. Management is a joke in every way possible, almost made me choose a business major because I hated them so much and wanted better for others. Constant drama, worked with schedule sometimes but often ignored requests hoping you’d go along with it. Training was almost nonexistent."
bad,"Poor management,bad hours, terrible benefits, they do not value their employees.  Worked here over two years,was still trying to get insurance,when I left. Great staff and customers.  Very friendly atmosphere."
bad,"Extremely stressful, dirty work place."
bad,"Clicklist was a mess. Our store was small, through tues-sat we'd get at most 26 orders. Wednesday were slow with sometimes just 5 orders lol. Sundays and monday we would get 30 to 60, with only on average 5 people working, managers wouldnt like to help, didnt know anything thing about clicklist when people called to complain. Coworkers would be giving  ""special"" brownies to others on the clock. Not a real place to work.I called off whenever, dont stress over this place, keep this job as temporary for only 6 months or so. This place gave me so much stress with clicklist, dont act like you know it all or a ""fast learner"" bc they'll expect you to do everything. Our fat lazy female team leader downplayed her work onto us, always making us going outside while she sat inside picking small orders, taking 15 min breaks, and bathroom breaks. Which is hard because if you have 7 cars coming within a hour, it makes the order youre on become late for that person to pick up,and she'll be wining why youre not doing better. Management was corrupt, think their so top but dont even have an actual office lol. If youre gonna do clicklist, make sure its at a bigger store where you have more than 8 people picking, and people who are specified to only pick up the phone and take orders out, not a store where its all at once where you have 2 wireless phones, and your lazy obese female team leader doesnt wanna answer it. Dont make this a fulltime,40 hours like her with kids and bills to pay LOL pathetic . The pay was not worth all the work we had to do in my area, atleast.so dont let them boss you around,"
bad,Managers do not seem to understand the need for help. I can run a department with myself and one other person and I should not be talked down to about my department when they do not know how to run it themselves.
bad,"Bad upper management, racist in promoting & stressful environment to work in and no backing by management. The union only supports certain people and does not represent all union employees."
bad,"Very unorganized with little help.We’re not supposed to get overtime,but they ask us to stay over and work us constantly while they get many vacations"
bad,"This place sucks. Management does not care. They are quick to exploit anyone who shows determination and ability into doing their job, for the same pay (or less) as the incapable moron they hired shortly after you."
bad,It was okay at first but got worse as time went on into the job it just wasn’t good and they didn’t have everything together the store is all over the place
bad,"Most managers have very poor people skills, many are uneducated & lack common sense. Many store managers play their employs against each other. Many tend to cut employee hours to make up for low bonus checks."
bad,There were times where you would have good days and others as bad but there are times where you would feel appreciated from this place. It was a good stepping stone.
bad,When I interviewed I was so excited I thought I found a good fit I’m talking about store 507 in Columbia Tn then I meet my management team. I left because they would not honor the terms I was hired on
bad,"Pay is terrible for overnights for what's required of you.  Hard to get hired in because of union contract they almost keep you from getting hired in. All they care about is sales and the customer. Always hiring because of such low pay. Turn over is bad. "
bad,"Management plays clear favorites in each store and will promise things they can't actually deliver upon, inter employee relations were absolutely fantastic, however."
bad,"In my experience, it is an ok place to work as long as you just don't take their promises to heart. They like to lie to get you to work for them. When someone calls off, you work the deli alone. No one will help you."
bad,Overall the entire experience was not a pleasant one. I was put into a workforce that had some of the least friendly people I’ve ever came across. The working conditions were not very sanitary either. In addition the managers turned a blind eye to bullying from fellow employees.
bad,The store is a training store for management so there is a lot of change in the store good and bad.  The communication between store management and the department heads need much improvement.
bad,Kroger used to be a place that you could grow into a career. Not they just drive you into the ground and replace you when you can’t go anymore. It’s too bad cause the associates are great.
bad,"The only good thing I can say about this job is that they will pay for your PTCB test if you pass it. It is a highly understaffed and stressful environment. There are no opportunities to advance, I was regularly yelled at by customers, and the coworkers I experienced were apathetic and rude."
bad,"I learned quite a bit, but not to the thanks of my management, I learned on my own.  Trained for a day or two and left on my own and asked to train a new person while I was supposedly being trained."
bad,"If you're looking for long-term employment, look elsewhere. The new general manager is a hard-nose, and has little in the way of people skills. The store is approximately 40 years old, and was last given a major re-model in the 90's. Much of the equipment is old, and breaks down a lot. There was even a fire in the store recently, in a 30-year-old cooler, that required evacuation and fire department response. All departments are chronically short-handed, meaning that frequently one person is doing the work of two or three, usually with unreasonable expectations for completing all tasks in a limited time frame. They are notoriously stingy with overtime, often arranging schedules for employees to work six days a week without exceeding 40 hours. There is no actual security in the store, just cameras that sit unwatched 98% of the time, and pre-recorded ""security"" announcements over the loudspeakers every so often. their stores have union representation, but union representatives are seldom seen. So, if you need short-term employment, and you have little to no outside responsibilities, this is an okay place to start out, but I would most definitely NOT recommend this place for any kind of long-term employment."
bad,Krogers is a horrible company to work for. Management is in control of nothing and employees work if they want to if they choose not to work then they don't and they are no results. The only thing good about working for krogers is their benefits are inexpensive and they pay weekly.
bad,"Kroger is okay expect rude customers and sometimes poor management. i learned to go to work and get money don't make friends"
bad,"Kroger offers flexibility and growth potential. Unfortunately, if a person doesn't fit in the cliques, or is not a union member, especially long-time employees with small but attainable goals, they are targeted and hounded by management, out to prove control, to the point of the employee quitting, or being terminated thru sabotage."
bad,"When I first started, I found myself working in an ideal work environment. Staff were friendly, management knew exactly what they were doing, and the air between team members was filled with respect and compassion. It was rough work, certainly, but we carried it out with a smile. Over the course of my employment, numerous staff and management changes led to a slow downgrade of both the work environment and the quality of our customer service. Now most of us are miserable and it always feels like our jobs are on the line thanks to less-than-agreeable personalities in positions of power."
bad,"Let's face it,  management where I'm at has no stability as for how long they will be at one Kroger, favoritism among management to certain employees is evident,  and they are too demanding to the point of micromanaging and can be aggressive to downright insulting if you don't slave yourself to the ground for them and the company! I'm typically in multiple departments but nowadays they want everyone to be on a register or bagging because their front end leads stinks making schedules and their turnover rate is getting out of control.  So the management will find a way to kneejerk you around in and out your department where you can't get any work done at all.   It's ridiculous and do they and corporate cares -  absolutely not especially now with these new raises.  As for the employees,  they are a pain, particularly full-time workers.   I'm part-time in my main department where 3 individuals have years of seniority and a full set of hrs will whine,  complain daily, take ongoing vacations/requested days off so they won't deal with the heavy lifting and then they aren't appreciative at all.   And this high school type of behavior happens throughout my store along with gossipin,  mocking immigrant/migrant workers that works hard and better than them,  disrespectful employees challenging management what they aren't going to do,  employees being no shows regularly.  And most of the management and supervisors will not reprimand or discipline due to union possibly ripping them apart depending if employees call or fill grievances.  In hindsight, I want to leave Kroger but I have insurance."
bad,Worked many hours and always stayed overtime to complete what the managers wanted but always demanded more and more. If you have multiple skills you will be back and forth between departments daily and your schedule will always be all over the place
bad,"Enjoyed starting with Kroger but once I moved to a new state I was told all my experience I've acquired was useless in my new state and was payed starting wages even though other coworkers were much less experienced and made more then I did."
bad,Even for a small mistake you were treated as if it’s the end of the world. Management is more likely to tell you that they will fire you then to actually fix the problem.
bad,They will write you up non stop . Stop changing mangment. Do not expect so much from one person. Sometimes I am the only person running the whole deli.
bad,"A typical day at work assumes that the workplace has consistency. My store location is not consistent. Management does not care for the employees' mental health, just results. Would be more understanding about this if departments were able to be fully staffed, instead of running at half or 3/4th strength."
bad,"Seemed like a great company at first with great insurance and was like that until about 3-4 months ago. The co workers were great and most of us get along really well, but the management picks favorites, especially a certain female store manager."
bad,"not a good place to work. Management plays favorites when promoting or hiring, corporate higher up managers are even worse, ordering people to be fired so they can be replaced by their own friends/family"
bad,Great job in general but need more help to actually get the job done. Work environment is good but also needs work on security for safety of employees and customers
bad,With our first manager everything was great. We all worked well as a team and made the store one of the best in our area because of this they moved our manager to a different store. They did this before hiring someone for ours so we had a new manager ever two weeks which cause tension between co-workers and cause the store to start declining again.
bad,"Not feeling satisfied with the company, seniority doesn't matter, they cut your hours, and the pay is ridiculous.. Only thing part timers get is paying union dues."
bad,"Stressful workdays, Poor management.Full-time hours but no benefits. No room for career advancement. No health benefits. Poor pay. When I accepted the job I heard that Kroger was a great place to work. It was not what I expected."
bad,"There were three managers in the meat and seafood department and all of them had trouble showing up for their scheduled shifts and left me the burden of carrying their weight. On top of stocking the sales floor and working the counter weighing out meat and seafood for the customers, I also was in charge of breaking down and organizing the shipments for the meat, seafood, and the deli departments. I did enjoy my interactions with the customers in helping them find what they were looking for and I also formed friendships with some of the regulars customers that came in."
bad,You're replaceable was just look at as a number. Super low pay. Only a starter job would not be for a long term job. The managment will fire you if one of the department  leads dont like you.
bad,"Unreasonable expectations, for example conditioning the department at the by the end of the employee's shift while the store stays open for 3 more hours and customers continue to shop. The management knows this but will say that the department was unconditioned and try to punish the worker for it too many managers giving conflicting orders. A customer ran over an employee's foot with an amigo cart and one of the store manager's laughed at the employee's misfortune. Management does not care about the well being of the employees that they're there to supervise. Scheduling employees to work during hours unavailable."
bad,"My experience with Kroger was a short one. The management was more concerned with sales and store policy than the employees. Talking among the cashiers, and baggers was strongly frowned upon which made the shifts long. They made work a competition."
bad,"Not the best place to work. It is stressful, and I never know what to do. They also don’t do the best job at training their associates. Very stressful place to work."
bad,"Kroger="
bad,"No one there cared about anything. They were all going through the motions, even management. They were disrespectful to not only their employees, but also customers."
bad,"If you want to be treated like you're worthless, work here. they pay as little as possible and keep everyone part time. Part time workers rarely become full time and there isn't much room for growth."
bad,"There is absolutely NO communication in the building whatsoever. Nobody is on the same page at any point. There is very clear favoritism happening which leads to people getting stuck in certain job functions for very long periods of time. In some cases actually leading to injuries or someone quitting. Your ""set schedule"" is actually wildly unpredictable since overtime can be called all the way up until the last few moments of work. The union does little to nothing for the employees that you couldn't get just working anywhere."
bad,I work in the deli and we have been short staffed due to low pay for months. There is more expectations on cleaning on the night shift but the day shift isnt held accountable.  Management is not where it should be. Overall I would not recommend working here at all.
bad,"The best thing about Kroger is the benefits. The pay does not measure up to the work put in. I work the deli but I am constantly having to my department, front end, get carts, clicklist, dairy, etc. Only to make $8.50 an hour. The managers play favorites and are completely biased towards those who do the work and don’t like me and those who constantly complain but have been there longer. One lady in my department says she can’t be alone on the deli counter because customers stare at her while in line. Meanwhile I get left alone pretty often and won’t say a thing. But she has been there longer so they let her have her way."
bad,"Management is terrible, pay is terrible, job is VERY stressful. Never enough people scheduled so you have to do the job of 3 people. And again you are not paid enough."
bad,"Poor pay, company will fight the union for any pay increase. A 40 hour a week employee starting out during the day cannot afford a one bedroom apartment in most places convenient to live and commute from. Management is good and bad. The good ones thank you for your hard work, are compassionate and know that life happens. The bad ones don't care and only worry about certain aspects of the store. There is job security thanks to the union. But advancement is rare and hard to come by. Regular pay increases again, thanks to the union, but the starting pay is too low to live in the area without a roommate. "
bad,"I had applied for cashier and was hired on as front-end clerk, I was working in the summer time pulling in carts, for an 1hour straight some time, when we were supposed to only be out there 30 mins at a time."
bad,"They dont care at all whats going on in your life, you have to bleed for them. They wont give you enough hours and wont work with you to get a set schedule so you can work a second job. They pay you as little as legally possible with 10 cent raises after 1000, that being said you have to finish those 1000 hours in the year. I was 948/1000 hours when the new year changed and they just reset me back to zero hours and no raise. Its a joke. Heaven forbid you need help from a manager because none of them actually work. They just have a social circle upstairs and just let the basic employees get verbally assaulted by customers for issues that are out of their control. You can get paid the same literally anywhere else... do yourself a favor and go to anywhere else."
bad,"Grocery workers are not compensated well.Years ago was a good industry but not now for the new hires. Not  enough hours, minimum wages, you pay the union for nothing because you cant even get health insurance until you work there 18 months. Accident arised and you are not covered with health insurance. The only good thing is you can get pension after 10 years of work and coworkers are very nice."
bad,I liked working in deli until they said if i go to bakery i can get health insurance so i moved to the bakery for that reason only but after my 90 days they said they didnt know why i didnt have it i fill out all the paper work so they had me go to the union they said i needed to talk the the company but the company said i needed to talk to union so i just gave them my 2 weeks notice and they said they was not going to take it so i quit i didnt get my insurance notice until i was work somewhere else for 2 months which means it was not 90 days for me it was more like 150 days
bad,The pay is not good and the management is not good either. They hire people with no experience and just text book skills. No real life application. Also they always want you doing something. Basically go sweep the road cause you're standing still
bad,Sometimes not getting breaks even though it was stated that these were to be provided. Working with people was great. Meeting new people was a great thing.
bad,"I enjoyed my fellow employees. Everyone I worked with at my level was great to be around. The manager didn't want to be there, and was away as much as possible. The hours were inconsistent, and I would get scheduled for days and times which were agreed upon that I would not have to work, and then get in trouble for not showing up, because I was unaware that I was scheduled for a day off. But that was the deli only. I have heard that other positions were not so bad."
bad,The management at Kroger is not a positive work environment. The employees all complain and just give the impression that Kroger is not a good place. I worked hard and tried to make it fun while I was there. I like working with the customers.
bad,"I loved my Kroger team, I worked at the corporate office in a customer support role. I thought the team of people I worked with were just great. I don't believe Kroger appreciates them as much as I had. "
bad,"Working at Kroger you can tell that it is either a temporary job or one where you must work 40+ hours to make a living. There is little room for advancement unless you want to work part-time foor years until a spot happens to open up. Benefits do not start coming in until you have been working full-time for over a year. Lower level management is always coming and going, and higher level management never gets along with employees. I have had to deal with several hot-tempered managers who yell at and demean employees for small issues. There is very little workplace morale as everyone there is counting the hours until they can leave. The managers will also try to guilt you into picking up extra shifts if they deem your written schedule unsatisfactory and there is obvious favoritism happening in each department. Salary raises happen annually by a few cents, but the turnaround is so high that most people do not make it that long. In 2017 when the state minimum wage increased, part-time workers who worked there for several years and earned a higher wage than new employees did not get to keep their raises when everyone's wages were raised to the same rate."
bad,"Nothing good to say.It is a very dysfunctional company, and no wonder North Carolina had to close their doors. "
bad,"In Georgia, if you want to make more than $7/hour you have to join the union. After you join the union your pay goes to $10/hour. In another state, your starting pay is based on previous experience, and mine started higher than $10. When I moved to Georgia, my pay dropped to the $7/hr range. I had been with the company over a year at that time. "
bad,"Kroger is an awful place to work. Things get changed too often. No one seems to actually care about their employees. People try getting others fired. If you work there, don't be there for long."
bad,Unbelievable sadden and disappointed that a Kroger would go belly up. I liked working there.It was a small store so ee became a small family .I think if we had a better manager that the closure could have not happened.I we orked there 6 years Started out as a bagger than moved to a cashier
bad,"I would not recommend to anyone to work at the Krogers I worked at in Clarksburg, West Virginia. You get paid minimum wage when nearby stores pay more, and the management is incredibly hard on their workers."
bad,Changes constantly with customers and co-workers.  Some people were there to put in their time and go home.  Then you would have to pick up more responsibilities.  Can be stressful.  Management only came back to complain.
bad,"In my experience the manager's did not appreciate employee input on ways to make the workplace more pleasurable. The general tone was do what we say and leave the thinking to us, and if that is not acceptable then go work somewhere else. Likely the best thing i can say about Kroger's is the Health Insurance is very good, and very cheap comparable to most employers. The down side is that they require six months continuous employment for full-time personnel, and twelve months for part-time personnel."
bad,No communication to share on this subject matter. The company is poor to work for. Wages are not comparable to market competition. Management is oblivious to what actually should occur at store level.
bad,I hated it there. it didnt even last long.the pay sucked. The boss was always negative and power abusive. I will never work there ever again.im just not a people person it seems.
bad,The store i worked at you only advanced in the workplace if some one in management wanted you too. There were people who got hired a year after i did and was promoted to a better department job and a pay raise and also got full time status. The people who are in charge of you will never be some one who you can learn from nor some one who you could model a good employee from. Plus if there is a issue just know that you will get thrown under the bus by your supervisors when they dont want to take responsibility for there actions.
bad,"A typical work day consists of dealing with call-offs, being short-staffed, and dealing with angry customers. The management seems to care less and less over time about their integrity, and places over-emphasis on profits instead of taking care of the employees."
bad,"management was very bad. I get to work & they tell me I am not need but I was on the schedule  Store was dirty . molded food on the floor , unsafe parking lot.  I had a necklace ripped off my neck in the store"
bad,"Kroger is not a great place to work, because I believe they ask so much from, but they never actually compensate you for the work you do. People do so much, but get paid so little. All management really care about is corporate visits and store numbers."
bad,"The floor manager was not consistent and caused a lot of trouble for me starting and quitting the job. I quite enjoyed my sections manager and my fellow employees but we all agreed that the floor manager wasn’t the best. I was always alone in my section without help witch sucked when loads came in. When I’d ask for help, I’d get a front end person who is inexperienced in stocking and wasn’t really worth the trouble in my opinion. And I was expected to do a lot for a 5’4 110lbs girl who had to lift a lot, but I did learn how to manage my time while working and enjoyed seeing regular costimers."
bad,not a lot of structure management doest really care about you they just want the job done over work you for little pay customer is always right but are good if you need time off depending on the season or how well staffed you are but more than likely you will be understaffed for there constant budget cutes
bad,everyone should know what I mean by the title. Kroger tends to be a pretty bad experience for most people coming in and out. At least it's job experience!
bad,"I hated it. The management was very inconsistent with their jobs. My job was very fast-paced, and if you did one thing wrong it was a big deal. The ""benefits"" were not good at all unless you joined the union."
bad,"For me working at Kroger started out very stressful as I started out working overnight as a stocker. The department manager would stress everyone out and make us all miserable I soon quit and found other work. Later I came back to Kroger as a produce clerk and I enjoyed that much better. Although the main dept manager there would also stress us out."
bad,"I worked in the Deli/Bakery a typical day can start with making Doughnuts/ frying chicken/putting away stock/ stocking shelves/ doing scans/baking cookies/making party trays/ decorating cakes/waiting on the deli counter slicing meat and cheeses/upselling/ setting up salad bar/ closing the deli/bakery/salad bar. You are required to strictly adhere by production standards. It is a great way to build customer service /team work skills. Management changes frequently and there are way to many levels of management. Accolades or recognition is rare, it is constantly an environment of you never do enough . Consistently short staffed by sometimes more than half of the needed crew . The hardest part is you will be expected to all the above mentioned jobs on most days in one shift with very little help. The most enjoyable part is the relationships you build with your team and customers."
bad,"Poor management, a typical work day includes being alone in a department for 8 hours, expected to do all work by yourself and with no help from department manager, who was never there. poor pay and a manager who expects you to work 39.5 hours a week as a part time employee for minimum wage."
bad,"Fast paced training done three times per week.  Low wages impact turnover on a weekly basis."
bad,The management was poor and picked favorites. Made you work longer if the person who was relieving you hadnt shown up yet. They were normally rude and hateful if you had to call out for being sick or an emergency.
bad,"I was glad that I became a Cashier so quickly, but I wish that everything was a bit more organized and that employees were paid for over time and it didn’t have to be requested."
bad,"It can take a really long time to make *decent* money at this job.... we’re talking 15 + years. And even then there is a laughable pay cap which forces your employees out the door. You are expected to do a lot of tasks as a lead and will not be fairly compensated. "
bad,They hired me as PT but scheduled me FT which was fine for a week or two but I was still in college and I’m a single parent. When I brought up the fact that I was hired for PT and could only work PT hours they said they would fix it. I waited several weeks and they still wouldn’t fix it. They don’t care about their employees as much as they claim they do.
bad,"I was hired part time and always ended up working 35+ hours in the evenings. Management knows there's a high turn over rate here and works you to the bone before you leave/burn out. The coworkers were enjoyable to work with, the customers were nice enough, upper management was the main thing I didn't like about the position."
bad,"Union workers create an extra layer of obstacles when striving for customer service improvements for the thing that matters most. Our Customers."
bad,"During my years at the Kroger company I witnessed sever unspeakably acts done by upper management to save a buck. Unethical behavior, favoritism, and bigotry. Many of the employees had mental health issues and were dismissed while on leave abruptly after FMLA ended. Or the company always ""lost paperwork"" often. If you are a minority, homosexual, or have any common sense you will be eventually chased out of the company. Or in my case have a stroke and end up out that way. It's common to have a stroke or heart attack working in the heat unloading trucks. No water, unable to get breaks, ufcw 1059 union...big joke.  Don't waste your youth at this place."
bad,"First, I was lied to by a hiring manager, regarding a position I originally applied for, that I had over 25 years of experience in. The Mgr told me he doesn't see those years of experience listed on my resume. My experience was clearly spelled out on my Resume, Ergo I knew he was definitely lying, didn't want to compensate me for it. I proceeded with my training video/test requirements, only to find out later in orientation, that I was switched to work in the Deli department. I was totally shocked by this underhanded move, & now had to do deli training course requirements before starting. Now with no experience in Deli, they started my pay at a struggling minimum wage rate. The work is not worth the pay, very poor Mgmt, favoritism, & harassment from other so-called supervisors. The crew I work with are awesome, team players, and we look out for each other. Day side crew, very lazy, & trifling, always leaving their mess, trash, dishes, & even stock for us to do in the evening. We had our on closing procedures to do, which would be delayed or not done for having to do day shift's job(s). If it weren't for my crew, I would have left along time ago. Also, Mgmt is always threatening you about your job, if you're unable to do something bc of body/health ailments, they're so quick to telling you ""if you can't do it, then you need to fill out Leave of Absence paper w/out pay.""  What kind of obtuse nonsense is this! They even told a woman going through cancer treatments, that if she doesn't get her lifting requirements changed by her doctor, she would have to do a Leave of absence w/out,"
bad,Job workplace was very unorganized. Had minors doing tasks during job that they were not able to do. Management was not suited to run store. Job was not enjoyable.
bad,"I have been working here for over two years, made a $0.25 raise in that time.  Our store recently got new contracts.  Now I make $8.50, the same as a new hire.  How is it fair that I have been working there for two and a half years and getting paid the same as a new hire?  The pay rates with this company is ridiculous and I cannot wait to leave."
bad,It was okay Kroger didn't work around my schedule very much. The management team didn't really know what they were doing as much and the people that came in to shop there were really nice.
bad,Management is awful and there is no moving up for anyone below a back up manager. Anywhere you try to move doesn’t have hours and the managers do nothing about incidents. They get away with everything and clerks are micro managed for no reason.
bad,"The store manager himself is the king of harassment. He manipulates and schemes. He skits the system they have in place to his own twisted ends. He doesn't care about anyone but himself. His hostility is plain to see and hopefully he will be gone soon. He's a misogynist, meddlesome, micromanaging dinosaur who needs to retire before he gets fired or sued."
bad,"Clock in for work, look on the board for your job duties for the day, for example, if you were  a bagger, for the first 3 hours you would be on the floor helping customers find their items in the isle and also help with bagging their groceries. Then after 3 hrs you would be called to do either carts, going outside and bringing them back in for customers, or working the bottle machine room making sure the machines are functional throughout the day."
bad,"my day would start off smooth, until i was left by myself. had to do my daily routine n also attend to the customers n answer the phone. some days it would get over whelming but i push though it, ive learnd about waste management. and how to prep products for the next day, condition the sales floor. the management was ok, the most enjoyable was when i would be by myself and can run the department by myself."
bad,"Non stop work which is good, but not much of a learning environment that management should concentrate on.  I saw new employees struggling and their culture is not to help employees strive."
bad,"You do not want to work here if you can not handle endless loads of stress. The management has very poor communication skill, they will treat you like a robot, and they don't care. There is no appreciation given here, verbally and paycheck alike. You will NEVER have full time, and you are never guaranteed the hours you want because people leave, and your co workers can not be trusted, some will be friends, some will act like friends and then when things go wrong they will turn snake on you to save their own hide. So work here, at your own risk. And the customers are just rude and can be very mean for some reasons unknown. Not all of them, but most."
bad,I would always ask for extra hours and I ended up getting less hours. I had a raise pay of $7.25 a hour and 2 years later it only went up to $7.85. That's not enough of a pay raise for 2 years of working.
bad,The manager was quick to berate employee's when he was under pressure to meet quota from HR. Easily irritated manager. Hours weren't consistent. The location i worked at was clean though. Although i dealt with one problematic manager quite a few managers were quite respectful and listened to my concerns.
bad,"Great place to shop, but not the best place to work. There is no communication between shifts and what little communication there is changes from person to person. Pay is seriously low and don't expect a manager to come when you call for assistance."
bad,"A typical day as management started early in the morning doing rounds around the store in every department. The day last 10 to 12 hours and you work 5 to 6 days a week. The pay, benefits, and training are phenomenal but the management structure is awful."
bad,"I would not get enough hours. I was working with a bunch of children, but they made one of them the manager even though I had to do everything, they couldn't even sell alcohol. Specific employees were very shady towards black employees."
bad,To much internal issues among workers.  Management does a poor job of being in touch with the union for various issues. There is no way to come to work and just work you are pushed into being in some sort of social click among workers and managers and can't just go to work and enjoy it. You are deemed worse if you do not choose to align yourself with whatever groupings the store might have.  Also they prey on people who like to work and constantly make them pick up the slack for lazier associates.
bad,"I liked working with a lot of the employees.. it’s a fast pace, your always moving, they had safety days when the company it’s a certain day . The director does a BBQ. And  when you go a year with injuries. The employees get $50 gift card"
bad,crooked union. if you know how to lie and be under-handed then this is the place for you to excel. the union is in kroger's back pocket. too many shady deals and shady managers there.
bad,"Working here has literally put me in a pit of despair, and i can't escape it. Customers treat you like garbage, coworkers can be trashy or nice. It's hit or miss. The main problem is that the pay is not worth the stress of the job and what needs to get done to provide what's best for customers that truly do not care for you. And if you make a mistake, can't answer a question or simply just get a bit annoyed, customers flip out. People are terrible. Also the CEO gave himself a pay raise while many associates are stuck at the max 11 dollars an hour. As well as you will pretty much always start off with minimum wage."
bad,"But it's not! It's extremely cut-throat and an overall poor environment because unfortunately Kroger hasn't gotten the routine down yet. You spend all day on your feet, standing on concrete waiting around for people who are late to pick up their groceries. "
bad,"Working at Koger is a definitely a hard place to enjoy your job. The coworkers are nice but management is extreme. Pay is not very competitive, working conditions are tough, and the break situation is absolutely ridiculous. Its hard to work at a job when the best part of your day is leaving. When you want to leave before you even go into work. Management tends to have an attitude with you when you ask for help or voice concerns/opinions. If you make a mistake management tends to look down upon you forever, they will make rude remarks or comments, they will give you annoyed looks, and they really just make the employees feel worthless."
bad,The management that was at my store at the time was terrible. They treated you like you were beneath them and butt kissing was the only way to get anywhere. It did not matter how hard you worked it would always go unnoticed.
bad,"Cut throat, unsafe, unless you are in a bind for cash stay away.  Plan on time away from your family on weekends and holidays, because they will force you to work"
bad,Its not a bad place to work but the grocery buissness is not what it used to be insurance isnt that great and its not a good job to have to live off of.
bad,"i believe if the managers actually cared about there employee but would be a better work place. Needs lots of improvement as far as hours , communicating and scheduling."
bad,"Decent company to work for.  Not a long term company.  A lot of management changes.    Good benefits,  fun people to work with.     Only care about the bottom line, Money"
bad,I was really excited to work for frys. It was horrible. My hours were never consistent. The manager would not give me the day off for my brothers funeral do to the fact i had taken 3 days off already that week.he  tried to make me work on the day of the funeral.
bad,"My experience here was very stressfull the way managment treated its associates and customers. Theres been times, other cleaner violated company policies for cleaner crew and cleaning charts filled out but jobs not done. Managers dont correct issues."
bad,Work environment was okay managers were really a pain no help at all would baerly even listen go anything employess had to say lazy and very stressful
bad,Kwik shop does not have very good management. You have to work by yourself sometimes and the stores are to busy to work by yourself and make sure everything is done that is supposed to be done such as cleaning the fountain area and making aure the slaes floor is properly stocked and clean.
bad,Managers whom don't know how to manage a team make everyone miserable. Undesireble shifts not enough hours for newer staff who have to wait for senior team members to leave to move up on list to pick shifts
bad,"Kroger Pharmacy is a quick pace work environment.  There is no down time or time to relax because of the fast pace, work load, and fewer hours that we have been given.  I do love my co-workers and my patients."
bad,Its an okay job for something part time. The raises are minimal and the store management can be iffy. They expect you to do a lot of work but wont offer you the hours
bad,Pay is way lower with minimal raises. I worked there for 4 years and never realized how bad the pay was. Check your other options first. But a job is a job.
bad,It's a very unfriendly atmosphere with extremely inappropriate behavior. The work is difficult and working midnight's are hard. I learned to be more organized. It's a very physical position.
bad,"If you do it during the door prepare to be get the day loads from all the trucks and be moving it in the back with pallet jacks all day, while getting complained at by the store manager to restock the shelves, while having to answer questions from rude customers that don't realize you are a human. You should probably never have to touch the cash register but be prepared to know the process."
bad,A hard work environment with little to no appreciation. Total disregard for your personal availability. Lack of benefits and low pay. Almost no chance of decent raises or advancement.
bad,Do not recommend as a career choice ok for temporary job. Company culture has changed over the years.  Kroger bottom line is the only consideration the customer first attitude of the past is gone.
bad,No balance between work and outside life. Management is poor and does not value employees. Not a very rewarding job. A lot of standing in one place without much stimulation or challenge.
bad,"The managers overall don't care about your well-being and how you prefer to do things doesn't matter. If you want to avoid dealing with customers, do not work for Kroger. They will force you to, no matter your position. They are too focused on the customers being happy to even begin to consider the employees' opinions on things should be ran and handled."
bad,"The Kroger company should really look into the people they have running the store. No one actually cares about the job they are doing, it’s just for money."
bad,It was a job where people who work as a courtesy clerk don't have much respect and it can be a dangerous and or a unsafe work environment. Management isn't very understanding and can be very rude.  The people around us the area felt unsafe and the security or lack their of didn't do a good job at making you feel protected.
bad,"I enjoyed meeting lots of new faces and many customers and their friends family, and their children.  I liked the fast paced environment and the job I had not the pay.  The worst part of the job was doing carts in the rain,  snow,  thunderstorms."
bad,"Most of the time customers trickle in slowly, but there are times when large batches come in and also long lulls without any. Hours are irregular as a part time worker. Some weeks I had 12 hours some weeks I had 30. When there aren't any customers management will want you to be cleaning or doing something else even when there is nothing to do."
bad,"I received very little training, I had to ask how to do each task they wanted me to do and managers would come by and ask us to do very time consuming and unimportant tasks while busy with our actual work."
bad,"workers are treated harsh and if your'e told to do the impossible and you don't get it done, then you're looked and treated different. not a safe place"
bad,"I had written a long 1000 word review on all my grievances at working here, but then I read that it would be posted publicly. You will always have a job there, just don't except more than that."
bad,"Employees are nice enough but management are useless as a molten car. Every day is stressful, and management is a pain. Most of the time they don't listen to employees and blame us for us being out of certain items in stock."
bad,"Pays lowest pay possible. No benefits. 10% discount. Low hours. "
bad,I was told that I would be able to advance and then they did not advance me to the position I was told I could advance to. So I found another job that had better benefits and paid more.
bad,Women were out getting carts more than the men. They didn't really train long enough before I was put out on the floor.  The management was okay but weren't much help because they weren't around long enough for you to ask questions.
bad,"Kroger does not like to pay. The way that the pay rate works is ridiculous. Nothing adds up or makes sense there. My particular store has terrible management & a huge lack of communication. I am a floor supervisor so it’s important that they communicate certain things but they are terrible at this. I definitely would not recommend working there to anyone that I know unless they were really, really desperate."
bad,"My supervisor threatened me and management did nothing. I guess that the HR managers like that they lose good employees. I did enjoy the work, but had personal conflicts in the way of work."
bad,"No career advancement and terrible management.  There is no sense of team work what so ever.  They do pay a bit higher than minimum wage, but in Chicago if you move up in the company you only getting a few cents more per level and it takes a little while to actually level up."
bad,A typical day at work was walking in and asking your boss what needed to be done like putting things on the shelves and unloading trucks and doing some customer service on the side
bad,"Working at Krogers, all I did was sit at the register and scan people's groceries. Customer interactions were sometimes unpleasant and the job was frankly boring."
bad,the co-workers where nice and fun to work with and it was nice to have them there the managers where completly out of touch with reality witch did not help with making work enjoyable
bad,"The store manager is awful. She acts like everyone is disposable. If you cannot get a job done in a certain, unreasonable, amount of time she would say that is no excuse. This store manager is the worst manager I have ever worked for. Slackers are praised and hard workers are degraded. She acts like she knows what's best and how things should be ran but isn't reasonable with her expectations."
bad,"First of all hrs were from 6-2:30am but almost daily you were stuck till 5:30am. They mandated overtime on your days off so you were ""forced"" as a union employee to come in and work for a minimum of 4hrs on your off days. Then they expected 100% productivity out of you each and every day, its a joke. Yes pay is decent but work hours, work load and expectations are just a joke. The morale of the employees were down because they're overworked."
bad,"After many years working for Kroger, the working environment has become toxic and stressful. To sale associates not doing their share of the workload to the management not having care about their employees. There is no sign of things getting better."
bad,Kroger was the first job that I had while I was in highschool and I had an awful supervisor that would continuously get mad if there was a scheduling conflict due to school and continuously schedule me outside my availability.
bad,"The job was easy for the most part, but the management was horrible. Instead of actually doing their job the front end supervisors would go eat on the side."
bad,"Management always has been terrible"
bad,Everyone blames and put everything on the overnight night crew and the Store Management treat us like stray Dogs.It was like a fight between Upper Management and Union Employees everyday. No Loyalty. Everything is about self not team.
bad,Just not enough to survive and stable living and you start low man ranking or seniority and therefore you have to work night shift which was not suitable for working single mothers. Therefore the deli department which I worked in had high turnover and young adults working and most were college student with no kids that can work all night  good for them but not for me
bad,"Kroger is filled with miserable people including managers and employees. The managers definitely show favoritism which means some employees can break the rules and get away with things. Also, the manager can lower your hours if you make them mad."
bad,"You don't always get your breaks, you can get fired for anything without the chance to correct a mistake you made,  you don't get warned of anything wrong, They have a discriminatory attitudes against new employees."
bad,"In my opinion on working at Kroger, as far as the management go. I felt as though majority of the time it was really unprofessional and they never took into consideration of the employees when it came down to a serious work matter"
bad,"I always had to work the night shift which I didn't care for in the first place.Part time with 25 hours,but rarely got out on time because it could be so ridiculously busy it would lap over to tee time you needed to do the lengthy clean-up.Tried to get an earlier shift to avoid the clean-up and crazy business ,but that was a no-no.After 4 months and my hours becoming less I said forget .Worst job I ever had."
bad,Too much is required in the time that is alloted; no work life balance; want you to be on call as if you were in the medical field; very unappreciative of store management
bad,Never enough staff. Always short handed. Managers do not care about you at all. As long as they get their money they do not care about you. They work you too many long hours and you have to beg for breaks. Hope you dont have to use the bathroom because they will make you wait forever.
bad,"If you're looking for some place that will hire you with no previous experience, Kroger is a good choice. "
bad,This job pays way too little . too much college kid drama.the plus of working is they do have security in the stores . there wasnt a problem while i worked there but it was nice knowing they were there.
bad,Need more associate that will work..need to better our pay and give out more hours and overtime overall its a good company to work for and they have some good benefits
bad,"To shop at Kroger is fine. To work there is not. Pay sucks, fuel center clerks get no bathroom break. Or they expect you to work for free. Meaning they do not want you clocking in before your time. But yet will ask you to come in early. Training was very minimal ."
bad,"Overall Kroger is a great company to work for. However I feel that this company could use a lot of improvements. I've worked at two different locations where I've seen new employees receive very little to no training. This makes excelling at your job very diffucult."
bad,"Its just not an enjoyable workplace for teenagers who are new to the workplace. I was 16 when I started, still in high school, and was expected to be there to start a shift even before the school day was done... and I got told off by managers multiple times for it as well, even though it was out of my control. So yea, not a very ""teenage worker"" friendly environment."
bad,"Over the years of working for Kroger I've seen the company pushing as much work onto each employee as possible, trying to do as much as possible with as little labor as possible. They are hiring at the very lowest possible wage that they can, and the benefits are so-so at best. I've started looking for other work when they also implemented a pay cap which prevents me from getting any raise ever again. It's a good job if you need hours but they'll make sure you won't qualify for full time by cutting your hours before you become established. A lot of companies in this field do that nowadays though. Odds are that if you look around and do your homework, you'll find another employer that will start you off at a higher starting wage. Also keep in mind that this is the parent company of QFC, King Soopers Dillons, Fred Meyers, Ralphs, Food 4 Less and a few others. I imagine they run those stores the exact same way."
bad,"I will never work here again if I can. The people, management, and coworkers are nice but I dislike that there is no room for growth."
bad,"A typical day at the KCC was coming into a hard working office environment, greeting and being greeted by friendly faces and sitting in front of a computer for 8 hours a day. I learned how to input information into the KCC systems as well as giving great customer service to the valued customers of Kroger companies. The management is never really around walking around the building, each specific area has a supervisor but working there i never met an actual manager. The hardest part of the job was keeping my numbers up. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with people that were willing to help you succeed and wanting you to grow within the company."
bad,"Lots of hours available for the hard worker, though the company as a whole does not have any compassion for workers families' schedules. No paid time off. I was denied vacation opportunity when I qualified. Union was ineffectual in pay premiums issues."
bad,"Some people that work there like to spread rumors & gossip and others like to do favoritism. It's not right and some of the managers don't care about you. Like if you have a family emergency, some people don't even care. They still make you stay off your phones, but are okay if others are on their phones. Favoritism!!"
bad,"Managers did not talk to each other about any issues brought up, no respect for set availability. Customers were usually very polite and were the highlight of the job, but treatment by managers made it miserable."
bad,"Not rewarded very often for doing a job well done.  Workplace culture is good, management does not seem to listen to feedback that is provided to them."
bad,Hated the management. No one knew anything that was going on. Managers were honestly the worst part. They never were willing to help associates. Also not a healthy working environment. Two people from produce died from lung cancer while I worked there.Neither were smokers. I honestly believe there was something wrong with the cooler that caused this.
bad,"Pick n Save is a nice job for a teen that's still in school but for a person that's trying to become successful and build upon their future, not a good ideal for a job."
bad,"While I am thankful for my job, it is not great.  Corporate does not consider employees.  They add more and more work and are cutting hours and pushing out good workers."
bad,Kroger pays employees very poorly and their is no emphasis on workplace enviornment. Most people do not enjoy their job and you are stuck dealing with difficult customers all day
bad,"Not only was management rude, but customers were as well, I got asked on numerous occasions if I spoke english. Management does not give workers incentive for advancement."
bad,"Not what i expected very disappointed, maybe will try a another position at a later date. Starting pay rate for job is horrible. Definitely not worth the amount of stress and work."
bad,Loved my team members but management not so much.Not many opportunities for advancement and the pay wasn't comparable to the work expected.Hard work didn't seem to be seem to be appreciated.
bad,"Kroger is an OK starter company for someone who has never worked in retail before. Do not expect to be treated fairly as the other employees unless you do everyone's work without complaint. The department heads will push as much work on the new employee as much as possible, and management does not see this as an issue. The new employee will receive all of the blame for tasks that are not accomplished on time, even if it is outside of that person's scope of responsibility. Store management refuses to correct these issues, which causes hard working employees to give up, and eventually seek new employment."
bad,"Management is inflexible and not understanding. Expectations are high for workers that show initiative, but not for most employees. The less work you do, the more you are rewarded."
bad,"working in produce was great till they flat out cut my hours out from under me, when i complained about it the manager said he would do something about it and never did"
bad,Not enough pay for what we deal with in customer service. Great people for the most part. Not a fun job to have unless you are in high school and just have it to make spending money.
bad,"Unfortunately, Kroger doesn't pay its technicians as well as it should. We deal with so much, even the pharmacists we work with think we need raises."
bad,it was an ok company to work for. the store i worked at needed better organization and more people in certain departments working
bad,The majority of the time the company is more concerned about making money than the safety of their customers and employees. They tend to worry about making money than keeping the people who work for them safe
bad,I worked third shift and was only getting 12 hours of work a week. I reported stolen products and then got fired a few days later. I reported that the person that also worked the same aisle as me didn't do the job correctly and the supervisor told me he knows and that they put up with it because the guys been there for so long.
bad,"I started on the first day as a Kroger employee with high expectations. I was disappointed with the organization of the store. The store of in itself is great but the management is faulty and almost never get much done. They are always pushing for customer acknowledgement and greeting and that is fine, but it sacrifices the quailty of work behind the scenes, like in the back. Stuff may or may not get done. It could be the department I specifically work there, but the my overall experience is decent and I at least learned somethings."
bad,"Starting pay is good for a high school student. After that it's horrible, hard to get a raise or move up. Management is the worst, don't appreciate their employees and expect them to do tasks that are out of their job description."
bad,"I've been with this company for awhile now. The culture used to be very inclusive and uplifting, but in the last few years the tone has gone downhill. It seems these days that everyone's worry is only about the bottom line, and there's little care for the employees of the company."
bad,People regularly work off the clock and expectations are off the charts. I did not see any future and medical accommodations are dismissed.
bad,I didn't like the way that the managers at Kroger talk at you instead of talking to you like a human being. Then the managers can change your schedule without telling you to make it seem like you know what time you had to be at work and then lie to the other managers and supervisor that they didn't change the schedule. They put a lot of work on you and inspect you to have it done before you shift is over. I feel like if the management can change their attitude and carry their selfs a little more professional it would be a great place to work. I like the company its just some of the customers attitude and management lack of professional skills.
bad,I worked for Kroger in high school and felt very much unwelcomed. Mostly adults work there but they hours aren't very good. I only had 14 hours and week.
bad,"They do care more about the customer's opinions than their own employees typically, Even if this is for the general improvement in customer service it does tend to make the employees feel less than important."
bad,Management doesn't want the best for you but whatever is best for them in scheduling.                                                                      .
bad,"I've never been paid so low, hours were NEVER consistent (I once had an EIGHT hour week, followed by a 35 hour week....what?????) Management never paid attention to us. NO benefits. Lead shift was the closest to a manager my department had and she had no authority. My co workers made the job bearable but in general I've never been so miserable working for a company."
bad,"Working as a barista in the licensed Starbucks, I was watched closely by two different companies that had differing ways on how to do things.  Also, within the Kroger company, many different managers (department, assistant, store) told me to do things that opposed what I was told to do that same day by a different manager."
bad,It started out fun but ended up not a nice place to work.  Bad morale and fast turn around of employees monthly. Not very stimulating job and at time excruciatingly boring. Fun part was helping the customers who always appreciated your time due to they couldn't find other employees that would actually help them.  Most misdirected the customer which really frustrated them.  I always helped till customer was satisfied even if it meant getting management in on the search for product. .
bad,"Great people is their mantra. It's what they call their employees. But for a multi-billion dollar company with lots of assets they don't share with their ""Great People"". They are another example of a big company that works their people to death for ridiculously low pay. They are always short handed because no one wants to work there because even Walmart pays more than they do!! I like the people I work with. They are really nice people who are underpaid and under appreciated!"
bad,"constant struggle to get on the same page, no work life balance on top of no compensation for the amount of hours you actually put in. raises and promotions are not given in the right way."
bad,"Good first job, but you will quickly outgrow this and there is no where else to go in this company. If you stay to long it will drain you of your energy and enthusiasm for life"
bad,"Stocked up all products for store opening every morning, learned to run a bakery. Did not like how management did things nor did i like how underhanded the team members were.Getting everyone to work together as a team,Resigning was the most enjoyable part"
bad,"One of the worst jobs I have ever had.  They expect you to check out customers, do the daily paper work, check all the temps, clean the store, unload two trucks, stock the store, and clean up the lot with only two people on staff during the day. I got yelled at for not taking out the trash before I left for the day when it was barely at half full. The District Manager is constantly coming into the stores putting down all the employees and blaming them for all the problems the district is currently having.  I would not recommend the company to anyone."
bad,"My co-workers were unfriendly, not team motivated, and lacked the want to finish the job task. Management, was unorganized, lacked the want to help employees, and rude. I learned the value of hard-work, and the ability to adjust with different personality types."
bad,i worked for the one in taylor and management there are very unprofessional. you tr to move up and they do not let you. the store manger there dose not like women.
bad,"I like working at Kroger but would like to find employment within my field of study. I want a more challenging career, and while Kroger is challenging because it seems no one in any store I've worked at communicates with each other as frequently as they should about issues that are important to know, such as replacing shifts when someone calls out."
bad,"This place works as a first job if you are in high school, but that's it. I don't recommend this to anyone with better options."
bad,"i highly reccomend against working for the company, management was poor and no room for advancement, also will never get paid a decent wage for what they ask. union is a joke."
bad,"Management always seems to be out to get you. They don't notice when you do your job significantly better than others, but they always notice the one time you do something wrong. "
bad,"Very poorly run and the management are far from trustworthy. On several occasions I had my department manger and the assistant manager lie to co-workers, the actual store director and myself. When I tried to provide evidence of said lie they refused to admit the mistake and quickly changed the topic. "
bad,"So,I got hired to work 3ed shift....that was cool but after being hired my 8-month nightmare started."
bad,Learned alot about the grocery industry. Met some good people. Hardly had any worthwhile managers. Pay is awful especially seeing how much money Kroger makes. The lack of decent pay also means that quality workers are hard to come by and definitely hard too keep around.
bad,I've worked here for years and they don't give raises. They give promotions to people that don't deserve them. As well as giving positions to employees that have not been given the proper training.
bad,"Local managers are more concerned with the size of their bonus instead of making sure the customers can get what they need. If you have high seniority then you have it made with some managers. They are concerned with looking good in the early morning and working the afternoon and evening shifts until they drop. Little to no help in the afternoons and during the busiest times of the day. Managers who talk ""follow the company guidelines"" yet actually do just the opposite, what gets them the biggest bonus. (lowest overtime, being set in the morning........) Unfortunately the best part of the job is when you actually get to go home at the end of your shift. The markup rate for products is HIGH in some cases it is in the 40% range."
bad,"The good news is that as a Kroger manager you are within full control of everything inside the four walls of your store.  You have control of hiring, firing, pricing, product placement, inventory, markup, etc.  The bad news is that you probably won't ever get to leave the store - other than maybe six hours per day to sleep, eat a bowl of soup and change clothes."
bad,"Kroger thinks that you should not have any other job when hired. They hire a bunch of folks part time only, no health benefits until after a year only if you are working a lot of hours. The issue is they schedule you for not many hours. Kroger is basically catered to the student in school or retirees. Basically they do not work around your schedule you have to work around theirs."
bad,"Job Work/Life Balance: The scheduling makes no sense. Schedules go out on Thursday, can be changed without warning until Friday, and go online late Saturday. There's no way to make plans more than a few days out, after you have the schedule. You can request days off, but they aren't guaranteed."
bad,"I love produce, don't get me wrong but Kroger is the worst grocery chain in America. You have almost no room to move up the totem pole and raises are non existent no matter how hard or long you work. The managers were very insecure and abused their power greatly, sometimes to the point where it's almost like they forget you're human. The corporation does not listen to employee concerns and whenever you need time off to visit family out of town (granted it was during the holidays) they make you feel extremely guilty for it. It's a great job if you're 16 and in high school but after high school it is not a job for anyone trying to make a living."
bad,"Company provides minimal training and inadequate preparation for external hires in management."
bad,"This is no place you would want to make a career, that is unless you like being stepped on, humiliated, and worked like a dog. They set expectations that are great, but follow them up with formulas and tools telling you how many hours you need to complete the task and then give you about 25% less time than you actually need. The pay is somewhat acceptable, as it is easy to move up the pay scale and advancement can be done in 3-5 years into a management position. Once you have that position though, goodbye home life."
bad,seems alright as a first job or second job while in still in school. Fun work place with supportive management. Decent amount of hours with decent amount of hours.
bad,"I was promised experience pay when i was hired on, though when i got my paycheck, i saw it was minimum wage, they say my experience didn't count. I was a Cake Decorator coming in with 3 years of experience from another store. They promised me 30 hours a week but kept me at 39 so I wouldn't hit full time benefits. "
bad,"The whole atmosphere was chaotic.  Managers were constantly changing was were the responsibilities and some people obviously knew how to use the mangers to escape work.  Maybe it was my store, but wouldn't ever think about reapplying to Pick n Save."
bad,"I only worked there for a short period of time but when I did I didn't really like the manager I worked under. She would make huge messes and I would have to clean them up. Also, their training isn't done very well. It is good if you want a temporary job until you can get a better one."
bad,"Management plays favorites, Raises and promotions are not qualification based, or merit based.  Everything is strictly distributed based on who is friends with who.  Very stressful, uptight atmosphere."
bad,"Kroger's is a company that will work you to the physical bone without regard of your own safety and or well being, maybe this is just my experience from the management team I worked with, but with the paying wage ($7.55) as well as the hours (16hr - 32hr) it simply is not common place these days in 2015 and makes it so that you MUST find a secondary job simply to survive."
bad,"Great experience, horrible job. "
bad,its not the best job krogers but it is a job and it is a pay check i wortked my butt off there never had enought hours there and i love working too
bad,"The stores previous assistant store managers knew me, and seemed to understand my need to work the morning/day shift. And I was thoroughly disappointed in our union rep., who misled me. I paid the union dues weekly, only to find that (the union) does not care about the individual any longer.  I had been asking for the day shift for over a year, due to childcare for my 4 yr. old."
bad,"I mostly took care of customers on the front end cashiering and supervising speed zones. Also would work bakery, stocking once in a while. Good experience."
bad,"My day is filled with pushing carts, bagging groceries, cleaning, and making customers feel welcome.  Interacting with the customers and coworkers are the most rewarding parts in my day.  What I did not like about working at Kroger was how I only had computer training, and then I had to figure everything out myself or with the help of a few co-workers.  I also believed I was passed up on a few opportunities to become a cashier.  No one gave me a good reason why they couldn't take the time to train me.  Myself and many of my co-workers found that I wasn't being treated fairly when we witness our new co-workers being trained on the register.  When I asked to be trained on the register I was brushed off.  It is hard when Kroger gets crowded.  When Kroger is swamped we become unorganized.  Usually there are not many workers scheduled on those day and it is harder to collect the carts quick enough for the consumers.  All in all Kroger has room for improvement."
bad,"I worked for them seasonal. I would have loved to stay with them. They were telling me the whole time ""You'll be able to go to part time and stay."" When it came to the end of my last work I was looking forward to seeing the next weeks schedule, but it never came."
bad,I would go in and help customers load there food into bags and helped take them to their cars. I would clean up my area where I was working.
bad,The job duties were not worth the pay. Managment was very friendly and understanding yet they lack the proper leadership skills.
bad,"Co-workers were very polite and always welcomed a new face, it was a great place to work. Management was most of the time negative and never appreciated the work and performance that you provided. I gained many new friends and made great connection with customers, it was truly worth the bad part of the day knowing that when you clocked out you excelled in providing and helping at least one customer who you know is going to spread the word."
bad,"Promises made and never followed through with, being thrown around the store doing random different tasks not in job description"
bad,"Overworked, high expectations, night crew gets treated like dogs. The night people are the backbone of this company and yet management treats them like slaves."
bad,"You are never able to plan your own week, Your life revolves around Kroger. You get your new schedule two days before the week starts so you are left out of almost all plans for family and friends. Managers will chastise and humiliate employees in front of customers. They act like they value their employees, but they gave a 5 year service award to a guy who was only there for 2 months because they confused him for someone who looked nothing like him."
bad,"Clean up after previous shift, am or pm. low expectations from supervisors. no assistance with career advancement. Management, some are good and some are bad. co-workers are allowed to leave tasks unfinished so others must finish and clean up after them, there is a culture of sloppiness. the hardest part of the job is trying to do a good job while working with others who do not care. It has taken over a year to be able to add my family onto insurance. The customers and the production work is the most enjoyable part of this job."
bad,"Typical day I Make coffee, count money, Stock cabinet."
bad,When I first started with the company I started with a very positive attitude and advanced quickly due to my education and people skills. Unfortunately the management at my store has changed over quite a bit and I've had to learn how to work under the direction of an array of different ... and let's just say unqualified managers. Along with a strict and negative atmosphere I have found myself falling into a rut. I'm an overall positive person but I feel like I no longer belong at a company that lacks in employee equality and a positive work place.
bad,"*A typical day at work is full of fun vibes from some of the people I work with, fast pace "
bad,"I only worked there for 20 days and was expected to pick up everything in that time.  Training is minimal.  If you don't have previous experience, this is not the job for you.  The co-workers seemed nice enough at least the ones I met, but they seem disgruntled.  Store is continually turning over and I had many customers wondering what happened to the old crew.  Couldn't tell them because I didn't know."
bad,"Typical day was to open doors at 8am, put away stock, run a register, and customer service."
bad,"Its okay for a good start as a first job, I wouldn't go back there if I was looking for a career."
bad,Everyday was unique. Very friendly employees. I learned to treat every customer with respect to be helpful to them.
bad,"Basically, you work, get yelled at by management the whole time even when you are clearly doing your job correctly. Poor training, and poor service towards employees."
bad,"Kroger pay the baggers little to money they max out at 8.00 dollars but there job consist of a lot they clean the bathrooms, clean messes take back unwanted items, get carts in rain heat and snow and so much more. The managers do not stand up for there employees they let customers curse you out threaten you and they just give the customer whate ever it is they wont and then they appologize to the customer when all you where doing was doing what you was told. They have rules they want you to but when a customer complains about those rules instead of standing up for the people that work for them they appologize to the customer and give them everything they wont making it a big problem for employees to feel confident in there work"
bad,"When i started working at pick n save... it was a pretty decent gig. I came in knowing expectations and that i would be able to accomplish the work left for me. It was the same routine and the people were positive. Many things changed and by the time i left this year.... many people had already fled. Roundy's is making some bad moves in a lot of peoples' opinions. It shows, they are now understaffed, they keep cutting where they shouldn't and they are looking to get ""refresh"" the labor pool so often... try to get their skilled employees to leave to make way for the cheap clunky labor ... then come down hard on the fresh meat. I do not miss it at all."
bad,There was no typical work day. I really enjoyed the flexibility of being able to be off on weekdays however I work all holidays and weekends. it made it difficult to raise a family with small children.
bad,Start the day off by checking with management. After getting info I get right to work
bad,"I totally could not survive off the pay, the hours are unfair and the management is poor."
bad,well the work at Kroger is pretty busy and long depending on your shift. there many jobs to be complete before u leave.
bad,"Not as bad as you think. This job is fun sometimes, and you meet a lot of interesting people. Some are really nice and other you just want to leave, but it's a pretty easy job otherwise."
bad,"The location I worked at was a very negative and depressing place. The management was great at putting people down and not recognizing all that they have done for the company. The management was also not ever available to discuss time off or ideas to change work schedule."
bad,Good place to work if your a college student but not if your looking for a career.
bad,Great customers and hard workers. This store does not know how to appreciate there employees. Glad i had a great supervisor and learned a lot about Produce.
bad,Kroger would be a great company to work for if it weren't for the managers
bad,"Kroger was not a place that made me proud to work there, the managers were unfair, inexperienced, and seemed lost. I was encouraged to lie and cover other people's lies more than following rules and being responsible. equipment is always broken and there is no maintenance staff available."
bad,"check out customers, clean bathrooms, mop floors. Co workers were fun to work with, but the supervisors and managers talked down to you too much, like you didn't know what your responsibilities were."
bad,the customers and associates are great but management doesn't back up anyone and no one is held accountable for their actions
bad,I can say I have defiantly gained the experience I hoped to when I started this position. It is a very fast paced job and keeps you busy the whole day through. That is one of the things I do enjoy about it. Management isn't always on the same page when it comes to some issues. I believe it is more a lack of communication. Overall I know they mean well and do the best that they possibly can at their job. I really enjoy my co-workers in the pharmacy. We all get along really well and the environment is very laid back and comfortable. I'm not sure what I would consider the hardest part of my job to be. I love what I do. Just knowing that you are one of the steps in helping patients in illness and staying well means a lot and makes you feel good about yourself.
bad,Kroger was not an ideal place to work due to the total disregard of it's employees and lack of knowledge of the work preformed at the Kroger Distribution Center.
bad,Customer service job and very enjoyable environment to work in with fun co-workers. Management styles on the other side are the worse I have come across. No attention to health problems arising due to chemicals being used by employees. Management does not comply with union rules nor company policy.Have witnessed use of food being dropped on floor and being re-put back into cases.
bad,"A typical day at work consists of a lot of frustration due to the lack of knowledge from fellow employees. Simple things such stocking the shelves properly with new inventory/overstock. I feel that management does not address certain situations properly, if at all."
bad,"Working here is not that great of a job. The pick n save I worked at was very un-organized. Scheduals were all over the place. Many people would call in and we would be short on positions. I love the co-workers and some of the managment. The hiring manager was very rude and was not very reasonable. The store director was just the same, also not very friendly with his/her Co-workers. i enjoyed the social part of the job. Did not like working the late hours every night with school even though i requested that i not be put on it for educational purpouses."
bad,A typical day at work would be to clock in right away count drawer and help customers need...
bad,The hours are crazy but they work really well with you if you go to school
bad,"I hated this job with a passion, the work was hard n it never was any down time. it was so much to do and never enough people to help do it."
bad,I usually i had a good day when it came to the customers. The employees were pinned against each other.
bad,"I had been with this company for 6 years. always tried to move up a step for a better career. I was always denied. A typical day at work included cashiering and thats about it. I was never allowed to talk to emloyees, develop relationships with regular customers or advance in the company. Management was never helpful with my schedule of having to care for my daughter and her school. "
bad,"Immature management that brings personal life to work; hardest part of the job was standing all day; great coworkers, poor management choices"
bad,"lots of fast paced work for very low pay! co workers are great. Managers always assume your not getting work done. Upon asking and you tellin everything is done now you can start orders they add on other assignments, knowing you have a deadline to get orders prepared. There is no sink near working area which makes completing orders take 3x as long."
bad,"A typical day at work is very boring. I enjoy a fast pace and the deli is not. Overall it is very repetitive. I learned how to decorate cakes which I really enjoy. Management seems like a joke, the schedule is often wrong sometimes even scheduling just one person to close. My co workers are very friendly and definitely the most enjoyable part of the job, but most of them are looking for new jobs also."
bad,It was a good working environment until i started to feel uncomfortable as if because I'm black i was laid off. I worked as hard as any and every co worker at that job and i was still laid off two months later.
bad,"I worked for Kroger 12 years, wish I would have left a lot sooner. I worked about 50-60 hours a week and six days on holiday weeks. Kroger is Unionized, which makes life as a manager VERY difficult. I was near impossible to terminate poor performing employees. Upper management did not give clear view of company expectations, and did not hold themselves, nor subordinates, to professional behavior."
bad,"You get no health benefits for 2 years, and this company is a prime example of dodging giving benefits by hiring many people for <20 hours a week each to avoid allowing them to use the healthcare (once they do get it) that they are still paying for with each paycheck. It was terribly unorganized and many of the Clerks and Baggers were nowhere to be found when they were needed. It is a frustrating job where they will always want more out of you than you give, so many of the workers simply showed up, and were expected to do nothing more because they showed they could do nothing more. The customers were allowed to run rampant, and instead of solving a problem, whether it was the customer's fault or the courtesy clerks, they would hand the customer discounts and coupons, while punishing the Courtesy Clerk. The turnover rate is very high, and after working there for 6 months, i could easily see why."
bad,- Do others job for little pay
bad,"poor management, negative environment, unreasonable scheduling no appreication.."
bad,"In all kroger is one of those jobs that its great if you know a higher up boss that can open all the doors for you. If you don't, the paths to positions worth achieving in this company are closed. Its nothing more than a dead end job. The fact is that I have been employed here for 4 and a half years, and ive had over 13 raises, and two promotions, work full time, and still make $10 an hour. Despite the fact i have an exemplary work record. And my route to college was shut down when my h.r. rep said that if i went to college it would mean id lose my full time and healthcare."
bad,- Typical Day would be stressful
bad,"The only few good things I can say about this company are the trade of work I was in, and the few employees I got along with. The company itself doesn't care or try to take care of it's employees. The pay rates are horrible. They never follow through with what they tell you. Kroger only cares about the next dollar it's going to make, and not its employees. You were expected to show up to work, no matter if you were sick, or had a family death. When I got hired on, I was told I would be paid X amount after my probation period because I came with experience. I never got close to that amount, and I was there for almost two years."
bad,"They were ok the managment was power hungry and a joke but the rest was not so bad even with working with the public, and the benfits were ok too"
bad,It was a nice experience and the coworkers etc were very friendly and polite.
bad,ran a cash register and greeted customers.
bad,"After working for a Kroger Fuel Center for just over a year I can say that the Company is poorly organized. My Fuel Lead was not trained properly to perform her job and duties, this was no fault of her own but due to the Managers. As a lower end Fuel Attendant, I was never sure of who exactly was the head boss. As to say, who was giving the orders and who was taking them. The only thing I knew for sure was that my Lead was my immediate supervisor and that's who I followed."
bad,most of the management were very rude. most of my co workers were in high school and they kept the job enjoyable for the most part
bad,The problem with Kroger is that they don’t have enough people  personally I was always left to do other people’s jobs and never promoted for it  I was basically a manager when I was there but getting paid for a basic job  that’s why I left
bad,"They are constantly hiring even though they are already cutting back hours on current employees. In the last five months as a part-time employee who is trained in every department, I was getting 25-35 hours for about 6-7 weeks and abruptly have been cut down to 4-16 hours for the past 2 weeks and the upcoming 2 weeks. Trying to find a new job now."
bad,"From store management to the HR department and upwards, the Kroger company focuses on brown nosing to get ahead, often ignoring the most qualified for the position. The needs of the customer are so far placed above the needs of the employee, that employees suffer on a daily basis. The company frequently breaks its own rules and policies, working the bare minimum skeleton crew and ignoring the customer complaints of needing additional help."
bad,They don’t help at all everytime there is a problem everything is always the person doing it fault and they never try and change anything you always have a million things on yours back at once
bad,"Unfortunately i have worked at a few of their stores but store #710 is beyond the worst for management and support to both the employees and to customers."
bad,I have broken out of a shell from being forced to interact with customers and co-workers at a constant rate throughout everyday at work. I have also learned skills like cutting meat and how to run a business efficiently as far as what looks good on paper as well as create an environment in which meeting the expectations for the company possible with a limited crew. I am grateful for these qualities.
bad,This company asks to much out of to few workers. Not to pat myself on the back or anything but everytime I go in to Kroger's the workers that I still know always tell me how much they miss having me there and that I got screwed period
bad,The pay wasn't enough to deal with the utter nonsense of the job. We were thrown into other departments that we didn't belong in due to short staffing.
bad,Would like to feel like I’m a vital part of the company! There is no recognition for your hard working efforts! Turn over is unbelievable! You can never get stable because people quit all the time!
bad,"Kroger no longer cares about it's associates, be it management or hourly.  They have been slowly drifting away from that mentality for a while now.  Soul sucking environment that proves on a daily basis it does not care about the people working there."
bad,"Some managers where cool, other did nothing and others where very racist. Manger had no respect for there employees. I wouldn't work there again. Honestly wouldn't refer it either"
bad,Management was not supportive. Customer concerns were not addressed. Service levels needed to be improved and were not.  It became stressful to work even on a part time basis.
bad,"Very understaffed. Store level management doing the best they can with what they have. Corporate has unreal expectations. "
bad,"A typical day at work would be full of stress because of how busy the store is. I have learned that customers will be rude to you over things that are out of your control. Management will not help you until a customer makes them. Communication was very lazy and the schedule was not flexible unless you have worked there for years. The culture was okay, my coworkers made it easier. The hardest part of my job was being by myself and dealing with all the customers at night. The most enjoyable part of my job was having the help of some of my coworkers when I needed it."
bad,I was excited to work there at first but then as I continued to work there I realized the place and management was horrible at the place I worked would never go back to that one
bad,if you don't like dealing with an upset customer because they are hungry and can't find what they need don't work here while yes overall its a good job its not for everyone
bad,It suprised me thru me back on first dAY CHRISMAS EVE BYMYSELF no traing and walked off. Sadly if you had any questions or problems or issues you had no clue who to ask . talk to one manager they send you to another and another and then send you back to the first one . Half the time you coulnt find them unless they were walking around shopping. The place was a jk.
bad,They want you to work like a horse but only start you at minimum wage and only get raises after hundreds of hours worked. The raises are usually 10-20 cents
bad,Not a fan. Just really not the best company culture and sometimes boring. Looking for a challenge currently and I don't receive that. Good first job but time to move.
bad,"It might not be every Kroger, but mine was awful. The management did nothing but shirk duties off on others way less qualified than them. People had minimal training, and management would constantly hit on shoppers. 6 hour work days turned into 12-13 hour work days due to poor management. Would not recommend to anyone."
bad,"I've been there for over five & a half years, every opportunity for full time almost in impossibility unless you try to become a manager. Though the overall management is neurotic and narcissistic & you do feel at times you're going to lose your job if somebody isn't happy there. It's not a bad place if you're looking for a part-time but long-term?..too stressful can be a fun place at time"
bad,I have been working at the 627 Kroger since it opened. About 4 months ago my old grocery manager left. The new one is unfit for the job. He doesnt listen to schedule request and he constantly tries to get you to work overtime. On top of that HR refuses to give me medical benefits. Instead I have received every benefit but medical.
bad,Not enough worker you apply for one thing you be working all around the store cause someone else call off or just cause no worker manger are racist call you by the color of your skin and not your name everybody talking about people in the store not a good pay for the work you doing
bad,"Not a fun place to work, too strict on some workers but not equal with others. Unfair working conditions. "
bad,Home and work life suck. Hours suck cuz you never know when you work or dont and the pick your schedule sucks. It's all about seniority over knowledge. It's also who you know and what you know that gets you privileges. The pay is minimum wage.
bad,"Night Shift Work is easy money, all you have to do is unload pallets and take the products for your assigned isle and restock the shelf's, not very hard. "
bad,"Very low income as expected with a retail job. But the work life balance was nonexistent. Management was nice and willling to work with you as best as possible, But if a customer had any sort of complaints no matter what the situation is you get ""reprimanded"" accordingly.   No paid Lunch its 30 minutes. Like really a million $$$ dollar corporation cant pay 30 minutes for someone to eat and get the nutritional needs they need for focus and strength to complete ""great customer service"" or ""job execution"". You're just a number in the corporate flock"
bad,The location I work at isnt that great. Management does not care about employees and are mean to employees.  they also mock some of them as well. The pay is not a livable wage for being a full time employee. And they talk about becoming a specialist or a back up for departments and then they beat around the Bush and never actually certify anyone. Because of that you do way more work than what you are paid to be doing.
bad,"Kroger  company has changed so much since I was first hired. I have worked for 4 store managers and the most recent is the worst man I have ever met. He tells associates that work is more important than their education and family. The only good part of the job is when I am actually allowed to do my job, which is a rarity, I am more often than not checking out customers instead of working my truck and running my department."
bad,harassed by manager by everything dont finish your task early manager will find something for you to do even if it's not in your job description manager will find a reason to send you home or fire your
bad,"Please do not make this a career. This is not a place to grow or advance, this is just a job to earn money. If you have real career potential in something good, this job will not satisfy you. Good place for students working through school."
bad,Kroger is an ok place to work if your living with family or if your spouse has a job. They will work you 40 hours a week but you won't be considered full time.
bad,"Management lacks professionalism, they also pick favorites among the employees in the store. Department managers will either make or break the department which will cause the associates in the specific department to either do good or slack off. Learned customer service skills though."
bad,work there for 3 years went through 6 managers. The good managers were run off. I firmly believe your management team should set the example... the company itself need to question when turn over sky rockets.
bad,you can never do enough or or do anything good enough!!!!!!!!!!~~!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the worst place i have ever worked!  they treat their employees like bad!
bad,"First off, this job genuinely did not know how to fire people. Not that they didn't want to. They genuinely did not know how to process termination. Due to this the majority of the employees run rampant leaving a few loyal employees to do the majority of the work."
bad,I enjoyed my time while I was there. Left because higher management changes that were making things worse and not better for employees. Not a lot of advancement opportunity.
bad,The pay doesn’t match up with the work put out on the job management are harassing because of postion I wouldn’t advise this being your first option no hours and no pay for shifts
bad,"Zero advancement potential at Kroger. You are stuck and will never go anywhere. Also, Managers are not knowledgeable on anything and actually make horrilbe managment decisions that decrease the moral of the entire department."
bad,"My time at Kroger was met with some nice people however I wasn’t treated well at all. I wasn’t paid on time and when I asked about it they told me it was my fault and that I needed to ask for my payment and when I asked I was told it wasn’t ready. They had never given me an actual schedule and the schedule I asked for was 4pm-9pm, however they gave me work times such as 8am-2pm."
bad,Management was out of control with the employees and treated the floor better than they did their own employees. Store Management couldn't of been more oblivious to the workplace issues or that they just didn't care. Co-workers were VERY competitive with their jobs which at times made work more fun but it mostly just caused tension between co-workers
bad,"Well, I unload the perishable truck, which is dairy, produce, and meat department. I work in produce, and they make me bring everybody pallet off the truck, then expect me to put up every last vegetable that’s in produce in the back room. Management only respect you when you talk to them Crazy. Everyone basically looking out for themselves couldn’t trust no one in that store !"
bad,Hate the way the company is changing for the worse and not better. Management walks all over employees. Doesn’t follow union book. Managers don’t get enough training before getting huge stores to run. No support.
bad,"management is always changing so your work life is in a constant change. you pay union dues but never hear from the union, and when its time for a new contract they don't involve the employees"
bad,I worked my way up the chain. Running multiple depts. until I reached the management chain. I loved this company. Until the culture changed. They no longer valued the in store knowledge of the 20 yr employee. They wanted new 20 yr kids out of a college classroom so they could brain wash them into thinking their way. Promotions were given to a piece of paper with no experience.
bad,I have worked night shifts. It completely depends on who you are working for and who you are working with. Not a bad gig as long as your supervisors are not greedy or self centered.
bad,"Management and corporate micromanaged to the point of stress induced panic attacks. I went in every day and left feeling sick and anxious. Corporate does not prioritize their people, instead they choose the customer over policies that THEY put in place. Some managers truly cared about their employees and felt for them, while other managers put their work load on us and talked behind our backs and spread rumors. This place was just like being back in high school... drama, ridiculous criticism, and rumors. A major lack of appreciation and disrespect daily. But what do you expect with a retail job?"
bad,My immediate manager and her attitude toward others was the main reason for my leaving.  My coworkers are good people and I wish them all the best. My first manager was good but the last manager I had was not organized and had power issues.
bad,Overall Kroger itself is not a bad company but the people I worked under was difficult on multiple occasions. To include harassment from other employees that was not rectified in a timely manner. I believe they are doing a lot better as they have moved different management in and out.
bad,"the management runs everyone into the ground. there is no integrity and they don't care about any one's safety. a lot of lip service and no action. "
bad,During my tine working for the maple point drive store i became close with my cowprkers. Almost all of which were fantastic; however i never felt respected by management. Issues would arise and never be resolved and blame just got pushed around. I felt under appreciated even when i went out of my way.
bad,The management was terrible. Scheduling was not organised properly. Training was required but never scheduled. When asked for manager approval for a process at checkout said manager always seemed put out/annoyed to do their job.
bad,"I’ve worked at the newest Centerville location for 2 years (since it first opened). Due to recent shifts in store management, it’s always high-stress, hectic, and overall a toxic environment. Hours are constantly being cut and we’re always SUPER understaffed. Management only cares about numbers and not about providing a quality customer experience or about the well-being of their employees, which makes tensions high 24/7. I just graduated from college so I’m currently trying to find a higher-paying job to pay off my loans. The pay is ok for teenagers who are just starting out, but it’s definitely not enough for recent college graduates or for those who need to provide for their families."
bad,"Front end management is very poor, no leadership skill. Don't have any Human Relation Skills. Pay is poor and hours are demanding. Pay wages is not up to standard."
bad,"When I started it wasn't terrible. Since then however, you have next to no help to get your job done. Our store brings in a million a week some times a day on holidays and you will still find yourself the only person in the department for an extended amount of time. "
bad,"Been here 3 years I have witnessed,  seen and heard a lot at Kroger.   Part-timers get blamed and dragged through the mud for everything that isn't completed;  where fulltimers can coast, make excuses,  float and leave early whenever.   Management allows it because they have their favorites in place and/or kiss butts.   Management also don't fire these associates often in fear of having to pay for the insurances so putting up with bums collecting a weekly check doing the bare minimums is tolerated.  So why not pick on partimers: they only get about 16-31 hrs a week (give or take holiday rushes),  they are ""the janitor crew"" and treated like trash by management. Most parttimers at my store are teens,  people of color and older people trying to build on their 401k before retiring and we're literally overworked  and held to an unrealistic standard against full-timers.  It's not like you get rewarded since seniority trumps contributions of being a hardworker.  To close the rant,  here is a tip to all my parttimers at Kroger: keep documentation aka close out sheets or keep a mini notepad of everything you do throughout your work shift dated, timed and don't lose it!  That way if a lead,  supervisor and management tries scapegoating you on something not being done you have your proof.   Trust me,  it helps!   When I first started Kroger a few of my coworkers (fulltimers of course) tried throwing me under the bus and I almost lost my job.  After that,  I realized I couldn't trust anyone at Kroger."
bad,A typical day at this job was almost always stressful. I didnt really learn much here. The management was not the greatest. Workplace culture was not great.
bad,"The projects for which I was hired were constantly having dates pushed out due to poor planning and foresight in other divisions. Leadership took no responsibility and looked to me for constant updates and process improvement when no processes were in place to begin with. ""Busy work"" was created departmentally which was unnecessary. I thought working at Kroger might be amazing but at best this department is semi-functional mainly due to unprofessional, bumbling leadership."
bad,"Kroger, in my experience, is no respecter of personal boundaries. When asked to stay late, or take an unscheduled shift, a simple ‘no thanks’ doesn’t suffice. They want to know why. As if it’s any of their concern. Remember, they’re paying less than $8/hr. "
bad,"I worked at Kroger for 3 years consecutively and I had 2 minor promotions with no pay rise. I also ended up having to resign because of family issues and i went back to find that the company only got worse. Kroger does not care about their employees and they do not compensate them for the amount of work they ask them to do. They hire you on for a specific position, but then they tack on extra responsibilities that are above your pay grade and don't even give you a chance for advancement. If they do, it's in their time-frame and they don't even care about the desires of their employees. Kroger only uses their people and they don't have any empathy or sympathy for folks. They need to be gotten rid of. The honest truth is, everyone has started to leave Kroger. Kroger has gotten away from values and principles that they founded the company on and not only have they lost employees, but the volume of customers has decreased as well. Kroger just isn't as good as they used to be overall."
bad,"I have worked for Fry’s for almost a year now and it feels like management never wants to support me in any way. There’s even been an assistant manager who’s told another worker that I was never going to get promoted, ever. I give a lot to my store and it doesn’t feel great to get mistreated and blamed because the management likes to play favorites. I even got written up off of hear say but the management put it down as “poor job performance”"
bad,"Lack of leadership, have no idea what their doing.  Worked in the packaging category where Director reported false savings  to meet savings goals.  VP is out of touch and not relevant in the competitive market.   Turnover is more than 50% and workforce left do not have training or skill set to do the work ."
bad,"If you're 18 to 20 something, work there ONLY during the summer, get quick money, save the money, then leave with the quickness. This particular division of Kroger does not have proper communication, ridiculous standards, and unheard of demands. Do NOT work here. Stay away!"
bad,"Management is cutthroat, hours are sparse and missing a shift due to emergency or illness requires documentation the provided insurance required nearly an entire days wages as a copay to acquire said doctors note. "
bad,"I was stocking shelves at night. It was physically exhausting. It was third shift. Pay was weekly, so that was good. It's not the best job. It's not the worst job."
bad,"The only benefit to working at Kroger is that they give health insurance to part-time employees. It's not good insurance, but it's better than nothing. They treat a very limited employee discount as part of the compensation package and use it as an excuse to underpay everyone. You're overworked and underscheduled. They make sure you do 40 hours worth of work every week while only scheduling you 20 hours. They offer a 401(k) but hourly employees have to put their contributions into company stock in order to get a match. There is no such thing as advancement with this company. I worked there almost three years and only saw one person formally move into a new position above what he previously was. He got no pay increase to go along with it. Pay is AWFUL."
bad,Management changes not for the better.  Unrealistic expectations. Not conducive to feedback from associates. Too many changes too quickly with no time for verification/validation.
bad,"I would not recommend working stock at Kroger at any point. The pay is usually awful with no benefits for part time and limited for those on full time. I was paid 8.15$ hourly, but others in the deli or meat department made upwards of 10.00$ for doing practically the same work. The management is so lazy that they relied on a 23 year old manager to basically pick up all their work that they were too lazy to do themselves. The only positive was the sometimes discounted groceries and the people were generally nice."
bad,Pay isn't that great and management usually sucks. They hound you about getting the work done and don't care about your personal life and if you have an emergency done and have to miss work they act as if it's a burden and that you're putting them out
bad,"Because of closing multiple stores, many people lost jobs, positions, senority and pay. It is obvious the compny no longer cares for the individual.  I find it all but impossible to balance my work schedule with a healthy home life"
bad,"Worked there for YEARS and let go because management and supervision were unorganized on their point systems. Work you to death then get mad at you because you were late(on an overtime day that was not given to me with their 24hr notice) after working 71 hours the week before. No acknowledgement of the overtime times you willingly work because no one else would. Management/supervision and HR have no proper education or skills. They just pull people from the floor and give them the title. Extra points if they speak Spanish, but can't answer a simple insurance question(HR)"
bad,"Pay is below the national average. Our department and line of work had almost zero chance for advancement or promotion. When I first started there were fun events and perks and bonuses, those have all gone away. The health insurance is decent. They are quickly becoming more of a technology company than a grocer."
bad,not the best place to work when grown and need a career. nothing wrong with having a side job and working there. management will rip you off when hiring and will only hire part time but make you work full time.
bad,"Management was unsympathetic regarding time outside of work, especially for a young high school student. There was always work to be done so time went by quickly. The most difficult part of the job was the scheduling and the most fun part of the job was the relationship with other employees."
bad,"On a typical day, there were a lot customers.I did love the customers a lot.They were sweet to me. I learned how to be nice to others and how to help people out. The management I did not like the management at Kroger because they worked me a lot of hours. The workplace culture was I loved greeting the customers and having conversations with them. The hardest part of the job was getting carts and doing more than one thing at a time and bagging when there was a lot to bag. The most enjoyable part of the job was the breaks and meeting new people."
bad,"Abusive supervisors and managers who cuss and yell at you on the floor in front of customers, no extra pay for supervising, very little training but was expected to know everything, managers/supervisors have selective memory so you need to have a witness when discussing important issues, union takes our money every week but does very little for the employees for example union representative not saying one word to backup employees during a grievance meeting"
bad,The stress that upper management put on everyone was unbareable. My heart litterally hurt every time i had to go in. The life/ work balance was non resistant. If you went over and beyond once that is their new expectation of you each and everyday. The reality verses expection was very scewed and there was no way to do 1w hours of work in the 8 hours they gave you.
bad,"I was working 30 hours a week while being a full time high school student. Then toward the end of the school year (now) I am getting no hours, at all. Due to the managers who handle the scheduling."
bad,"Managers were not allowed to hire/fire based on race, sex, or sexuality, but they sure do love to gossip. Coworkers can be friendly, but are more often than not teenagers who don't care to put in work. Customer base is the best part of the job. Management will overwork you without fighting for your rights as a worker."
bad,Too many task to be performed. Kroger wants technicians to perform clinical activities and they don't feel confident enough to be successful. Pushing the boundaries of clinical interventions and health screenings that pharmacists may not be qualified to do.
bad,Seniority matters. Once your at top pay its no room for advancement. Kroger gives second chances to people they like. There are times were associate have been fired multiple time and got their jobs back. There are times were associate get fired once and don't get their job back. Its no consistency.
bad,"The management here is terrible. When I injured on the job, management tried to sweep it under the rug, and I was never paid for my paid time off. After going to the Union over the situation, management treated me terrible, until I eventually was sick of it and left."
bad,"schedule may be flexible but the stress isn't.  it's mostly female cashiers so it's like high school for middle aged women. constant bickering, gossiping and competition management affection.  "
bad,"Kroger is a miserable place to work and it gets worse all the time.  The money and benefits are good for management, but that's the only good part about working there.  You work 50+ hours every week, and they can force mandatory, uncompensated over time any time they feel like it.  Your schedule constantly changes, so it's impossible to make any kind of appointments.  It's impossible to keep good help because the pay for hourly employees isn't very good and the hours for the store are constantly getting cut, even though the amount of work the company expects from everyone is constantly increasing.  Upper management at Kroger is a nightmare.  They tell you to be uplifting to your staff, but they never have anything but negativity for you.  They give you impossible goals, then beat you down when you don't achieve them.  I wouldn't recommend this company to anyone."
bad,"I tired to enjoy working at Kroger's but their willingness to force you to coming as early as possible after school and writing you up if you were even a minute late is absurd. while upper management was nice the direct management were terrible. some would yell at the handy capped works and ""Forget"" breaks."
bad,"Number one1 Grocery Retailer That Has Lost It’s Identity.  Division leadership that lack knowledge and desire to learn about this regions culture. Good old boy mentality. Promotions are not based on merit but instead on who you know.  The company is continuously chasing one competitor or another randomly, shifting focus and attention."
bad,"there is no work life balance. Kroger always has to come first. The pay is not  enough to cover cost of living, YET THEY WONT WORK AROUND SECOND JOBS. management runs the store like its a sick experiment to see how he can pissoff employees. management also runs and hides from confrontations with customer leaving employees to take the brunt of customer anger rather than growing a pair.   promotions are to be given by seniority not who kisses butt most"
bad,"Stay away. There were very poor management in the store that I worked in. The managers showed favoritism, and they mistreated workers . They never gave me a weekend off. Sometimes not even the ones I requested off."
bad,"Very unorganized.Unprofessional.Lack of care. Kroger was not the greatest place to to work . I worked 12-30 not consistent at all, but I worked more like 70 hours of work in 30hours I with the amount of work I did. No one did their job . Would not recommend"
bad,"This was kind of awhile ago, so I dont really have much in the way of specifics. It wasnt a good job, by any means, and they didnt particularly do anything to make it that way. They know they have an unlimited supply of new hires from the college, so everyone is expendable and thats how they treat you."
bad,The amount of paperwork needed to do a simple job takes more time to do than it takes to do the job. The management adds unneeded stress with unrelated tasks. The job is very fast paced which is good but becoming more and more unrealistic every day.
bad,"I had fun working here until the costumers started becoming rude more frequently and until two of my co-workers got me fired and arrested over a joke, and we would joke daily together and that’s what honestly makes me not like the Kroger company or the way management(corporate) does things."
bad,The management is poor and you are treated poorly. Can go 3-4 hours with no breaks. The customers are more important and treated better than employees.
bad,"The work itself was fine, exactly what you would expect as an employee of a fast paced job. The people who worked with me were awful. They would treat others with such disrespect and gossip. It was pretty awful to watch. I love fast paced high speed work where you just need to keep going, I probably wouldn't recommend someone work at the same location of Kroger I worked."
bad,Good pay but not a good work place to work at because you are ask to impossible work that can hurt you and there safety is no good very dangerous need to do better
bad,This is not a job for anyone seeking full time employment.  I was only guaranteed 12 hours of work each week.  Certain co-workers were horrible to work with.
bad,"Kroger was more of a temporary job more than anything. While was there, it was not all that great. Even though i did pretty decent for it being my first job, the management just didn't seem to care about anyone as far as their personal being is concerned. Its almost like they could care less about anything you do or say. It was a odd place to work for me."
bad,"The Kroger Company does not value their employees and this is displayed through the lack of benefits and competitive wages that are offered. For pharmacy technicians, there is no opportunity for advancement and often times, employees with very little experience and poor on the job skills are compensated almost identically to employees who efficiently carry a much larger work load."
bad,"Some managers are easier to work with than others, but there are managers that do not work well with people at all. Some of them will bully employees too."
bad,It wasn’t the best place to work at. Some managers were very biased towards certain people and regular employees were not treated very well. The reason I quit was because of my manager in my department ran it in a very poor manner
bad,"There were nice customers, sweet People! The managers & workers are rude! They pick who to side with and who to pick on! New people were not trained correctly, also nothing was explained correctly from a trainer!"
bad,The work for Kroger is no bad. Management was poor and you only moved up unless you were close with them. After working the holidays hours were cut for their bonuses to the point of it being worthless. Only pro is cheap benefits dental and vision only for part time.
bad,"The company has taken its toll on its employees. The company has quoted saying ""we do not pay you to think, we pay you to do as you're told."" They expect long hours and offer little to no recognition"
bad,It is not the same company it was 10 years ago it's not even the same company it was 2 years ago. Care more about number than employees. Union is a waste of money and is only for you if you are a paying member
bad,"Due to poor management, my schedule was inconsistent every week, I was consistently scheduled for more hours than I was legally allowed to work, my area was constantly understaffed while others were overstaffed to the point that some workers were doing nothing. Most of my coworkers would have play knife fights with boxcutters and purposely damage items in order to be allowed to eat them while I did work. Most of the time I did what was assigned to me and more while others slacked off."
bad,its terrible to watch a company go from people oriented to only worrying about numbers. they are molding their values to match that of walmart and everyone looses.
bad,"With my current job I make merely double and do half of the work I did at Kroger's clicklist. I ran the computer, picker, runner, oversize, and picker for Kroger cicklist and worked a ton of hours to only receive a paycheck of about 150- 170 dollars. As a student in college that did not help and many of the co-workers that were working there felt merely the same way. When I was lifting so much to the point I had to go to the ER clinic for inflammation in my chest (Heart area), many of my managers did not consider the pain from the labor I provided. They were more concentrated on you are here now and you can work. That is what ultimately made me decide to leave for a better opportunity and better pay with less work. As a BIG Loss the heads of Kroger visited my store in hermitage and I was their favorite and most talked about employee."
bad,"I worked with twenty micromanagers who took turns telling me that I am wrong. I worked for $6.10 during a time when minimum wage was, well, $6.10 i n Ohio. The minimum wage was above the Union contract's wage. There were absolutely no benefits except for a 15 minute break for lunch. I never understood what I was paying Union dues for. It didn't make any sense to me whatsoever. If a customer asked me for information, I'd try to be as friendly and helpful as possible and some micromanager would try to explain how I take too long with the customers. I've heard tell that Kroger is a lot better now but let me tell you that I didn't take the job for money and benefits, I took it for the atmosphere and the friendly neighborhood environment and the community aspect of it and Kroger wouldn't even let me have that. They wanted to.exploit me for all my worth. Don't work here."
bad,The job was way too fast for the pay. Expected so much for little pay. Management is greedy and only cares about sales. They didnt seem to care about the employees home life. Basically felt like you lived their.
bad,"Many employees treated us courtesy clerks with disrespect, making us feel little of a person like we weren't just as important as anyone else (were still people!) This has ruined my experience with the company, they say were a family but everyone treats us like were nothing. We do alot for the store (getting all the trash around the store, cleaning bathrooms and spills, returning food, bring in carts  ect.) I understand that's all in the job description and I have no problem with it, but what I have a problem with is we do all these things for the store and in the end we getting insulted and mocked at and it's not fair, if we were to treat anyone like that we would have gotten in trouble. But there seems to be no Consequences for other employees. I would not suggest anyone to work as a parcel, especially the store I worked at; was just the most hostile work environment I've seen and the managers barely do anything to resolve the conflicts."
bad,"Typical day was hectic, long hours of chaos with no incentive or appreciation. Very low wages. Not enough breaks, and at times not enough help. Very stressful"
bad,Working at Kroger was ok. I LOVED my coworkers and the environment.  The management team sucked!! They would do things to try to get me fired but when I tried to turn in my 2 weeks notice they said I couldnt which was crazy.
bad,"You are required to work with the bear minimum amount of help in each dept and if someone calls off or you get busy you are not aloud to call in extra help "
bad,The management is terrible. My hours were cut in half and was expected to stay on will getting no good work days.  The pay is not good enough to live on. You would have to get a second job.
bad,"Managers wouldn't tell you if there was a schedule change, co-workers never cleaned their areas and I always had to pick up the slack when the other co-workers would wonder around the store, and the place and kitchen was unorganized and difficult to work in."
bad,"Your hours vary so much, and when you are off they will call you to come in, they override your schedule past your availability and make it difficult to get it fixed. Expects you to have no free time and always be there."
bad,"Nice people, and all with a strong work ethic. Culture can sometimes dwell too much on the negatives. Processes seem to be in silo's and interaction between departments seems disjointed."
bad,"Ok, I held off reviewing this company because I needed a cool down period after I left. I want this review to be unbiased as possible. "
bad,Horribly underpaid compared to other pharmacies in the area. Also expect to work 20 hours a week unless you are a favorite full time employee. While working there you deal with some of the rudest customers who will curse at you. Kroger is cheap and love to pay new CERTIFIED technicians $10 an hour with only 15-20 hours a week as if people can live on that type of pay. Management lies of raises and training but its all bs.  Im currently looking for somewhere else and I do not recommend this company at all.
bad,"i would be bagging groceries and getting carts all day. awful management. there was only a handful of associates that were friendly and the managers don't listen to you. it was very stressful because of some difficult customers and your co-workers did not like their job enough to be nice to you and personally, my store manager would take advantage of his associates by making them do things that their job didn't require."
bad,"My manager was rude, I never was late, but she always had a problem, rude coworkers, required weekends, no sick days, unfair treatment such as ""favorites"". Coworkers and other staff were horrible for my mental health. Miserable experience. I very rarely got my breaks during shifts."
bad,"The benifets are nice but it takes six months to get them. the pay is not very good. And managment is a total wreck. i was suspended by one of the managers and he would not tell me why. Then the lead manager came in the next morning and asked why i was suspended and no one had an actual reason. so i was at home for 6 days before i got an email from one of the managers and the only thing it said was ""Are you coming in?"". So i replied ""No."" and thus i quit my job."
bad,"All I have to say about management is that I got fired due to a death in my family. Stocking shelves and assisting customers was daily, I learned how to receive trucks. There is no culture there. I honestly found the job easy but full of drama."
bad,"Managers are pretty much abused by D.M.'s.  Your job is constantly being threatened if you're not hitting your numbers.  Totally cut-throat.  No advancement whatsoever if you are over the age of 30 for ASM's.  Still a boys club.  What can I say, 20 years, at least I can pay my mortgage."
bad,"Always understaffed, so multiple jobs fall on one person to complete by end of day. Very inconsistent management. They were never on the same page. The customers could be rude but as long as you were polite they were fine."
bad,"Management needed brown-nosers and I didn't however for the right Employer I would brown-nose. I enjoyed helping my fellow employees and the customers, management didn't know how to work with employees, they had personal cliques."
bad,"the hardest part of the day was running around trying to keep the place clean and to help customers at the same time. A typical day consisted of: clocking in, running to the back of the building to the cleaning equipment was, grab the dust-mop and sweep the entire store which was about 789 sq. ft, once that was done it was time to do the restrooms in the back; front pharmacy side; the front deli side and the employee's restrooms on the second floor, once finished with that we had to repeat, also help the courtesy clerks bag when they were understaffed."
bad,At first the job was good the management was very nice and would help out. After management changed things got worse paying was bad got pressured a lot I could go on and on about it.
bad,Working at Kwik Shop had a fun environment at times but went through a Manager changes and some of us got left behind and overworked. The manager wasn't that worried about employees more about the company I was written up once for a no call no show but I had the flu and couldn't talk so I text my manager and with doing so the next time I came into a write-up because I didn't call.
bad,The staff itself were just rude. We weren’t trained properly at all. I walked in there not knowing how to do stuff. Walked out with the knowledge I gave myself or what I picked up on.
bad,My review on Krogers overall is satisfactory. Some of the managers where every helpful and some where kind but there are a couple rude disrespectful ones. The pay there was not fair at all. And my job there was not fun.
bad,"Kroger is a brand that we all know, but there are so many issues within the company. The only opportunities for advancement are when other people leave the company or position. It's also a very poorly paid position when compared to other companies in the industry. Kroger has some great people, but it's a company that won't succeed to its fullest potential until corporate figures out their stuff."
bad,"IThey don’t really care about their employees, they smile in your face but I promise they don’t have your back . Worked there 3 months part time , never missed a day nor was I late . Got sick 2 hours before end of my shift ( we weren’t at all busy )asked to leave so I could go immediate care but was told if I left I wouldn’t have a job . I was really sick so I left and was fired . I’d never worked for a business so cold and unfeeling . Not even given a chance to produce proof I was sick ."
bad,Kroger dose not reward hard workers it rewards your time spent at kroger. Pay is very low compared to similar jobs. And the benefits only are availbe to people that have been there for many more years than you
bad,"Kroger closed all stores in NC without telling the workers and only giving us 60 days to find new employment. Unrealistic quotes, very stressful toward end."
bad,"I liked working here. Loved learning about how to bake different cakes, cookies, etc"
bad,I wish I worked somewhere else. No benefits until 2 years and you stay part time for a long time. Some managers are evil and don't speak when you speak.
bad,"No room to improve, poor management. Inconsistent amount of hours, not enough hours. Customers were my most enjoyable part of the job as they were happy most of the time."
bad,The job was quite easy and fun to do. The managers and coworkers were the bad part. The manager promoted her son before me even though I seniority and the experience. I worked there for three years and only got two raises.
bad,It may be okay as your first job to attain experience but they are very hardworking. They are a company that care about themselves and what benefits them only. They pay very low although every 6 months you get about a .25 cent raise if you qualify.
bad,"Kroger is a good company as long as you want to be a cashier or bagger. Any other position is hard work and punishing. The company itself is one of the dumbest companies around. None of their plans or ideas work or fix the problems. If you do not mind being asked to work twelve hour days and breaking your back, for no thanks or good jobs, then Kroger is perfect for you. Management, some of them are good people and some of them could care less about you. My most enjoyable part of the job was vacation time. The employees are the best part of the company. The company itself does not care about employees only customers."
bad,"Whatever you do not work at a Kroger's for a career option. The pay is next to nothing and the hours are extremely inconsistent. Maybe only work here if it is your only option or for something temporary while you're in school but other than that, do not work at a Kroger's near you."
bad,"O boy my 8 year experience @ krobers lol. You know it wouldn't be so grim if the management was all on the same wavelength. Some had good leadership others were jerks. Micromanaging was a definite hassle it was intolerable. Dont be a part timer,for me i couldn't exceed 30 hours, if i do, I wouldn't be forced to punch out on my shift by management. I always loved utilities so i can evade the buffoonery from management,at least some of the time. Alter advancement & hours for a change."
bad,"Pay is extremely subpar for the sheer amount of work you will be doing, which in most cases is not your work to begin with. Management regularly violates policy to side with customer making employees feel useless. Hours are okay but must work weekends."
bad,"Kroger doesn’t treat their employees very well, at least I wasn’t treated very well. I went in with a very good attitude prepared to learn and work hard, and I did for a while. I was offered a promotion twice and then denied because my manager “liked me where I was”: a janitor basically. Breaks were short and benefits were meager."
bad,The job was very simple but I wasn’t trained properly fellow employees trained me. Management would stand around when we needed help and did nothing. Never fully staffed.
bad,"Kroger’s is a decent place to work if you are starting your first job but not for a career. It is stressful, but that is with any job. Associates don’t get respect from management, nor is the pay worth everything you do."
bad,"Daily work routines became very mundane and repetitive. No real coaching opportunities. When asked what areas could be improved, I was told where my strengths and weaknesses were and how we could improve but was never followed up with. Felt a high degree of favoritism. Too many ""higher ups"" to deal with as well, constant contradiction and lack of communication. Extremely high turnover rate."
bad,"I did enjoy it there at the start, tho one of my managers insulted me in front of the customers, calling me slow or using the R word, she was this old lady who also seemed to be slightly racist, going after workers who happened to not be white and wanting to fire them."
bad,Kroger does not completely train you for your position then they will write you up for an incident you weren't trained on handling. Management is usually a joke and communication skills are at a bare minimum. The pay is definitely not worth the amount of work you're required to do especially after working there for several years. Full-time is also ridiculously hard to get when you start as part-time.
bad,"Kroger, especially customer service, has the potential to be a great job. Unfortunately, it's not. Managers rarely back you up when you try to enforce their rules, most customers treat you like garbage the moment you disagree with them, and the policies change depending on who you ask. If rules were stricter, the job would be easier. "
bad,Raises and promotions are given out on how much the supervisor likes you and not who is more qualified for the job. This happened in all departments and is still happening today. I have watched many managers get promoted who abused their power and got their friends promoted with them. The top is all a good old boys club and they will make your working life impossible until you quit. This store is not a union store and they will stop a union from coming in to the store.
bad,"management was very flip-flop, never knew who was really in charge they always overstepped each other's orders. managers would throw other people under the bus to save themselves"
bad,"As with any retail job, drama drama drama. Supervisors are in no way afraid to play favorites and requests to transfer are often left unheard. There are no merit raises, only a 30 cent raise every 6 months."
bad,"inconsistence in training. unfair work load distribution. pay is low. Lack of positive management. it seems most people that work here are just here to get a pay check, they seem to have almost no integrity, throw things on the shelf, who cares if it goes there or even fits, attitude. Clean up is way to often left for the night crew.getting moved from part time to full time is almost impossible. "
bad,"Kroger.... where do I begin.. "
bad,"I worked for Click-list and it was demanding. Corporate was constantly breathing down your shoulder. They would make surprise visits and critique every little thing you did. What they fail to realize is on occasions you have to do things the fast way, in order to get the groceries out to the customer and ensure their happiness. They would want you reading off this long list of things as you get to the car, but on days when you are understaffed and have exceeded your expected orders, it is very hard to follow exactly their format. They require you to push heavy trolleys and be able to move through the isles very quickly. It is quite hard to do this when you are stopped in every isle you go into. To many tasks fall on a click-list associates shoulders. The rest of the staff within the store does not realize how demanding of a job it is, and often times will not be helpful. You are constantly running back and forth doing your best to get the groceries picked and out to the customer. Often times, even the simplest mishap will end in a customer calling and screaming at you for how you picked somethings that they don't like, yet you told them this at the car. Or they will leave a horrible review, bringing your scores way to. It is almost impossible to keep those scores up to the standard that corporate requires."
bad,"In the past I loved working for Kroger. I knew I got paid far less, but I didnt mind because Kroger staffed so well that we had a proper team to get the work expected of us done. Now they keep cutting hours, they gave new people raises but not to people who were loyal and stayed with the company. They keep everything on an algorithm and if you dont complete work by what your metrics say you should have then you will get repermanded. Home office if completely out of touch. When you bring up problems to them they are non responsive. My job was a dream and now it’s a nightmare."
bad,working there was great loved my daily customers && the people I worked with it was very challenging and I loved learning new things there was always challenged with new things daily but it only helped me in the long run.
bad,"I loved this job when I started, it was better and more steady in every way than any other food service job I had in the past. However, if you are a good employee you get put on closing shift only, and over time, get less and less help especially by the full time employees that make more money than you. Other employees got paid the same amount as me for simply standing around on mid shifts. This did not just happen to me, I saw it happen to others. They manipulate and make you feel guilty just for wanting fair treatment. I also completed my level 2 training after months of barely getting cleared to go to the computers to do it, only for 3 more months to pass without getting promoted because my department manager wouldn't schedule me for earlier shifts needed to do it. I ended up having to do 2 shifts in one 5 hour shift, and the work of 2-3 people only to find out our manager changed that shift my last week after giving my notice. Absolutely unreal. I can't speak for other departments or for other Kroger stores, but that is my experience. I learned to never take this kind of treatment again."
bad,"I thought it would be a great place for me to use my background in grocery retail.  I was hired in as an Assistant Front End Manager.  I was capped right away at $14.85/hr.  No benefits available until 1 year of service.  I had a below-knee amputation and used a prosthetic.  They would not allow me to use my knee scooter when I had issues with my prosthetic.  The union was a joke; never was represented fairly and getting accommodations for my disability was nothing.  There was always talk of me advancing up to Front End Manager, but they never gave the time to learn about the job; always had to do it on your own time.  They are taking away more and more traditional registers in favor of more self checkout and do it yourself options, which is not customer service in my opinion.  It's great for high schoolers/college kids who need a little extra money.  But as a career, no way."
bad,"It does hire full time, but if you are full time, you will never get 40 hrs consistently.( at least at the one where I worked.) the vacation time is seniority based, so it doesn't matter if you put in for that day off first. If someone that was there before you wants that day they get it and you have to work."
bad,This is not a job you can leave at the workplace. It is very stressful and every shift i brought that stress home with me. This job took a toll on my mental health.
bad,I learned how to use the cash register and scan items. i talked to customers and had the occasional bad one. However the really patient customers who are patient with my mistakes are the most memorable.
bad,Not much I can say about the job other than it was an unpleasant slog of difficult tasks while putting up with inept managers. The customers were brutal and the amount of work was nonsensical for the minimal pay.
bad,"Poor wages, and impossible to advance.  Their management style is run primarily by intimidation.  The required union membership is absolutely worthless.  They gladly take your money every paycheck, but if you have a problem you are pretty much on your own..."
bad,Worst place I ever worked. Every day at least half the employees in the brake room were contemplating quitting. Management was terrible. The customers were demanding. Hours were inconsistent. I was only able to get 5 hours of sleep between shifts. People were crying. Some days it was OK. Others were terrible. I have to add that not all Fredmeyers were like this. North Salem is just fine. South Salem is terrible.
bad,"They expect you to put up with a lot of customer's issues and will not back you up when you are trying to uphold store policy. They do not appreciate their employees. You do not get time and a half for holidays. The pay is minimum wage and you gain 5 cents every year you are there. The pay does not match the work done. You are expected to know how to work anything and everything. If you are a bagger, they throw you on register. The pay is not equal to the amount of work you do."
bad,"it was good being busy, management didn't have a clue. when needing information from the store manager she acted like she had no clue and i had to go to the head HR to gewt problems resolved"
bad,Pay too much in union dues get nothing in return
bad,The right hand was always unclear what the left hand was doing. Everything was very disorganized and no one could decide what people should be doing. It was a hostile environment.
bad,"At the newest Kroger in my area I was given very positive feedback with my work and made friends along the way!"
bad,"6 am - review previous day data"
bad,"Honestly working here wouldn't be so bad if they actually cared about their employees. It's all about the numbers, which I get is important, but you also have to consider the people that get you there. Management is unwilling to help and the pay is ridiculous for the amount of things you do. It is not a permanent place to work and mostly just for students, retired people, or those that don't need a job."
bad,No incentive to stay with company for a future career. Lack of pay and paid time off takes a toll. Lots of stress on entry level managers to meet set company goals.
bad,"While I was working as a Stocker for Pick N' Save the place was unorganized and the Managers were very rude, and lazy. Other Stockers while I was there did not front the stock and stood around talking instead of working the majority of the time"
bad,"Kroger micro manages every aspect of the business, thus bogging down productivity.  The culture is lack luster at best and most of the leadership team has no respect for the associates in the store."
bad,People who work there are great for the most part but the job sucked and they kept adding policies because people kept abusing the system. I liked talking to my co-workers and the customers.
bad,While working at Kroger during high school I was able to just earn some spending money but once i graduated it became something that cant pay the bill and is not something someone could work as there only job and still afford to live on there own.
bad,The job was easy the work environment was nice the rolling of hours was ridiculous and there were times management was useless but over all a good job.
bad,"My day at work would consist of pushing carts from outside, bagging customers groceries, and helping customers around the store. The management at the store was terrible, they wouldn't know when to give breaks and they consistently keep hiring new employees when they would cut the current employees hours."
bad,Kroger has been apart of this area for many years and was once a company that took care of its customers and its employees. There was respect and honor and integrity once upon a time. But now the company is only concerned about the all might dollar. They make there employees work too hard with very little help and will let go of people that have been with the company for years if they are not willing to meet there time tables. Its a shame what Kroger has become.
bad,The job was very stressful. I was hired on at part time because i was 17 still in high school getting paid minimum wage and i was still scheduled to work full time sometimes even getting over time.
bad,"It was an okay place to work. Too many store managers. They were friendly for the most part, but it was hard to tell who was in charge. Best advice I can offer would be to listen to all of them."
bad,I'm not exactly sure what to say but this company has gone through several changes throughout the years but there aren't many opportunities for advancement or for gaining a higher position.
bad,"Management was very rough and unorganized. There were a ton of scheduling issues that were not flexible. We had to fill out our schedules several times online and in person. Despite filling out the times we were unable to work multiple times, management still disregarded it. A typical day is working as a group to get a list done within your shift, but the list was very long and we were rarely able to complete it due to lack of time and resources. The most enjoyable part of this job was my coworkers, Kroger does an excellent job at hiring some of the kindest people to work in the departments. The hardest part of my job was the list we had to complete and having to throw away a lot of food."
bad,"The biggest issue with this company are the seemingly endless levels of bureaucracy, consisting of 1 store manager, 3 sub managers, and many more department heads, all of which are prone to contradicting each others desire as to better appeal to some higher form of management."
bad,I would not recomind it to anyone. it is very stressful and and not very organized you're schedule will not be consistent. If you take a problem to the manager they will not fix it.
bad,It is very stressful to work there you don’t even talk to the manager are anyone unless they are in your area. That also don’t give you good benefits.
bad,"Some people goof off but besides that it was a fun place to work, but I couldn't make enough money there to get out of the homeless shelter I was living in"
bad,"The corporate culture was one that would consistently ask for more, more, more.  Little understanding of life balance with work.  Frustrating environment where you felt like it was never enough."
bad,I hated working at Kroger. Management was always looking to get after someone for almost anything. Management was always accusing people of doing something wrong and threatening to write them up. Would not suggest working here.
bad,"Working for Kroger was boring. Its a big company so you dont often feel your problems are being heard, and managers often dont have time or arent available to listen to you. Sometimes youre asked to work beyond what is reasonable. But, for someone just starting out, its an okay job. Minimum wage to start."
bad,You must get your full time status. Before getting any benifits. Which is you must work forty hours a week for twelve weeks straight. They make it very hard to get forty hours a week some only get 20. When they were hired for full time work. They do not give performance based raises only per hours worked. So that makes it hard to get raises as well.
bad,"Company frequently and significantly reduces allotted time for tasks. Management regularly changes standard operating procedure, often in  a conflicting fashion. New hires are expected to perform as well as an experienced worker within a week of hire."
bad,"Worked hard and put in extra hours on my own to make sure the department was running  smoothly, but no mater what you did it was not good enough and the upper management always were adding new parameters to accomplish.  I enjoyed working with my fellow co-workers and enjoyed the camaraderie.."
bad,I go into work clock in and then I face my aisles and department then go to the back and look for carts and then begin to break down my order from the night before and then order product while stocking and then I scan all the lows and holes that are in those aisles.
bad,"a typical day at work ,I make sure all my stations are clean. "
bad,"Kroger doesn't believe in correcting any problems, opting instead to just cut someone loose immediately after the mistake. It makes the management look better to the corporate heads."
bad,I was working as a cashier for almost a year. I was getting paid $7.75. Upper management was horrible the big Boss only cared about money not about employees. Everything I would come close to becoming full time they would cut my hours. During the summer when all the high schoolers were out of school they slashed my hours!! I have bills and they didn't want to give me the hours I first started at. Then they rotated me to closing shift which I did not sign up for... I wouldn't work for them ever again BUT I loved my coworkers they were the awesome.
bad,"Low hours,few customers.No room for advancement.Schedules all over the board.Lot of employees called in sick, short coverage.Clickish co-workers,too much drama."
bad,"At Kroger, you will be expected to do a variety of tasks, whether they are under your job description or not. No allowances will be made for your wellbineg. In general, the managers will be demanding and angry at you, and will not give warning that you are doing something wrong before penalizing you for it. It's not the most intensive job, but it is not worth minimum wage with the environment you are expected to put up with."
bad,"If you begin as a technician but also going through  PharmD program, they will promise you a placement as a registered pharmacist when you graduate. What they don't tell you is it's not really promised."
bad,"Worked there for about 8 months, long inconsistent hours due to poor scheduling. Very bad managment and human resources on second shift. Managers scream and are very unprofessional. First shift has way better management!"
bad,"unstable hours, low pay, bad management make this job a last resort. My direct supervisor was incredible and made the job less mind numbing but overall i would not recommend this job to anyone unless they recently moved and their car broke down"
bad,It's hard to call in sick without the manager guilting you to come in. Advancement is always promised but does not happen and employee morale is low. There is always yelling involved.
bad,"I worked for Kroger for about 13 years and the last three years had one pay raise which brought me up to a whopping $9.96/ hr. The hours were so screwed up that I would get off late then have to sleep fast and get up and go in at 6am. Bagging was fun but not enough hours to pay the bills and the deli was way too much work for so little pay. Now I'm retired from there and receive so little it is equivalent to $2.84/hr. and who can live on that. So, I would only recommend it for high schoolers or for retired people who want a little extra pay."
bad,During my time working at kroger i did not like it. I worked as a courtesy clerk and only got 1-2 days on the schedule. No one there worked as hard as i did. i feel i should have been paid more than 7.50 a hour.
bad,"I'm a hard worker and for my hard work wanted to get paid a decent wage , but they could only do so much with the resources that was given to them to hire their employees ."
bad,I would go in the store to shop while NOT working and mgr. would confront me while shopping to discipline me in front of other customers. Would complain that I did not do my job on such and such a day and I wasn't even scheduled to work.
bad,"We had quotas on everything, immunizations, MTM’s, clinical work plus normal dispensary duties. There is not enough staffing to provide for the basic tasks. Management was clickish and targeted Pharmacist for dismissal with advanced age being a primary goal. They use audits to give bad reviews. The area manager will change your satisfactory review to needs improvement without your knowledge."
bad,"This is not a good place to work! The management is horrible and they thought that they knew something about clicklist, which they didn't, and argued with the clicklist managers a lot so the clicklist manager quit."
bad,"I have found that there is very little communication when working for Kroger stores. And different managers have different views on policies. Also, management does not operate in a professional hands on manner."
bad,"Kroger is a faced-paced job. The customers are nice (sometimes), but some can be a headache. Can't really advance at Kroger. PAY IS NOT FAIR!!!! At all! I wouldn't recommend anyone working at Kroger because it's little advancement and people really can't survive off $7. You deal with a lot, but don't get paid for it. It's a good job for high school students, that's it! Discounts are just for Kroger items only which is little to nothing."
bad,"So disappointed union job takes $11 a week and never got improvements. Part time(hours vary) and very hard to get full time. Always work the weekends and hard to get a day off when requested. Managers and co-workers remind me of high school with clicks, gossiping, favoritism and harassment/bullying. Also management was confusing because each had different rules and favorites. No raises except 10-15 cents once a year if lucky-ex work 10 years and only making $2 more. Do have paid breaks and unpaid lunches but not on time. Some co-workers are very nice and 90% of customers are nice. Instead of raises they give you a free product every once in awhile and fuel points if you hit quotas. 10%Discount only on Kroger products but not always rings up. Variety of shifts and not always 8 hours in between. If busy you have to stay until management tells you to go. Got more benefits and better treatment being a customer than a worker."
bad,I wouldnt recommend this company anymore as a good place to work.  The managment doesnt care about the assocites really any more. They treat you poor and ask you to do more then what should be asked of you.
bad,Kroger stores are a joke. I don't recommend working for them unless you plan on applying for a position that is manager level or higher. Horrible wages but there is always room for advancement due to the number of people they fire on a regular basis.
bad,"Inconsistent scheduling, no work/life balance, low pay. A good place to work if you need a part-time second job, but not recommended as a primary job."
bad,Always smile interact with the customers be friendly move fast.be vocal with your peers. Wear comfortable shoes at all time. Make sure you treat every customer the same.
bad,"It was stressful, cutthroat, and management was very unfair. the forced to pay union dues and they did nothing to help you. that's all I have to say for now"
bad,"Always on your toes, constant mandatory overtime, it was almost always understaffed. I learned a lot working at the King Soopers division of Kroger. I learned how to order for the entirety of the store and how to work the store handheld computer systems. The managment was mediocre at best, rarely helped train new employees and it was usually pushed onto the veteran employees. The workplace culture was pretty high strung because most employees were extremely drained mentally and physically. The hardest part of the job was trying to finish 12 hours of work into 8 hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was they were willing to work with me on days off that i needed, and that i got weekends off"
bad,Many days at Kroger were fast paced with no time to stop. Company objectives overshadowed that of the needs of the clients/patients. Responsibility was never accepted but passed on to the next person in line.
bad,"Wouldn't work around my lack of a babysitter, hours were very inconsistent. My coworkers were great, and the deli manager was awesome, but the higher ups have a lack of compassion for the lower workers."
bad,"I was hired to be a carry out but my typical day was utility duty. Cleaning bathrooms, taking out trash, cleaning the lobby. I did not enjoy my time at Dillons, management was not helpful. Training was lacking and then they expect you to know what to do without telling you."
bad,A terrible place to work. The only thing good was some of my coworkers and a tiny discount. The pay and hours sucked. I was in a competition with my other coworkers or they would miss their shift a d i would have to stay till somebody else showed up. The pay was min wage and the hours really sucked.
bad,"An okay job for a high school and college student. They would try their best to balance school and work and your personal life. A lot of work and customers to deal with, and the pay was minimum wage. Not worth it. Management sucked. There were about 8 employees in my department. And the manager would literally put 5 people for the morning shift. And only two people, sometime one after 5pm-close even on the weekends. Lazy manager didn't want to work."
bad,Not a fair work environment too many people trying to backstab to further their career management not recognizing your work not enough hours to complete work
bad,"I did not work for Kroger for long, but I personally believe they do not treat their employees well enough. When I asked for more hours, I was only given more responsibilities, and was worked in five departments for only 50 cents above minimum wage. not worth it"
bad,"I worked at Kroger from 2015 to 2016 and will never go back. The people are nice and the job was okay, but the Management at Kroger was a mess and was often cruel to the employees who were most loyal."
bad,"typically you just go in doing what you know your supposed to do, fast paced, hard to keep up with time, got to watch what you do so you know when to switch for your hourly duties."
bad,"When I was originally hired, there was a natural hierarchy that made sense, (Store Manager>Co-managers>Department Managers/Leads>Department Backups>Employees). By the time I left, there had been so much turnover and my job description had changed so much without further training or opportunities for advancement in pay or work status. I had a total of four different managers that I reported to during my employment. Two of whom I had more experience than. I was given several informal leadership responsibilities and promised multiple promotions that never came. By the time I left, my direct manager and I never saw one another as we were on completely opposite schedules, and I was working directly for a co-manager that treated myself and my team like we were beneath her as people not just employed positions. Furthermore she micromanaged everyone, from the guy 60 days on to the 10 year veteran, and it made going to work miserable. Too much changed."
bad,"This company will work you into the ground. They also don't care about their employees. Management claims to have an open door policy, but seem put off if you need to speak with them. Training is poor. As far as the benefits go, they are very affordable. You do have to wait a year before your eligible for medical benefits for yourself. If you want to add a spouse or children, it's another year of waiting. Vision and dental are available after 4 years of employment.  Full time is never offered, and you have to climb in seniority to get any hours."
bad,There is no work life balance. They only care about the needs of the business. If you are a single parent you have to have a back up plan they do not work with you.
bad,Typical day of work is usually coming in and asking your manager whats going on then they'll direct you to the appropriate place. From get to work till they tell you your breaks and lunches.
bad,"Typical day at work starts by greeting patients who are waiting to be seen, setting up the desk so I can best assist the patients throughout the day. Completing follow up calls for previous days patients to check on them. Cleaning the rooms after NP is finished with patient. "
bad,"Sometimes other employees won't pull thier own weight and you'll sometimes have to push in carts when it is raining and sweltering. "
bad,"Helped in the pharmacy whatever I was told to do.  Loved helping the customers, keeping the place orderly, helping the pharmacists and my co-workers.  But, didn't like management or the environment in the store.  They don't care about their employees."
bad,"Work life balance really?  There is such a thing?  You will be working a minimum of 50 hours but in reality 60+.  You will be working opening shifts, mid shifts, and closing shifts all the time.  You do not have a set schedule of anytime.  You may work from 1pm to 11pm and then turn around and open the store at 7am.  6 day work weeks are the norm.  You will need to commit to marrying Kroger."
bad,A typical day at work can be stressful especially if the manager is in. The workplace cuture is toxic most people in my department talk poorly of others.
bad,"Most of the people I work with are nice. There are favorites there, like everywhere. My Manager is great and so is the Store Manager, but others are not, but I know that happens everywhere you work. "
bad,I hated this place the people were soooooo freaking rude. the people you with  are the worst . the people who are supposedly over you  treat you with zero respect
bad,"It was always stressful.  The customers were awful, the managers didn't care about our wellbeing and were always on us.  Yet they hardly advertised to get more people in the store, so we were always understaffed.  So a problem that could have been solved by them being proactive was perpetuated by their unwillingness to do so.  From 7:00 in the morning until around 6:00 in the evening, it was constantly busy.  And when you're alone and have to rush everywhere, the stress really starts to take its toll.  My hair started to fall out.  The only good thing about that job were my fellow employees because we could commiserate with each other.  I learned nothing from that job other than I'd rather be unemployed and homeless than work there again."
bad,You have to have patience working there with people because some people do not know how to to talk to other people . Kroger have good benefits you get paid weekly as well
bad,This company has gotten down so bad. They treat employees poorly. They denied Union in store for employees. Only management is allowed to work 40 hrs+
bad,"Kroger was my first job and it was very stressful , how much work i did they paycheck wasn't cutting it. i worked too hard to only make 7.25 an hour , thats why i moved to taco bell its an great place to work"
bad,"I was primarily a cashier, but I'd also get pulled to go some work in produce stocking shelves. We were rated by how fast we could scan items, but it wasn't a true scale. A lot of the workers there have figured out how to cheat the system to make it seam like they were faster that they really were. I didn't enjoy that job, but the spending money was nice at the time."
bad,Would no waste your time with this company. False promises. Bad management. Stressful most days because it was so understaffed.   The atmosphere sucked cause everyone was under to much stress to get things done.
bad,"A typical day at this location consisted of 45 minutes of work and 7 hours of standing around and waiting. With a rotating door on the upper management offices one was never really able to perfect and streamline the job. As a training facilitiy for the company, new, unexperienced kids were put in charge of a store that was quickly bleeding out. No one was there long enough to provide stability so the crew did whatever they wanted until it was rule and then scoffed at any attempt from home office to make improvements."
bad,"I worked at two locations. I had to transfer locations due to moving. The first location I was at, I enjoyed. I wasn't getting great hours, but management was great, as were fellow co-workers. The location I transferred to was another story. I was getting better hours, but management was pretty bad. I was told I was gonna be trained for cake decorating since ours had left for school, but never happened. I became sick for a week (very contagious stomach bug), even brought in doctor notes proving so, and was still accused of blowing off work because my manager happened to have not come in that week. My co-workers weren't a problem there, but management was simply too much to handle."
bad,The worst place I have worked. They don't pay you much for the amount of work you have to do. You have good and bad customers but you have to look past that and just keep working. My bills were more important than losing my job.
bad,Decent place to work.  If you can deal with the rude customers all day.  The best part of working here is the other employees.  Everyone here was very friendly.
bad,"have to do lots of cookies ,cakes,and breads.you learn how to do lots of different kinds of cakes. you have things done timely fashion .making people smile."
bad,"one would think with a large store that the management would have their act together, alas this is not true with critical under-staffing problems, massive employee fatigue.  the General manager is so disliked that sentiment over their competency and or mental stability is frequently at discussion.  several good managers have come to the store but quickly quit or moved stores due to the toxic environment.  employees are often exhausted and listless."
bad,Kroger can be a fun place to work but it is still run by the good old boys unless you know the right people you will not get promoted no matter your abilities and pay is handled the same performance is not really considered if you are not one of the chosen few
bad,"I didn't realize just how bad working here was until I left. The management is extremely top-down, and due to the useless union the pay is awful. While Kroger starts virtually everyone at or near minimum wage, most competitors are offering upwards of 10 dollars per hour now. The discount used to be very good, but I've heard that they've practically taken that away as well. The only plus was that the scheduling was very flexible."
bad,Some of the people there are really not the nicest and the pay could really use a bump up. But overall it was okay. you did get free snacks sometimes.
bad,been trying to advance and won't let me advance because they wont hire a replacement. best part are the customers but there is a work environment that is not a team and it difficult.
bad,The best part about working in retail is the employees and customers you meet. They are what makes the job the most enjoyable because you can always make someone's life better.
bad,The old Kroger i worked at on Benton road was horrible and had absolutely poor management. Lots of people loved me there and it was convenient but the pay sucked.
bad,There is nothing to review about working at Kroger. I was basically thrown into it without ant training at all. if I had questions it was like it was an inconvience to help me.
bad,"Call center environment, causing people to leave weekly. Moral is poor, but we make it as fun as can be. Pay is average, but not worth the repetition of the recruiting script. Gave it a two star rating overall due to pay."
bad,"krogers was my first job i started as a cashier and bagger. job duties i had to help with carry outs , push carts clean bathrooms , use handheld scanner , SHRINK , and other jantorial duties assigned"
bad,This is a place to work when you need a job.The company offers benefits to both part time and full time employees which is a plus and the company pays every weekly.
bad,"The job tasks are relatively easy, but the customers are unbearable. Management isn't much better, nor are just regular coworkers. I witnessed some very harmful things come out of coworkers mouths directed at customers. I myself quit when my manager called me a ""baby who'd never accomplish anything"" in front of customers. DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!!!!"
bad,Terrible pay and poorly managed. Would not work here again. They also mess up pay checks constantly. Overall its a nice place because of workers and customers but management staff and pay is terrible.
bad,"This was an awful experience; first day of training we waited for mgmt. to start & he was over an hour late. Once he showed all we did was walk around & taste samples. Was supposed to be an 8hour day for training & was less than 4hours. Didn't learn a thing! Scheduling was just as bad; never had enough baggers so customers would complain, store smelled bad due to mgmt. not pushing for the go backs. At one point there were 12-15 carts in front of the store for a week. The kids they hire is a joke, always on their phones, having personal conversations w/other employees, eating @ the register. Worst job experience ever!"
bad,Frys management team are getting to be the worst experience of my 23 year career in this company  they have begun to tell people to step down or retire or take a chance of losing your job  it is not a fun place to be they don't care what is going on in your life ad long as you show up for your shift this includes being sick and family deaths last year I missed three funerals two nephews and a niece  wow what great people to work for
bad,"The job was alright and the management was ok."
bad,Working at Kroger was one of the best/worst experiences of my life. It was exhausting working there and unfair in some areas but it also taught me what I do not want to work and be a part of.
bad,"Kroger is diverse. The only problem I had while working with this company , it was very unsafe for woman to work at night time in a gas station by their self handling customers , money & walking back to the store."
bad,I worked as a cashier which was stressful and uncomfortable for me at times. I learned that this is not necessarily a good position for me.  The hardest part of the job was the physical aspect. I didn't like standing in one place for hours doing the same repetitive task. Overtime it took a toll on my ankle and wrist.
bad,"I was a meat clerk for 2 years. I was fuel clerk for roughly 6 months. It was a long commute, with ridiculous schedules and horrid management. Only 8 more characters."
bad,"Very low pay, management was horrible, never worked with your schedule. Quit because not enough hours. Dirty store, not organized."
bad,Kroger at first was a great company I got promoted fast and then went into management. There is no work life balance they expect you to work 6 days a week over 10 hours a day. No time off for family no weekends off ever and now have restricted schedules
bad,"Job was easygoing and not terrible at the start. Plenty of rude and nasty customers, but maybe that's every gas station. I worked at a gas station down the road from my girlfriend and we worked only about 10 months at the 2 seperate stations. Things quickly went downhill as it became clear how they operated their store. They told us it was flexible scheduling but overrode our unavailability that we would enter into the computer no matter what we did. We soon began to realize management did not care about fuel. They shut us down any time us or our fuel leads would ask for help or assistance of some kind. Basically if you work in fuel, you will not be treated as part of the family. We were very reliable workers; showing up for every shift with no issue and doing our work every day. Both stations struggled immensely with employment and we were both on overtime almost every week from the start of working in fuel, but they waited until we quit to really try and bring in new hires. There was also a ton of drama and management decided to treat everybody as children because of it. We were driven to actually quit without putting in 2 weeks notice because we were so fed up. I do not recommend working at the Brighton Kroger. Maybe some other people have better experiences, but this is ours."
bad,"The company at large has a very admirable philosophy and code of conduct. According to union contracts, the employee promise, and recruitment literature, they value a higher standard of ethics."
bad,Great for entry level college student. For older people who has bills it has no flexibility. First time learner ok training
bad,"Good place to start while in High school to get something on a resume while finishing school. Good place to learn customer service skills in general, for life and for other jobs"
bad,"Too many managers. Each one does not know what the other is doing. Not enough employees on a shift, especially the night crew. Hourly employees with seniority are treated a lot better than the rest.  I worked at Kroger for 11 months. Started as a customer service utility clerk. I was trained as a cashier then moved to the night crew as a grocery clerk/stocker. I was told job would be only temporary and my union rep told me to write a letter and submit it to the company and the union. I was later going to be fired for attendance, however I terminated my employment there."
bad,Time goes by quickly as the customers come through the line.  The produces are placed onto the scanner and the price comes up.  You give the customers the total and they pay for the items that were in the cart.
bad,Supervisors never communicated properly with any employee. Did not follow work permit rules and regulations for students/minors. Very difficult to work in this atmosphere.
bad,"A typical day at work began immediately.  While I cannot speak for my manager and co-workers, mine began as soon as I walked through the door.  I learned how to balance numerous things at once, all while being as sincere and professional towards the customers as possible.  "
bad,co workers were great. but the amount of micro management and lack of fair compensation for the work we had to do was horrible
bad,"Co-Managers spend the majority of the day auditing, covering shifts, making sure product is flowing into the store and onto the shelves. If you are organized and able to think on your feet the job is manageable."
bad,"Management stuck me, a recovering alcoholic, in charge of conditioning the alcohol sections, after I specifically asked them not to."
bad,"It is a harsh work environment for those that care about the customers and want to improve. As for those who don't care and are just there for a paycheck it is probably an alright place to work,since management won't enforce rules and hold people accountable....Reminds me of an elementary playground"
bad,Typical day at work is busy. Learned their computer but didn't have much time. Management was nice. The hardest part learning their computer. The best part was when it's quiet and you can get thing done.
bad,"Management heavy.  Not enough communication of company initiatives.  Many unhappy co-workers, but good friends.  Lots of work, but little to no help."
bad,"I enjoyed doing my job at Kroger,however;overall most of the managers I had to deal with were self centered,and I could not always depend on their help when I had a problem.I started off as a part time associate, and earned full time status within a year.But after that,I felt like I constantly was looking over my shoulder or having to watch my every move.I enjoyed the challenge of training a new associate,and at times management did value my opinions."
bad,My two and four year old nieces died in a fire in September.  Kroger wouldn't let me have time off without a fight and then proceeded to call me at the layout to come in and work.
bad,"Working for Kroger is fun but it has it's pro's and con's. What I learned is that we have to get work done as fast as possible since a lot of customer's come through every day. The store manager is nice at times and at other times, we can get yelled at. All my co-workers I've met and worked with, and some I still work with today, are great. They are very friendly and I enjoy talking to them while I work. The hardest part of the job, as a bakery, is trying to get all my work done within my shift. The enjoyable part of the job is working with my co-workers."
bad,"I don't hate this company but there is a serious battle line, at least in the store I worked in. First, they demand that you join their union which has done absolutely zilch for me. The union is the worst part of Kroger. Completely useless. Other than that, most of the department heads are within 5-7 years of their retirement and have been working in the same store since they were kids. They have a very old style way of managing and it clashes with the new age group of employees and higher management that are moving in. The tension in the store is so thick that the customers constantly make remarks about it. It is a very uncomfortable place to work."
bad,My very first job was as a recovery associate for family dollar which was to condition and have the shelves nice and neat with all the products in its correct place. Being my first job ever i felt like it was harder than ever and after 3 weeks of working at this company i felt like the job wasn't for me. Even after all that time i still couldn't be as fast as my employer wanted me to be.
bad,"Don't waste your time. You sanity and peace will be compromised daily. If you are lowest in seniority forget your holiday time with family, YOU WILL WORK. Scheduling is non -flexible, good luck with that. Deli food will make you sick, eat somewhere else."
bad,The most enjoyable part of my job is unloading trucks co workers are good and nice to be around management is in my opinion is just average
bad,It is a nice place to work.  I liked most of my coworkers.  everyone was helpful and pleasant.  It was a fast paced environment most of the time.  Most of the customers are regulars.
bad,"No life to work balance and the wages aren't very good. You come in every day and bust your butt, but when you need something off they are not willing to work with you. The wages suck you only get a quarter raise every 6 months but only if you are full time."
bad,"Busy place to work with generally unsupportive management who refused to take into account the feelings and certain inabilities of their employees to perform certain strenuous tasks. A typical day at work involved bagging expensive orders, checking, assisting customers in finding store product, assisting elderly people to their car, collecting endless amounts of carts from a very large parking lot, taking out the trash, cleaning check stands, sweeping the entire store, answering phone calls, communicating with any and all customers, re-stocking and facing product on shelves, cleaning up any messes made by customers in the isles, working and cleaning different store departments, receiving new store product from the truck, and cleaning the bathrooms."
bad,"Extremely long hours (60+ hours) but if retail runs in your blood, this environment could really be your ticket. This business will really educate one on food merchandising and how to shop wisely."
bad,"The Kroger Company is a strong and growing Company however their management is very unprofessional in their Salt Lake City Corporate office. Their Electronic Payment/Customer Service Division is ran by several people who create drama in the call center and have multiple inappropriate relationships going on within management. The supervisors are vindictive, immature and not helpful."
bad,"Many of the people there are very rude and judgemental. They bend the rules for some employees, while others are held at a higher standard and it is completely unfair."
bad,almost no advancement opportunity and if you do there's no raise involved. you only get $.05 every 6 months no matter what and there's no evaluation process.  i live around the corner from my store but i had to drive an hour away to a training center and they still don't tell you everything you need to know. long periods of work with no breaks
bad,Kroger corporation wasn't one of the best jobs I've worked at mainly because of the people and management. (Forney one is the worst)
bad,"This job was very physically demanding for a retail job. A typical day consisted of stocking, scanning back stock and helping customers. Lots of lifting and walking/speed-walking. I was lucky enough to have a supervisor that liked me and enjoyed teaching. My immediate coworkers became like a work-family. The hardest parts of the job were dealing with unreasonable customers, performing strenuous physical tasks under time constraint, and the pressure management put on me to pick the up slack caused by other employees, often without thanks. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I could use my knowledge about the pharmacy to help customers or show them product solutions or alternatives that they didn't know about."
bad,"I would go to work at about 12pm and get off at 7pm, i worked in the coldest place in the store. the management was horrible, the hardest part was unloading the milk truck and stacking the cases up. I really liked my coworkers they all seemed pretty friendly."
bad,"Day to day operations include customer satisfaction, building displays, writing budgets, recruiting hiring, completing projects within the organization. I have learned to juggle more than one task at once while completing them in a timely manner."
bad,i worked there to long ago to give a proper review but one thing i can say is that i had fun working here. like to people watch this is place to work
bad,"I was with Kroger for a short time and while I appreciated the opportunity and learned many new skills, it was a very harsh environment.  Accomplishments were not acknowledged nor did the managers make an effort to make me feel welcome.  My co-workers seemed to only care about themselves and it made it a quiet work environment."
bad,This company does not treat there employees with any sort of respect. If you are sick they try to get you to still come in. They will cut your hours and they work you to max. Pushing you up to 150 percent efficiency.  You work so hard that you pass out only to do it again the next dcay with no clear path to move up in the company.
bad,"I did not enjoy employment at Kroger because I felt they overwork their employees for a low salary. They also do not schedule everyone fairly, so that the hours are evenly distributed."
bad,Business is perfect High School kids but working there as an adult has no benefits whatsoever. They didn't care if family (self) are sick they just want you on the floors doing your job. Management did not discipline properly. They thought lecturing someone on the floor was the correct thing to do.
bad,"I would not, in any way shape or form, suggest working for the Kroger Inc. unless you were desperate for money or looking for a very demeaning part-time job. The company is, at best, a trap for low-paid management and even lower-paid part-time employees. They regularly fire and ""let-go"" employees who don't measure up to their oddly high standards. There are, occasionally, a few good managers (Such as the one I worked for in the Benton, AR) mixed in with the rest of the drab folks who work at these grocery stores, but in general the whole store was a lame, badly paid den of depravity and depression. If you value your pride and sanity seek work elsewhere."
bad,"Fred Meyer is a great company to work for, Kroger is less so. After the realignment of the Kroger West office. There has been little work life balance, management is not supporting the personal lives of employees or understanding the challenges of all team members."
bad,"Kroger breeds racism, sexism, and abusive behaviors. I have worked there for 6+ years under a department manager who can't even say good morning to me. This behavior is tolerated and overlooked. I am not a dog, nor stupid."
bad,"It was a good opportunity, where i got to work with other team members. We work together in getting our work done by the end of our shift. We made sure we gave the best customer service."
bad,The most enjoyable part of my job was receiving great feedback from customers. Hearing what people had to say about me when I was only doing my job made me feel amazing. I helped people and made people have a better day with just one little task.
bad,"My typical day as a courtesy clerk was I clock in, greet/help customers, bag groceries, put away unwanted groceries, and collect shopping carts from the parking lot, will clock out for 15 min break and lunch break, clock back in to work, and at the end of the shift, I clock out for the day. "
bad,"hours varied day to day"
bad,"This job lacked everything and anything when it comes to culture, even was a member of the culture club.. Very disorganized, sexist, and over all rude people that occupy this store"
bad,"They will try to run your life by continually changing your schedule until the last possible moment and even after sometimes. They will call you on days off and get mad if you do not answer. They offer little pay and no benefits for part timers, which most people are because they don't want to pay full time wages. You will most likely be secure in your job unless you steal or are late or don't show up. The people you work with will either be cool or think they are still in high school. Management sucks... they look over your shoulder for everything but act annoyed when you actually need them for something."
bad,"2+ yrs of service, great first job experience. Stocker, shelf condintioning, unload/load trucks, stock frozen products and dairy."
bad,On average you will work 2-3hrs of overtime and they expect you to maintain your quota throughout these 50-55hrs a week. The pay is good but not worth the constant mandatory overtime and ridiculously high quotas.
bad,"I started as a courtesy clerk (bagging, getting carts, cleaning) mostly part time positions are avaliable. the turn over rate however will ensure that you will be called in or asked to stay over."
bad,"working at Kroger is not hard at all, but you are not well compensated for your work. I felt over work for the position I was in, but they didn't want to increase my pay. they want to advance your title, but not the wages."
bad,I have nothing positive to say about working there. Everything was very unstable and unreliable.
bad,"The employees are payed too low for a large amount of work, management is a mess and there was even a conspiracy to replace all of the employees in my station including me, half of my coworkers were unbearable and took advantage of me to the point I couldn't finish my work (at least the others were kind and helped me out), honestly the job made me miserable and I became ill physically and mentally the entire time I worked there."
bad,"clock in, print out receiving order for delivery, condition department, unload new merchandise from truck, break down load, put new merchandise on shelves, condition department again, run back stock, clean work area, clock out.  "
bad,"Got in while in school and was not good for me at all, while in high school was working 4-12pm all through the week and the management did not care at all, management stayed in office all day, walked around the store maybe 2 times a day. May just be me go and talk to management before applying to get to know them"
bad,"I provided great customer service and assisted customers with their needs. I also ran service desk, cash register and whatever else needed to be done to best service customer. Management poorly communicated with employees. The hardest part was balancing the needs of the customers and those of the business. Working with co workers was the most enjoyable part of the job. I learned how to manage the customer service desk and other people. I also learned that it takes more than hard work to get ahead with the company but who you know."
bad,I enjoy who I work with but would really like a more consistent part time job and better pay
bad,clocking in and making sure meat was cut correctly. How to slice meat. Management was do as I saynot as I do! They got away with too much under handed stuff. Waiting on inpatient customers and having to clean before leaving. Learning the rules as you go and the dept hour changes. I liked the people I worked with some of my co-workers were great!
bad,the best part about the job wasn't brought to you by the corporation but by the other folks you worked with and the everyday customers that you helped from day to day to get their groceries
bad,"Assist customers with returns, purchasing store protection plans and service packages"
bad,"I've worked here from 2005 to 2007 and left to work in the home improvement field.  While working for another employer, I was kept in a department I didn't want to stay in, so I came back to this employer in 2013 with the intention to move into the bakery or floral departments.  I've never been considered and was never given a reason.  Instead, they placed other workers from other stores to fill the positions I've applied for.  So, this company is not a company I wouldn't want to stay with."
bad,"I enjoy working around so many people, helping customers is a highlight and working with my fellow co-workers is a plus. Only full time employees get benefits and at this time only managers are full time."
bad,"everyone i knew their hated their jobs, the people in charge were extremely two-faced"
bad,"Hired in the specialty cheese dept (F/T) and initially was great. Good team in the dept and fun. Then, because the deli was always losing people due to very poor manager and difficult work environment they chose me to be moved to the deli with no notice or training.  They had no qualms about transferring me without my input and failed to even train me on the basics of my responsibilities. Even worse I was the ""night supervisor"" - when I had been working days. "
bad,ok place to work to but not enough hours no advancement pay never changes
bad,I ran the cash register. kept my area clean and help bag grocery.
bad,A typical day is bagging groceries and receiving carts. Management seemed uninterested. Co workers were what got me through the week. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the weather. Most enjoyable part would have to be interacting with customers.
bad,average job no advancement average pay work is easy but no one wants to do it co workers are two faced including management no one seems to know what is going on from one minute to the next
bad,"A typical day includes answering phone calls from stores researching for missing or mislabeled product. On occasions there are also quality or damaged issues with product received at the store level.  I was trained on how to process claims for stores while also taking the phone calls from stores. The first six months on the job management was very supportive and willing to take questions from agents and provide training to agents. After about 6 months, however, this changed and any and all questions were frowned upon. It became very apparent that co-workers were the most knowledgeable resources over any lead or manager and were also much more willing to work with other agents assisting with issues instead of ridiculing. The most enjoyable part of this job is the co-workers."
bad,Currently undergoing a spree of indefinite suspensions without pay.  Would not suggest as a place to work other than for students looking to make a little extra on top of what their families are providing.  Not a solid source of income to live on.
bad,"A typical day at work will include punching in, going to receiving to be told any special directions for the job that evening, or proceed to work product to the shelves you are assigned."
bad,"breaks arent always promised , and you cant use the restroom at will . when someone does finally relieve you to take a bathroom break , you cant go inside the store , had to go to burger king. no one inside store was trained to run fuel station but customer reps and if no one was available then you just werent going to get relieved."
bad,"The work itself is not too difficult, but management needs some serious work. Lots of in-house fighting, temper tantrums, and blame-throwing."
bad,"I have often had troubles with the management in this establishment. They don't recognize prior engagements or school as a reasonable reason to let an associate off, especially when they are an as needed associate. It has been rather bothersome. Also, the other employees are mostly younger high school students and incredibly unprofessional. I am not always excited to be an employee for this franchise."
bad,"work, sweat, normally you learn nothing, management is alright, the hardest part is standing in one place all day"
bad,slave drivers that didnt care about anything but dollars management didnt care about their workers just dollars
bad,"The location where I am employed is terribly understaffed. Being a manager I am expected and feel it is my duty to ensure that tasks get completed effectively, and on time. Many have left the company, and the ones that remain care little about their job. Disciplinary action is seldom taken against insubordinate employees, due to upper management turning a blind eye to the gravity of the situation. I am left to perform and assume the job tasks of at least 5 different positions I can think of. In addition to being a manger/supervisor, I assist with everything so much, that the place seemingly falls apart when I take a day off. It has become frustrating and I feel I am not appreciated at my current place of employment, leaving me to look elsewhere for work."
bad,"Put some time in, make some money and get out. Management can change your schedule any time. Such as saying ""Your entire department no longer works from 10pm-6:30am but from 12am-8:30am"". Union is of no help whatsoever and corp. security will entrap and fire you no matter how little evidence there is against you."
bad,"Its a good starting job if you want to gain experience in a grocery store. The unions which everyone is required to pay for keep people employed who really shouldn't, which encourages them to be even worse because they know they cant be fired. Advancement is almost impossible when it comes to becoming a manager. Most people who work there have been working there 10+ years and treat this as their career, which for most of them it is which is not really what most people are applying for. In order to get any amount of a decent raise you would have had to waist at least 3 years of your life to get a raise which is not that attractive for college or High school students. I managed to injure myself on a Deli slicer and rather than letting my hand heal they made me work the very next day as a cashier which was not all that fun especially when your are constantly in pain."
bad,i was hired for commercial bakery then i became friends with our gm head department so now im doing commercial bakery and helping the gm but i hate it our gm head department girl is really lazy she doesent do nothing all she wants to do is boss people around she falls asleep when is not even break or lunch me and some other employee's talked to our atore diirector but she didn't care she always takes her side
bad,"Wonderful quick job to work to build customer service skills. I have learned how to be patient and grow a one on one relationship with my customers. The hardest part about working I would say would be when you get irate customers, I've learned great patience will take you long ways. The most enjoyable part of my job is a satisfied customer."
bad,"Very busy from the min. you walk in the door. You are answering phones, helping customers. Calling doctors, and Insurance companys. Counting pills"
bad,"I was stocking merchandise and pricing them before to put in shelf's,"
bad,Kroger has been trying to make everyone in all of its stores including Fred Meyer think it has suddenly become a fun place to work. It is not a fun place to work. The pay is no better than any other store I worked in before. The store managers are not very good. It used to be a great local company but not any more. Nothing North West about it. They want you to think they care about you but they don't.
bad,"Clock in, and begin serving, checking people out or taking care of people at the customer service desk. Focus was getting people in and out the door satisfied."
bad,"Most all ideas that the ""brass"" that seem to equal employees in numbers, come up with is good ideas, but if they ever worked a day with the employees they would know there wasting time and money cause it just don't work. When you got spend more time marking down items and auditing out of stocks than putting mercahndise out on the shelfs to sell, it makes no sense."
bad,"You had to hit it hard right from the start or you will be behind. Fast pace all day long. Lots of work everyday. I learned how to order supplies, and product, upload order to computer. I can use a Telzan gun and a floor handjack. The Managers here really don't manage well, at least at the Ypsi store. It was difficult to have time management to get everything done as more work was thrown at you in a matter of seconds you have to change gears to do the new task. The best part of this job for me was my co-workers and quitting time!"
bad,unloading all the semi's that came in it was a fun job. Had to be fast paced lots of overtime.
bad,"This company treats its workers HORRIBLE. No one goes by the rules as far as management. Some of my co-workers do not complete their daily tasks, and forces them on others. I do not recommend this place for someone that has a lot of bills or children. It is for high school students"
bad,"This is a retail job, so basically take the good with the bad. Kroger is Union based and basically with that limits your ability to advance in the company. Kroger just wasn't the right fit for me."
bad,"Kroger was my first job. I worked as a courtesy clerk for a little over 2 years. my responsibilities where to bag groceries, bathroom maintenance, bottle room maintenance, pushing carts and bottle seperation. Overall it wasn't my favorit job, but it was ok for a first job."
bad,"I worked for a little shy of a year, was promised easy raises as long as my work ethic was good which i was told it was, i received no raises or even got moved out of bagger, i was used 5 days a week as a cashier and 1 as a bagger so they didnt have to give me the pay increase"
bad,it was a fast-paced job with very little freedom and I would never do it again.
bad,Typical day is standing at a register for 8 hours. I've learned that most people are Rude. Management does not care about their employees. My co-workers are nice. The hardest part of my job is Standing for so long when I have Fibromyalgia. Sorry to say this but There is nothing that I really enjoy about my Job.
bad,I am resposible for 10 associates and the deligation of their responsibilities of the day. I am directly resposible for the cutting room production and quality.Very demanding job.
bad,"Everyone worker were repsonsible for their own actions, such as the work area to be clean, safe for customers and everyone in the store. Met establishe sales goals. Maintained proper security of cash. And provided the highest quality of customer service at all times."
bad,Wanted advancement but manager not interested or supportive although i met requirements and proved loyalty.  Benefits were great but i got paid less than new hires that i trained.
bad,"Work at a minimum of 55 hours a week sometime 60 to 70 hours a week. the company really do not care about your family needs. Also, the company laid off many of the mid managers who had been with the company 15 to 30 years and the reason was we are cutting back but the real reason I think is that they were paying these managers too much so they let the most loyal employees go and know they are hiring really."
bad,Been there for a year and they never allowed me to have a flexible schedule or anything terrible place to work only stayed for the employees they let people do whatever they wanted to do
bad,"Coworkers Managers suck and , they won’t give u the right schedule and , they won’t listen and  , they don’t care , and u get paid every week . Immature."
bad,"It was my first job, and was a bad experience. I had to do jobs that a regular courtesy clerk shouldn't have to do for $7.25 and hour. Some of the employees were racist."
bad,𝙆𝙧𝙤𝙜𝙚𝙧 has a terrible work environment employees have to worry about retaliation from senior members if they show concern or file a grievance they hire Young people for seniority positions that do not know how to maturely handle their job Kroger does not show appreciation Beyond giving you a sticker if they think that you're doing a good job much like a child in kindergarten class we are not children we are hard-working adults and we deserve some type of appreciation shown for our jobs if senior position people do not like you they refuse to acknowledge your work
bad,"I loved this job until management changes came. I understand the company has to be profitable but the pressure is now unbelievable. My boss told all the pharmacists in our district that ""we are all replaceable"" and she has had to replace many because morale has tanked. I didn't mind going the extra mile for previous management but now I feel abused and resent all the unpaid hours that are required to get the job done."
bad,"They use this store as a training store. Turnover stays at 100% "
bad,"Helping customers is mainly what a day at Kroger consists of. I've learned better time management. Management is getting better. Workplace culture is not the best. The hardest part of the job is working multiple areas in a department while understaffed. The most enjoyable part is working alongside friendly individuals who do their job, but also try to have fun."
bad,Kroger is trying to get 24 hours of work out of a single person's 8 hour shift. From corporate down everyone is afraid to make a sound business decision fo fear that they will be terminated. They are unwilling to expend funds to make sure the work can be completed successfully and there is a mass exodus from this company.
bad,"Just not a good place to work if you have a schedule. Could have been the one manager over my area but she made my life miserable. I loved my job, just not working evenings and no matter my issue .. she didn't care."
bad,"Staff was not very welcoming and Understanding. When I had health issues, they accused me of using that as a ""crutch"" to skip out on work and miss shifts."
bad,While I was there I was cussed at by a employee while a manager was sitting there did nothing about it and I got in trouble instead of the employee who cussed at me.
bad,I haven’t been working here too long and I don’t like it. It’s a hard job maintaining to a lot of customers at one time. It was hard working with not being taught.
bad,"Kroger is a good place to start a job. Not a good place to make a career."
bad,"There are better jobs that'll pay more, offer more, and less stressful! The communication between managers and employees is TRASH! Not enough workers!"
bad,"I learned alot about customer service while being an employee at Kroger."
bad,Don't work for Kroger they don't care about emloyees MGMT is a joke you won't be Happy no overtimes no full time poor MGMT team it pays the bills that's why I stay
bad,This company has gone through a lot of changes since I first got hired and not for the better. The current environment is very toxic and is not beneficial to anyone who currently works there.
bad,Interesting work environment. I worked in a Starbucks kiosk and you typically worked as a two person team or by yourself. You worked under both Kroger management and Starbucks management. There were expectations to follow the standards of Starbucks and Kroger which sometimes had conflicting interests. I wasn't trained in any other position other than the Kiosk but was often asked to work in different departments.  When the lines for the registers were really long customers would frequently come to the kiosk to check out which inconvenienced customers that were just coming in to grab their coffee before work. Customers were always fun to talk to.
bad,Everyday was a hit the ground kind of day. Learning the new way the world is going for their groceries was something exciting to be apart of. I got to be apart of the innovation part the of the e-commerce department.
bad,"My time working here was not very fun, the co-workers were great to be with, they were all very friendly and helpful, but the management was stressful and poor, I called in sick one day and the store manager called me out for lying."
bad,"The typical day at work was good, until the hate came into play, the costumers got mad at me when it came to bagging, the Kroger didn't have a bagging system, they just summed it up as a ""throw everything into the bag"" and move onto the next person, which made me feel horrible and i wanted to make my own bagging system, which the employer didn't like that, when he caught onto it he used harsh words, and degraded me."
bad,"Working there was ok. It was fast paced, sometimes stressful, but the worst for me was management. "
bad,"Job duties include organizing supplies, delivering necessary supplies to the production line, pulling orders for shipping and arranging finished products."
bad,"Kroger needs help as a company. The manager at the time was very sexist, and the work was too much for one person to complete every day. The training was all but non-existent."
bad,"So on a day to day it's hard to find the equipment needed to complete your daily task. Too much is put on a single person. There is a huge gap in communication between management and management and staff. Very possible to burn out quickly. "
bad,"Generally assigned to cashier, but at times was pulled from cashiering to work in the floral department.  Job responsibility included codes to weigh produce/fruit, direct customer(s) to areas to locate products, answer questions as they came up or find the answer for the customer.  Required to check out customers on a timely manner.  Also, acted as the Front End Supervisor as needed to make certain that breaks, lunches were taken."
bad,"Many employees have to fight hard to advance in the company. One of my managers explained to me that it took him 7 years to achieve full time status. The pay is okay, but when I get close to getting full time, my hours get cut to next to nothing. This would probably be a great job to begin with. However, I have found that unless you are related to someone in a position of power, it is very difficult to advance."
bad,So so. Lots of empty promises from management.  Very stressful environment but get to help people all day and make people laugh and smile.  Yay! Union job so job security is very good!
bad,"Management could care less about a persons needs.  You are a cog in the wheel.  I specifically chose a position I was interested in performing and instead was put in a position I hated and although I complained I was told to ""suck it up""."
bad,"Managment in store and corporate make bad decisions based on appearance not usage, customer service, practicality, or logic. The bottom line is profit, they do not care about anything else!"
bad,"Kroger's culture priorities have changed."
bad,I would not give this job to my worst enemy. They worked you to the none for almost no pay and the people who dont work get by with almost no punishment making it harder on everyone else.
bad,"Getting paid minimum wage to deal with customers constantly, collect carts, and clean the store is extremely low.  Additionally, managers would call you in claiming that you were to work that day, even though you weren't, forcing you to come in.  Even though I was part time and we agreed on 20 hours due to school, they worked me 30 or 40 hours a week.  If the pay were higher, and the managers abided by the schedule that they made, it would be better."
bad,"Overall it was a good experience for me. I learned a lot and I still know a lot. Changes started to happen fast and I wasn’t satisfied with the changes. The management wasn’t good at all. They wouldn’t care and I was never able to level up, even though I tried for almost 4 months."
bad,"I worked there for 8 months and it was a very hectic environment, very low appreciation, and high expectations, would not recommend if you dont like being ridiculed"
bad,"A basic retail job with all the negatives you can think of. The managers and people were nice enough, but not the company itself. I asked for a raise about a year in, and they denied me. When the company laid off all it's workers, people with part-time positions and less than 5 years only got 250$ as compensation."
bad,"Kroger was my first job. They did a horrible job at training & blamed me for every mistake someone else made. I was forced to do things I wasn't trained for, I was forced to stay after my shift because a customer lied, I never got my W2 so I could never claim my taxes from when I worked there"
bad,Kroger seems to be going through some changes at the moment.  I don't know if the company or store is going to be around much longer.  Almost the entire night stocking crew has quit at my location.
bad,Not a team environment no professional qualities taught to work with or how to treat people. Employees are not taught how to do their jobs or listen too
bad,Bad employee retention rate and work culture. Management needs to renovated. Management needs to focus on employees and to create a good working enviroment.
bad,"i typically work a 4pm-10pm shift and normally it the day happens smoothly but for a while days have been more stressful,getting in trouble  over simple things,coworkers trying to tell me how to do my job even though we work the same job."
bad,"Management couldn't even communicate simple messages between each other in an effective manner. I can't recall how many times I would be told by one manager to do a particular task, then that manager would tell another manager to have me do a different task, without the original manager communicating to me that they decided to have me work on another task. This lack of communication could be quite confusing for me, as it would seem that I had two different managers telling me to complete two separate tasks at the same time. In addition, the store was always understaffed, which even the store manager recently acknowledged, but management never hired an adequate number of employees to properly staff the store."
bad,"There have been a lot of changes recently and I am not sure if/ how they will impact Kroger overall, but based on past experiences I would not recommend working there. It seems that Kroger is trying all they can to save themselves money by changing the uniform to a cheap ugly apron that ends up giving you a headache at the end of the day, to changing the once great insurance to shitm it is never a guarantee with anything at Kroger."
bad,I don't Recommend it they pay very little its not enough to live off really i would only recommend this for a high school student. If you want a Horrible manager and work where other people don't do their jobs right either i would say go for it. But the hours are barely any I was only getting like 10 hours a week they would call me in for a 2 hour or 3 hour shift it was a complete waste of time not even worth it
bad,Kroger can allow you to focus on customer but constant reports and conference calls can make day to day operations that need to be done a challenge to get done in a timely manner
bad,"They want to be just like Walmart: hire their staff, assign the same tasks, scructure their day, everything.  Upper management really seems to want to squeeze every drop out of store level staff that they can.  To ""boost"" morale they push an ""uplift"" culture."
bad,The mgt is very rude dont care and forces you to work even if u sick. No one cares about nothing you have going on. You hardly ever get requested days off.. no holidays off
bad,"I had a basic full time stocking, customer service rep job, and would take receiving orders, that was the best part. The rest of the time you work alone figuring out where all the backstock goes. You don’t know if they will stick you in the freezer or not. Rotate and stock coffee and water and bread are the big three, using a pallet jack. If you have retail exp., you can go in as high as 13 but I started at ten. Lots of walking and standing. With little reward. Not a livable wage, but you gotta start somewhere. Try going back to school, IMO."
bad,Allows time off for any reason. Good working with other people. Customers are nice. Union reps are ok better to deal with things yourseld and not rely on union
bad,I would not recommend this job to someone who has bills to pay. People there make good money but only if they have been there for a while. My experience was unique. I am sure that all Kroger stores do not have managers drinking on the job. Mine did.
bad,This place is worth working at as your first job.  Other than that people should be looking elsewhere to advance their career.  Kroger is not a good place to work if you are raising a family.
bad,Managers don't communicate which made assisgments confusing.  Being part of a union was helpful and gave job security.  Deli never had enough coverage.
bad,Management wants you to do the work of two or three full-time positions while giving you part-time hours and pay.  It is soo stressful.  Colleagues like to gossip and complain.
bad,The people I work with on a day to day basis are fantastic and become like family. Upper management can be challenging and have unrealistic expectations.
bad,"I was overwork, extra jobs added constantly, "
bad,"Hard laborious job that had very little incentive to keep you motivated. Dirty and mishandled work environment. Not a place to stay long-term, unless someone higher up really pushes for your advancement."
bad,"Employee turnover is terrible, so if you have even the slightest ounce of reliability you will not lose your job. The managers try their best and most of them are good people; but there is little to no communication between management and the departments. Often poor communication between the managers themselves."
bad,"The field of pharmacy is changing, and this job showed me first hand. I felt like working at a fast-food restaurant trying to fill orders as quickly as possible."
bad,I loved the people and the work that was asked of me but the manangement was aweful over over worked at times few of the management would not help if it was needed
bad,"As a newly licensed Pharmacy Technician and 1st time working in a pharmacy, I was given NO instructions. Using my common sense, I knew I had to keep HIPPA laws. It was hard work in that I greeted customers; received their RX; if needed, contacted insurance company; answered phone; worked drive thru window; took RX from shelf; typed customers information in the computer; filled RX; and bagged for pickup. They required scripts be filled & ready for pickup in 5 minutes, no matter what else I had going on. I wanted to be accurate & therefore, I did not always make the 5 minute time frame which caused my termination which I feel is unfair because another employee completely went against HIPPA laws and they were put on probation for 6 months BUT allowed to continue to work."
bad,They want to work you hard doing 101 different tasks while paying you next to nothing and not granting you full time benefits. Management was horrible.
bad,"Stock shelves "
bad,"Enjoyed fuel center very much. Was not micro-managed there. Was able to sit and/or stand. Floral department was stressful with more work than one person can do all the time and management breathing down your neck. Cashier work was standing all of the time, as was floral work."
bad,I really enjoyed working in the deli the people were really nice but they didn't train very well  then I was only hired for the holidays and was not told so they let me go with no reason
bad,"The place was a mess. There were usually between 2 and 5 floor managers at any time, and none of them worked together. One manager in particular would be frequently late to work by two hours, and usually leave early. The store supervisor was openly sexist and homophobic. Inventory changed constantly and made it hard to return things to their proper shelves. The employee turnover rate was insanely high."
bad,I didn’t like working at Kroger because to me they are not professional enough. They never care about how you feel . They treat people like slaves like they just don’t care
bad,"Overall, not too bad but I definitely wouldn't recommend to anyone that I valued even slightly. If you have no job, no standards, and you don't need the money, this is the perfect place! Also, it's really fun to be treated like garbage!"
bad,Good starter job but don't make a  career out of it. A couple of years and move on. This is my second time back and it is for the pitiful  insurance and it is easy to get on with them. Not the industry it was at one time.
bad,"If your from outside the company you have no voice and any positive changes you recommend will be squashed, it’s a good ole boy promotion system not for people leaders."
bad,"I was fired after 16 years of loyal service with the company for a simple mistake, an error, that cost me,at the time my home life,personal welfare, and mental health! The union was involved so to speak,but were never a real benefit to me!#notdisgruntledjustdisheartend,"
bad,Working too hard and no hours always on times.come in on my off days .work hard.schedule never the same.different date and times.sometimes my checks will be mess up.the item's is never in.manager didn't really do there job's.
bad,"Even though it wasn’t the job I wanted, it was a learning experience for a first job. Working overnight was probably the hardest because I never had worked overnights before but I adjusted quick."
bad,overall it was a place that lacked leadership. managers di dnot do much managing. overall I was unimpressed wit hthe way things were run. hazards were everywhere. workers lacked emotion.
bad,"Then you have nothing to lose. You'll either be bored on the self checkout machines or you'll be constantly bagging groceries for people.  I've met quite a few nice people but I've met almost as many rude people who think that I'm not a person because I'm underpayed and work retail."
bad,the workplace is ok but after working there for a couple of days or even months you dont get as many hours as you want cause then they start cutting them.
bad,"Pro: "
bad,When did customers quit being the main priority. Kroger is worried more about paperwork and micromanaging than waiting on customers. Customer service is lacking due to hours being cut.
bad,"I was balancing school and work, and no matter how many times I asked for a change of schedule, they wouldn’t do it. Eventually I had to put in my two weeks notice, because I was too stressed out to stay, considering the low pay. Which I did not get the right pay for my position in the first place."
bad,At my store there were some awful managers. They were always rude and condescending to you and you always had to work so hard to get almost nothing in your checks.
bad,"Would like a career change due to too much stress and company not giving me the tools to do my job successfully. "
bad,It's okay but they expect you to work on your graduation week and I couldn't do that bc for me it's just to hard to balance everything out. The manager is really mean so I suggest not working there.
bad,Upper management was not good. Pointing fingers at what you already know needs done while they know you’re short handed. Forecasted hours too few for the work needing done.
bad,If lower on the schedule. More likely to work weekends & holidays. They dont close for anything. They start off at 12 hrs to 40. So along as u want to be on call u can make 40hrs
bad,The Kroger philosophy is that their employees are beneath them they don't like to appreciate what their sales associates do or accomplish. During my time there I never once felt like anything I did mattered and you're basically on autopilot the entire time. The management there is always told to just keep people moving.
bad,"Kroger commends themself for being a proud equal opportunity employer. That’s not the case. At my store especially it is overwhelmingly not diverse. They do not care about the employees. They constantly are demanding we cut hours and send people home and then leave us to deal with the rightfully angry customers. I have a full crying breakdown every other week from stress. Oh and if you get a good comment don’t worry, you’ll never hear about it. But have one bad day and you’re basically strung up and ripped apart by management. The most negative company I’ve ever worked for."
bad,"Plan on always being understaffed with very little training.  Kroger's does not believe in training their employees or their managers.  Only the strong survive.  You will work several positions in the store.  Where ever you are needed.  If  you learn more than one job, you do what they need you to do.  They are always taking hours away from the front end, so they expect the perimeter employees to be cashiers and baggers.  Sometime hours at a time while your job does not get done.  Then criticized for not getting your job done.  Living the dream."
bad,"Well I've  been working at Kroger for almost 4 years and it sucks I'm still looking for a new job. The management sucks they pretty much play favorites.Like pretty much you'll be working your butt off but then you got this other co-worker doing nothing but then the managers ask you anyways to do a special job duty for them even though they should be asking or telling the other person to do that task!!!!  A typical day of being a courtesy clerk or bagger which ever you decide to call your job title consists of bagging and going out to get carts unless there is lightening outside then you stay inside. Or you are cleaning restrooms cleaning up after people who can't use a public bathroom decently, or just don't care. Then managers want you to magically pull skills out of your butt that require training expecting you to perform job functions that of a plumber not a bagger!!!!! There is also the bottleroom where you build bottle bins and try to fix the bottle machines even though you aren't a mechanic, and clean the machines and the bottleroom. Also in the winter the managers expect you to go out and shovel snow and salt the sidewalks and main entrances they also had me shovel out all of the corrals alone no help at all!!!!!!Then there are store sweeps where you go around the whole store with this big broom and go down the aisles and go side to side trying to get up all of the dirt also trying to stay out of the way of other people. Also the managers have no concept of time at all it seems like!!!!!!"
bad,Has become very dirty looking store and unfriendly to customers. This includes stores that I go into to shop. They have low standards and should drug test their employees randomly.
bad,"Great benefits, but terrible work/life balance. Pay is low which is why they are unable to keep workers and lead to more stress for the rest of the employees. The store manager was transferred and has yet to be replaced after a month. I've worked at a few different Krogers and while some are better than others, it definitely is not a company that I feel could sustain my family and I in the long run."
bad,"Retail with high expectations for performance.  No work-life balance."
bad,"Management, at my store at least, is unprofessional and does not take your concerns seriously. Also, more often than not, your availability that is in view of your department lead will not be followed or even taken into consideration when schedules are being made. I've been at my store for a little over a year and all I can say is that consistency is severely lacking."
bad,"I would not work there again.  Poor managers, low pay & lack of effective communication all contributed to a negatively work environment."
bad,I have worked at Kroger for 8 years. It has been very stressful and is very hard to move up in position especially if you are part time. It was very hard to get full time at my store. i would work for 30-40 hours a week and would barely bring home 300$. The working conditions are terrible and the management was really lazy and poor.
bad,Good enough if you're under 18. The union is pretty bad and the pay is since par. People that work there are usually nice though and made a lot of friends.
bad,Its a good starter job. Minimum wage. Management is kinda wonky. Definatley more of a clique type setting. If you struggle too much they dont really go out of the way to help. You kinda gotta keep up or get left behind. I liked what i did n if the starbucks wasnt in that particular krogers i thinkt woulve been a good job.
bad,Mangers will tell you one thing then go back on their word. No overtime. They will cut hours and expect you to get the same amount of work done. Management never try to work with you and communicate the issues they have. They never explain anything if they have an issue. its stressful. The pay is ok but not the best.
bad,I have worked at Kroger for two years and I dread having to walk into my workplace. The management is poor and there is lots of favoritism. I would only recommended working here for the retail experience to put on your resume. There is very little chance for career advancement. The departments tend to have cliques and it is difficult get the recognition you deserve because the reward system is horribly flawed. The only reason I still work here is because I like to keep money rolling into my account.
bad,"Very little communication on career advancement opportunities. Store teams work hard but hours are tight, Compensation in good for the job asked however the company preaches work life balance but will not back that up in action."
bad,"Great product if you are looking for organic? all natural options."
bad,"Working here wasn't a hard job. The upper management was strict but acted like kids. Most Associates are rude and obviously didn't want to help new people. Also at the store, I was located there was tons of gossiping and didn't know how to respect one another."
bad,"The wage is bad and sometimes the management and the people you work with can be a bit low class. Good place for students to make some extra money or for retired folks. If you are trying to get into a management or supervisor position, but the work is more then what you get paid"
bad,"Krogers was testing a new program called “Clicklist,” that would allow customers to order their groceries online and wait outside the store for employees to bring out their groceries. I was responsible for getting the groceries and delivering the items to the customer’s car. I got into the rhythm of things very quickly."
bad,The managers wanted to much out the people who did the most work we couldn’t have a break from anything and it took away the fun of working or the energy of wanting to work
bad,I loved kroger but working there was not boring just people favored the the ones who was there the longest and not who worked the hardesr and i worked so hard i once went to the hospital. Thats how dedicated i was at working and left due to management harassment.
bad,"There have been so many thefts lately that its not even safe anymore. Some managers just let people run out of the door with huge items such as; beer, meats and seafood, tissues, clothes, etc.. it's ridiculous at this point."
bad,"Little chance to advance, favoritism to long-term employees, no consistent hours. Low pay, high turnover. Reduced hours and added duties, without getting more time to complete. It is a very physically demanding place to work."
bad,Great highschool job but other than that not able to make a living off of less than 20 hours of work. The good part about working at Kroger is probably the customer service
bad,Managers and leads argue. Employees are late and lazy and they dont get written up. Zero communication between managers and heads of departments. If you want a job where you can show up when you want and leave when you want this job is perfect you.
bad,"management was awful"
bad,Kroger was pretty diverse.  Managers only wanted to help advance certain people.  The workload can be too much when they give you more responsiblities because they don't want to add headcount to save money.
bad,After 11 years I still make less than other companies starting salary for lower ranking positions.  Kroger is great for kids starting out but for long term career paths they are not the best fit.  They do not promote equally among genders or based on experience.  They do not offer raises that are commiserate with experience or time on staff.  Overall it has not been a good experience and I would not recommend this company to anyone other than high school kids and college students who need a little pocket cash.
bad,The higher ups in charge are destroying what was once a great place to work. Kroger used to be an industry leader and is now a follower. I planned to retire from here and after a decade of work I had to look for a new job. Not on board for how they manage people or treat them. They are having a hard time retaining people and management is overwhelmed as well as the employees.
bad,"The work it self was easy and didn't come with many challenges, but constantly not getting breaks at proper time and not getting paid properly really messed me up."
bad,"Alone working the produce load to keep the department full."
bad,"If you enjoy being micromanaged...this is your company.  If you like being around a lot of people who are counting the minutes until they punch out...this is your gig. If you dig walking on eggshells to avoid being written up or terminated on a daily basis...you're gonna love it here. I have never encountered, nor do I wish to experience, a worse culture of horrid morale. If you can turn off your emotions, the benefits are great, but I advise you stay at the clerk level...promotions do nothing more than put a target on your back."
bad,"Working at kroger provided me with an opportunity to learn the different types of jobs within the grocery store. I was an overnight stocker, management is stressful and racist."
bad,"This is a very Stressful place to work in. They will underpay you, overwork you, ignore your requests for advancement, and trap you in a position you do not want to be in."
bad,"A typical day at work was mainly stressful.  I did learn how to work more efficiently due to other employees constant mistakes, including management.   Management was terrible due to the fact that half the time they made errors on a consistent basis that shouldn't happen at that level.  The culture was pretty selfish and not very team oriented."
bad,Kroger will always keep you on your toes. Customers are always first and there is something to always do. You meet extremely nice people but also meet the nastiest customers. Kroger teaches you to always have a smile on your face and work together to give the customer the best shopping experience.
bad,"Working at Kroger in Clicklist, now called Pick-Up, used to be fun because of my co-workers and the managers and the overall environment. We helped each other out and uplift one another. E-commerce is not a hard job at all, but it is definitely challenging and pressure builds up due to the fact that customers take notice of how convenient this service is. The previous managers understood the pressure we E-commerce associates would go through on a busy day, but it seems that majority of the new management that took over does not, and have piled even more pressure and stress on not only E-commerce associates, but in other departments as well. This stress is unacceptable and very unnecessary, which is why I do not recommend working at this location."
bad,"Kroger is not what it used to be, the higher ups are non-reasonable and don't care about their employees, they only care about making as much money as they can, which creates a stressful environment for all employees who are just trying to live their lives."
bad,"On a typical day at work it was straight complaining and stress. I learned everything I have learn about properly bagging the customers foods and I have learned about the register. The manger don't care about they only care about the customers, you can be in the right and they still wont take your side. When a close family member passed in your family you only have three days to grief. and more..."
bad,I am not in a position to rate this company at this time as I have not been employed there in over 7 years.  Their staff turnover rate is extremely high.
bad,"The work life balance was terrible ,you work every holiday .Their culture was terrible as well as the morale .The only thing they cared about was the bottom line .The clerks were like family but the relationship between clerks and managers was strained .There was always distrust at contract time .There was always too much work for the little labor you had .You could move up as long as you knew someone .The 16 week training program did not teach you that much ,and there was not that much difference in pay for 1st time managers ."
bad,It was a good starting job for me when i was in high school. That's when i learn how the work life and school life balance. Other then that it wasn't a bad job
bad,"Pharmacist didn't teach much, nor helped with scheduling conflicts. Waited until very last minute to let me go during probation period. Doesn't like employees talking to customers in pharmacy."
bad,nothing good or bad about this place they just don't offer enough hours to keep good people on the staff. There is a lot of turnover in employment for this reason
bad,So I been working with Kroger for three years as a courtesy clerk I try to work my off to get more hours but then they said that i have a disability I’m not able too work because of my height so they gave more hours to other employees they cut them where I can never get insurance threw them
bad,"Huge lack of ability by management to recognize real talent, if you can say yes, you are leadership material, if you want to do right for the shopper and company and push back on decisions that are not good for company or shopper you become a grunt."
bad,"I worked for Kroger for 10 years. From associate to store manager. Kroger’s leadership changed and they didn’t care about your work/life balance. Also, why was I passing 10 stores to work at one 1 hour from my home? WTF? When I asked about this, no one cared!"
bad,"Worked there over 3 years. Make less as a clerk now than a sacker who started yesterday. Little growth, and shittt management. Nice part time, leave soon. Would not recommend staying very long. Management just doesn't care anymore, and almost always caves immediately to customer bull. At least the hours are somewhat flexible, few as there are."
bad,The people I worked with where nice just mangers and co managers where not good they could of gave verbal warning for 1st time problem with management because I wouldn't of called off if I wasn't intergated and head manager said I was not intergated when he was not there or on the phone listening to me always two sides.
bad,"they had poor management , they isn’t care too much about who they hired a lot not the time and let just about anybody work there, which created a very poor work environment"
bad,"While the environment of Korger was nice and the prospect of advancement was good in the short term, there was no guarantee for a half time employee to get over 15 hours a week."
bad,I don't have any further comment at this time.  There are always high pressure environments in jobs.  Retail is a tough place to work and cut your teeth.
bad,"Management was poor and hard to work with. They didn't understand that I was a high school student and had to take the ACT, and expected me to skip it so I could come into work. They don't want you to call off early, and will make you come in even if you are sick."
bad,Poor establishment to work for. You don't get any leeway unless your full time. You get part time but work full time hours so they don't have to give any benefits or pay wage increases
bad,The only good thing I can say I made some god friends and that's it. I feel like the mangers would be better if they talked to each other the store would have been ran better
bad,Kroger was a very tense place to work. The managers were clueless and most employees aren't sure of what they're doing. Breaks were often late or never came at all. I definitely do not recommend working.
bad,"Pretty much what you would expect for a grocery store, fast paced, bad hours, poor pay, poor management, and no way of advancement. Courtesy Clerk's get treated the worst out of everyone there because they're at the bottom of all the jobs available."
bad,"Work culture is awful, favorites get promoted. No work life balance, long hours, manual labor involved, unloading trucks, not a good option for females. Disrespect from associates, clique behaviors from upper management who have been around forever. Overall a stressful job, not a long term option, most managers stay around for 1-3 years and move on. Those who stick around are being 'catered to' allowing them to stay longer. Coordinators never around and are rude and disrespectful to co-managers."
bad,management was poor felt like there was employees that were favored more than others schedule was always changed and was not really flexible around my kids schedule
bad,"Had to move grocery carts back into the building. Bagged groceries in a specific order, greeted guests and helped them out to their cars. Organized items"
bad,"First thing you would do is clock in and immediately be directed to a register. You would stand at the register for 2 or 4 hours depending on how long your shift was. Take your break which was 15/30 respectively. Then go back to the register until your shift was over. I learned the importance of talking to people to help pass the time, and i met a lot of interesting people as customers. Managements was okay, there were 4 management changes in the time that I worked there. Culture is very industrial. You aren't allowed to speak to other cashiers, management will get onto you for doing so unless it is absolutely dead in the store. You only talk to your co-workers unless you need them for something. The hardest part of the job was honestly trying to stay occupied, there would be days where I rang up 12 customers in 8 hours, which was incredibly boring. The most enjoyable part was definitely customer service, you have a lot more freedom and you can talk to people pretty freely without management getting on to you to much."
bad,"I tihnk that this company is not fair. They do not run their stores in an orderly way, i think that this company needs to revaluate the way that they treat their employes and their customers."
bad,Don't care about their employees manger cut throat. Got favorites they like and protect. No advancement. Union is a rip off not for you but for the company.
bad,"I worked on the front end, usually at self check. If all of the machines were filled with money, it was a good day. I didn't have too many of those. They never hired enough workers and the ones they did hire didn't do any work. The job was tolerable but they really need to raise their pay. I was there for 11 months and got one $0.20 raise to $7.55 an hour. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone, especially not long term."
bad,"They really just threw me into the work environment and I had to figure out on my own where everything went. The manager was honestly a rude individual and I hated to work for him because he didn't, and still doesn't, treat any of the workers with respect. I would never return to that Kroger if he was still working there. The pro, however, was learning the basic concepts of category management and using that to apply life later."
bad,I worked here for the period of about two years while obtaining my undergraduate degree. The support I received here while working was very negligible and didn't feel supported and encouraged to perform my job duties.
bad,"Expect to be under paid and over worked. They have as few employees as possible and have ""metrics"" they expect employees to perform in. Management is too busy filling out paperwork and covering for themselves to actually be able to manage."
bad,For this being my first job it was not a bad start. I personally did not enjoy working in the deli as it was under poor management at the time and was not being ran as efficiently as it could have been.
bad,"After working here for almost a year and being a CSR, the company is trying to accuse me of things that I didn't do by falsifying information. The employees are great, just management."
bad,"A typical day was to come in take pallets off of the trucks and bring them onto the sales floor. You then start stocking your aisles and do any backstock."
bad,"When I first started I was 18 in need of any Job to pay rent and in walking distance. I started in August of 2016 and the job was fine. Sometimes it was stressful but that was to be expected. Hard work was fair and I had plenty of help. Soon after in about march of 2017 Management on the store level changed and we had new staff who didn't know us or what we did or how we worked. They were very by the books, witch i can understand but most of the people working here have done their job and done it well for well over 5 years. So it was frustrating on employees. We lost some staff in the Meat department i worked in. Making the job worse. In 2018 also march we had another set of new managers. This group was strict and enforced the most minute rules most employees over 2 years didn't know existed. In the month i had an emergency medical situation the same week they Fired a coworker and another quit. because we were short staffed i offered what help i could well before i was cleared... my plan was to just take small jobs and help the customers wich involves little to no lifting at all... The first day back i was left alone to close with no help because my coworkers were fed up with the management and lack of help. the next day i was back in the emergency room... on returning to work. because my days were scattered they counted them as 2 separate call offs, and i was SIR... For trying to help my Coworkers who wouldn't help me. I was also SIR for having a cut requiring stitches when a knife fell in the sink i was doing dishes in... Apparently reacting to something falling and accidentally"
bad,"Management at this store does not like older individuals,  Expects you to do 10 jobs at one time.  Demands you do work that you are not trained for.  They do not train employees which cause problems with employees they cannot keep employees"
bad,if you like working alot of 12 hour shifts and not getting holidays or weekends off kroger is for you . ...... . ............... ./... .......... ........ .......
bad,this was also a temp/job.Pick-Save (Roundys) was to help me to better my resume on handle customer service. Kroger came in after i was gone. My manager was a great person.
bad,"The typical day at work was stressful but coworkers were usually friendly and helpful, almost always smiling. I learned how to operate machinery and tools such as:"
bad,I worked here in high school. Its closed now. The management was poor and the majority of the workers were lazy and unmotivated. There was no room for advancement and the pay was poor.
bad,A typical day is stressful. Didn't learned much. Management was ok. The hardest part of the job was lack of pay. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people.
bad,"Did not enjoy my time there. Weird Boss/employee relationships. I've never had to call my boss Mr. or Mrs. ""insert name"" Horrible hours and the fact that they wouldn't work with me and my school schedule is beyond reprehensible."
bad,No the place to work at. Only if you wants discounts then that is great. Not a friendly place to work at. Not a friendly team working place. Every managers are rude.
bad,its stressful. not enough working hours. rude customers. management dont really help. management expect too much but they provide too little. just not a good place to work at.
bad,"it was almost always over staffed with cashiers coming in and having to do a different job than hired for. Poor treatment of workers with disabilities, very judgemental."
bad,Overall a decent place to work during job transitions. Provides customer service experience and work life balance. Pay could be a bit better as well as resource management.
bad,I learned that the Store Manager doesn't really care for the employees as much as the numbers aspect. They aren't willing to help you out when your sick or need some time off for personal reasons like Church or Sports Activities. They don't take your availability into consideration. They expect so much for so little pay. I was a supervisor making just over $10. That isn't enough for what you deal with on a daily basis and what people expect of you every day. It was a poor working environment. Not enough employees to cover the people coming in to shop the store.
bad,Job is for high school students to learn how to work in a team.  Manager was a micro-manager who was always over your shoulder nitpicking.  Vacation is non-existent and seldom approved.  Management treated employees they like much differently than those they did not.  Privileges (opportunities) and vacation time first goes to favs rather than by seniority or merit.
bad,Meet one of my best friends there and most people that work there are good people. Most of the mangers are to. The higher ups come up with the dumbest things to do
bad,"I have worked at this place for a year and it is terrible. You have to have the patience of a saint to deal with everything thrown your way in one day. You are put to brutal work from the second you walk in to the second you got out. Management will never reward you for your hard work but they will make sure to scold you for slacking off. Pay is much lower compared to other places nearby. The only perk that they actually lived up to is the flexible hours, which won't be true towards the holidays."
bad,I don’t desire to work at a place anymore where the hours are constantly inconsistent and I am not getting the credit I deserve. I am always overlooked for promotions and the work environment is quite stressful due to low forecasting of sales which leads to a lower amount of hours available for associates. We are always needing help from various departments and it creates a outstandingly stressful work environment when customers are constantly complaining to the workers about items not being out on the shelves or not enough help in the front-end department.
bad,I work for Kroger a couple different times in different positions and both experiences were less than positive; management was often rude and not flexible at all.
bad,"I was a part- time employee but never seemed to wok enough hours to make enough income. The pay is considerably low for the amount of work and attention to detail that goes into it. I'm not looking for a career in this field whatsoever, so I really didn't benefit very much, however I did learn A LOT. Overall, it's an ok job to have if you're not depending all your bills on it as income (only making like $9-12 an hour) and if you're actually looking for a career in the field. They offer great opportunities for pharmacy students and interns. Otherwise, it's not for you."
bad,Kroger is a great company but must get rid of all the managers left over from farmer Jack because they will not adapt to new ways of retail grocery to move forward into the future.
bad,"Best part about this job was the benefits but besides that working there was a slog. Really poor management in the sense that everything was ""right now"" and an emergency paired with inconsistent schedules led to many unneeded headaches."
bad,"Start clocking in"
bad,everyday was more and more stressfull the managment was awful the less they could do see kroger helps with special kids and they made them do more then thry do i know they have to lean but i also hate to see them poor kisd struggle
bad,"depended where are you going work Kroger that where i work there place management is fixblie , i like work with wrap sandwich and bakery  that all i do it so far ,"
bad,It was ok I guess just wasn’t for me there was several reasons on why I just said that I loved co workers hated management it’s just plain sucked over all
bad,"You are working retail. So long hours, holiday and weekends especially. If you are lucky to get placed at a store close to home it is a decent job but if you have to work far + the daily hours it is not worth it."
bad,"In a typical day, you bag and bring in carts for most of your shift. Its normally 1-3 baggers with you. Lanes are normally backed up into the isles, we're out of carts, and breaks are almost never on time. the hardest part of the job is carts."
bad,"I really don't have anything to say about Kroger's. To be honest, the store need to have all new management to make the store better first of all, then maybe it will get better."
bad,I think my bad experience was due to the supervisor/manager of the department I worked in. She either liked you and you got good hours or she didn't really care for you but you filled empty shifts. She was also extremely rude and you could tell who her favorites were. If you were older than 30 you were at the bottom of the list
bad,I do not have any information on employment at Kroger as I have never worked here. I do not have any idea why Indeed requested my evaluation other than I have worked in the Grocery industry just not for Kroger.
bad,Made me stay out side in the hot Texas heat for an 8 hour shift most of the time hardly getting any breaks. You don’t really get the hours you want and mangers treat people poorly.
bad,"It depends on your intentions, and level of work ability. What you put into this jib is exactly what you will get. Trust no one and please utilize your union representative."
bad,"The typical day at work was show up, clock in, see where a supervisor wanted me on that day, either working on registers or if they needed help elsewhere in the store."
bad,It’s not for anyone out of high school. After you have been there long enough they will cut your hours to give them to newer employees because they don’t have to pay them as much as someone who has been there for a while. Kroger teaches you that no matter how much time you have in a company you are disposable and can easily be replaced without a second thought.
bad,"Decent working environment to make new friends in. Management has bad habits of engaging in poor communication with associates, often chastising employees to the point of quitting. High turnover rate and low morale."
bad,"Very cut throat.  Very unstructured.  Preferences made based on who you know, and who you are friends with.  If you out perform a supervisor it doesn't work out well for you."
bad,I had a horrible experience working for Kroger. I only worked there while I was going to school so that I could work nights.  The management was infuriating and the pay was extremely low after you pay union dues every paycheck.
bad,"Company caters to crybabies who don't do their job instead of hard workers.Leaders have no idea what leadership is."
bad,"Ive learned the importance of customer service "
bad,"You get what you expect. I worked as a cashier clerk. I felt advancement options were not offered to me but others employees. And in the end when they restructured the company, I felt poorly treated. It was very physical, and a lot of standing in one place."
bad,Talk is cheap and Kroger talks plenty.  In the end their actions rarely follow there mission statement.  Yet they continue to constantly change actions/programs because none are successful.
bad,ive worked at Kroger for 4 years now. There bad communication. I work at the fuel center as a fuel lead and they really do not care about the fuel center team members or what happens there. They do not train well either.
bad,"It was a very stressful job, some co workers would help if they saw me in need. But management was very unorganized. I wouldn't say it was fun unless you have co workers that are new working with you because you're learning everything together and you can relate to one another."
bad,Management needs to improve and the pay needs to increase if you ask for more hours and you're the go to person I think they should give you more hours
bad,"My manager of my team was wonderful. Always willing to jump in if she was needed on the floor even if she was needed elsewhere. The job is fast paced but it always made the day go by fast. The customers (for the most part) were great to us. The kiosk was always clean and the products were always dated correctly. The only thing holding anybody back from getting their jobs done correctly was the Kroger management. From the moment I got hired I should have known that I couldn't trust their word. Promised to have at least 30 hours a week and the second week I worked the hours got cut back and they hired 2 more people after me. If you need help, have questions or concerns you will not be answered. They always treated other parts of the store with a different respect. A girl told me while I was training that we were the ""red headed step child of this place"". It was true. Your tips that you receive are totaled up and divided by hours worked. You have to pick them up by check at customer service every Friday. None of the people who I started this job with are there anymore. That's how great this company is."
bad,"They do not care about family"
bad,"Not nearly enough hours for the pay. The customers were nice and so were the other employees but most of the time I only worked maybe 4 hours a day, and sometimes not even 5 days of the week."
bad,Very stressful environment to work in. Your hours are always being cut without warning. Excellent health insurance however if your hours are cut too much you are dropped without warning.
bad,"The management teams I've worked with over the years have been, for the most part, poorly trained and underskilled for their position, which leads to a stressful work environment that I cannot recommend."
bad,Management is not very professionable and they lower all the hard dependable workers hours and give them to new employees. They make me pick up everyone else's slack all the time on top of my own tasks.
bad,"I worked for the warehouse for all Kroger stores. Very stressful , have to be able to lift 75lbs or more also need to be able to lift that over your head to stack on a cart. No dress code, not really a family place to work you had to work long hours and a lot of over time."
bad,"For a mechanic, work varied greatly as some days you would be constantly working on breakdowns. I learned about the complex nature of a food production facility. Opinions of management at the top levels were low and was reflected in the attitude of many employees. The hardest part of my job was probably contending with the physical environment, but learning the mechanical aspects of such a wide array of equipment is also a great challenge. As in most cases, I believe, getting a production line back up and running provides a good deal of satisfaction."
bad,"Kroger's meat and seafood department was only fast paced during lunch hours. When it wasn't busy, i would be able to stock product at my own pace, whether it were fast or mid-paced."
bad,"A typical day of working at Fry's would be taking care of grocery carts and bringing them back into the cart rally for customers to use to get the things they need, refill the ice cooler, and bag customers groceries. I learned new ways of talking to people especially working in an environment that's different than most. Management works well with you. The culture of Fry's is fast paste but its easy if you know what you're doing. The most enjoyable part of working at Fry's is getting to know new ways of talking to people and learning how to use good customer serve for future jobs."
bad,"The management would change in and out very, very often. Which lead to poor leadership and poor knowledge of what to do in that position. Maybe if your a high schooler it would be a good job."
bad,"Kroger is a job that is easy to get into as there is no drug test, however after working there for some time and getting to know those in management, I have absolutely no desire to ever work there again and continuously chose to go grocery shopping in other stores due to it.  As a courtesy clerk you are constantly taken advantage of and are expected to clean up after every other position no matter your current task, you are asked to essentially run to each task you are assigned to and the management is undependable."
bad,Horrible customers treat you like garbage and so does management. Expect manegers to have your back but they never do. Treat you like a slave and pay you like one too
bad,The Kroger company changed so much after the first few years.  They no longer seem interested in what's best for their associates is customers but only for the bottom dollar.
bad,"I gave Kroger many chances in the past year, but management’s lack of concern for the health and well-being of the “lower” associates creates a toxic, unreliable work environment for everyone involved. From the moment I entered the store I could tell that the general low morale and high turnover rate was not without cause. Pulled 50 hours a week in a department by myself and was refused the staffing that my department high-ups had recommended and approved. If management can get you to do it all and save themselves the trouble, they will."
bad,"I am the Deli/Bakery Assistant Manager. In 2017, My Bakery Manager got diagnosed with Pancreatic caner, and had to go on a 1 year medical leave. It was my job as the departments assistant, to take his place until his return, or leave was up. I did not know anything about running a bakery, and after 7 stressful, understaffed months of struggling, I asked to step down. I was told if I did not want to run the bakery, I would be stepping down as a regular employee. I decided it was in my best interest to just quit, and find a more suitable job that would appreciate all my hard work."
bad,"Great if you're under 18 and want a job, but depending on your management staff it may start to be draining after a while. Sometimes feels like you need to be there for years to get anywhere of importance in the culture."
bad,You are paid minimum wage and expected to work full-time hours if needed with only the part-time pay rate. Which is nearly half that of a full-time employee. Be ready for people to assume you will go above and beyond and they don't have to.
bad,Kroger is a stressful job due to the demand of what they want you to due to the lack of help you are given to do the job you are given. There is some awesome people that you get to work with.
bad,before i hired in they promised me at least 25 hours a week but after working there for 6 months and trying to get the hours they promised me i was only able to get 12 to 1 hours a week.
bad,It was fast paced the store i was at was in a bad part of town it was close to the interstate  and was robbed quite often we constantly had to watch the customers and make sure they didnt steal anything wich was not any easy task due to how the store was set up
bad,Kroger was a good job to branch out for networking. While working at Kroger I met many people that I will hopefully have on my team in the long run. Kroger was a second home despite the horrible management team.
bad,"Your exact experience depends on what department you work in. None offer the sort of experience to make you sad to go home, but some of them are more tolerable than others. I quit a few weeks after I was moved to a different department because a new store manager forced me to work a 15-hour shift with only a 15-minute break."
bad,"If you want to work at a place where you'll have to pick up everyone else's slack and they get no repercussions, this is the job for you. Also, if you'd like to work on every holiday, this is job for you."
bad,"Lack of training, and support from upper management causes a high turn over rate for new hires. There needs to be a better training period and extended classes for certain areas such as the Deli."
bad,"The work itself is pretty straightforward and easy, it's just a challenge to get what all they wanted done completed in the set time frame. Training could be done better, there's a consistent lack of effort from management when it comes to that. It's tough to get things done on your own when the task has the work load that would need multiple people to complete. The best part of my time there was working in the front end."
bad,"Not to much to say, but i prayed for a better place with a more comfortable envieinment. Asst. Manager was terrible with employees hours and the  way they operate their cashiers on registers. Its was uncomcoftable setting."
bad,"I do not care about this part for it is a waste of my time, I just to get this review over with for it does not help me with finding a job which is the point of me on this site to begin with."
bad,they provide great benefits they underpay they workers the raises are not much the management is horrible it would be a ok place for a high student to work
bad,The job and environment itself is all around horrible with everyone there smoking and all around I didn’t enjoy working there that much with me having a free schedule 24/7 and not getting any hours at all and even at times only working once a week. I’d prefer to work somewhere I can be more productive at.
bad,"The pay is minimum wage cause most of it unionized. No benefits. Expect a lot out of you with compensation (pay, appreciation, nothing). Would not recommend unless you absolutely need something."
bad,came in and went to the board were the Boss has everybody name on it and what he wants everyone to do for the day. I usually go to the freezer and do the stock in there first.
bad,Kroger was a great place for me to grow as an individual yet it was a terrible place to be in on a weekly basis. Half the workers did not do anything which left me to do a majority of the work.
bad,"A typical workday at Kroger for a front end worker consists of collecting carts, returning unused or unwanted merchandise to shelves, and maintaining a clean environment for the customers and merchandise within the store."
bad,"It was my first job after HS I made next to nothing for 40 hrs a week, great job if you’re in HS, not recommended to sustain any sort of life style if you have more the two bills"
bad,"The entire time I worked there, the manager for my department was constantly complaining and intentionally messing up things for the employees so as to make the entire department look bad. I overheard him several times say that they wished they would just fire him already. This resulted in several long time employees in the department getting fired for things beyond their control. So I jumped ship before I got fired."
bad,"There were 3-4 store managers and their communication was so poor. If you told one something important, none of the others would know and generally the original manager you brought something too was so busy they'd forget anyway. Placed me in different job areas without my permission. When I complained to multiple managers, no action was taken, went over a month in the new positions before I quit due to this."
bad,pay could be better no family life very stressful work but they will work with you on time off and most of the management is easy to get along with good customer base
bad,"decent job but the hours and schedule are all over the place, i have no idea why but they pay horribly also. for being in the store from 10pm-7am you would think they'd at least have a meal for us lol."
bad,"Kroger is a union so you would think that they listen to their employees and at least pay them decently. NOPE. We were paid multiple dollars cheaper than other competitive pharmacies. When we started getting ""incentives"", they decided that it was too much money to give away and changed the incentives to where only lucky employees (name picked from a hat) would win extra money. Before, you could get $2 for every positive mention of your name to go toward food/drink. It's just sad. Management also sucked. Pharmacy management picked favorites constantly and the store management just acted like they cared. We constantly had new store managers."
bad,"A typical work day was hectic, you have no idea what you will be walking into it. You were always running and didn't have time to eat. You can forget about the work life/balance working for this company."
bad,"I did not enjoy working at kroger what so ever. My day at work was sweeping, garbage, getting carts, cleaning, assisting customers, and helping with whatever people needed"
bad,"Trying to avoid the stereotype of retail associates, my time working at Kroger was under paid and over worked. Management is next to no help and their ideas look great on paper but are not practical."
bad,I worked at the local Kroger for a month and it was the worst month of my employment career. The people I worked with were inconsiderate and I had little to no training prior to starting my job- just the usual CBLs.
bad,The pay for an officer is lousy they treat officera bad they don't give us our uniforms in a timely manner i am still waiting aftwr2 4 months they don't want to give us the proper supplies we need to do our jobs officiantly. They pay warehouse employees 14 + an hour and guards 10 i live an hour a way Is a waste to drive there i need to get gas every day i go negative in my bank every week
bad,"My job itself was fine, but dealing with the management was a exercise in futility. Poor communication and poor problem solving all the way up. Lack of understanding of employees actual job duties and also a general lack of effort on the management's part."
bad,A typical day of work consisted of the same routine where no one takes initiative but points the blame on others especially the managers.hours vary and are limited
bad,"nothing much to say about working here, it's a good job for some just starting out or wants a second income. basically a lot of cleaning and standing on your feet."
bad,"All i did was cut fresh meat and cheese, measured based on what the customer needed, I assisted in frying chicken, working the bar, cleaning and helping out where needed."
bad,"Working at Dillons was stressful, fast-paced, and the work was intense. Management changed constantly, providing no job security. They refused to lessen my schedule and allow me to work in the daytime more. My schedule was erratic and stressful. Some of my coworkers were fickle, some were downright mean, and others refused to do their jobs."
bad,I operated a cash register and assisted customers in finding the products that they needed.  I also trained new cashiers and put back reshop that customers did not want I also made sure that my work area was clean at all times.
bad,"was a good job experience. Learned a few more skills to help me in future. Would recommend the job for younger adults, would be an easy way for them to gain job experience"
bad,If you are younger and can handle customers with low wages this place is for you.  The people were really nice.  If you are sick you best not miss work.
bad,Stay occupied at all times. I worked in the deli area with all protein and healthy foods are sold. we have to make sure all dates are valid and to make sure none of our foods look unhealthy to serve.
bad,This company sucks. They're union so there is constantly this fight between management and the union about how to treat people. I never actually quit and they never officially fired me they just kept scheduling me less and less and eventually not at all.
bad,"Working here was honestly the worst. The customers and daily tasks were extremely stressful, not to mention the lack of shift variety due to employee availability. Co-workers were sometimes unwilling to do certain tasks which would be left to be done by the same people each night. The department is constantly busy and there's almost always something to do or rush off to take care of. Being food service, the rules and procedures are very strict, no exceptions to anyone and mistakes were not taken lightly. On any given night I was lucky to get two fifteen minute breaks in an eight hour shift, and would usually have to settle for just the one. All-in-all, not very rewarding or satisfying work."
bad,"I was expected to have a list of tasks completed by the end of my shift every day, the problem is that customers required service immediately making it extremely difficult to complete every task on busy days, customers living in the area were rude and there was an apparent lack of respect for employees at this location. Management did not have any regard for their workers' schedules and would make seemingly random adjustments to the weekly schedule without notice. Weekly schedule started on Thursday instead of a day that made sense."
bad,"Hours vary a minumum of 21-24 as required be the union, as full-time has to be earned. Days off are rotating along with shifts and chance of working a majority of weekends."
bad,great places and will work with you would be great for teens and or students or even as a second job and you get to work with alot of great people everyday
bad,I worked here as a high school student. I worked when it was roundys so I know a lot has changed. Managers are all different as well as the work areas.
bad,Its okay if you prefer retail. You have the opportunity to help at other stores and help as well as learn from other techs. Other than that it was fine and it helped me in the long run.
bad,working in the pharmacy at krogers can be very hectic. There never really is enough help and it is hard when you supervisor becomes overwhelmed and cries. pay is not fair. you may be state certified but you will still make minimum wage.
bad,"Lots of employee complaining, constantly pushing you to work faster, no matter how fast you work or how you are feeling.  Long hours, stay until it's done, which is difficult in stores that open very early (5 AM) or open 24 hours and customers complaining about you."
bad,"work schedule is NOT flexible."
bad,"I worked as clerk stockier as loading more cans and food boxes in front shelf and loading more new and old dates for breads in every morning. Also, I putted all of empty boxes in machine to push them down in flat."
bad,"Workers in general weren't bad, but the management was terrible, and it would cause many good people to quit."
bad,"while I did not enjoy working at krogers, to many job titles for 1 pay. wasn't to organized in the back people were extremely rude. they did offer free lunch some days that was a perk and also being apart of the union, but still the pay wasn't good"
bad,I was treated unfairly due to my age and gender.  They were very rude to me when I asked if I got a break that day after working for 5 hours already.  The head manager of my department preferred the male workers and cut the female's hours back and gave the men the hours.  It was unfair and I ended up walking out due to the treatment.
bad,"The communication posses there is in dire need of improvement! Especially with the staff and management. Plus, it needs to be made clear on job duties."
bad,Ok job for high school first job or job while in school. Maybe ok for retirees who want extra money. Not a good career choice long term. Good employees who are loyal to the job.
bad,"Didn't really work with the public, or with other employees. Good ran company with management being moved constantly. That company will be around for along time."
bad,They never really paid attention to people availability and they always try to make you seem like they don't appreciate  your time and request. Don't know dhow to solve problems and very rude.
bad,"At the time the deli department was very unorganized and the manager was not willing to work with everyone's schedule which prevented a lot of associated from getting the hours they needed,"
bad,"Courtesy clerks should be paid more because they do basically everything. They do go backs, gets carts from the lot, and even have to be a cashier when it’s really busy."
bad,"Pretty much what you'd expect from a corporate environment. Hired mostly ""entry level applicants"" for part-time hours. Expect to work with a lot of highschoolers and young adults. Benefits really only apply to full-time employees and those positions are hard to come by. Pay is not very competitive and the varying schedule is frustrating."
bad,Kroger when I worked there was a good place to start out while you where in high school witch at the time I worked there i was in high school so was a good fit for me then
bad,decent work for students and or elderly no real issues just sought out better things and pay the people were great would consider for second job great place
bad,"The managers cannot make up their minds on policies and standards, so you are getting 8 different directions for the same subject from 3 different people. You are not given enough hours to complete what you are expected to, nor or you given the help. You are not supposed to work overtime, yet you are expected to do the work of 3 people, causing for very long days. Despite being customer service and supposedly customer first, managers are too worried about what kind of paper work and procedures will please the upper management. There is no teamwork. Morale is terrible. They don’t pay as much as other grocery stores. It has good job security and good advancement opportunities, though."
bad,"the management was not really there, hours were not flexible, and hard to get a personal day off. the only time it seemed like I can get off is if I had to visit the hospital or a family emergency"
bad,They were happy keeping a steady position with a core group of employees with it being hard to do enjoyable things there unless you were part of the core group
bad,poor management
bad,"Kroger was a fun place to work. I loved my job. I loved all managers but one. I would still be at this job if it wasn't for one manager. I would really be wiling to return if I could, with more pay. When I worked at kroger I did not even make $9 an hour."
bad,was ok for a staring job when i was young but the pay was horrible. Worked overnight and didnt get paid what i should have. The union was a joke as well .
bad,If you have health issues and have told them how many hours you are suppose to work and that you have needs to be met. Well guess what they do not care and will find any excuse to fire you before you are out of the probation period is over.
bad,"I would say there is only one good thing about working at Kroger. And that would be quiting Kroger. That and the small mediocre discounts that they give to their employees, which is a joke to say the least."
bad,I did not like the work culture here. They would over work you and under pay you.  They did not listen to employee's who had ideas. The manager ruled with a iron fist.
bad,"was very much under paid when it was still owned by roundy's.  asked to do too much for the little pay that was offered. worked in deli , meat, and front end"
bad,fair in some areas lots of favoritism for consideration for advancement positions and upper positions hard to get into the clickish atmosphere not much minority
bad,I had management who scheduled me on my days off. work was too fast paced. breaks were given late. management looked out for management and employees had to fend for themselves.
bad,"Union can be a double edged sword, as some people are legitimately bad workers and stick around by making friends at union. I've heard stories from people at other stores and the culture here sounds like you have to ""know someone"" to advance. Not much reason to work hard unless you enjoy getting more responsibilities without any extra pay."
bad,"I would not recommend working here to anyone. The pay is dependent on how you work if you worked you would still get shortchanged. No matter what, if you were bullied the management would do nothing about it at all."
bad,My time there was unremarkable I barely remember it. I just remember engaging with some customers an coworkers that is about it. The workplace culture there was kind of blah.
bad,"Hostile environment , make excuses for employees that should be let go. Pharmacist doesn't do his job, relies heavily too much on others to do it for him"
bad,"unloading palettes, diving stock by what goes on each aisle. throw the stock for about 6-7 aisle. lots of heavy lifting and gotta be able to stand for long periods of time."
bad,Very demanding and has poor managers. Expect a lot of work for a very low wage. Would not recommend this job to a lot of people except for high school students.
bad,Incompetent managers and extremely low pay. The higher up managers always love to get in the way of the department managers even though they actually know what to do
bad,This company is a horrible environment to be apart of. I do not enjoy working there and the pay is awful. I would recommend a pay increase in order to stay at that job.
bad,The front end managers were cruel and did not care about my well being. I do not recommend working there even if it is a part time job. Good luck to all that do.
bad,"This is job is reasonable for their minors.  It is really good for making petty cash.  However, if you a looking for a career opportunity, this is not a good place to start.  There is no opportunity for full time positions and over-time is frowned upon."
bad,if this is your first job then you will like it if you are okay with a fast pace area the training is long but you get paid for it. the people i worked for at my store are not the nicest people.
bad,"The pace was too fast. The hours were too long. The breaks weren't long enough. The staff was cruel. I was fired for being too slow after 15 years of working there, plus the drive was long."
bad,"The pay was the lowest it could be, I didn't get a raise till two years ended, and it was only a twenty cent increase. I felt like I work to the bone for nothing, first jobs"
bad,"The hours were inconsistent we kept getting cuts and they barely train you. Sooooo it can pretty much bet a waste of time. However some of the people can be cool from time to time, but some tend to slack off or dont show up at all."
bad,"When working here most people worked on their own at their own pace. "
bad,"Challenging and good opportunity to open doors in Kroger, and interesting environment to work in a marketplace........................................"
bad,nothing  to  say  but   low  wages  and  really  need  better  baggers  besides  standing  around  on  their  phones  in  the  parking  lot  and  u  ask  them  for  help  out  to  the  car  they  look  at  u  like  its  not  my  job  and  other  people  help  them  out  thought  it  was  a  baggers  dutie  to  help  them  out
bad,"I'd advise anyone to try and get on at the warehouse or start as a teenager. Coming in as a full adult if that's your only income is a no go. Management sucks, Hours vary, and please don't believe the hype."
bad,"This being my first job was the only reason it was good, the income, I made good money being a student but I had to deal with two much being an employee."
bad,"They are really good at giving employees new work and tasks to do, without making the job better. More work, and more stress with less help and meager pay. I understand that the customer experience is what drives the store and how they make money, but treating your employees poorly seems to be the trade off."
bad,"the location was great for travel, the hours were not that great.  the schedule was flexible to a point.  managers however tried to be accommodating and that was appreciated"
bad,"good place to work, i just had my own issue of traveling to that far everyday. it was getting to be an hassle going to and from work everyday. i wish it was not so far."
bad,"I have been working at Kroger for about four months now and I would not recommend the company as a good place to work. The biggest reason is because the company as a whole does not pay their workers fairly. No matter how good an employee you are (coming in early, staying late, picking up shifts, doing good work, getting along well with managers and coworkers, etc.) you will not get a raise until everyone else gets one..... 5 cents..... every six months. And although the stores advertise that their employees can make as much as $10.20 an hour, hardly anyone who isn't a store manager actually sees that, even the people who have been there for many years (because 10 cents a year doesn't add up very quickly). Pay rates and raises are all calculated by contract with the union (which is a joke) so there are no personal raises for good performance. The more work experience you have, the higher your starting pay rate. No experience, you make minimum wage. It might be good as a job for someone who has several years of work history and just wants to supplement their income with a few hours a week, but I would not recommend this to anyone just starting out or who is looking to save money for college or something like that. There are much better places out there that pay more and appreciate their employees."
bad,Very stressful environment and lower than average pay.  Work schedule changes weekly and includes weekends and holidays.  Expectations and demands can often be unreasonable.
bad,"Kroger is based on making money, it cares less about the people, they have ads saying they are military friendly yet they offer no discounts and military personal working for them are treated even worse"
bad,"The job made me stressed, as a cashier people are extremely rude to you. CSR’s think they’re in charge and berate employees  in front of customers. You get paid nothing as well."
bad,Hours were inconsistent. Never got enough hours scheduled. Pay was poor for a part-time job. Management team didn't seem to care about the employees. Not the best part-time job
bad,Kroger is a stepping stone and most people should not stay there too long. I didn't like the management and the training was inadequate and everyone pointed the finger at someone else
bad,This was a tough job with overnight hours. I had to clean entire floor all night long. It was tough. Benefits were good but pay was low. Did not get enough hours per week.
bad,I enjoyed working at Kroger when I first started. I didn't like how they would lead me onto to thinking I was doing well then would lie about it behind my back. They weren't very direct.
bad,I like working for Krogers i love all the customers and meeting new customers everyday. I was not train very well on how to cut the meat for our case.
bad,I was a cart pusher and grocery sacker so dealing with customers all day and going outside in the heat for 30 minutes or sometimes an hour at a time to push carts is what a normal day was like.
bad,I was stocker for the perishable area. I always went in 6am. On this particular morning I had to finish filling the milk cooler. Had 3 pallets of freight. Also had to be backup cashier.  I had to have my work done before noon that day as well.
bad,The store is lacking in management. The management is not fair to employees. Not a good company I do not recommend this place to anyone wanting to work and the pay is bad.
bad,"I had quit my job at MotorCity Casino and needed something Part time to pay my rent. I got hired very quickly and started working just as fast. Most of the customers where nice and polite. A few were complete A holes. But what can u do about it,  nothing. Their was this one employee no one wanted to work with she was so lazy. She always took long breaks when we really could of used her help slicing meats for customers. The best thing about that job is not having to deal with that old lady."
bad,"A typical day would be squeezing out the energy out of the good workers while the managers sit on their rear end complaining of how you don't do your job. Horrible scheduling. If you consider yourself a good worker, I don't recommend you here. They take advantage of you. Lazy people could strive in this business."
bad,Hired as part time auditor and was moved into full time sales without being asked.  Unreasonable goals and terrible management.  Pay and compensation was not as promised.
bad,"In my experience, Kroger does not care about anything else other than making sure they get money. They definitely do not care about their employees and making sure they can either advance or get more hours to make ends meet. I worked there for 4 years and I can say the first year was fine but it went downhill the more I got pushed to do other tasks in the department. This place is terrible and it is not the place to make a career."
bad,i was in high school when i started working at krogers so everthing has changed since then dont really know anythng abot krogers the managment team was great when i worked there
bad,"Management doesn't care about employees, and often won't work with them. They ask for the sun and moon and still treat you horribly. I wouldn't recommend working here except for last resort."
bad,Very low paying job and very little training given. Little to no help from management and fellow employees. Very high quitting and fire rate. Poor flooring conditions.
bad,Too much drama and everyone plays favorites there. I would come in at 1:30 pm and work alone until 10-11 at night. Hardest part of the job was not being scheduled with anyone because they said I was capable of doing it alone. Although no one should have to do it alone.
bad,Doesn't treat long term employees very well. I'm barely getting enough hours to pay bills despite working for 5 years and having flexible availability and am now having to look elsewhere to work.
bad,"Union seems to be the biggest problem. They have their hands in your pocket for the first 4 checks. Regardless of the hours, they get their take. Now those same people that are supposed to have your back are the ones that protect people who don't do their jobs. You are pair with people that have years in the company and barely, if at all, hit the minimum goals for works. They make their rate, and you are stuck at minimum wage. Management says it is too hard to try to replace them because the union will bury them in paperwork.  So if you feel like busting your butt while others sit on their butt, then this is the place for you."
bad,"I like the people I work with. It does not have a good family/work balance. They ignore your availability requests. Its retail, so they think of you as replaceable. It's only very recently that they did not start everyone at $7.30"
bad,"I would not work for Kroger again based on my experience with working there. Management is prone to blame problems on associates, drama is rampant, and expectations are placed too high. "
bad,I am only working there until I find a full time job. There is no communication among managers and the work environment is quite poor. The way to treat employees is not something I think they have ever been taught.
bad,I loved meeting new people all different cultures the job was actually a good job I just wasn't trained properly knowing the policies and rules that I needed to execute the job
bad,"I did not like my time spend and Kroger stores . there was little to no instruction, it was a slow paced work environment, absolutely no supervision. I had to learn my way around the store and learn how to attend cars alone, which was fine because I am a fast learner and learn from mistakes quickly but it was not a very good work experience also I was able to work almost 45days before they did a background check and then was terminated ."
bad,"a typical work day at kroger was bagging groceries, then jumping on a register when the front end was busy. towards the end of my shift i would go help push grocery carts back in the store."
bad,If you are hardest worker in store but newest employee there theyll give more hours to lazy people because of senority days off are never the same. Smh
bad,No one is on the same page. Leadership will put you down and treat you horribly. They don't like to work around availability but will because they have to.
bad,"Incredibly high turn-over rate because you aren't treated fairly until you have worked there 5 years. Management is a joke and don't care about employees because they are all replaceable to them. Hours are based off of seniority, so the person who has been there the longest gets the best hours. Schedules are not flexible what so ever. The environment is basically a high school and management does nothing to step in to help personal situations."
bad,"Nothing fancy, but if you aren't quick on your feet or can count numbers like a mad man you won't be able to work in the meat and seafood department. Plus my manager wasn't the greatest nor did he care about training us"
bad,"This is the job I wish I never would've taken. Management is rude, unprofessional, and cliquey. Everyone I talked to hated being there but was there out of need for a job. It is a union company that you get NO choice to join. They take alot of funds out your paycheck for the first month. They claim to be a business that lets you move up within the company but they did everything to keep me at the entry level position even after giving me management duties with no change in pay. I also told them I was a student and that school was a priority when I was hired on, they would schedule me during my classes. When I would call management to let them know I couldnt work that (my availability was clearly stated on my app form) shift I was treated uphoardly. I would come in during my time off to buy groceries and management would follow me through the store to reprimand me."
bad,Kroger is for anyone who is looking to start there first job. It is an easy job but sucks as far as retail. The management is miserable because they work them long hours and the turn over is so high. I would recommend not staying with kroger long-term.
bad,"Not to trust what management says, if you see something wrong don't waist your time telling managers because nobody will do anything about it. good luck trying to make this a career."
bad,"I did not enjoy working for this company. Management was ok, but most of the staff were rude and did care about meeting the customer's needs as much as they should have."
bad,"At the store I worked for, for 2 years, everything that I told a manager ended up throughout the whole store. Then they try to make it someone else's fault"
bad,the freezer i worked in was no joke the coldness was outstanding some times take your breath away that was the hardest part but i cant say it was all bad there some good in all jobs its just i dont think i got the chance to see the good in it
bad,A typical day at work is stressful and the corporation expects to much of its workers especially those in management roles. I take great pride in my work I do on a daily basis. The hardest part of the job is communication and how you are treated by supervisors. The best part of the job is the fun coworkers and customers I encounter.
bad,"Great place to work to decide if you like retail or not. The job was fun but the company sucks. wouldn't go back there. too much politics."
bad,I liked it at first but then completely hated it. Management sucked. They were very pushy and bossy. Only cared about themselves. The pay sucked. Barely any hours because they always hired new people.
bad,"I felt that the location that I worked had a very high expectation of its employees without giving the proper support or understanding of time constraints in a day.  There was too much asked of each person, and not enough time or support allotted to complete the task, often times with reprimands when goals were not met. I saw many people come and go, with only a few of them actually staying at the job."
bad,company in flux due to internet and other factors. work load is heavy with no possibility of help getting the job done. people pass up advancement due to the nature of being held over on a regular basis. 12 hour days are a norm. work/home life balance doesn't exist
bad,Worked here while in high school. Great benefits and was in union. Great place to work as a teenagers. I would recommend anyone looking to start working.
bad,I was a courtsey clerk so i was at the bottom of the food chain for the 2 years i worked there. I pushed carts out in the blistering heat especially with the hott asphalt
bad,It was always a struggle to get good hours while working here. The management was always changing and would all try and enforce their own way from previous stores. There was no smooth flow and lots of miscommunication.
bad,"They changed managment very suddenly and there was no smooth integration of old employees with new ones. The new supervisors were not given very good instruction on how our workplace functioned, as well as our procedures/guidelines."
bad,"I guess they have flexible hours when youre part time, its an ok work environment nothing special, breaks are decent, managers are decent but sort of lazy."
bad,"Nice pay however long days and mandatory overtime. Warehouse work for Roundy's brought by Kroger. Be prepared to work long hours and mandatory overtime, sometimes seven days a week,  Kroger is attempting to make positive change."
bad,"It was good for someone who had never had a job before but would not recommend trying to make it a career. It was okay enough, even with the low pay and standards."
bad,"They only have 1 register open when there are a thousand customers my breaks were never on time , they always want you to cover the same person that took forever on their break so they can take they lunch or go home"
bad,"While I worked for the company for a short period, it was a very stressful job and the work atmosphere was very competitive and cutthroat. Yes, I did improve the sales in my department, but it was never good enough."
bad,decent job but not much room for salary advancement. decent people to work with but company policies can get extremely annoying. Hardest part of the job is to much work for no pay.
bad,"It is a difficult place to work. The union does little to protect hourly associates, poor leadership and very little concern for the work life balance of thier employees"
bad,Not the best place to work and no stability. Upper management communication could improve. Respect for all people should be a values of the kroger stores.
bad,"Kroger from the sound of it used to be a decent place to work, Now... the only thing keeping me there is the money and benefits. I am expected to work 10-13 hours a day with a stock crew that can barely even wipe themselves. Upper management is under-trained and only does things to benefit profit margins. They refuse to hire anyone worth anything and Kroger pays new employees next to nothing. ""You get what you pay for."" As a Grocery manager I am expected to stock more than my stock crew, while doing a list of other things which I never have time for."
bad,"Typical Day at work- OK"
bad,did not enjoy my time out here. I worked for Kroger for about 2 years and it is very mundane and by far the most unchallenging experience I have ever encountered in the workforce.
bad,"Management can be a pain and employees aren't much better. Work is boring, monotonous, and sometimes gross. No benefits or perks at all, and zero effort to work with your schedule."
bad,"Often over-stressed due to management expectations, with both stores I worked at. Management does not know communication skills. Poor team atmosphere."
bad,Work life balance is terrible. Upper management is under so much pressure that they treat everyone terribly. There is no way to reach goals that are set. They have unrealistic expectations.
bad,"OK, so this is not a crack at Fry's. It's a crack at the grocery business.  As an assistant manager, the pay was just about the only OK, not great, thing about it. While I worked with an awesome grocery manager, a solid assistant manager, and exceptional stockers, the management at the top of the food chain expected way too much from us in an 8 hour shift. Might just be me or it might just be the store manager, but I just couldn't wait for a shift to be over."
bad,"The only way you'll be valued by the company is if you started working there at 14 years old. Benefits are few and unattainable, hours are inconsistent, and management has a do-as-I-say-not-as-I-do work ethic."
bad,They expect a little too much from you for such little pay. You may enjoy it the first few time you work but after you will not enjoy it at all. There are some good parts of the job
bad,Management will make many promises to you on advancement and not keep their word. The job doesn't pay well and only provides a few cent raises every month
bad,"About 3-6 months into the job, the employee benefits kick in and they are substantial offering discounts to so many places. Getting there was not worth it to me. Workers would skip shifts without warning and no penalties. The managers were always in a state of extreme anxiety and screaming at the employees (I suspect they couldn't handle the pressure). They often forget to send me on my breaks and didn't accommodate my school schedule. After years of working, a coworker friend finally got promoted inheriting the extra responsibilities and hours yet still only paid the same minimum wage as before. What gives?"
bad,"A typical day at work included scanning and sacking grocery items. Working here I learned great customer service skills. However, management was very unorganized. The hardest part of this job was dealing with management. The most enjoyable part would have to be assisting customers."
bad,"I loved my job at this store.  But they did not seem to care about their employees very much. I worked alot in the heat, without much water.  But I set goals and took pride in doing the best I could."
bad,Kroger was very wishy washy. its one of places you have to be friends with someone in order to make it out on top. every man for they self. dog eat dog. people throw people under the bus and all
bad,"There is a large amount of turnover with very little chance of moving up unless you threaten to leave the store you are working at, at which point they will attempt to offer you a promotion. Do no reccomend."
bad,"Bad scheduling. Bad training. Bad culture. The only good thing is that I got a good paycheck, although I had to work anywhere between 50-58 hours a week. Constantly changing schedule, working every weekend and holiday, open/close/mid sometimes all in one week. Constantly being pressured to get the most out of a min wage staff that is already consistently shorthanded."
bad,unprofessional work environment co managers flirting with employees         equipment not working managers telling employees to be untruthful to customers
bad,"A typical day at kroger begins with day shift drama between arguing, lack of communication or just flat out fighting. No teamwork, no productivity during the midshift hours. I work nightshift and once day shift employees leave the night begins to get better but the lack of experience pay and motivation creates tension among myself and fellow employees. The equipment gets repaired rarely as well as the tools necessary to finish the job aren't present (broom, squeegy, properly functioning scales, etc.). A company that cares nothing about there employees and if it wasn't for a union, the turn around rate would be ridiculous with the lack of understanding from management."
bad,The management did everything they could to harass most of the employees on a regular basis. Worked for this company for close to 2 years and did not receive any of the raises I was supposed to get. Did attempt to work with your schedule if you were a student
bad,"Working at Kroger was a good first job for me. I would do anything around the store that needed to be done, in the sense of upkeep in a store. It taught me the basic duties that are required to run the day to day operations of a marketplace."
bad,Kroger is a nice working environment. The employers are nice. The best part about working with the company is interacting with the customers. They expect a lot out of their employees. sometimes u have to work in other departments to get them caught up even though you will get behind on your on work
bad,"In general the management weren't friendly people. A lot of extra work. I would be the only parcel there a lot of the time, getting up to 5 calls within a few minutes and expected to handle more than was physically possible for one person to do."
bad,"When i worked at kroger i did all the above, customer service, self checkout assist customers all around cashier but he main position was file maintenance always making sure the sale signs are up to date"
bad,"They are very disorganized, especially when it comes to scheduling your work days. They make you do jobs that are outside of your department. They were usually under staffed and I would usually have to work overtime."
bad,"They do not pay enough for the job. I was paid 7.25 an hour. I didn't even make $100 on my checks. The managers show favoritism and instead of helping you learn the position, they make it seem like you are a burden and talk about you to others. They also micromanage you, which shows mistrust and shows that they believe you are not competent enough to fulfill your daily duties."
bad,Some of the management acted childish and often employees would call in because they couldn't stand the manager on shift. I ended up being called in to cover a lot of these shifts since I lived so close at the time and the managers made it a point to take advantage of my situation until I was burnt out. Not a very good place to work
bad,"Management had 0 grip on the store I worked at, and it was clear they didn't care. In addition, they called me every day and asked me to come in and always underscheduled even though we had plenty of employees. They've made me gather carts in the middle of the summer for 3-4 hours at a time, not letting me come inside for breaks."
bad,Small office environment very hard to break into cliques.. No training materials in place. Too many managers telling you to do things their way. Other employees give you different information if you ask questions about how to perform a job related process.
bad,"A typical day at Kroger would entail baking and packaging various breads and other bakery goods as well as assisting guests with questions. I also cashiered during busy times.I also hosted an onsite job fair.  Having never worked in the food industry I learned a lot about food preparation.  Some members in management were more helpful, patient and kind than others. The culture at the workplace overall was fairly negative. But there also some wonderful, helpful people there as well. The hardest part of the job was the gossiping, immaturity, and lack of work ethic."
bad,"Hated the Krogers I worked at because they never listened to their employees. The person that interview me was told by me that I was pregnant and going to school and couldn't work more than 20 hours in a week and they supposedly ""lost"" the paper she wrote it on. I told them I still couldn't do that and brought in something from doctor saying that I couldn't and they said oh well you work what you have to so I had to quit because they put my health at risk."
bad,Some of the managers didn't know how to be a manager I liked co workers and I had an ok experience working there Jonathan I did not like was that some of the managers would ignore you and they wouldn't let you go to the bathroom when you really need it too but other than that it was a very good place to work
bad,"Discard expired bread and pastries, fill cases and shelves with new product. take cake orders, describe and answer bakery foods to inquiring customers. general cleaning and inventory. other days responsible for preparing next days bread for baking. Operating heavy equipment such as bailer and electric / non electric pallet jack."
bad,one of Texas top grocery stores...very productive in sales.  It could be a lot of fun some days and meeting people everyday with different attitudes was a challenge but very rewarding at the same time.  I love helping people.
bad,"The corporate part of the job doesn't like to help out in anyway, all they like are yes men, people who just say yes to anything they say.  In store management is fine."
bad,said they would work well with outside conflicts did not and you would get in trouble for just trying to go to school. not the job for you if you are not looking to make it a career.
bad,I hated working at Kroger sooooooo much. The break room stinks and the people that work there never seem to be happy working there. Every time I went to work someone was always talking about either going home early or quitting. You basically never move up from your starting pay. I've been working there for almost a year and never got a raise but even if I did it's only a 5 cent raise so yeah I started off at $7.25..... guess how much I'd be making if I did get a raise! $7.30/per hour. Isn't that great after working there for 6 months?
bad,not a career i would pursue. they do not provide much training. not very professional place to work. i worked as a salad bar attendant in produce. i was harassed by the manager. this was a while ago when i worked here. they did pay descent pay at the time 9 an hour. but i wouldnt work here i would try somewhere else thats more then this.
bad,Just avoid this company. its a horrible place giving no freedom and get looked down upon when needing anything in return. There is little to no life outside of this company and you never advance.
bad,"Its a good place for starting out in the work force but for those who have bills to pay and families to care for, its awful. Barely above minimum wage, with minimal raise opprotunities. Management is quick to offer promotions but it takes months before you actually see your title and pay, yet they use you like you are a manager, but without the raise. Union is hardly worth mentioning but theyre happy to snag in newbies and get them to agree to pay 8-12 dollars a week to be part of the union, with very little given info. Every other company I've heard of pays more than Kroger does, even other managers get paid more than Kroger management. Its not worth climbing the ladder here."
bad,"no comment! I do not want participate. •	Supervise daily employee activity concerns and schedule issues"
bad,"kroger was an alright job, but i mainly worked there to just get started in the job world. i feel like it helped me learn how to deal with customers in a polite manner"
bad,Upper managment does not care about the employees.  They will talk about caring but in no way show it.  It has been a hostile and degrading experience.
bad,"I have worked here 4 years, gone thru 3 onto the 4th manager I  all those years. Current management doesn't do anything to help her employees advance. No lunches, no breaks. 8 hours on your feet no sitting for anything."
bad,"I only recommend this place as a last resort to work or for high school students to get into the workforce."
bad,"Part time employees cannot volunteer for overtime, but they can make you stay late. Some of the people are difficult to get a long with. No flexibility in the hours."
bad,"There was a lot of drama in the store and it seemed that there was no sense of loyalty to senior employees, whoever complained the loudest won. I did not always enjoy working here."
bad,"my overview working for this company was not a good one, I liked helping the customers, but there was not always a good day working with some of the co-workers."
bad,"Even with new initiatives to ensure there are no 6 day work weeks you still work many.  Old boy network so unless you're willing to compromise your morals or kiss a ton of you know what, there's nowhere to go.  Executives treat you like your dirt/scum; they talk down to you, treat you as if you're dumb even when they couldn't manage the same store themselves in years past with less limitations."
bad,"Low wages, low hours, short breaks, poor management, poor communication, poor direction, no teamwork, little advancement opportunities, no managerial support."
bad,"Poor leadership"
bad,I don't like unions its pointless I'm paying for a false sense of protection if you have your head on and want to work can be on time basic adulating you don't need to pay a company for so called protection I don't use the benefits they don't pay there employees good
bad,everyday I would wake up to go to work and it felt like I was going back to school. no morals for anyone but other then that I liked it.
bad,The work was easy but the management was not a at all good. they believed more on the he/she said nonsense then facts. which could make your job very hard.
bad,"Overworked and underpaid. I'm worked for Kroger for over a year and didn't receive a yearly raise. Kroger management said I could not wear my hair in an afro because it was ""inappropriate"".  Kroger management made frequent racist remarks towards me and other employees."
bad,"If you are part time, management is able to schedule you for 40 hours without the benefits of a full time worker. If you work a 6 hour shift, you are only allowed one 10 minute break, two if you work 8 hours. No lunch breaks if you are part time. Managers are apathetic, and consistently do not finish their jobs and leave it for the employees to deal with the consequences. Additionally, they do not communicate with you unless you essentially corner them. Other employees are typically kind and understanding of each other's plight, but other than a friendly group of fellow associates, there is little to recommend employment by them."
bad,"I go to MTSU and Kroger's was willing to work around my school schedule and give me hours; and that was great! However, they gave me too many hours and was hard to work with. They knew 20 hrs. was my max and that I was only part-time, but when I started showing I was a good worker they put me down for more than I could give. Then all the workers were overworked and underpaid on top of that. The managers never did anything (LITERALLY) but talk to each other at the customer service desk, while everyone else on the front end did the work. Then the managers didn't give or forgot to give me my lunch breaks all the time. On top of that, the managers always showed favoritism to certain people. So at first it seems like a great job, but the longer you stay the more they try to force on you and don't up your pay! It's a BS job."
bad,"Typical day at work would be just bagging groceries, doing restock, or getting carts from outside. I didn't really learn much from the job other than some customers can never be satisfied. Management wasn't very friendly or understanding of if you needed to call off, especially for emergencies. Co-workers were alright. Hardest part of the job was letting the customer always be right. The most enjoyable part was break time."
bad,"Kroger was like working with grown children. the management seemed to care more about the customers than their own employees. "
bad,"If you want to be successful, you have to work a lot of hours. Your success depends on if you rubbed the right people the right way, or who you know. Being a hard worker and a good person doesn't necessarily get you anywhere. Upper management laughed and talked about others behind their back, but lower level employees were very nice. Hourly associates were part of the union which could make progressive difficult."
bad,You will have to work all hours and holidays. The job culture depends on the location. You may have to deal with unethical political issues as you advance your career with the company as a minority. I did enjoy working with the customers because of the personal connection you are expected to have with them. It is a family orientated environment.
bad,"kind of decent, but don't necessarily recommend working here long term. didn't give a lot of hours and management was finicky. decent job to just get your start."
bad,Kroger's is an ok place to work if you like rude disrespectful customers and bosses. That treat you like garbage and don't give you enough hours to even make it worthwhile to come to work.
bad,"What can I say? This job is definitely not worth the pay. The lead management do not care about their workers, and often like to cut hours of the workers. It is a petty store with a lack of growth opportunity for regular workers."
bad,"It really wasn't the job for me I was in highschool at thd time with a curfew, mangement did not consider my availability or schedule for public late night transportation."
bad,it was an overall great time and i met a lot of great people as well . Would do it all over again and with the same people as well
bad,I loved working there about a week after my first day but after that I was the one everyone depend on but it wasn't worth the pay an I couldn't move to a different department
bad,"Nice working with other Koreans. The company is very busy, because of this the supervisor  won't let you take a break or even use the restroom. Other than that is ok."
bad,Managment of the store i worked at was terrible and could not handle much. The csm (customer service managers) were fun to be around and helped a lot more then the store manager. Other than that i met a lot of great people and made lots of new friends.
bad,"The management was horrible, overtime was constant, and they were horrible at working with me when it came to my hours. "
bad,Not the kind of work you want as a department manager. More of goal focus company as pass or fail. Be a regular clerk for any position is ok but department head or manager. No
bad,"Loved my job and the people, just horrible management. Great pay, okay benefits. Not willing to work with scheduling either."
bad,Management places a lot of pressure on full time employees and offer little compensation. They dont value your work experience and wont listen to reason.
bad,"i learned good people skills and quality customer service representation. i was always interacting with customers no matter what it was they needed help with."
bad,"Kroger was a okay place to work. I started when I was 17 years old until I was 21.  When I would come in it would be the most busiest times of the day because a lot of people was getting off of work and i was just getting there from school or from my first job,"
bad,I worked here during high school and enjoyed my time working for the company. I have revived great things from the company. And glad i had the opportunity to work there.
bad,this is a good job for students who are in need of a summer job but otherwise I would not try and make it a career due to the fact that rising in the company is hard to do and the pay is not enough to live off of
bad,"the work was not hard to do, just other things made it be a stressful work enivroment. had a few good people to work with. liked decorating the most"
bad,It's not a bad place to work if you already retired from your career. But if you are student I wouldn't recommend it. Their hours are not as flexible.
bad,"I felt like a slave working at this job. They were not every helpful when it came down to training. Mainly you are thrown in the sea, then they tell you to learn to swim. The job security sucked, one day you can be here, then the next you are gone."
bad,during my first 3 weeks working and the store the head cake decorator up and left me with all the work for me to do and relocated to another kroger store.
bad,There was no work/life balance and had no room for improvement. The hardest part was working 8 hours straight without break or being able to leave and get water.
bad,"Mariano's is a great place to shop, everyone there is always working, and giving 100%. Also they will usually go out of their way for you at most times."
bad,As an adult working with kids and under educated adults it is a little frustrating at times.  Very hard to relate but I know this job is simply a way unto my means of landing a good career job.
bad,Working 40 hours a week at kroger as a cashier is just not worth it. Wages are to low for what we deal with. Making only 8.40 an hr is horrible compared to other grocery stores. staff always quits and new ones brought in all because not enough hours are given. Most staff nowdays doesnt care about anything. The store i work at has gone down hill big time. I think its good for high school kids starting out in the job force. If they would pay us better i think the staff would stick around and do a better job. Even are breaks are terrible. 2 15min breaks for an 8 hr shift is not enough. Hoping to find a new company to work for. Cant even get a good raise which i sure could use instead of a 5 cent raise every so often. management doesnt seem to care about us. same goes for corporate. they only care about the money .
bad,"Very demanding physically but easy to complete. "
bad,"I hated bringing in carts, cleaning the bathrooms,  along with the bottle machines. I didn't mind bagging groceries for the customers or helping with carryout but the rest of it i hated it. I hated when it was my turn to bring in carts when it was raining or even snowing. Pushing them up the hill sucked!!!"
bad,I had an unhealthy work environment with my managers and department. I didn't find much room for advancement and I wasn't properly trained I had to deduce some things by myself and watch others.
bad,First day on the job they always yelled at you made you feel uncomfortable made you feel like you had to rush wasn't very considerate of your schedule and made you feel like a slave
bad,hard work low pay no appreciation but i get along with my co-workers and a couple of the managers the hours are ok i hvae nothing else to say
bad,"Management confuses good work ethic and abuses and takes advantage of that, will over load you with work if you show good work ethic without extra compensation."
bad,"receiving product, breaking down pallets, stocking shelves, and editing numbers through a rf handheld. Management did not see worth of employees and never encouraged."
bad,"I started off as a utility clerk bagging groceries, cart retrieval, janitorial duties and customer service.  I was promoted to deli clerk after my first year of employment"
bad,"poor employee retention,management, working environment, benefit, staffing, training, low pay, nonflexible hours and scheduling"
bad,not the greatest place to work for. very poor management. no communication. get yelled at for something isnt your fault
bad,"I loved all my Co-workers they were like my brothers and sisters. The work was not at all what I applied to do online, I was thrown in a department I never wanted to work in. the store managers were gossipers and the manager where I worked was new and believed everything we was taught was wrong wanted us to change our mindsets to what she liked and wanted done."
bad,"I gave Kroger such a low rating cause of the people I just do not "
bad,"Well this Job is definently for layed back kinda people."
bad,"The bakery manager for our store was downright AMAZING. The job taught me how to ice cakes quickly and efficiently before I went to culinary school. BE PREPARED to not get paid for your work. I made minimum wage the whole time while doing a lead decorator's job. Also, be prepared to be asked to work outrageous hours, or not asked at all but expected to do so. 10 hour work week with no extra pay because they conveniently scheduled me in between work weeks. Customers varied. Upper management was a nightmare and loved to cuss everyone out."
bad,I learned how to bag groceries and retrieve carts. The hardest part of working there was the ridiculous short hours you receive and the pay. I worked really hard for the little bit of money I was given.
bad,"Let's start with the good, Kroger gives you plenty of hours, maybe more than you want. co-workers friendly and customers pleasant"
bad,need to be a more caring place alawy be so never to some of the cutomersno help no manger ment never no toll to do youer job lack of time
bad,The only thing I missed about this store was the customers. My customer service skills increased while working here. Management was not the best but there were some good ones.
bad,"Good ole' boys program alive and well.  Advancements do not go to those who deserve it.  Education is not a contributing factor in their decision making for promotions and they definitely do not utilize the dedication and disciplined work ethic of the veterans on their staff."
bad,I like working there. I wanted to advance my career and work in stocking and become a manager in a department so I can oversee everything
bad,No raises given for incentive or work ethic. YOu get .20 cents the first year and .10 cents a year after that. Not enough staff for the store to function properly. If you were going to work for in retail. I would shoot for home depot or somewhere they pay you decent.
bad,"I have learned a lot working here. Customer service, food handling, and some inventory management. I want to leave because my true career dream is to be a game designer. Working here is not working towards that goal. So I'm going to school and looking for a new job that can push me towards that goal. The hardest part of this job is the amount of work they put onto you, on top of customer service. My co-workers are the enjoyable part of this job because I get along with all of them and have made some new friends."
bad,"You will do everything in this store, especially on a Sunday morning one person will do frozen, other dairy and deli, and dry grocery, they expect you to this done asap! I am surprise I lasted 6 months. Only thing positive about this place are your co-workers."
bad,"typicle day is coming in at 7 am and breaking down the truck and cutting meat for the customers till about 3 or 4 pm."
bad,This job can be very stressful at times especially in the beginning of the year. You can be busy non-stop from the moment you clockin until you leave with varying situations from being extremely complicated to very simple but both can take the same amount of time.
bad,"For anyone who wants to advance in life I do not feel that this company is the best choice.  I really needed a job so I took it.  From my experience, almost the entire management structure in the store(those outside of the store are much better from what I've seen) is flawed.  It has been a long time since I have seen abusive store managers to this level.  It is very numbing to see this for long periods of time because you learn to just accept it.  No mater how hard you work it will not be enough for the management.  I bought an quality activity tracker to track how much work I do because I began to feel like I must not be working hard enough from all of the criticism I was getting.  I walk 8-10 miles a day for job related activities alone.  While working here I have noticed that many of the workers feel that, ""their lives are over"".   Many of these people are the only reason why I still work at Ralph's.  Most are very kind but their self worth has been damaged while making bottom dollar."
bad,A typical day at work is busy. Management is rude and ignores you constantly. I learned how to satisfy customers and help others. My co-workers were friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job is dealing with management. The most enjoyable part was my co-workers and regular customers.
bad,a typical day was under staffed with short hours. General managers were almost not seen and pharmacists on duty were hard to discuss position with.
bad,will allow you to work depending on the scheldule that you have. management seems confused and disorganized the pay is very low for such a major corporation and you get low hours in the beginning unless some people quit. they promise promotions but it takes years to move up in the company.
bad,"Strong  process and Technical support. Very poor people management. It was a volatile, harsh union environment. Turnover in management was massive."
bad,"Kroger was my first jobs, and I must say management wasn't the best. It was so unprofessional and very disorganized on the daily. Employees were decent people but I think the hardest part bout the job was learning the fruit and having to do returns."
bad,Mostly i just stocked shelves and helped customers. The managers were fair for the most part. I did enjoy working with customers and learning to be a meat cutter.
bad,"I started working there in February. I loved it at first, but as time went on I noticed that there were days of the management being unorganized and immature. It just wasn't the place for me."
bad,"I wanted to obtain a position as a cashier here, but was instead put on the stock crew. Although I'm not saying that women cannot complete the tasks the job requires, I will say that it is very difficult, and made even more difficult when you are the only female on an all-male crew. Although I liked my job, it was very hard for me to fit in with my coworkers, which made my shifts miserable. I was also harassed by several of my coworkers, even those that were not a part of my department. When I brought this up to the management team, they seemed very complacent. No one should have to work in an environment where they feel uncomfortable. This is the only job I've ever quit without a notice. For someone else, this job would be great I'm sure. For me, it was an epic fail."
bad,"Fast paced work environment, where excellent customer service is not only given but expected.  Co-workers and supervisors were great however management was not supportive, leaving the many of the employees frustrated."
bad,"I had a hard time working at Krogers. Most of the areas were dirty, and my co-workers werent the nicest of people. They paid very little and gave even less hours. I averaged about 12 hours per week, and that was DURING the holidays. I was not properly trained in how to do my job and then was looked down upon because I was unable to do my job properly. When raises came around, those few people who actually did get a raise only got about a nickel raise. All together, a very poor company who cares nothing for its workers."
bad,"Kroger was a great company to work for in the 80's, but now they under pay their employees and require more work. Kroger dont care if you are under a physician care they expect you to come to work anyway and they dont have light duty, the managers say if you cant do the task at hand then you are out of a job"
bad,This job taught me valuable customer service skills and time management. It also showed me how to work as a team and balance out other peoples ideas on how to get things down.
bad,"great place to work if you love concentrating on customers and helping them."
bad,They expect u to be able to live on 15 hours a week why hire all these people give the hours to the people who have been there and want them we have homes and families and have to pat union dues too  wake up already
bad,Being told one thing by your manager and then being told something else by another manager is frustrating. Especially when the first manager told you that you would or wouldn't have to do certain things.
bad,They didn't give enough hours to employees who had been there a while. Was there over a year and was still only getting 8-12 hours most weeks on top of paying to be part of a union. The upper management was lacking and it had a very poor culture.
bad,"I love talking with the customers and employees but the company is all about the union , that sucks.The company will work you wierd hours and call you in a  lot.The worst is the union issues though.Short breaks, small pay,..."
bad,"This job was overall and ok experiences, I learned how to stock and learned how to be a cashier. The management team was ok, the co-workers was alright."
bad,The employees were cool but the pay was terrible. Management was really good but they were hardly ever willing to work around employees schedules. The pay was the worst because they pay you as if you will be with the company forever.
bad,"We had loyal customers with amazing employee's and I was able to build great work relationships. I also had the privilege to work in different departments, such as the home good department, drug and prescriptions, produce, and cashier."
bad,"good work environment,fellow employees,low pay for dangerous environment,management very immature,company has declined over the years,stores are not kept up"
bad,I worked at the outer loop location. Some people were ok but that place was like high school all over again. I do not recommend this work place at all.
bad,"If you are willing to know you will never move up and that you will probably never get full time, then this is the job for you."
bad,"Deal with a lot of customer service"
bad,"I work at Kroger as a cashier. The management changes our schedules all of the time without telling us, and then yells at us for not showing up or knowing we are supposed to work. I personally don't have a laptop and the only way I can check the schedule to see when I work is either online or in the store. The store is twenty to thirty minutes away and I cannot afford the gas to go see if I work. The library is only ten minutes away, the reason why I can be on this site, but I cannot afford to come here every day."
bad,once your part time you cant advance to being full time. thats just what i was told. hard to get 40 hrs a week. plus side of this is you get weekly pay
bad,"All I'll say is that if someone there decides to have a personal problem with you (emphasis on personal, NOT professional) get ready to be unceremoniously fired. If the right people like you, you can get away with murder. If one of the ""right"" people doesn't like you, say ""goodbye"". It doesn't matter how well you do your job, how mature and dedicated you are, how far and above you go, what legitimate obstacles you may face. All it takes is one spoiled brat who knows how to kiss up in just the right way and you're out. Other than that...meh...it ain't so bad."
bad,"Rude co-workers, no breaks, management is rude also, typical day at work was nice, as long as you stayed busy."
bad,"clock in, stay busy, and go home, cut meat and cheese, prepare rotisserie chicken, cook food and put it on display to sell."
bad,"they will not schedule you a full week but call you every day to come in to work, so it is possible to get hours, but at the expense of your personal life.  under the new contracts,  raises are 5 cents.  which means if you start at 7.40,  you can work there for 10 years and still not have gotten a total of 8.00 per hour.  it takes a year and a half to get benefits as well."
bad,"Enjoying the public"
bad,its a very stressful work environment. everyone is always on edge. managers never do anything and blame you when you don't finish your job before your time ends while they are upstairs just sitting down
bad,its a cool job to have part time in the summer time but as far as a long term job I wouldn't recommend it.
bad,work hard and little pay do multiple jobs on top of yours and get punished if yours is not done
bad,I like the weekly pay.  The pay was ok for me when I was in high school.  I would work here again
bad,"Provides no room for growth. Under pays employee's. Company claims to care so much about employee's but that is completely false. This company is run on communism fundamentals, I know this because certain managers have told me this. The enjoyable part about this job is the co workers. The hardest part about the job is the rate of pay. Management is 50/50. There are some great managers, and then there is managers that don't know what they're doing."
bad,"Stressful environment, terrible management, high turn around, ridiculous pay, little chance of promotion, the place is a dead end."
bad,"Customer Service skills, sales projections, ordering product and inventory control. Cash handling. I enjoy being around people and helping out in all aspects of the store."
bad,Good company but no room for advancement. There was no proper training for potiental advancement.
bad,Put groceries in bags and help customers to their vehicle while maintaining a respectful attitude.
bad,"it was just work i just can to work i had learned how to Unload groceries from trucks. "
bad,It okay it just when your management have an attitude and also threatening you.Also when you have a nasty customers they make it extra hard.
bad,it was ok but they always took my weekend away so I had no time for my family
bad,"Customers and Co-workers made the workplace special and enjoyable, and mostly worth the high stress environment."
bad,"sacked groceries, pushed carts in."
bad,"It's a job that is good for highschool students. When I worked there, I found that most other grocery chains paid at least a $1 more per hr for the same positions. If you started off as cashier it seemed that no matter what department you moved to, you would always be called back up to help at the front. They would call you on scheduled days off asking you to come in and help and if you didn't they would cut your hours the following week. I had one store manager discriminate against me while I was pregnant and made it unbearable to work there. I finally quit."
bad,Great job if your in high school just to keep some little money in your pocket.
bad,Management never cared about employees and customers were rude most of the time.
bad,"To Hot and they wanted hard work for very low pay,Small Work Place."
bad,"Typical day clock in go straight to work."
bad,Kroger is a fair place of employment. It has a decent management team. My co-workers make the job enjoyable. A typical day is long.
bad,"Manage training 300 employees in 50+ fuel centers while demonstrating inclusionary leadership, expecting inclusive behavior from associates, and support the efforts of the store, district, and division Cultural Councils.  Utilize coordinators and other field staff to ensure store departments are achieving their sales and profit goals and ensure implementation, and execution of division merchandising plans. Promote and support strong relationships with local fuel managers in the surrounding area in which the store operates. Control fuel storage tanks and enforce state and government fueling regulations."
bad,the management was treating us bad.Not a good job to work there
bad,At first it was good.  Then i started to dislike it because you had to be a favorite.  If you wasn't the favorite the you would get yelled at all the time.
bad,"little hours, 28 at the MOST. poor management. un organized. constantly hiring. un professional supervisor. however my co workers were fairly nice. easy job. assist customers with lottery, gas, and tobacco products."
bad,"part time job"
bad,I was told i was going to have full time hours and ended up getting 12 hours to 30 hours a week.
bad,"Despite not having any work life balance, i leaned how to be an effective manager."
bad,The hours are sporadic and challenging. I do not want to talk about it.
bad,Zero work life balance and punished for not coming in on your days off
bad,"I mostly was out bringing in shopping carts, and doing price checks.  Not a lot to really say or list."
bad,The way my day was checking customers out at the register making sure they found everything they needed and if they didn't I would help them anyway I could. I always made sure my customers were happy about there shopping experience. I always learned new things about work and new things we had to do every day. My co-workers were awesome. The hardest part of the job was making sure all the customers were pleased and happy and got them in and out the door. The most enjoyable part about working at Kroger was the experience I had with my customers I always made sure they were happy and helped them in anyway I could.
bad,pick n save was a ok job i went there and got my job done. the workers was not much of out going seem like everybody stayed to they self. the mangers was rude and didnt speak.
bad,"I had the pleasure of learning a lot about myself and people as a whole while working for this company for eight years. Management is constantly changing as well as the group of employees, mainly due to low pay fluctuating hours."
bad,Kroger is one of the busiest grocery stores around and has good prices.
bad,"There is very little communication between management and workers, which causes confusions and errors. The staff, both hourly and salaried, seem very stressed at all times. many weeks I would be forced to work 2 to 3 times the hours I was scheduled: i.e. I would work 50+ hours during a week that I was scheduled 20"
bad,"built dispalys,helped customers ,run registers. did photo lab and took care of  money"
bad,Management is treated better than hourly employees. Work/Life balance is not very good for hourly employees.
bad,It could not get any worst.  The very busy hours of work.  Management not giving breaks on time to relieve
bad,A typical day at work usually starts out with filling all the produce items and helping customers with questions. Then finishing whatever my produce manager doesn't get done. After that I usually unload the truck and put up all the produce items in the cooler. The management at this krogers is horrible they don't help employees out . I do not enjoy any of my co workers because there is a lot of childish talk and play that goes on that is not work appropriate
bad,"A typical day included rough labor and unfair supervisors. Inaccurate scheduling. Lied about my schedule when i was out of town and claimed they called me, which was not true. baggers and stockers were creepy and they tried to flirt with me all the time. at the time i was only 16 and it was pretty terrifying. overall, poor management and very bad hours."
bad,I worked here as my first job in high school and I can't remember that much about it except that every one was really uptight and did not have a sense of humor at all.
bad,"Kroger is for a kid in high school. The shifts are not long, anywhere from 4 to 8 hours which I really like, but I get paid 7.85. That is not going to pay my bills especially while trying to get a college education. The Kroger I work at does not give me enough hours, and they normally schedule me 7pm to closing (12am). Sometimes they even schedule me on days where I am not available or days I have requested off a month in advance because I knew ahead of time I was going to be out of town."
bad,"I worked here for about 5 months. On a typical day, I went outside to get bascarts about 7 or 8 times in the scorching heat with no water provided. In between getting carts, I bagged groceries and pretty much begged for my 15 minute break. I didn't learn anything that I didn't already know here. The people were very nice, and made the job at least halfway bearable. The hardest part of this job was dealing with customers that wanted everyone to go out of their way to make them happy, even if it was most inconvenient. And of course there was the times where I had to close and was asked to  open the next day. The most enjoyable part was leaving at the end of my shift."
bad,"Working mornings, days, or nights is pretty mediocre. You learn the bare minimum and it's pretty much learn as you go. Management is very unorganized. Coworkers are pleasant most of the time. The hardest part of the job is dealing with impatient customers, and constantly asking for help on how to complete certain unique and intricate transactions. The somewhat most enjoyable part of the job is getting paid the little that they give you I guess"
bad,"The day starts out with breaking truck down, stocking shelves,  assisting cash register as needed, customer service is the most enjoyable part of day,  learned to be patient with customers and management, enjoyable working with co workers."
bad,"High fast paced job.  I had to hit the floor running to get everything done.  I didn't mind this as I love fast-paced physical work.  I learned how to proof dough using a proofer in order to get the best quality product for sale.  I enjoyed baking, but I didn't like dismantling the pallets of ordered products, THAT was the hardest part of my day.  But to do the job, you had to embrace ALL aspects of the job."
bad,"A typical day at work begins with clocking in no earlier then 5min before scheduled. Next an employee would check the destination list to begin daily tasks. During an 8hour shift, an employee will receive; 2 thirty-min breaks or 1 Sixty-min break. At the end of an employes shift, they are required to clean-up their working area then proceed to clocking off for the remaining day. "
bad,Working for Kroger isn't that bad I just learned that personally it wasn't for me. I like a fast paced enviroment.
bad,"customer service, cut meat, stock and rotate goods, unload trucks, clean. Check inventory."
bad,could move up soon and easy but work is too hard and not enough pay
bad,"Its Ok to work there, but highly recommend you make it a short term goal"
bad,"Start out with a rush day but this comes with the grocery store industry, you learn to keep moving and sacking, stocking and making customer happy with taking grocery out to car. Management is wonderful, co- workers are always looking out for one another, and there is no hard part about the job but what u make hard for your self. The enjoyable day is everybody go home safely including customers."
bad,I liked working at Kroger for a while but then things changed for the worse for me in particular. I love the fuel station but they switched me to utility clerk apparently because my children were sickly.
bad,"typical day at work customer service."
bad,It was the perfect job for someone if it is their first job. They show the the importance of having great customer service.
bad,"I worked second shift, full time, prepped deli meat, stocked and cleaned. I learned how to work well in a customer service environment. My coworkers were very dependable and were willing to help any time I needed them. The management I had at Kroger was very resourceful and dependable as well. Any questions or issues I had, they were able to help. The hardest part of my job was the hours I had to put in. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with the public and working with my coworkers. "
bad,"- walk the department and look for items going out of date. bring up fresh product and work it onto the floor. run production report for the bakery, and lay out fresh bread to be baked the next morning.  clean the baker at night, throw out all trash, gather up and place the boxes in the bailer."
bad,ran operation of retail grocery store. Learn and gained valuable employment skills
bad,i was not traind properly and i got fired for poor performance i loved my co workers
bad,Very poor department and store management. Even people who had worked their 10+ years did not like how the store management had changed. 
bad,"I would go to work and start to grind meat. Then after that I would finish stocking any of the product, and fill up the service case. I know how to open and close departments. I learned the importance of customer service, and how it can help grow your business. I had problems with management because they kept screwing me with hours, till I was down to about 12 a week. That's what led me to quit the store I was at. My co-workers I enjoyed and they helped me learn what I was doing. The best part of my job was the people that I worked with. The hardest part of my job was dealing with management about the hours I need."
bad,"You could not ask to work with a better group of people, and while some managers are wonderful and treat the employees as family like the employees feel they all are, some management will let you know you are the work horse that keep them fed and nothing more. They are constantly cutting jobs, full time positions are disappearing, along with any hopes of benefits, sadly. You work at a very fast pace which makes your day go by very quickly, which is always nice."
bad,"Completed all deposits for the location, making schedules, all the stores orders, hiring and firing of all employees, conducted personal evaluations on all 13 employees, Handled all customer complaints."
bad,The only reason I went to work everyday was because of my coworkers. The job was horrile and so was the pay. I went from being a bagger to cashier to deli and never got a pay raise
bad,kroger in beaumont on phelan is a bad place to work at. The store mgr is never happy with your work.
bad,"A typical day would be getting cursed out by the customers and not trusting your co-workers. Management is cool, I can't complain too much about them. My co-workers on the other hand are out of control. The hardest part of the job would be biting your tongue. And the most enjoyable would be interacting with customers who don't give you a hard time."
bad,I was being move all over the store. I was going to Galveston Form Deer Park.
bad,"You are a #. You work hard,never Late, Come in if they call you. All for what? They do not care about you as a person. It's just a job."
bad,I have absolutely no complaints...unfortunately i have to move so i had to quit...
bad,Nerver seen a job that was that strict made working miserable.
bad,"Very monotonous work days, what made this job great was the co-workers and not much else"
bad,"Re-stocking and pricing produce food and cleaning the work area. I've learned how to give great customer service and complete tasks in a timely fashion. The management wasn't that very good, I didn't work with any of the supervisors that often and treated the employees poorly whenever I did. The most difficult part of the job was not working enough hours and low pay rate. The best part of the job were the weekly pay and the location was two miles away from home."
bad,"I enjoyed working for Kroger, it was never boring and always fun and exciting. I met lots of new people and was always available to anyone that needed assistance."
bad,I do not enjoy my job but I put up with the work and go about my day.
bad,was not a team affort there people wanted to start drama the manager in the deli hardly worked herself always had everybody else doing her work for her
bad,This place is a place to work if you like tons of overtime and long hours. Not to mention you have no time for family life and you can rule out all holidays cause even on Thanksgiving and Christmas you are working. Would never consider working here again or recommending it to anyone.
bad,Great place to work while serving the public with a smile at the same time meeting new ppl
bad,"This particular pharmacy was all about speed. Your day would start out with either filling prescriptions or placing orders. The manager would tell you if you weren't filling the prescriptions fast enough or get mad at you if you interrupted them to ask a question. After a while, you just start guessing and making mistakes and then they get even more mad. The customers were always upset with the wait times. There is absolutely no quality assurance."
bad,Full time position's not available.
bad,"Don't give out enough hours, don't give any raises its always bush with out the proper people there"
bad,i absolute loved worrking at krogers pastry area. I have a passion for cooking deserts and any type of food. if it have a reciept i can make it.
bad,I had trouble being only behind the counter all day not really having any fun and being by yourself so not being able to take breaks.
bad,"Set up Seafood Dept., place orders, restock product, inventory, customer service"
bad,"Upper management gossiped about employees in negative ways, spread rumors, and allowed religious discrimination. Best part of the job, was that customers were better to deal with than other co-workers."
bad,"Company is an ok place to work at, although lacks hours when you need them. You work hard and do not get any appreciation for it. When ask for full time, does not get it, I have been waiting for almost 9 months now."
bad,The management rarely respected my hours of availability and regularly scheduled me for days at which I had listed as unavailable.  I repeatedly asked them to correct this and they repeatedly didn't.
bad,"The company spends too much time worrying about things that would fall into place if they would just back up and let the management staff manage a grocery store.  Some processes are needed but there is way too much focus on the unneeded ones.  Kroger pays department managers well and they should let them run their departments, there is a lot of micromanaging that takes place.  If they are going to pay them well they need to have faith in the ones that they have chosen to fill these roles.  There should be more training involved with all associates, even store management.  Most of the time it is a sink or swim situation, setting people up for success sounds good but backing it up with action would make it better.  They spend a lot of time degrading the ones that are put in top positions about job performance when they should be spending more time asking what can I do to help you be better.  Kroger used to be a great environment to work with but they implement too many changes at too fast of a pace.  Change is important but they need to give the associates time to deal with one change before they make another.  For a zero waste company there is way too much paper wasted on checklists and processes that take up a lot of time.  Just let the employees do their jobs, have enough faith in them to know they will run good solid stores.  They have a great benefit package but in a lot of situations it is not the benefits that make people stay."
bad,"I worked as a cashier for Kroger for almost four years. My pay started at $7.65 and when I quit it was $10.40 an hour. Pay was every Thursday. While there I did the same monotonous work which gets old after a while. I also noticed the teenagers were more likely to receive promotions instead of the older workers who had been there a lot longer. "
bad,"Overall, Kroger provides a friendly and uplifting work environment for its employees. The management team, however, does a poor job of answering questions about schedules and hours."
bad,You work holidays and customers are terrible. You are a slave to the customers and most of your coworkers are care about themselves so you might need more people to help than that are provided.
bad,"Didn't provide enough hours to afford a living, pay wasn't enough for work , very in organized, managers often changed work every night. Schedule was all over the place"
bad,"Hard work for little money. Two Vacation week out of the year. Discount for food, College tuition program. Hard to move up. Some days require long hours"
bad,"Customers want a selection especially in the Meat Dept,,,two steaks to pick from is no way to promote sales.  Grow your sales and shrink will take care of itself,"
bad,Manager that works there now likes to bully the new employees. Several have quit and several have went home crying afterwards. Worked several years for kroger
bad,Management takes an easy job and with the micro management they make it stressful and the concern for family time is not available there concerns is getting groceries to store at any cost
bad,"Overall the company does a good job of paying its employess the have put in the time. "
bad,I felt i worked in a hostile work environment.  Long time employees treated me like a outsider.  longtime employees complained that i was a woman and that i was given more work duties then they got when they started working there.  i actually had a long time employee walk away from the job and work because he felt i was given more responsibilities then he.  I kept up my pace and actually was ahead daily on my work duties.  the atmosphere became so hostile i would have major panic attacks and ended up  quieting my job.  very unfortunate as i was fully qualified
bad,"I had a terrible time working here. Most co workers, barely enjoyed the work environment and management was disrespectful. The pair was unfair and the job overall was unfair."
bad,Manager and food service manager are terrible. Two faced.  They stab you in the back.   Wrote me up for no reason. Manager was supposed to be my back up for decorating and she quit doing it.  I took pictures showed other manager s they did nothing.  Corp changes hours. Even tho my available hours were 4 am to 4 pm. They wanted 10 to 6:30. So that and manager s.  I quit !!    Corp needs to pay attention to these things
bad,Im giving a poor review b.c my experience was slow for acknowlegment and hireing. Training was not provided but can be found amoung other techs. Low pay
bad,"After working at kroger for 8 months i quit , the management has no appreciation to lower level employess , they make us do all the hard stuff while they sit there and watch. The pay was 8.00 /hr for work that deserves at least 9.00 , I was in my senior year in high school and they scheduled me till 11-45pm every day I'd never get enough sleep, they lie about calling you for being late and the managers choose favoritism"
bad,"Kroger was once a great company to work for.  As of late the management team is underappreciated, devalued, not empowered to make decisions, and work under micro-managing upper management.  The culture is a depressing one.  Most tenured management have left/are leaving.  Benefits and pay are good, but it is not worth the lack of work-life balance and disrespect."
bad,"Starting out the job is fine. As you work your way up in store positions it gets harder. Management has a hard time encouraging the employees that earned it and reprimanding those that need it. The benefits are nice, for the most part. If you decide to work there make sure you know about your benefits. Not all the stores are the same. Some managers are nicer to work with than others, but the company overall is difficult to work for."
bad,"When I first started at Kroger 11 years ago it was a wonderful company with lots of opportunities. However it has become an increasingly difficult place to be with little to no life/work balance. You are expected to have everything done even when you are short staffed by several employees, with no hopes of hiring anyone. Advancement is rare above department management, but below that is everywhere."
bad,A very stressful place where the higher ups promise you raises and never give them. The HR department just tells you to go online to there many websites if you have questions or concerns.  You are just a number there and that is it. The higher management people there at Kroger do not care for there workers at all.
bad,"Working at Kroger is rewarding if you like working with people. Cons: Long hours, High Stress environment, little praise for accomplishments. Advancement is easy if you work very hard an build relationships with others."
bad,"Would never work there again..the only good thing about working there is the workers, you have friends and it’s cool sometimes but most of the time you aren’t even allowed to talk to them. Why clean the floors & clean stinky wine off the floors for 7.75 an hour?"
bad,"Department head stressed all the time, closed 4-6 days out of 7 day week, and management was getting better as new workers were hired. The most enjoyable part would be helping people and satisfying customer."
bad,No advancement for older workers  management plays favorites  constantly changing management is confusing  no communication job is hard physically without proper tools
bad,A typical day starts with greeting customers and fill their prescriptions. You may also be responsible for verifying and inputting the information provided by the customer.
bad,"I wish Kroger was better to their employees, but really its quite the opposite. The union is in bed with corporate and nothing ever comes from problems that are reported other than your neck on the chopping block. They start everyone at 8.50 even if you have experience, I started in a management position and wasn't hardly paid much more."
bad,"A woman once yelled at me because she failed to read the instructions on the offer she was insistent on using, and then yelled louder when I told her my computer did not have refund functionality and that the customer service desk would be happy to assist her. I was then told I should try to understand where the customer was coming from, despite doing everything within my power to try and help her and not being frustrated with her whatsoever. You work mostly by yourself, you're prone to being belittled by your boss to absolutely no action by their bosses, and you are essentially disposable. I've heard things are more tame now, but Kroger was miserable."
bad,"My time as a starbucks barista working for kroger was a horrible experience. We had no discounts or benefits and were paid only about $8-9 an hour. The space was tiny and scheduling was atrocious. When they were understaffed in the deli department, they had me, a 16 year old teen, working there even though it was not part of my job."
bad,They will lie to you to get you in the door because they're desperate for competent management.  You're shuffled around specific districts from store to store with no warning.  The district managers treat you like garbage unless you've been there for 20 years. The employees are all union and they take advantage of it.  They can just about get away with murder and not get fired.
bad,"As a order picker you are required to meet a goal after 8 weeks of training/was hardly ever met, un safe working conditions, junk head sets that had to be switched out. Lost time they gave no credit. Electric pallet jacks barely operated safely ( Bad wheels, Brakes) water on floor in alse very unsafe when trying to meet numbers. Then they wonder why no one stays. Pay a decent wage!"
bad,I've had so many problems since our last manager left. My main problem is management not caring enough about the awful job my supervisor was doing. The pay is ok but there is other retail jobs that pay more
bad,Great experience overall but it’s not something I want to continue but if I had to return back to Kroger I would cause they always are hiring new people.
bad,"Hours can vary, pay isn't great, working holidays can be rough, gets really busy and truck sizes can be a lot. The company wont be  a good buffer for how customers can treat the employees."
bad,"Management was not hands on and did not take confrontation or recommendations well, avoided that if they could. All the ""senior"" workers felt entitled to treat new people like they were below them in a rude way. Being a bagger seemed a lot harder than being a cashier, with all the little jobs baggers have to do with also keeping up with bagging, while cashiers are anchored at the front end the whole day."
bad,"Over worked, not worth working for the amount you get paid due to the of stuff you have to deal with depending on the department you work in."
bad,Kroger basically gives their employees exactly what one would expect from a bottom rung position working for a large corporation. Pay and benefits are decent but that’s about all that this company has going for it. Basic store employees are generally treated as being completely expendable. Unless you’re lucky you probably won’t get much recognition from this company even if you do a good job.
bad,Each Dora different in its own ways. Store management and department managers have a lot to do with the environment. It's Touch and Go what are you getting to a good store or not.
bad,I did not enjoy my time at Kroger. I only kept going to work everyday because I needed money to help me get through school. The managers were horrible and I felt as if they did not care for their employees.
bad,"For over night position its only 8.25 an hour and that'd be okay if it didn't take a year for you to start making 9 an hour,  also the hours required to work were horrible no time to do anything ever."
bad,"I managed the Starbucks in the Kroger store and a lot of the stores problems was lack of communication, and failure to understand the contract made between the two companies. The Kroger management neglected their half of the contract which in turn made life hard for my employees and I on a day to day bases with hours and pay."
bad,No one likes standing in one place for 6 or more hours in a row. The break room was absolutely disgusting. Management leaves you in the dark and clearly doesn't want to be there. Good first job but find a new one asap.
bad,"Kroger is the cheapest company I ever worked for, they literally will attempt to keep you from making $,01 if it is to their benefit, and once in management you might as well not have a family, as Division managers will require you as a punishment to work 6 & 7 days straight.  Just a horrible company.  Benefits are soso,"
bad,"A typical day at work was either boring or stressful. As a courtesy clerk working on the front end, bagging groceries was a pretty tedious job that became increasing annoying/difficult as fewer coworkers would assist. Several coworkers would either be doing a different job such as bringing in carts, or not even working at all. Often times the lobby would be empty of carts due to lack of workers and the managers would then tell everyone to go out to grab more. Working in incredibly hot sun for at least an hour at a time, we'd be sent out several times and it was worse when there were people not doing their jobs. "
bad,Hard long hours out in the heat pushing carts where the only water you got was the water fountain or water that you purchase in the store. Nobody that works here really cares about you. They don't even care enough to remember you name. Mostly managers.
bad,"Love the customers and associates, but you sell groceries and u are not solving world issues. The thing about that is the higher ups think you are solving world piece and will sell it that way to you. Work Life balance does not happen. Good luck over cans of beans."
bad,"The highlights of working here are the people, I have met some amazing people both customers and employees. Work/personal life and management were both the only cons. I was a full time student every semester and it would become a routine for someone in my department to quit or get fired and hours needed to be filled so my 25 hour work week would develop into 35-40 hour weeks so school became very hard for me. This is a great place to work if you're really flexible and like being overworked and if you're not a student."
bad,Kroger taught me to work under extreme pressure and how to work well when communication isn’t the best. It also taught me how to keep pushing myself even when I don’t think I can’t push myself anymore. I found more strengths in myself working here than any other previous job.
bad,"Working at Kroger was great at first then management started changing and new people got hired... "
bad,Company focuses too much on the daily stock price and what VP is showing up on certain days than focusing on employees' happiness in order to take care of customers.
bad,"Bad pay, fluctuating hours, unorganized, and no appreciation for real hard work. No room to really succeed. Others could work half as hard and make twice as much."
bad,"At my time at the smyrna Kroger, I'd say that it was definitely less than satisfactory. The managers rotated sp frequently that you never got to know who was in charge. The scheduling was always last minute and unchangeable."
bad,I did not enjoy working at Kroger. The hours were long and the work was boring and repetitive. I did not enjoy being stuck in the same spot for hours on end.
bad,"they recently changed a lot. Kroger cut employee benefits tremendously. They will give you more responsibility without the pay. You pay to join the union but it takes a long period of time to get help with the issue (wage, hours, benefits etc) if at all."
bad,"I did not enjoy my time at Krogers. The clientele was rude and absolutely disrespectful. Coworkers were not helpful, they were slow, lazy, and inefficient. Management had poor understanding of ordering priorities.  Poor wages and horrible scheduling with availability that can be updated monthly. Unsafe work environment. However availability was normally something they tried to honor and keep consistent so it was nice in regards to working during high school and the first year of college for me."
bad,I work way too hard for inadequate pay. I have management duties. IE being in charge. have door key and alarm code. but haven't been adequately compensated for the extra work. I work overnights in a dept. that keeps loosing people who are never replaced. due to incompetent management. and low pay.
bad,Management was either combative or incompetent. I either found myself being berated and humiliated in front of customers and coworkers or trying to compensate for lazy and inexperienced management.
bad,They will make it seem pretty and tell u about advancement but unless u know someone or someone dies ur stuck in the position u are in. Work/life balance is not existent if u don’t want a family or see friends go for it.
bad,"I would not recommend this job to anyone. This was the first job I ever had and the experiences I had there made me really hesitant towards customer service jobs going forward. As you can imagine, that sucks for a high school student just trying to make some money and connect with new people."
bad,"Wildly inconsiderate upper and corporate management with no regards as to how their pointless procedure changes affect the employees lowest on the ladder. I followed their convoluted medical leave process to the T upon breaking a bone, but my paperwork was somehow lost, and I was ""replaced"" in my absence, forcing me to transfer departments. To this day, I find it incredibly hard to believe that ClickList legitimately ""filled up"" in the month-and-a-half period I was gone."
bad,Unsafe work conditions. Typical corporate BS. Not enough payroll to increase sales to get more payroll. Most managers unwilling to help or even listen. Can’t request days off because schedule is based on seniority. If you want 40 hours a week you have to work at least 6 days.
bad,"Hours are great the managers will more often than not work with what hours you provide. There is a lot of physical exertion while performing certain tasks. I would say that the majority of this job is fairly self explanatory, the unfortunate part of this job was the constantly changing criteria for performing duties. It would take us several weeks to successfully preform a new task but everytime we would catch up managment would throw a  new obstacle our way. Management was terrible they would rarely hear out suggest or requests of help when a department got behind they just take people out of their own department for a few hours but this rarely resulted in success."
bad,"They do not clean the store only when the president shows up that's the only time that store is ever cleaned. Very hostile environment. Plus they weren't very nice. "
bad,"The Store Directors never focused on the Adult Beverage Department. They only focused on the Perishable Departments. The Store Directors and Department Managers are responsible for all Departments in the stores but they really didn't pay attention to the display activations and promotions. They always ran out of Beer, Wine and Spirits inventory on the weekend. They were too concerned about extra inventory and theft issues. The culture of the Company went bad since they acquired Roundy's Supermarkets, Inc."
bad,"Not enough hours(20-24) hours a week , how am I suppose to live off that."
bad,"The job pays... That's about it. If you're looking for anything more than an entry level job at around $9.00 per hour, then you should probably be looking elsewhere. The other thing is, most of the other employees are in the same boat. They know it's a dead end job. This makes the work environment a little bit tiring and demoralizing. The staff is unmotivated, the management is tiresome and doesn't pay enough attention to their employees, and there's very little room for advancement from what I experienced. I saw 50 year old employees that had been working there for over 10 years and only ever made it to the self checkout lanes. There's the occasional employee that makes it to supervisor, but for what it pays you'd much rather be looking elsewhere."
bad,The culture at Korger was toxic. It was mostly High School aged students that worked there. They practiced partiality and bullying. I did not enjoy my time there.
bad,"if you enjoy stress, no work life balance, and no gratitude for anything you do then its for you. it used to be a great place to work, but then it became more about what they thought customers want or fakeness. I loved it and with the staff and customers, but upper management is unrealistic and live in a fairy tale land."
bad,My experience at Kroger stores has been alright overall it’s a job where the work/life balance is low Just like the compensation and benefits are. I’ve had the opportunity to work alongside some wonderful and quite interesting people. It’s mostly a collaborative environment for all to get each tasks done.
bad,"Working in Kroger part time is waste of time of efforts , I was asked to achieve targets without any benefit in return. Salary in general is below available rate as i was $8.25/hr before deduction of taxes and ss."
bad,"Work as assistant manager. Responsible for all aspects of store operations. Merchandising, ensuring store is set to sales plan on a weekly basis. Responsible for creating budgets, controlling expenses, and wages."
bad,"The changes to Kroger's pharmacy team on a corporate level have DRASTICALLY decreased employee moral in District A. We grow consistently each year in both script count and sales. As of recently, instead of applauding us for our amazing team and employee retention, corporate has now started coming in, un-anounced to tell us that our workflow is not ""best practice"". Our workflow has been perfected with years of the same technicians working together under one roof with excellent teamwork. We get nothing but raving reviews on our pharmacy's efficiency by all floater and fill in pharmacists. We strive to serve our customers and community. Kroger, if you want loyal and dedicated pharmacy staff...change something. I'm afraid that if you do not do something VERY fast, your pharmacies will crumble."
bad,"It's okay at first but there was only 2 mangers and 1 supervisor that was at my location that what cool, but yet made sure you did your job and they did theirs's. Those are the ones that will help you as you boss but be a friend at the same time. If you have other things you have to do and you turn in you schedule unless there is only 1 person that does the scheduling there it's as if you did have anything else or have a life of your own. For example  at the time I and a few other start working at our location they scheduled us to work doing the time we were supposed in class, know that we a students. Plus its as if you are whoever never set a availability for the time you can work with out a problem. Also  depending what you are doing you are under paid like Courtesy Clerk, Stockers, Cleaners, Supervisors and whoever will have to work self-checkout or the money center. They all get under paid fort the amount of work the do and did. But yet this company is supposed to be part of a workers union."
bad,"I have witnessed the rapid declination of store conditions in all aspects IE: quality and integrity of upper and store level management, depletion of properly staffed departments and inconsistent communication concerning goals and objectives. Blatant favoritism/bias in regards to promotion/demotion of employees."
bad,"Was told that I could make good money,but minimum wage for a 50yr old is not good money. I worked full time the entire time that I worked there and was offerered $8.50 when I gave my 2 weeks notice."
bad,"My review would actually be more positive, but unfortunately my last manager was a complete trainwreck of overblown pride and horrific incompetence. My managers before that were actually great people, but they had some serious off days where the stress of the job and the requirements placed on them by the company would get to them and it would show. Also, the CEO of the company blocked a pay raise randomly when I worked there; it took the union stepping in to get us the pay raise, something I find suspiciously pathetic."
bad,"If you like to be micromanaged by under qualified supervisors, then this job is for you. Promotions are based on who you know, not what you know. Meetings are long and repetitive. Goals are constantly increasing as well as the workload. Expectations are ridiculous."
bad,"There was really no work life balance at Kroger, Most store manager said that you were balance to be able to work at Kroger. The HR director agreed  with the store managers."
bad,They didnt treat everyone fairly they put to much work on us just cause we got everything done so they gave us their work. I wish I could have been treated like a human being with options.
bad,"Your experience varies from store to store, but my department was being bombarded with policies and changes that I did not feel fit my salary. Often you'll find management and coordinators complaining that understaffed departments do not have an excuse for being behind. This is asinine--wholly ignorant of the environment's situation. But why bother complaining? They want a target rather than an understanding. This is a common theme throughout stores, although it does depend on whether or not your management team is cannibalistic. You'll often find in overworked stores that the management is willing to sacrifice employees as long as it means upward mobility in the company. I do not operate that way."
bad,"Kroger would be a great place to work if the current management was more knowledgeable in their roles. Also more involved with knowing their employees. I realize our store is large and there are over 300 of us but even getting to know your main full-time help is beneficial to overall employee satisfaction. The district and corporate offices lack the communication and amount of help they need to help stores. "
bad,If you’re under the age of 18 in Illinois they pay you 7.75 an hour which isn’t nearly enough to be able to afford the cost of living. They aren’t flexible with hours so whatever you set as you’re availability is set in stone.
bad,"My time with Kroger was an absolute nightmare. Even though it was a part time job, I was ALWAYS scheduled to do fulltime hours. The pay is minimum wage, the supervisor I had practically had no idea what he was doing, and relied on other employees, experienced or not, to train new hires rather than train them himself. The management was alright, but not real communicative with the other employees."
bad,"Some parts of the job I did enjoy, my coworkers and supervisors were great and super helpful. "
bad,This job was one of my worst due to the poor workers that I worked with most of them were very rude and horrible to new associates said things like “why he here stealing our hours”
bad,It's a workload for no purpose. The pay isn't worth the drama and work. I especially hate it when customers aren't being attended to when in need of help. It's so unfair.
bad,"Personally, I need more challenges in my work life. The environment seems to be getting hostile towards older women. I am getting fewer hours than someone who has been working less than a year-I have twenty years working in Kroger. I'm reliable, honest, and conscientious. Right now, I'm looking for more challenges and better pay. Benefits are the only reason I'm still with Kroger. Yet, those are getting to be costly in the out-of-pocket category. This sounds like a whiny review, I'm not that kind of person. I want to work in an atmosphere of shared respect. I do not see this anymore. Kroger seems to promoting the wrong people, all the time! This has been going on for the last three or four years now. Good management seems to be a thing of the past."
bad,"This job is not one someone can reasonably live off of. Entry level is an understatement and pay raises are practically nonexistent. Basically everyone starts off at minimum wage no matter what or very close to it. The busy labor and hard work is not worth the pay behind it. If you're serious about wanting a worthwhile job, this is most definitely not the place for you."
bad,I can't really say much about the job because I was only on it at least about a year and a half. But it seemed that when what little time I was there the store had seemed to be poorly managed in one particular department and that was in the deli department where I was.
bad,Its a place for young high school kids nothing else. Management was poor & I went through atleast 5 managers while working there. & nun were any good in my opinion. This place truly doesn't care about its workers unless they have to. & I see why they have union reps there.
bad,"Working at Kroger was enjoyable due to the co-workers. Management loved to micro-manage the employees. It wasn't liked. Besides micro-managing, expectations on the employees to get impossible tasks completed were implemented daily. Working to an unending goal is what it felt like."
bad,Even though I worked at Kroger for almost 10 years and ended my last 2 years there in a acting full time position I was not paid in that manner or received full time hour even though I left as a department manager.
bad,"I loved what I did for my job however, always had to pick up other peoples slack for what they did not get done which put me in a bind for my work ""orders"" every day. Management always hounded about being ""set"" by 9am every day which was nearly impossible at times. Most people loved union however it was impossible for me to advance to what I had wanted to do because seniority rules."
bad,"My typical teenage days here at my first job were as a bagger, customer servicing and stocking away left overs.  The job was quite simple, yet not very inviting at the time. I wasn't treated as an individual whom would be subject to becoming successful to their business at the time. Management seemed a bit aggressive during my time and the culture was great though you felt like you were ready for home halfway through your shift. The hardest part of the job was  taking on peoples extra work and the hard winters of ohio making cart pushing your worst nightmare."
bad,"Kroger is a fast-paced place to work, but does not pay their employees well. They are also forced to join the union after a probationary period, or loose their job."
bad,"kroger isn't anything special . good for hs or college kids. after that you will feel miserable. gain experience do your job, make a good business relationship ."
bad,"At best, the job is a strenuous but bearable stretch of work with a bit of a break toward the end when everything gets finished. Even then, the scheduling can be inconsistent (scheduled for 6 hours, asked to stay for 8) and sometimes management won't inform you of a rule, policy, etc. until you've gone against it. "
bad,"there are favoritism in this store especially if you have been with them for a while.  if you ask for some small favor, management will promise you but will never do.  the union is not of help, at all."
bad,at the time I worked there I was advanced to front end supervisor didn't get a raise just had a title .my manager was rude to me and employers. customers most of the time was excellent and understanding very busy environment
bad,"Not worth the 10.00 an hour to work harder than the lazy people the union protects. "
bad,Poor Management with unethical/immoral practices. Far to much drama for a civilized work environment. Felt more like being in elementary school rather than a professional job.
bad,"This job is an excellent first time job for any teenager. Excellent Benefits, by far one of the cheapest packages with more coverage than most. Full time can be near impossible to achieve. Managers are hit and miss as to whether you get a good one or not. If you get in good with management then your career can be assured with minimal work on your part. If you don't always see eye-to-eye with management then your career path can be a very rough hard rocky ride with a distinct possibility of being slapped back down to the bottom rung no matter how hard you work."
bad,The people you work with are great and very friendly. They are hardworking and do their jobs. The management does not listen to the employees when there is an issue. They are all about appearances and act like they care when they really don't. The employees are not appreciated like they should be and that is unacceptable.
bad,"I expected more from this company. The pay is lousy, the management is only out for themselves. Very disappointed with the job I had there. I quit after 3 months."
bad,"Working at Kroger, I gained the experience needed to work in a fast pace environment. At first, my intention was to only have the job for the summer but when the school year started, I needed the money for necessities such as gas and food. The $8 an hour pay was not enough so I started working more hours to bring in more money and I soon discovered that the more hours I worked, although it helped me get more money, was taking a toll on my academics which I want too prioritize. I now know that I need a job with a higher pay that I can work at and not come home ready to just go straight to sleep after instead of doing homework. I feel that a job  as a cashier would be perfect."
bad,"I feel like krogers was a good job but they weren’t flexible around my school hours. We have fun working there some times. There are times where management isn’t to fair. Krogers overall is a good place to work if you are not doing anything.. such as going to college, working two jobs, etc."
bad,"Fast paced, department manager doesn't really work. he doesn't know how to schedule properly and doesn't rotate with the other leads on the team.  Co-workers are fine and know how to do their job. Customers are very nice."
bad,"Hectic scheduling caused many conflicts, several managers with differing styles and conflicting personalities made navigating each day difficult. The actual requirements of the job, thankfully, are fairly lax. Expect to be sweeping a lot of floors and pushing a lot of carts. They change the layout of the store every few months which makes it a challenge to navigate customers to the items they want, and holidays are a nightmare."
bad,It is a great and new type of job experience for me. I enjoy learning new things and meeting new people. The Kroger that I work at has people from all over the world working there and I enjoy hearing about different cultures and mindsets. I also enjoy interacting with customers.
bad,Good benefits but more work is required than compensation.  Employees are required to work most weekends and long hours.  The store is very busy and there are not enough employees for the work required.
bad,This company does not give enough pay for the years given to the company. I can not live off of my hourly pay and the pay raises that are given are a joke.
bad,"I work as a courtesy clerk, bagging groceries and collecting carts from the lot. I'm not liking it as much because they are not giving me enough hours, the breaks are short, and I spend time in 100+ degree weather collecting carts."
bad,When I started with Kroger it was a great company.  Now it’s all about the mighty dollar.  They cut hours but still expect the same things done.  They are not family friendly they could careless if you saw your family just as long as they were making money.
bad,Kroger wasn't my favorite place to work. It was unpredictable from management. Most of the time my manager didn't show up. The compensation is much to low for the work that is being done.
bad,"Low pay, high stress and management can be hard to deal with and the people you manage are difficult. Not worth the stress and problems some days just depends on your manager."
bad,Kroger abuses employee's with low pay double the work load. so many OSHA violations to mention yet they keep pushing the envelope untilluntilsomeone gets hurt. They have a good ole boy work system placing unqualified people in positions cause they are friends.
bad,krogers management is very poor. worked for kroger for almost 3 years and never put me full time which was ashame cause i liked working for the company.
bad,Working for Kroger is challenging and busy. You can easily advance from one position to another because they offer the jobs to all employees before hiring from outside the company.
bad,If you're 14 and you are looking for a job yeah go ahead its a good first job but if you want to stay as a baggier make sure you don't say anything to management or your supervisor because technically you have a better chance if your 14 to become a cashier than other older people that are 16 or 17. Because its a promotion and here at Kroger they do not like giving promotions and they don't have to give a promotion to 14 year old's soo they would be glad to give you an offer to become a cashier.
bad,"The job is easy however the Managers make you want to kill yourself, the customer are toxic and make you want to kill yourself. If you're desperate get a job there but don't plan go stay and be happy with it"
bad,"The Kroger stores in my area have good management that you can connect and get along with, but they go through so many people that it is impossible to be put on full time and there is not a guaranteed amount of hours you will be able to get per week."
bad,Why do people Stay?  The relationships they build with their customers. The Pension Plan.  Their time invested. The hope it will get better. A sense of Loyalty. If you want a challenge and you think you can make a difference and have good work ethic you can move up quick.  You will earn every penny of your salary.
bad,"The manager at the time had everybody doing whatever he felt like telling us to do, whether or not we had the required experience or if it was outside our department. He would change our schedules on his own whims and was just terrible."
bad,Starting rate needs improvement. There needs to be a better system when it comes to company advancements and recognition. I did not receive a raise until I worked there for nine months. and starting rate is not enough to survive throughout the week.
bad,Kroger doesn't pay enough for the job that needs to be done. The employees work really hard and are not well appreciated. Which is sad to say because the potential is there to be a great work place.
bad,My personal review of Kroger as a whole  this company was great to work for but because of reasons  I cannot control Kroger in this region of the country is no longer going to be in business
bad,Three hardest part of the job is getting everyone onthe same page with like minded goals.  The management at kroger is a knowledgeable but they don't necessarily take care of their associates.
bad,People weren’t treated fairly and I barely made 100 dollars working at the job and I really didn’t get any hours. The managers showed favoritism to the older employees.
bad,It was not at all worth the amount of effort I put in even as my first job I couldn't stand standing so long in one place then immediately afterward bring in carts for hours in the summer heat of Texas.
bad,so many opportunities at krogers cashiers to stocker to supervisor if u want it .. always something to do the most stressful part of ob is getting carts in bad weather
bad,"Kroger used to be a great place to work,  in the past. The company is on the decline. Its management and Department heads are no where near as knowledgeable or  professional as they used to be 10 yrs ago. The training is sub par at best. There is no accountability with the department heads or management. The employees are the scapegoats for management, or lack there of. They do not coach their employees, in order to improve performance or knowledge. They are deceitful, and manipulative of employees to get what they want, violating their contract with their union."
bad,Kroger can be a good place to work for if you do what they want with out question.  they will treat you good until they don't see a need for you anymore and then they will lay you off
bad,"Kroger could be a an easy place for teens who are just entering the workforce and for retirees to keep active. But I highly advise you not to work here. "
bad,"Management is pretty good, but the lack of training and direction makes it difficult to accomplish some tasks or fully understand the how or why of doing things managers require. Expected to stay over, regardless of my personal schedule (dr's appts, etc)  burned out after 3 months"
bad,Kroger was ok at first until the manager started being a jerk to everyone he would tell us when we could take our vacations and get upset if you or your family got sick there is a serious lack of compassion with this company
bad,"The people are nice and the work hours are plentiful and flexible, but management and pay are both terrible. I can't live off of their horrible wages."
bad,"I have worked for other customer service jobs, and I will say this job was the least stressful. I was able to go into work and I knew my exact position. They just did not pay enough to have a livable wage."
bad,"Even with previous experience it seems like You have to fight to ask for a pay increase. I worked produce department, I had a 16 pallet delivery and I was expected to break it all down and rotate it properly with new dates. This is at minimum wage $9.25. But yet the young kids up front bagging for customers get the same pay. $9.25. Like WTF?  And when they do internal company surveys, they try to buy you off by flooding the break room with greasy pizza and chicken... this is so sad."
bad,"Where I work with my management, it is difficult to get the amount of hours you need. Communication is severely lacking and they are typically unforgiving unless if you have been there awhile."
bad,"When i worked for Kroger, it was a lack of management. The hours to work wasn’t flexible like they said it was. I was getting paid less and that’s another reason why i left. But since i left the pay went up. I think it just depends on the Kroger’s you work at to experience different customer service."
bad,"I am pro union, but this company makes being unionized excruciating. You get great benefits, and can't be fired (virtually), but you get paid less and are forced to work horribly understaffed."
bad,"Store was constantly short on help in order to cut costs but they would deny me consistent 40 hour weeks in order to keep me off full time.  Customers are always angry because shelves are empty because we are under staffed but hey, we were top 10 in profit for the region so management is happy"
bad,Working at Kroger for two years as a deli clerk was a very stressful and frustrating time. There was no communication between department management and their associates. Overtime was frowned upon. Fellow associates were unwilling to compromise or help when short handed. This job gave me several anxiety attacks and I only regret taking so long to leave.
bad,good as a first job to maybe get your feet wet in the actual working environment but would not recommend to anyone my age. Good to learn the ropes of how the grocery store runs.
bad,"Customer service was great but the employee experience was not. Management did not teach employees how to do the job, just thrown into it. Too simple of a job"
bad,"Very fast paced atmosphere, learned to have to have a lot of patience with public. The management with in our store, are very disrespectful, unappreciative, talks down to hourly associates."
bad,"The Kroger store that I worked at wasn't the most beautiful store (it was ghetto), but nobody cared about their job or the cleanliness of the place. It wasn't the nicest Kroger store, but literally, they could fire every single person there, and almost none of them would care, because it's that bad."
bad,"After 14 years of service, once I started going back to school management gave me a hard time. At times it was stressful due to the lack of communication between employees and management."
bad,A typical day is stressful. Management is inconstant. Workplace culture is everybody for themselves. There was little training; some computer training and on the job shadowing.
bad,company is in andover. would not recommend working there.. Didnt pay well no advancement and stressful at times. Supervisor doesnt care about employees.
bad,The best thing was the formation of friendship with fellow coworkers and customers. Most of the positive activities are not possible for you to attend. They did sponsor a good quantity of continuing education but it has been cut. The compensation was good.
bad,My coworkers were very rude and you don't really learn the information needed until you get on the the floor. Once you are on the floor you're kind of on your own because we were so short staffed it was hard to get help.
bad,"With the 15 years I have spent with the company I feel like I have hit the plateau.  There is not much more room for advancement.  I work 50+ hours a week with little to no work life balance.  For the time I have with the company compared to the compensation packages the new managers receive is not comparable.  The job culture is miserable, and most store management teams are miserable and looking for new employment."
bad,"Very demanding, very stressful. The lack of poor management is a reflection why departments don't do well. With understaffing and lack of leadership the customers take the fall. With more of a positive sense of leadership the company could do well. Except they always have a poor notion that there is never enough time to give back to the departments."
bad,The job itself is fine.  But depending on which department you in; the environment changes.  My department it is not what you know or how you do your job but if you are friends with the supervisor.
bad,Kroger needs to understand and rationalize the importance of pharmacy technicians and pharmacists. The turnover rate seems to be very high due to lack of competitive pay.
bad,"Just like any other job now, Kroger will keep you right at the part time hours to not pay you benefits. The workers there are great and some of the management. The big bosses only come in to the store to complain about how you are not doing things right. When they bought out my store, I had 5 paid vacations because of being with the previous company almost 20 years. They cut me to 1 week no benefits immediately."
bad,"I worked there for 7 years, for the most part I liked my job. But at the end management didn't treat people right and I didn't feel safe at work anymore. The Job was great I loved it, I learned a lot of real life skills, like working with people and the public. The store I was in had a low morale but that didn't stop me from being happy. The best part of my job was working with the flowers, the hardest part of my job was making sure I had the right amount of product in the store for the consumer."
bad,"The hours is probably the worst part of the job, getting less than 20 hours a week on average. There's also too many managers that the fuel manager has to deal with, getting conflicted orders is an expected part of the job. Also, you can expect help from people when  you first start off but not so much when you've been there for a couple of days and need to help get lines down."
bad,"Management has little to no communication, will jump to immidiately punishment if something is not to there liking. Sloppy work from other departments within the store and extremely unorganized."
bad,"Numbers are what’s most important for the company. Employees are a dime a dozen and hours are stretched thin throughout the store, but job responsibilities are piled high and expected to be done with no overtime allowed."
bad,"This job will hire you for sure but its not very good. Very monotonous work, 30 min lunch breaks, and an overall depressing work environment. This a job for high school students and other people who are struggling to find a job any where."
bad,"I loved most of the people I worked with which was not the problem. I wasn't getting the hours I needed with the wage I had to be able to make a living, take care of my family as well as pay bills. I also didn't get along with my store manager and she would constantly go back on her word. She would try to quote policy which wasn't actually policy. She treated other employees with the same situation as me with respect and kindness but she constantly was making my life there terrible. She added to the problem of terrible hours along with bad pay."
bad,I was mostly a bagger at this grocery store it was my first job that i had and it was something to get me over the hump to take care of my new born. Krogers was  not an growng experience for me thats why I left.
bad,The pay is very low for similar jobs at other companies. It was a fast paced environment and over the years they have been giving us more work with fewer hours.
bad,"Bad pay and once your there for some time, some people tend to stay a while, (like decades) others don't even make it a week.                        ."
bad,"I worked here in the Fall/Winter of 2015 and I hated it. The management at my store was pretty terrible, except for one lady who was very ""on-the-ball"" and would constantly be doing stuff around the front of the store in order to make everything run smoothly. The Courtesy Clerks did a lot more than what we were paid for in my opinion. We bagged groceries, collected carts from the parking lot, and did go-backs if it wasn't busy. I wouldn't recommend this place at all."
bad,The work was fine and the customers were fun to work with but the management there doesn't care about there employees at all. The pay there was alright and the benefits don't kick in until you've been there for 8 months.
bad,"I get paid to grab food for the old, busy, and lazy people of my community and during the adventure I'm greeted with people always asking me questions. The thing is if its about stocks which surprise it mostly is then I have no clue as all I do is pick stuff up for others. Without the use of the BayMax I wouldn't be able to find anything myself without having walked some of the isles for what seems like days within a shift before they are changed or messed with by management."
bad,"the store manager is horrible but the company is great I enjoy working at Krogers. As a courtesy clerk my job was to bag customer groceries and make sure they leave wanting to come back, we're the last person they see for their day. We also have to go outside and push carts for a given time which is not bad. I've recently be promoted to a cashier and still have not received a raise, I've been offered the supervisor position but had to decline because it did not come with a raise."
bad,I would work 50+ hours a week doing 4 peoples worth of work. I did get a promotion but for way more work it was only a 50c raise. Poor Management did not hire near enough staff to properly run the store. The people worth keeping they refused to pay more.
bad,"There is a focus on sales all the time and a lack of appreciation for employee's hard work.  Working with the public taught me a lot about customer service.  Like everywhere, management can be good or bad."
bad,"I learned many great things here - no doubt. It isn't horrible if you like being micro-managed to the T and don't have a family or life outside of work because all that you will be able to do is work. As a manager I was responsible for EVERYTHING from the dust on the trash can in the lot to the dust on the ceiling and everything in between. Expect no hand outs - you will work yourself to the bone here but you will also get a decent pay (if you don't figure out your hourly rate is lower than a clerk). I would work 60-80 hours a week (they tell you 45 hours is required) to even make a dent in my work load! Some days I would work 15-18 hours! Then later expect calls, texts, and emails on your time off. Black out weeks for vacations - then right before your scheduled vacation they will cancel it because of an ""event"" or something they overlooked!"
bad,"I started this job being told I would be hired as full time and then once hired was told  to meet and maintain 40 hours per week for 12 weeks to gain full time benefits. Seemed fair enough, and it isn't unheard of, so I worked the appropriate hours needed to gain my benefits. Over two months since my benefits were supposed to be put into effect and they still weren't but to try and get an answer on what to do about it turned into a bunch of he said and she said, being told by the store manager that they DO NOT KNOW what to do to get marked as full time and basically being told by HR that this kind of treatment is to be expected. It should also be noted that I have multiple years worth of experience in my field but I am being paid the same amount as someone fresh to the field and was given no way to haggle/bargin my wage. This is probably a fine first job for someone who is young and still on their parent's insurance but do not come here and expect to be treated as if you are valued."
bad,The job itself wasn't bad but the management was terrible. We argued about life changes and career changes. They never wanted to let you off for important things. The pay was not working there at all.
bad,"Priority in work hour schedule, people who have been working more than 4 years can set up the work schedule that they like, otherwise he have to work according what they want you to work"
bad,"The opportunities for advancement at Kroger are actually nonexistent. Managers sometimes try their best, but are poorly equipped by the company to handle anything."
bad,"Was not my favorite work place. Management didn't listen, little things were big problems, but big problems were overlooked. Would never go back there."
bad,"Usually there was one cashier and five people in line to check out. Customers commented they wouldn't be back due to this issue."
bad,"It is an ok job if you are looking for a first job or something part time. However, you don't get to make a lot of money. As a courtesy clerk in the Southern United States, you have to get carts in over 100 degree weather for thirty minutes at a time. They are supposed to provide water when it is that hot, however, it is forgotten sometimes. Depending on the manager, you may be able to talk with other courtesty clerks and cashiers while you work. Other, however, will not allow it. I did enjoy helping the elderly out to their cars. Plus courtesy clerks are allowed to take tips."
bad,"Kroger leaves a lot to be desired in terms of a long term job. The management of the stores is the biggest complaint I've heard, that and the cut hours during the holidays. It's not a good career job."
bad,"The work environment as a whole is rather pleasing, however the stress placed on the employees due to lack of communication and overall immaturity of management makes the job less than worth while."
bad,a lot of moving  around  and some rude customers.. great with keeping hings in order and nice and neat. i wouldn't mind working back in that environment got along great with customers and employees
bad,"While working at this location there was poor management because things were unorganized and unprofessional. There was a promise that was broking, an associate and myself were supposed to have an opportunity to become a sale floor supervisor but the promise was never fulfilled."
bad,This job was just so I could make some side money before joining the Air Force.  I had no intentions of making a career out of the food service industry.
bad,"We get promised things and never get them. They push you to hard. There equipment (markdown printer's) never work that makes a 30 minute job take 2 hours. There are many times I just want to walk out. 1/2 the management only care for them selves. And they stick together and back up each other for there own gain. I loved working there before. The last 8 months has been so sad for me. 3/4 of employees hate working there and are over worked and stressed out. Then management don't listen when u can't finish your job because they force you to mulltitask like being a cashier 10 times a day cause they don't have the brains to hire a cashier. Then they hire 16 yo that keep calling for alcohol key and that slows everything down. Then they wonder why customer s are backed up. Duh. Many, many stupid things make it a :Get me out of this job please. I'm so sad cause I work very hard. Many have just given up."
bad,"There is a bad work life balance and they often try to fit one person in multiple roles when, even with good time management, the demands of the duties mean none of the jobs are achieved well. You pick up some good skills if you try but after a while they become overly generalized to kroger."
bad,It's cool cause u really learn new things and plus they really help u to Kno the job it's just that most of the stuff they want u to know right off the back sumtime..
bad,"After working for this company for so many years I realize that unless you kiss butt or know someone you won't advance. Management will lie, change schedules and talk badly about employees."
bad,Have to at some point realize that everything can't be the most important thing and dragging the associates around in thousands of different directions leads to upset and disengaged employees.  pick a strategy and focus on it.
bad,"In all honesty, I did not really approve how the manager was really running the store or with how much I was getting paid starting out. It may just be me, but it is how I felt."
bad,"Kroger was a good first job for me, but for how much trouble I've had with management in the past, I wouldn't recommend you stay at Kroger for very long. On top of trouble with management, the hours for me have been quite horrible. There will be times where I will get 30+ hours, and there will be times where I will get maybe between 8 and 16; which was most of the time. Though I did learn a lot about customer service skills though working at Kroger."
bad,enjoyed working with my fellow employees and made it easier to get through the day. managers were either too strict about rules or not strict enough. hired people for departments that were already full and let other departments like front end or people that did inventory stay overworked. bagging was easy but carts gets hard if you let it get hard. busy around end of day when people are coming home. weekends are ALWAYS busy.
bad,i had a horrible female boss who would put me down every chance she got. I had the best sales in the chain out of 260 stores. so I should not have been treated this way
bad,"Low salary, poor management, short staffed. New president of Kroger has taken every benefit we receive not including health benefits. Employees both part time and full time should receive holiday pay."
bad,i will never work for kroger again. The pay wasnt enough. the management was really messy. and i told them i was in school and they continued to schedule me on days i couldnt work.
bad,Never have the same schedule from week to week & in fact often I dot even know sometimes until the night before when I'm supposed to work the next day
bad,I was basically getting paid under $7 an hour for a crazy amount of work. People I worked with would slack off and the manager did not know how to handle the department.
bad,"It was a very unorganized experience for me working at Kroger. Schedules were never official, and they were very irresponsible when it comes to letting you know about schedule changes."
bad,"From working my way vigorously from an entry level employee to a supervisor role I had assumed the hard work would reap the benefits given from the employers but, through the management and pay, you were shown that despite any hard work, they tirelessly expected unreal results with limited resources still."
bad,I would not recommend Kroger there really is no work life balance and I feel very underpaid. Kroger a one point in time was a good company to work for but since there has been change in upper management it has changed for the worst
bad,"Pay doesn't match position. (Butchers, even when starting, generally receive starting pay of around $10/hr. to $16/hr. Was payed $7.40/hr.) "
bad,My experience was good at the beginning but then after a couple of months the management got worse and we became understaffed and the job got harder for most of us.
bad,"I was told going in that I was going to get close to 40 hrs.  That I may be scheduled less but not to worry because I would get more.  Well that I why I rated the job work/ life balance poorly.  My manager would always schedule me 4 hour shifts.  He told me he did this so if he had to he could make me work longer. Hard to have a life that way, because you cant plan things and you don't make enough to live.  "
bad,"My store has me doing assistant department manager work for the minimum pay of a normal stocker position. I have been promised advancement but nothing has changed and nothing has been mentioned to me of the progress of this opportunity. The culture is average, you have good, honest, hardworking people, then there are the run of the mill screw ups who check their phone ever hour on the hour. Management does not get onto the one who do not work hard, only those they know will take their abuse, even though I have worked through 90% of the breaks I am required to take. The only good thing about my job is those hard working people make the job more bearable."
bad,"a typical day of work consists of fielding customers at the cash register, performing basic cleaning of the store, and ensuring that the shelves are properly faced and stocked."
bad,depending on your position a work day can be different. didn't learn a whole lot from the job. Management was the biggest problem with working at Kroger.
bad,But the one I worked at had a tyrant for a store manager. I cant even get into everything she did to me and my crew because it would be a novel. But when I did step down and transfered to antoher store she had the new manager call me with a wrong scheduel so that I immediately had a bunch of no call no shows and they could fire me. Good place to work unless you have a bad store manager.
bad,Low pay and unappreciation. Everyone is paid the same no matter how hard you work. Which is frustrating for people who can't help but work hard. Turn over is really high.
bad,"Poor middle management, lacking in leadership and communication skills.  Pay is low for the amount of work that is expected.  A lot is expected out of employees with very little training."
bad,"Worked at Kroger for maybe 6-8 months over night stocking  , from my first week till I quit I got 40 plus hours but was considered part time and official schedule showed me as a 32hr worker.  When I asked about benefits  and a pay raise my work loads got so ridiculous  I had to quit"
bad,"I got this job to get out of working fast food, wasn't too bad for a while. Management doesn't do their job well. Working with regular customers is the best part. Wouldn't work here for life."
bad,"Management on the front end is immature,demeaning, overall very unprofessional!!!! The 4th street store in Albq,NM is the only store Im familiar with as far as employment and customer service."
bad,"I would not recommend working here, at least the one in Valley Station. The management is mean and are not considerate towards their workers.They do not provide enough hours to work."
bad,This job is not worth getting if you're just starting out and trying to provide for yourself. They pile so much on you and keep piling until you snap. The only enjoyable part of this job was my co-workers. You get absolutely no breaks working in the bakery as the baker and you only get 8 hours to do 20+ tasks that half of them take at least 3 hours to complete.
bad,"This was perfect when I was still in high school and didnt care about advancing or benefits or raises! Once I was out of school, it was a whole new ball field and ended terribly! I went 3 and a half years without a raise despite my climbing the ladder, i did recieve vacation and insurence offers, but that wasnt helping with the bills."
bad,proper time is not allowed to trained each individual and the pay scale does not allow for someone to provide for their family if this is their full time job
bad,"Great pay, then the hours are slashed to where you cannot survive and must seek other employment. Too bad. I really loved working there. The people are nice but management in HR is not."
bad,"Salaried staff was always moving from one distribution center to another. There were never set hours, one week start at 1am, the next 8am, the next...who knows."
bad,the hours are king and the pay is not worth the amount of work you are required to do. i am a cashier and on a typical day i get 100+ customers. i like to maintain a good clean environment at all times and a friendly place for all our customers
bad,"It's just not for me I guess. I don't feel like we got paid enough for all we do. The scheduling was horrible and the didn't give me enough hours even when I asked for them. When I tried to move to a different department when they had an opening, the store manger wouldn't let me just because they thought the front end needed my help more. Soon after I left my coworkers told me it got even worse at our store. I even had a manger who told a co- worker of mine to hit me because he thought I didn't do a good enough job clearing carts. He didn't even get fired for that.. For never calling in sick and always being on time, they treated me like garbage."
bad,"Kroger is a good part time good for school kids. Being in upper management the stress level was unbearable,no work life balance, can't keep stores staffed, division office doesn't support stores. Please don't work in upper management if you to enjoy a good life."
bad,"I wanted to gain experience in allied health professions in college while making a decent amount of money. I only worked here for 2 months because I wasn't even making enough money to pay my rent and had to find a new, better paying job. Pharmacy techs should not be paid the same as cashiers, ClickList, etc. the amount of training and knowledge necessary to fill this role are not valued as much as it should be."
bad,Kroger is over 7 years various positions but as a manager if they feel someone better for the job they'll do whatever to get them the job meaning getting rid of you
bad,"A high paced busy environment. Fun place to work but difficult with family life and small children."
bad,been working for kroger for 8 years and its not like it used to be. the expectation has become silly. retention is a proplem due to low wages. the company completely denies this problem. departments are mostly understaffed 50+ hours. but the job still has to get done. i know of many department leaders/managers who work off the clock to keep their positions. that's not right! the company has become completely unrealistic.
bad,"Kroger is an old-fashioned company run by old, white men who will always cut corners to make sure the company looks like the ""good guys"" among other superstore chains. I'm a pharmacy tech and they pay their techs less than any other techs in the nation. That is a fact. They offer tests to take to get pathetic raises that are honestly not even worth the time."
bad,"Typical day at work consisted of multiples things at once to juggle, especially holidays for work. I enjoyed my co-workers, but not the supervisors. Management would continuously change every other month. Our store was a training store for managers, and it would continuously change."
bad,"There is never a slow day when it comes to my job duties. I have several different tasks that must be completed each morning within a just two hours of my arrival. These tasks include markdowns, scanning my department for holes on the shelf, doing any necessary orders, and conditioning various aisles/sections of my department. I have several different aisles/sections I have to keep stocked in my department. I have my regular dairy stock and milk in dairy, stock in frozen, dry and specialty stock and grocery, and more. The hardest part of my job is maintaining a growing department with the volume of sales I have."
bad,"I worked at this company awhile. Starting off at 7.25 and after two years only making it to 7.75. They ask a lot of their employees, but do not offer any rewards or advancement. I often times would be doing a managers job, but at my low entry rate of 7.25. I trained many new employees, worked multiple departments, and worked long hours without sitting down. All for 7 an hour. Also, DO NOT sign with the union program, it is a rip off. I would rather have been fired over something stupid then them taking money out of my check every week. It was not worth it."
bad,You have to have patience to deal with your Co workers they're slow and don't listen very well. Hard to find someone to work for you if you need off. Management is sporadic always leaving and never really nice. Fun place to work but have to be able to deal with a lot of people.
bad,"A decent job for a high school student, but definitely not a good place to work long term. You clean, help customers, management wasn't very likable by employees, hardest part was just dealing with some customers, you may have some good co-workers to hang out with and that will make the time go a little quicker."
bad,"A lot of days at work you'd see management slacking off and employees dealing with the customers. Because being apart of their union is required $25 is taken from your paycheck every week for almost no union benefits. Management never seems to listen to the employee and always takes the side of the customer, even when they're obviously in the wrong. I've seen many employees walk out during their shifts simply because they can no longer deal with being told what to do by people who seemingly have no management experience."
bad,"Needs more team building skills to make employees cooperate better and move faster."
bad,Management in this store treat employees like idiots. Supervisers dont know how to do their job. They treat employees poorly therefor employees could care less
bad,"Its not the job its the people you have to work with. There are some that are very easy and cool to work with and then there are others that are always high strung 24/7. You are of course dealing with many different personalities so its natural for things to not always go smooth but instead of acting like adults all people do is talk behind each others back instead of talking it out. Management is terrible one of the store managers isn't even a people person, he doesn't speak to anyone no hello at all form him but he will quickly yell at you if you are not doing something right. Most of the managers think that they are above everyone else and they treat you how ever. But they defiantly treat the customers better than their employees. Pay rate is good but the hours are not. Not a place id stay long term at all."
bad,"I usually did more then expected. Because I like to work, and others didn't do what the were suppose to. I learned how to operate a fuel center without someone always being right there. Management was not good. Not easy to talk to. The hardest part of my job was the drama. The best was the regular customers."
bad,"they pay horrible even as shift lead you'll be luck to make it to 8 bucks a hour, management isn't great. Job security is the best. Hardest part is multitasking all day for 7.50 a hour"
bad,"-Heavily customer focused"
bad,"I initially applied to work as a cashier but as I finished up the surveys they decided to bring my position down as a store clerk.  I spent much of my job moving carts, stacking boxes of cans to trucks, taking out trash, as well as bagging.  The management was decent, although it was obvious all employees felt incredibly stressed.  The workers themselves made the job a bit more enjoyable than it was, but each day felt very redundant, with loads of work seeming to be done for less than what could be earned."
bad,"Stock and present produce in a professional manner. "
bad,"Kroger works well if you need a part time, moderate paying job to work into your schedule.  They are always hiring new people and do not reward the employees they do keep, so morale is low on average.  The company has lots of 'policies' that they tell you to follow, but they override those same policies if the customer complains about them, so the policies are a wash.  "
bad,"Just a job for teens college students,and older people who need extra income.Boring feels robotic. People who have grown up bills should not apply.It's every person for themselves."
bad,Barely trained me in the Bakery. Trained me for one day only. Never had a bakery position ever. Ran in to many complications with decorating the cakes and what to do everyday.
bad,"The Kroger I worked at was poorly managed and had a bad environment. They were flexible with their hours, however, they will barely give you a raise and the would even mess up on associates availability."
bad,I enjoyed my 2 years at Kroger overall but I think they pay too little for the amount of work expected and there management is awful.
bad,"the company is good to work for, it's just the people they put in certain management positions, they try to hinder your growth within the company."
bad,Co workers were always nice. They had a good balance of working and break time. Good opportunities for uper lever postions such as managers and assistant managers. I was only getting ten to twelve hours per week so i just tried to move on to better places.
bad,"-Great compensation to experience ratio, its hard to find an employer willing to pay a college graduate the way Kroger does."
bad,"A typical day involves interacting with customers , assisting them , heavy lifting , hours on my feet , my co workers were amazing , management were great but struggled with schedule and employee management . The most enjoyable part of the job is talking and helping customers I love to see people smile and laugh , the hardest part of my job was the height of some the places I had to reach ."
bad,"Huge drag of a workplace. No real energy to excite you to come into work or be productive. Would not recommend.Very old fashioned and drab, no excitement at all."
bad,I enjoyed working at this location in the deli for a short period of time. The employees are always putting the next person down just to make them look good.
bad,"didn't enjoy this job, and the company doesn't care about employees. I enjoy shopping there but that is it. stupid stupid"
bad,not allowed to have a bottle of water at our station. Expected to be available ALL the time and NOT request off or change availability. Inconsistent work schedule for a single mom.
bad,Kroger is a productive company however they are an unfair company. The store manager is unfair and a lot of the decisions are one sided. The customers can be very rude at times.
bad,"Had to do a lot of work for little pay, was not worth it. Managers were very immature and unorganized. Environment was full of drama with so many teens working there."
bad,"My coworkers are great, I was a courtesy clerk and overall I'd say that the people who aren't supervisors are great, but most of the supervisors are terrible. Belinda is by far the worst human being on earth, why her vest says number one customer service, I don't know. I have seen her scream at employees over the smallest things. I have even had a customer tell me ""she seems like a b***h"". The other supervisors just won't work with you on your schedule and try to guilt trip you into coming into work if you are sick or have requested time off (time off is usually denied anyways). As for the job it's self... it's not a hard job. The pay is terrible and the extremely short breaks make it hard to eat something for lunch or dinner. Do not get a job here because it sucks. It's better than Walmart, but not by much."
bad,i hate going to work i can not talk to my manager about things going on in my department. management is horrible at my store
bad,you will be asked to do anything and everything meaning if you work here you will not be doing what you were hire for. not a lot of breaks. management sucks. and the people that work there are snobby and just outright mean. you have to call the union for anything that happens to you because no one helps you. you will be turned down for advancement due to the manager liking someone better then you. if you call off due to a family issue your hours will get cut the very next week. overall this is a terrible place to work i would not have anybody that i know apply here.
bad,Depends on the right people that be there and your day will go by pretty good. The most good part is going outside and push carts. Some co-workers are disappointed.
bad,"All day standing, heavy movements depending on area of store, work overload with a pressure for up in their face type customer service. For 50 hours a week and this salary i learned it's not worth my happiness and health. I didn't like they treated me and how other managers worked. Jewel is way better. Oh and the black and white attire everyday with a tie? Haha....a big no no. Feels like the strict dress code a prison employs."
bad,"Terrible management. Friendly Coworkers. Bad Scheduling, Weird hours. Higher Ups treat you like garbage and have no interest in interacting with you."
bad,i went into Kroger loving it at first because it was a brand new store but as i started to get use to working there  i notice how slack the store was. the managers were not doing what their suppose to do . some of the coworkers were still confused on the register. I did learn how to do WIC transactions. the hardest part was getting everyone check out and helping others at the same time. the most enjoyable part was conversation with my customers an brighten there day
bad,"I worked with good people, but the management direction was confusing. The company goals kept changing. Overall it was a good short-term/entry level job."
bad,"Have been working for employer for almost three years, and there has been no significant sign of a substantial promotion; looking for next chapter in employment history to possess more opportunity for growth"
bad,"This company could care more about their associates, and pay more hourly because we work hard. The hardest part of the job is not stable work hours. I learned to work hard and never give up. A typical day at work will be clocking in and then going to the department to determine how the day is going."
bad,Kroger ia a decent place to work for the short term. Long term there is no advancement unless you are a member of a boss's family.
bad,"Starbucks was a great place to work inside of Kroger. I worked there for 2 yr and loved it but, my biggest problem was i started with a pay rate of 7.35, there was no advancement, and no benefits."
bad,"Low hours, low pay, no advancement, no health care, false promises, unrealistic expectations, usually had to skip breaks in order to finish tasks."
bad,Kroger Store Associates face lots of challenges as they go through the work day. Everyone works together to get the many tasks finished by the end of the shift. The most difficult part of the job would be the struggle for more staff on any given day. The most enjoyable part is becoming friends with people you see daily at the store.
bad,"Good job for first time workers. Nothing is hard, and everyone for the most part is very laid back. Some people have bad attitudes because they can hardly make ends meet because of the weak pay. also the system they use in which to decide pay is pretty bad, good workers get stiffed and cant get raises based on performance"
bad,Speedy check out is key. Many oppertuninties to grown within the company. Busiest times are during the holiday season such as thanksgiving and christmas. Pay was ever week and if you've been there for more than three years you qualify for healthcare benefits.
bad,Kroger wants more than they are willing to pay for. They require perfection but they will not compensate for it. They think they are more than they are when at the end of the day they are just a grocery store.
bad,"In this role I am primarily focused on the application design, development and support of Fuel management and Accounting back-office systems. Ensuring the systems support the overall business objectives and profitability. I am also tasked in this role to audit, design and help implement any needed security controls to maintain PCI certification in 800 convenience stores."
bad,The Front End department is not fair.  There are cashiers who are available at certain times of the day but receive no hours to work.  The supervisors work them long hours but no pay rate until July.  I was told in the interview that since I have cashier experience I would start at a decent wage i.e. 9.00/hr.  The front end is always short of courtesy clerks and staff.
bad,This job allowed me to encounter multiple people who needed help and who also relied on my service in order to complete their own personal tasks and agendas.As far as managers their was lack of respect towards the employees. There was no appreciation given for the work that the employees did.
bad,"I was a closer in the bakery and I enjoyed my coworkers and upper management."
bad,"New company. Lot's of potential. Still growing pains occurring. Location's just starting in the state I live in. Pay scale not for me,"
bad,Main store manager is the worst. Work in a hostile environment half of the time due to everyone else's stress. Wouldn't send anyone here to work.
bad,"This is a good place to work if you are in high school. It teaches you responsibility, but the management there is brutal."
bad,Management was terrible both to customers and employees. Near the end of when I was there we were extremely understaffed.
bad,"Manager expect unrealistic expectations of night lead. Give no assistance toward reaching those unrealistic expectation. The job is relatively easy and mostly consists of unloading trucks, working the truck and making the isles look presentable for morning shoppers."
bad,"No job training,your basically on your own most of the time !"
bad,"I was not certified to cut meat, however, I was expected to cut what ever a customer wanted while still only being paid minimum wage. Managers would get extremely angry if something was not complete by the end of the night, even if it was a busy day."
bad,"It was an okay place to work in, but the job can get hectic and terribly busy. Supervisors didn't give breaks on time or when needed to switch cashiers out. They only want to give themselves breaks first before the cashiers. Managers are bad, they hide most of the time from customers and some co-workers, they sometimes yell at some co-workers that they don't like. The pay is low and only go up 5 cents in the holiday and the day you was hired. Some of the departments don's give customer service and be mostly rude to the customers. Before I left the it was getting a bit better but there some things in there that still drag the company down."
bad,The company really cares about its customers  and tries to make them happy.  In addition the employee benefits are really good.  However work life balance is poor.
bad,"A typical day at work for me was stocking the shelves, filling the cooler and freezer, helping customers find products, and then making the department look nice at the end of my shift. Seems like an okay job, right? Wrong. For how much business my store did, every department was WAY overworked and underpaid. There was not nearly enough employees to keep up with the demands of the store. We had to work our butts off to keep up with our work so we wouldn't get scolded for not having it done. And in the midst of us working our butts off, they were short staffed on the front end and frequently called the department people up to ring for hours at a time. So our work piled up almost every week because we couldn't get it done while we were ringing, and they still had no problem calling us up. We always had to do them a favor, but no favors were ever returned."
bad,"I am over 30 years old, and I have always enjoyed the positive attitude of the Kroger employee's. I decided for a part time job, I would apply.  When I arrived at the time assigned to me, I had to wait for 25 mins. I was not offered a seat to wait, and had to stand. When the HR person appeared, they never even introduced themselves and their suit was covered in hairs and lint (very unprofessional) all they said was my name and ""Follow me"". When I arrived to their office, I was appalled. The dirt and clutter was unbelievable.  The HR person had an ""Attitude"" and it was obvious to me they were not a happy person and probably burnt out on their job.The job on line had said it was a part time position, but when I was talking with HR, I was told 6 days a week. No exceptions. I knew  I could not work in this type of atmosphere.   I now admire their employees even more for being able to smile and upbeat."
bad,"Pick n Save used to have good management when I started in 2002 when I started working there. They were super nice and would work with you. About 3 years later things got worse over my last 5 years there. Management came to me and told to increase another working day from 2 to 3 days. I told them it would be hard with me having another job. They seemed to have the attitude you're making you're other job first and Pick n Save 2nd. And like if you wont work another day we'll find someone else like you're a name and number. I had also worked Pick till 2010 for 7 years total and also worked some of the major holidays like 4th of July, Thanksgiving etc and that didn't seem to matter to them when they wanted me to increase my working days"
bad,"Kroger is a good place to work part-time, Decent store politics, but not much room to move up. They dont always work around your schedule, but they are the cheapest place around to get groceries."
bad,"Fast paced semi-supportive management friendly co-workers friendly customers work is challenging at times, easy at other times."
bad,I've worked at Kroger for over a year. I started out in the meat department but due to a lack of training I was forced to move to the front end which cut my future raises and benefits. After being a bagger for three months I began asking about other positions and was told several times that I would be moved to another department but that never happened. My hours got cut more and more as time went by because of corporate and there was nothing I could do about it. I only heard of the benefits but from what i here they are unheard of but they come out of your paycheck and I dont see how anyone makes enough there to afford it.
bad,"Job is like any other customer service job. Higher ups will anticipate you know things that they know you don't. Then, proceed to get mad when you stress you don't versus train you properly. The typical come and go is what any customer service job has. Minus the fact that management will throw a fit to give you anything more than the allotted 15 minute breaks; even getting those always seems like some kind of issue."
bad,"I got hired before the store opened in May.  I had no grocery experience and was hired as mid level, level 3.  that was because i worked for the federal govt and was responsible employee.  Majority of those people with no exp. would have been hired 4 or 5.  level 1-2 are management.  The store was a mess, produce what Marianos is known for, by far the worst management in that department.  They hired all these people, picked a location not big enough for their business, former dominicks store.  Location made money, but was not booming like locations where they built the building for Marianos like in VH/Libertyville.  So they cut employee hours to make a bigger profit margin for the store.  All those people basically quit, because lack of hours or none at all.  Produce was the worst department, second shift was a bunch of millennials or high school/college kids.  They had no supervision, so they pulled out produce, bullshitted around, did no work, did not put their stuff away and left a big mess fro third shift to put away just so they could do their work. First shift worked but, made the freezer a mess, so everyday you had to clean it up and reorganize again, just so you could do your work.  Doesnt matter how many times and how nicely you asked they would keep messing it up. Produce department is the hardest to manage since fruits and vegetables don't last forever.  Had four mangers over 2 months, kept hiring guys who decades with grocery experience, but had no clue of what they were doing.  They ordered way too much, to make it look like they knew what they were doing, but ended"
bad,"A typical work day here is busy. High-volume store. Friendly associates and customers. Customer service is key, no matter your job title."
bad,"A typical work day for me would be setting up anything that I would be using for the day, before beginning my task at hand. Some days I would have to work on the sales floor, and prepare the displays. A usual day for me would be me having to come in and be a juicer. My duty would be to provide customers with freshly squeezed juiced in a timely manner. I would have to often take customer request and special orders on how they wanted their juices made. If a customer needs assistance finding an item I will walk them over to the the item, I never point and direct. The main thing that I learned is that customers are always right no matter what, and that I always have to put them before anything else. Once that customer is taken care of; i will then go back to completing my duties for the day. I learned that good communication helps that day run a lot more smoothly. when my co-workers and i are on the same page and cooperate, then things get done a lot quicker.  The management can be very unprofessional. They tend to use unsafe language for any work environment. They usually have negative things to say about employees as well as other managers in the store. There is always a lot of micromanagement. The managers at Mariano's will take off work for consecutive weekends, which are the busiest days in this type of business, but they are unwilling to give employees days off that they request. My co-workers and i get along very well. The majority of the people that I work with get along and are very kind to one another. Everyone is very willing to help each other and give constructive criticism."
bad,"It seems to me that management has a hard time getting it together. They don't pay you nearly enough for all the hard work you have to do, they don't give hours to the people who have worked there a lot longer then the new people."
bad,"At this job I was very interactive wit people across various forms of backgrounds and ethnicity. I perform many different tasks all over in all departments from deli/bakery, front end cashier, produce, meat, to floral. I have assessed many talents from this establishment. I get along and work great with all employees. The hardest part of the job is having some demands that are difficult from costumers that are hard to please. The most enjoyable part of the job is expanding to be able to decorate cakes to becoming the floral lead."
bad,I did learn how to communicate with customers in a retail environment. Management was incosistant at times but seems to be okay.
bad,It was a nice place to work and enjoyed the welcome feeling when I was there not just to work but also to shop. Everyone was so nice and very helpful
bad,I have worked at Rulers for a year and we have gone through almost two managers and have had a few upper level workers walk out because of treatment. They won't let you work past thirty hours and if you do they cut back hours in the later weeks majorly. They won't give any benefits and if you call off even months ahead of time they won't give it to you. They want you to pick your job over family emergencies. They don't staff enough so we are always low on help. They also have messed up payroll more then once and try to blame it on us.
bad,My typical day at work have to be seeing the customers everyday. I've learned to be more patient with people. My co-workers are just my co-workers. There is no hard part of my job. The most enjoyable part of the job. Would have to be seeing some of the regular customers. Management could be a lot better than what they are.
bad,I was a grocery stacker which was very simple to do. Every now and then they would switch me to frozen. Management and co workers were easy to get along with and all were willing to help. But the hours were horrible and at the time I worked there minimum wage was $7. The highest of hours I got a week was 24 and the usual 8 to 12 a week. I got paid every week which was the only good thing but I did not expect much.
bad,They don't pay enough end of story. Its a fast paced job with cooperate trying to tell you how to do your job more than just letting you take care of your customers and growing the company.
bad,"I worked here on and off a few times, and I was generally dissapointed with the management. They were not respectful to employees, They picked few favorites and if you weren't one they made sure you knew. As for other co-workers, they were usually friendly. My position was a floral clerk/ designer. It was quite enjoyable. I loved the creativity of the position."
bad,"At the pharmacy we are trained to type prescriptions, count medications, release the medication, and give good customer service. At work I was entitled to do the technician schedule, audits, inventory maintenance, and supply orders. Everyone gets along just fine or at least we are professional about it. The hardest part of the job is explaining procedures to people that just don't want to understand what is being done. the best part of it is helping others getting their medications and helping them save money."
bad,"I worked at Kroger for about 2 years. It pays what you would expect. The jobs are easy, the customers where friendly, and the staff was usually nice. My only criticism would be scheduling conflicts. They say they can work around school for college students and the like, but I ended up leaving there when they made it clear how untrue that was."
bad,There is not much to tell. I was kind of a gopher who drove company trucks to assist with H.V.A.C. jobs in the Twin Cities area.
bad,"it's fast paced, it's alright. you're on your feet majority of the day"
bad,Management don't address issues until its too late and employees bicker or cry about every little thing and for what you deal with the pay isn't the best but if you can find something better highly recommend it
bad,taking orders cash handling cooking cleaning making sure our customers are always happy
bad,"I didn't mind working produce at Mariano's. It was mainly for a paycheck while I was working there in high school. I did however ask to be trained for higher positions after a year or two of working there. Nothing came of these requests. Management is also disorganized and show poor leadership qualities. They do not motivate their workers to do a better job. A lot of the times, especially when the store is busy, management (at least in my experience) crumbles under the pressure and makes it harder on the employees to do their jobs."
bad,"Bad pay, bad management, no flexible schedule. My least favorite job i have had."
bad,"Every department you work at gets paid the same unless you move up in the company. Which means, whether you are a courtesy clerk or a deli, produce, or meat clerk .... to start, you get paid close to, if not minimum wage. Only the cashiers make more and excel in the company faster than the rest. Unless your in high school or college, this job isn't for you ....."
bad,"Each day going into work seems like something new happened. I had a great relationship with all of my managers. I learned to always work hard as if someone is watching, when no one is. They all knew me by name and as a good worker. I got all with mostly all of my coworkers. Some of us got so close that we started hanging out outside of work. The hardest part of the job was working by myself and making sure the entire department was up to par for management in the morning. The most enjoyable part of the job are the relationships I can leave with"
bad,"i was going to school at the same time. I liked the rush of fast paced bagging at dinnertime and on saturdays. Some co-workers were friends, some were mentors, and there were those who talked with me about very key things in the break room... about the importance of moving my career ahead. After I helped a handicapped individual to her car, she asked me if I believed in the lord, I replied ""yes."" so she said a prayer of blessing, and whatever disgruntled mood had vanished instantly. It's good to help people. The reason for the review is my dog's pain and suffering with lymphoma, she passed. it had a bad affect on my mood I got overworked due to overstaffing."
bad,"•a typical day at work"
bad,You have to know a lot but you do not get paid for it. Also seems that anything goes wrong the techs are to blame.
bad,"Scheduled for 45 hours per week, was nothing to work 65+"
bad,The only thing I didn't like about Kroger was that we switched management team every 3 months. Every time we would get comfortable with a manager they would leave. My co-workers were the same way.
bad,I was the cook my jobs were to grill the hamburgers and help customers
bad,"The Hardest Part About This Job Was Cleaning Produce Because It Was Always A Nasty Environment To Be. The Only Great Thing I Did Like About This Job Is Working The Cash Register, That Was Also My First Time Learning It And It Is A Fun Experience To Me."
bad,"Management was kind, but the job was very tedious it was scanning items and cleaning all day everyday. I often had to work until one am only to come back the next day at noon. There really wasn't any opportunity for advancement at this location."
bad,I enjoy working at this store.  I feel safe and comfortable with my co workers and I enjoy the challenges working in pharmacy.
bad,"On a typical day of work, you immediately clock in as it tends to get busy or there aren't enough cashiers on the register. Time passes slowly or quickly depending on the hours and how busy it is. "
bad,Gas Kiosk - Confined to a small area that is required to be locked at all times. If you have to use the restroom you have to wait for someone from the store to come and relieve you so if your having any bowel issues call off cause they take their good old time getting to you. I was made to wait over an hour for a restroom break that I needed immediately!
bad,"Working in the receiving area of the store, I pretty much hide from the sales floor and do all of the behind the scenes work. Starting in the early morning till the time I leave, my receiving door is open a good 80% of the time no matter the weather, negative 50 degrees blowing 40mph winds in a blizzard or 109 degrees 56% humidity and the sun just blaring down on the asphalt. Deliveries are taken in all day long. Between deliveries I manage shrink loss prevention, vendor credits, in and out of store transfers, recalled items, out of codes, bailers and garbage disposal. One downside about my job is there is almost never a slow point during my work day, however that is also the best part. Being kept busy all day long keeps me occupied and makes the day fly by. There is also another negative, scheduling, they do not balance the work/ life aspect too well. Whether you are scheduled 26 hours one week, you can receive 40 the following week which makes money management difficult, especially if you have a lot of bills to pay."
bad,Did not enjoy the work for such little pay. Did enjoy the people I came in contact with.
bad,"Adjusted fuel prices"
bad,"Kroger is the 4th worst in the nation at paying its employees a fair compensation. Good job security. Great customers. Management and employees never on the same page. You would think having a union would better increase benefits, but the fact of the matter is, big union business is not what it used to be, and they do not fight the way they should. Only a good job for high school kids, or kids working through college. Should never be considered a desirable place to work as a career."
bad,"Everything is politics. You can move up in the company if your manager likes you.  You will stay where you are if they don't.  The Livonia store has horrible morale. They have things such as Cultural Council to try to boost it, but it is beyond repair there.  The current management is disengaged.  They sit in the office and only come out to yell.  They are completely unapproachable. The corporate programs are a joke.  They are meant to make life easier (such as key retailing), but they don't give you extra hours to make things right.  This store is very understaffed.  They only start hiring when the district manager or VP of operations make a comment about them being understaffed.  A department head's opinion is relatively worthless.  The benefits are great, however, if you have been there for 3+ years or are full time.  If you were hired after 2010, you get hardly any benefits.  If you were hired after 2013, don't count on a raise any time soon.  The turnover rate for the Company in general is fairly high.  The turnover rate for the  5 Mile in Livonia store is very low.  They have a hard time getting rid of people, and it makes life more stressful for the associates.  Pretty much unless you are a dept head or someone who has been with the company for more than 3 years, you're not going to enjoy going to work."
bad,"not a very good atmosphere to work in, rude people. management doesn't care about you just his customers."
bad,It was fun when there were people you knew. i learned how to manage my time and how to deal with many situations that may occur at work.
bad,The day was always started when we clocked in. No time for chit chat. I was a cashier so I had to stay there all of my shift. Unless we were slow & They wanted me to help put items on shelves. I learned Money handling & basic customer care. My managers were nice but they were not fair people. My co-workers were amazing. We could talk & learn things from one another. The hardest part was getting hours for the week. The most enjoyable was the customers. They always made my day enjoyable.
bad,"A typical day at work for me was enjoyable, I loved the job and the friendly customers, but on the other hand the co-workers and the management was very unprofessional and made the job very unpleasant, that's why I was not with the company long. My co-workers where more worried about gossiping about the customers and using unprofessional language and being rude to customers and not doing their jobs. The manager was also very rude and made everyone else feel unworthy. The most enjoyable part of my job was talking and getting to know the customers, a lot of customers knew me and always had very pleasant thing to say to me and how friendly, outgoing and motivated I was and how I kept very professional in the work area in hectic situations and always made sure their day was going fantastic."
bad,I think this is a good job for a  high school student. Paid weekly. Will work with hours
bad,"I was a cashier at Fred Meyer for several years.  I worked with some great people, loved my customers, and loved shopping there."
bad,"Bagged groceries , alot of the mangers were nice and encouraging, co workers were friendly ,"
bad,this job does not offer you much pay or much oppertunity to move up the ladder. and they only pay 7.40 u cant even make a living of that alone.
bad,"The work was fast-paced and kept you busy, but the management and some didn't seem to understand food and safety regulations. The coworkers you had were all very nice, as were the breaks you got."
bad,"a typical day at work entails servicing customers,clean the department, and logging information such as meat that has been processed as well as the temperature readings in the department.  you must also date and rotate product, package said product ,sort product ."
bad,I stock groceries to the shelf when they are low and help customers find items they are having trouble locating.
bad,With the position that I have at Kroger it is a good place to start out working if you are young or just looking for extra income.  
bad,They are well run company and show strong judgements in their key postions.Also still employed with Krogers
bad,good for high school students. work hours range from 4-8 hours. a lot of 4 hour shifts so if its a good distance drive for you prob not a good job option.
bad,"The job was good at the beginner i was a bagger/pushing carts then my bosses start telling me that i was gone get a raise.I start working harder so i can get it, but i never got it. So therefore i went to get a job at amazon, they told me i couldnt work 2 jobs so they let me go."
bad,"A typical day at work there involved a heavy amount of customer service and safe food handling. I was able to hone people skills while dealing with a wide variety of customers. The management was not up to par in my opinion, a lot of miscommunication and rule changing between managers."
bad,"management was bad, food and grocery was good. got along with most co workers."
bad,"In a typical day at work you will be unloading trucks, working merchandise to shelf, and handling customer complaints. The management is very demanding. The co-workers try not to do as much as they could since they are union workers. The hardest part of the job is that you must work weekends and holidays. The most enjoyable part of the job is the regular customers that you get to know."
bad,having worked for kroger in colorado it was easier to have a life outside of work. here 50 hrs a week seem to be expected but not needed if management was more organized
bad,Typically you were tired coming into work because it as difficult to sleep in the daytime when you weren't used to it. You lifted lots of heavey items at the same time trying to work fast to get the job done.
bad,"A typical day in Kroger consists of constant flow with business. You learn how to become involved with your customers and how to resolve negative situations. Management isn't exactly top notch, however they do an exceptional job to keep things a float. My fellow co-workers were all positive, dedicated workers with great personalities. Hardest part of the job working at Kroger is resolving customer complaints or deal with an unpleasant customer. However, the most enjoyable part of the job is being able to resolve that customers complaint and watch them leave in satisfactory."
bad,Assist manager in vendor relations
bad,its a good place but the management is no good they work you harder then you suppose to and want more
bad,"Depending on the department and management team of certain stores, certain jobs can be enjoyable. Some departments are very boring while others are lively and fast paced. Some management is not thoroughly trained while others surpass with flying colors. Co-workers are awesome which can be the best aspect of the job."
bad,Working independently and organizing my day according to what was priority. I learned basic accounting skills and how to be a leader. The management style was inconsistent with developing their employees for advancement. The hardest part of my job was seeing others advance with less experience. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with my coworkers and being an asset to the company.
bad,"The manager are understanding except for a few,"
bad,"Kroger pays their workers the bare minimum and always make sure to give you all the wrong hours. If you have been an employee for less than 5 years or do not hold a high up position then they make sure you either get to work anywhere between 0 hours a week to around 30. Very unstable environment with all the wrong policies and all the wrong ""issues"" in front first."
bad,Almost no kudos are given when assigned goals are met. Upper management is so focused that they forget what it takes to run a successful store and give unreasonable expectations.
bad,"Since I started working here, there has been a great deal of change with the company. Roundy's lost control of Mariano's, and Kroger swooped in. Now, with this change has come a great deal of superficial changes, and managerial ones. The superficial ones made everything look much more stale and corporate than it did before (which I personally don't really care about), while on the managerial side of things, they cracked down hard. Things went from:"
bad,"I didn’t enjoy my time there. I was treated with disrespect and would wait for the smallest reason to try and fire you. So in the end, I decided it was best to quit the company and pursue another job."
bad,"Hours are being cut in every department to ensure upper corporate gets paid more per shareholder request. Upper corporate in any banner store treats anyone below them like peasants. The usual inhumane garbage you see in the movies happens there. As far as store level, we're all just trying to make it by without someone from corporate coming in and firing us for right to work state reasons. Pharmacy isn't bad and people are people so the patients can be annoying but the pay is great for what you do. Since the hour cuts are full in effect, we all just work part time and get the morale beat out of us by upper corporate all the time. If things were different I would rate 4/5 but currently at a 1.5/5 if possible."
bad,"A typical day included Stocking Shelves, Unloading trucks, Breaking down pallets, Operating the box baler, Checking expiration dates, organizing the shelves. I learned how to organize and analyze products."
bad,"a typical work day consist of stocking shelves, serving customers, filling case, down stacking truck, and keeping cases filled. I learned how to cut meat. management does not care about the employees and take out there bad day on them. workplace is very diverse. the hardest part of the job is dealing with management.  the most enjoyable part of the job is the customers."
bad,Watch your back  Management will lie to you and run you into the ground. Never let you have enough hours to cover shifts.  Expect you to be there all the time and at the drop of a hat no matter if your off or across the country on vacation
bad,to be fair its not a bad job the management just need to be better and they really need to understand that people do not like having people and come in and try to tell them how to do a job they never done.
bad,Being employed there was not good nor did I enjoy my time there. Management was never understanding and did not let you find the opportunity for improvement.
bad,Company has no regard for it's employees! Had I not invested so many years Id be gone soon as I realized the company cared more about it's customers than it's employees. Great job for college kids but not something i wish to pursue as a career.
bad,this job was tiring just because you had to get carts in heat and comeback and bag groceries. they make you get baskets in all weather conditions i didnt like that.
bad,"Once you gain experience and years of service, they begin to look to weed you out if your salary becomes too high or your age becomes too old and if you have opinions on how to run the company effectively that go against what the company is looking for and this is not the place for you"
bad,"Super simple job but several factors make it harder than it needs to be. You have to be fast and accurate. That’s all well and good but in clicklist, you can barely do one without sacrificing the other. What gets doled out from Kroger corporate is that time and customer satisfaction are the only things that matter. No matter how well you do your job it’s never good enough for the powers that be."
bad,"If a high school or college student this could be for you. Not very flexible.Weekends is a must, Not many hours 15- 20 at most not willing to get full time.  Management treats you like a child. Forcing you to quit, change your hours when upset them only let you work one day a week til get on good side. Make promises and dont deliver. They will leave you hanging. Dont go!"
bad,"It’s not about the people anymore, it’s the numbers. It’s the metrics, it’s the petty and unethical behaviors that have become too much.  "
bad,"Poor management, they expect alot out of you for little pay. Terrible hours on night crew they change them constantly especially around the holidays and they keep you late on holiday mornings by about 3 hours or more usually"
bad,New corporate visions leads to decreased value in employees. The most recent corporate visions devalue employees and require more work from technicians with the same company pay. Requiring 10-12 hour days with no break and benefits constantly getting cut.
bad,Kroger has changed considerably over the years. It seems like they care less and less about the employees and more about making money. There are unrealistic ideas of how things should work
bad,"For starters, we have to put the little carts and the big carts in three rows but there is so much little carts that the manager wants it in one row and it'll block the door that cause the customers won't be able to go through. Plus a few courtesy clerks are not doing their job right like not taking their turn getting baskets or spent too much time in the restroom."
bad,This job is good for someone who is young  in high school and just needs money but it is not enjoyable at all. I have had many problems with them scheduling me when I have said I am unavailable.
bad,"While working here, I found it easy to to accomplish the tasks at hand, however, the other clerks didn’t think the same way. Some days I had to get rid of loads of cardboard and trash before I completed my work."
bad,"It's all union so no matter how hard you work, the slacker who was hired before you still gets preferential treatment. It's not a hard job, per se, but it's not very rewarding either. It seems to really only become a living if you decide to make it a life-long career."
bad,I worked in produce my job was to always have fresh fruits and vegetables  so that customer could access them if needed. also to stock a organic section at all times with fresh and organic items.
bad,"I love this job, it’s really easy to put cereal on a shelf. But management is changing and I get random hours and I would prefer to have a set schedule."
bad,Don’t recommend working for this company if you can help it. The management team is very unhelpful and there are a lot of hoops to jump through for daily activity.
bad,I Liked Working in Deli fast pace. Horrible Manager. Unprofessional Demeanor. In front of Customers. I reported her. And was Informed. They knew. About her behavior. From the Union  ..Nothing done.
bad,its ok it could be better a lot of people worry about the wrong thing the night shift is cooler better..................................................
bad,I was stuck working every day from 4 to 12 except Wednesday. i had to quit due to working 40+ hours with highschool and constantly getting random fees with my paycheck only getting around $110 biweekly. I didn't mind the job itself I hated the other management being childish.
bad,"While many managers meshed well with the employees, corporate rules and systems were very flawed which caused an extremely stressful work environment."
bad,"this company offers great benefits for fulltime associates. as a department manager you learn a lot about the store and the department, and the need to work with our without hours.  you realize that the Kroger company wants to make a number, and not as focused on the associate in the workplace as they preach."
bad,"My experience here was okay. I did feel that management was rather nit picky and uptight about things that aren’t serious especially for such a low position at such a non professional place. Management was often cranky and rude at times and the job was sometimes so busy for so many hours that one fifteen minute break, wasn’t enough to go through the entire long line with your food and also eat it. I left because I genuinely enjoyed my second job (cafe creekside) much better. They also were very not flexible with the students working there. I was 15 or 16 and was told not to get involved in certain things at school which I think is inappropriate and not worth the job considering that I didn’t really need it in the first place. One time I colored my hair a blueish color that was going to wash out, since I was in cosmetology school at the same time and though since it’s kroger and they are blue that they might be okay with it, instead the boss sent a lady to throw a hat at me while I was on register in front of a whole line of customers and yelled “dye your hair a natural color!” Which I thought was rude and uncalled for. They also made me throw away my frappe that I bought before work once because they wanted me to bring carts inside and thought that I wasn’t safe, even though it was 6 in the morning and the parking lot was almost empty. Also one time around Christmas I showed up early to have someone clock me in and I asked if I could come and leave early, my manager clocked me in and THEN said “no” and walked away, so not only did I have to work extra hours that I wasn’t scheduled"
bad,"To fully explain the extent of 4-5 years of prejudice, lack of teamwork, and constant belittlement, would take far too long to explain - so I won't get too far into the details."
bad,Some of the managers are abusive of there standing. Not very true to their word on “being friendly”.  I did not like the management at all. That’s the only bad thing to me.
bad,"I worked as a cashier at Kroger. The job is nothing special, of course, but it's not difficult either. Pretty average. My main problem was the management. The scheduler kept scheduling me to work Sunday mornings, even though I told her I couldn't come in until later in the day because I went to church in the mornings. And the managers don't support the employees at all when it comes to customers who complain. Even if the complaint was obviously ridiculous, they'll still reprimand the employee, and refuse to listen to their side of what happened! Perhaps things have changed since I worked there, but I don't know."
bad,This company ONLY cares about the bottom line. Employees are expendable and interchangeable. Price in one's work is discouraged and initiative is beaten down. the overall quality of the stores Kroger has acquired deteriorates shortly after take over. Such a disappointment.
bad,"I unloaded deliveries, stocked the store product, helped with customer service, made price changes, and did inventory. Th management was not engaged with its staff. Had a negative work culture. The hardest part was getting direction from management. The best part was being able to help people."
bad,"Cant depend on managers to do what they say, and they will generally do things out of spite. especially if you attempt to involve the union. Should be a much easier and light job but the managers don't know how to properly do the job or don't care."
bad,Most of my time working here was enjoyable but there were some days were management and customers would just stress you out and give you such a hard time for trying your best to do your job. The pay definitely is not worth it for the amount of disrespect and harassment you receive from customers on a daily basis just because they might have had a bad day.
bad,Kroger's does give you opportunities to advance within the company but the work environment has steadily be on the decline since I first started there years ago.
bad,I would come in and have a short meeting with my managers and then I would work until it was time for me to leave. I would usually work about 6 hours a day and have one break.
bad,I've been here too long. 10+ years too long! I'm very underappreciated so much to the point I don't really care about company needs anymore. I've worked myself down they core and it still isn't enough. I get.more done than my department manager.
bad,Didn't intend to quit but they had obvious favoritism with their employees so I am currently looking for new employment.They take things you say the wrong way. An expample: I was training someone to close they tried to pull me to a different devepartment and I told them she couldn't be alone. So they took that at me saying no to what they were asking.
bad,"In 12 years of being with the company I’ve watched it go from a nice place to work with fair pay and reasonable hours, to a place that runs a skeleton crew to save money and overworks the employees while they’re there."
bad,Working in the pharmacy for Kroger (in my district anyway) is a joke. Corporate simply DOES NOT CARE about their employees they will give you a big spiel about how the employees make the biggest difference but do nothing to actually help the employees. Every pharmacy in the district is under staffed because this multi million (billion?) dollar company does not offer technicians a decent starting pay where the competitors do. If by some miracle someone actually makes it through the 3 month long process of getting hired on and into the pharmacy the lack of proper on the job training scares anyone who has never worked in a pharmacy away because of how overwhelming the job is. Actual pharmacist help is minimal as well. The only bright side to this job were the people and some of the benefits.
bad,Terrible hrs .... Hard job .... U get an untouchable bonus .... Terrible job ungodly favoritism like crazy .... If u lie an act like u know wat ur doing u will move up
bad,Working for Kroger in produce you didn’t get a work and family life balance at all.  They played favorites and didn’t promote the right people. The way Kroger gives back to the community is very good but they are very hard on their associates.
bad,Each supervisor would tell you something different to do then tell you to not worry about what the last one said. Store manager that was there when I was there was a good guy. The district manager however was very condescending and would change things around to where it wouldn't make sense. She changed the truck schedule to where it came in during prime shopping hours instead of the morning so we could have the shelves fully stocked.
bad,"The pay is extremly low,  compaired to other companies.  Not near enough to kive off and take care of a family.  No teamwork with coworkers.  Lack of training."
bad,It is a stressful work environment. Store management is absolutely broken. They have little to no knowledge about how to run the store and manage their employees. They are severely understaffed in all departments; sometimes they'll grab people from other departments and have them help out during the busiest days and come back to only realize that they have little time left to make up from what they missed. Customer service is not really good at all. Been working here for 6 years now and nothing has improved.
bad,Always fun and lively place. Fresh new faces and new customers of different sizes and races. Never get bored always on your feet and New products and fresh produce
bad,They do not care about you. Will find someone to replace you quickly and put so much stress on you. They only care about money and not about the employees.
bad,There is not enough hours Nor money to want a career with Krogers it was 9.00 dollars per hour and basically 20 hours a week not enough to pay a car note. No fair Union representation and they take union dues for what?
bad,no bonuses or early raises offered. do not care about your well being or outside of work life. wants to work you hard but no overtime without punishment. most managers play favorites.
bad,I was paid 10 cents over minimum wage (7.35/hr) break are 15 minutes and you get 2 per 6hr shifts. it was a learning experience  and I worked there from may to august
bad,Kroger isnt a terrible place to work if you are young and are willing to do the job. Most of the management there does not care as long as a warm body is holding the place.
bad,"Constantly changing the rules around the store. They like to pick their favorites, and if you do something they don’t like, they make sure you know what you did was wrong. Very hard to feel any type of appreciation around there for any extra hard work you did. Extremely draining for little pay."
bad,Didn’t enjoy working at fuel department  because there are a lot of people that come there and try to scam with stolen pre paid cards and if the is a gas spill you have to clean it up that gets on my nerves very dangerous working at Fuel Department
bad,the pay did not allow me to pay for any of my needs and due to the union i could not advance quickly or how i wanted. i worked the dairy department which was cold and largely manual labor.
bad,I wish that I could say better about this company but I really cannnot. I enjoy the ability to occasionally work alone when I have it if only to get away from other beleaguered and often times irritable coworkers. The low pay and even lower standards for employee behavior with its high levels of resignations are indicative of the company’s most glaring flaws. The managers are mostly lazy to be honest with some few exceptions rather than the rule.
bad,"Working at Kroger can be an amazing experience in the beginning.  The people are great and the workload is easily manageable.  However, if you stay long enough you will see Supervisors and Managers behave unprofessionally.  Certain Supervisors will conspire with Management to get rid of good employees over petty disagreements.  One such employee was accused of stealing coffee when they only drink water.  Another was accused of stealing coupons for items that they don't buy.  Yet another was forced to resign for being late while caring for their sick mother and child.  Needless to say, I would not recommend working at Kroger for any length of time."
bad,"I only worked for about two weeks. There was NO type of orientation other than watching videos for 1 hr and a store tour. No one ever told us the do's and don'ts of store regulations.  I never knew that I always have to work for at least 4 hrs,  until one day when I went to work, having no real schedule, they called and said come to work from 12:30 to 9 I told the HR girl I did not know I was scheduled no one called but I would work from 12:30 to 4..Got to work and the front end supervisor said you need a lunch cause your staying late I said no I told the HR girl I have to leave at 4, she yelled at me at the register in front of all the people...Said heaven forbid we interfere with something at home. She said UNION requires you to do at least 4 hr shifts..I left at 4:30.....Another day, I am at the register, my daughter brought her basket through my line, the same supervisor was bagging for me and I said.... Id like you to meet my daughter...AGAIN she began with waving the finger saying...NO NO NO  you cannot wait on family that is an action that could get you fired. And again she did it in front of my line and my daughter....I said  HOW IS SOMEONE TO KNOW THAT WHEN NOONE TELLS YOU..I left that evening... was scheduled again the next 4 days 12:30-9:00 pm  I called the next morning and quit.  "
bad,Kroger use to be the place to work for but not now. With the industry being rocked by amazon Kroger is trying to change and it may not be for the better. Management is too green to be really effective in this time of change to their employees.
bad,"I was went into work and did my job, would even pick up other peoples slack without a problem. I loved working with my work crew in the bakery. I would have remained there if the management was better and have a career advancement and environment."
bad,Part time employees that are in school do not get paid well. Full time employees do have a chance for advancement. Felt like the managers werent the best and the store was ran poorly. Learned good team skills and customer service skills
bad,"No matter how motivated you are to get your job done, its never finished and you will feel like you accomplished nothing when the day is over. The most enjoyable part of the job is when its time to go home and you realize that you survived another day."
bad,"I was a cashier and courtesy clerk, I wished the register and when I didn't have any customers I would go out side and get baskets on my own with the permission of the GM to do this at random when needed."
bad,"The Kroger I worked at had an almost toxic work environment. Floor managers rotated on an almost monthly basis, so there was very little time to become acquainted with them. On top of that, many were rude and out-right dismissive of the employees, leading to a large amount of turnover by the workers. Most quit because of their treatment there."
bad,"I worked at the Kroger in Wylie, and it was a mess. The management loosely follow the rules, and do not have any sort of management skills. They were unreasonable and we were always behind on work due to their lack of skills to manage a team."
bad,"Schedule changes too often, not enough hours or pay. The top pay is very low. Customers are very rude more times than not. They schedule you late nights and then early mornings the next day."
bad,"You start your shift by clocking into your station, set up and wait until you have your first customer. Then within an hour is your first break, then lunch and finally your last break. You work until you are done with your last customer, then clock out and finally head home."
bad,On your feet and Constantly moving provided me with an 8 hour workout. Best shape of my life. Had a Starbucks inside so I was able to get a raspberry mocha for breakfast.
bad,"Typical day at work was fun. Busy days and holiday times are stressful. I learned many great skills and things such as customer service, handling displease customers and time management. Management is mediocre. Scheduling work times can be difficult. The hardest part has to be the supervising role."
bad,I didn't gain any skills to help me further my career. Management during my time working here was inconsistent. The backroom was very dirty and unorganized.
bad,"Lack of communication skill are over whelming and , there's no team work . There's always something to do, if you are finished with your department....."
bad,"With a force force that is predominately high school and college goers, there was always a problem of having to manage a workforce that was always more interested in checking their phones and being social butterflies than taking care of the customers.There were often times when I sat down with the store manager at the time and we came to the conclusion of 'It is what it is.' I am thankful that I learned a lot of the lessons I did at Kroger as early as I did and that's all I can pass on; It is an entry level job and If you feel like sticking it out for as long as I did or longer, there is hope. Just be ready to hold out for the long haul."
bad,"·	The first year of employment working with customers and front-end care, after 3 months, promoted to meat clerk. Duties including excellent customer service, knowledge of different types of product, safe handling, and prevention of cross-contamination, daily truck delivery, knowledge of first in and first out. Experienced in power jack and hand jack equipment. Knowledge of cubing machines, wrapping and weighing stations. Knowledge of meat cutting machines such as; care, sanitizing, and cleaning."
bad,I only worked here for a week. It was horrible. The only training you receive is on a computer. They give you no hands on training and they just throw you out on the floor and expect you to know how to do everything.
bad,"If your not busy there is not much or enough to do, hours and pay is low. Management is lenient, the people you work with are friendly but none of this is worth the pay or hours."
bad,nothing really to say its a hard job you have to smile all the time it can get boring and if your someone who zones out a lot i wouldnt do the frontend cashier job
bad,"Management will tell you something is okay, then next thing you know store management writes you up and department managers will deny any involvement. Store management gossips to other employees and managers about workers. It's very difficult to work in such a cut throat environment. Employees are unvalued and scare tactics are constantly being use to ensure job performance. Extremely busy store and it seems like less cashiers are open and more work is put on the workers they have working!"
bad,"I enjoyed this job for maybe a month and then things started going downhill. It caused major depression and stress. The staff I had to work with were rude and always acted like they were better than you."
bad,"If there is one thing I learned while working at Kroger, it was that most people aren't going to do what is needed. Most of the time it is one or two people actually doing the work. Some are there for the benefits, others just tag along for the summer paychecks. It seems that Kroger is very ignorant about why they have a very high turnover rate. The hours were a hit or miss. Some days were nice and calm while others were insanely fast-paced and tiring. You get paid the same either way. Actually, you get paid the same no matter what. This could be your 5th year working, and you could be on the same pay scale as a new hire. Yeah, there is a bonus check and the 6 months 10 cent raise... It definitely doesn't balance out. Would not recommend to anyone other than a high school student or maybe college. Nothing more."
bad,Take need better management . It wasn’t too bead but they need more communication skills with the employees and better understanding of the employees school schedule
bad,"Poor management for overnight they have constant turn over with employees they will work for your schedule somewhat , the conditions of the backroom equipment and freezer make the job harder than it should be. Stay away from anything overnight at this location."
bad,"Low pay, store manager is overbearing, way too much red tape and bureaucracy for a grocery store. Management 9 times out of 10 has only worked one department in the store, but still tries to insist they know more about the work being done than those who do it almost every day. The only way you can get close to 40 hours, or even 35, is to wait for someone to go on vacation or to get sick. And $7.65 is EXPERIENCE pay? Wow, Kroger. A whole $3 extra per week! Company metaphorically spits in its employees faces constantly, as do management. Would not reccomend to anyone unless they are desperate."
bad,"Work/life balance is terrible. Shifts are typically 7A-5P, 1P-11P, 8A-6P, 9A-7P or 10A-8P. The first two are opening and closing shifts and you typically get 2 of each a week and one mid shift a week.  Unless your store manager wants, then you close 4-5 nights a week.  You also can expect to work until 11pm and live an hour or more away(sometimes in a different time zone) and be scheduled back at 7A.  The problem lies in the fact that you can never leave on time and being asked to come in early or work a 6th day is way to common.  Kroger is very top heavy and if anyone with even the least impressive title might be in the area you are forced to work extra.  They will ask you to move vacations that have been approved and planned 6-8 months in advance and get mad you if you say no.  They pay was fair and the vacation policy is generous but for what you have to put up with, it's not worth it.  I get sent text, get called or emailed almost everyday I'm off.  As a assistant manger you will work every holiday, even Christmas.  I was suddenly and randomly moved vert far from my house(about an hour drive one way) and was offered no additional pay or time off to make up for it.  You are generally treated with disrespect from customers, subordinates and superiors."
bad,"Taking on the role of a deli clerk was fun, I just didn’t have any help . I would always work by myself. Mainly every night I closed by myself an it consisted of many things that I couldn’t get done alone an still attend to my customers, but over all it’s a good company"
bad,"As a first job, Fry's wasn't the career I was looking to get into. The hours were spotty at best and didn't allow for much choice for someone who starts there right away. Previous management was shortly replaced a few months after I started in my department, but the replacement was leaps and bounds above the previous individual. I would recommend this job as a stepping stone into other career paths, as the process to move up into higher positions is bureaucratic at best. Even with several college degrees, you will start at the bottom with minimum wage."
bad,Management was hard to deal with being that there were almost always at least 4 different managers asking of different things at any given time along with shift leaders doing the same. Worked with a lot of fun people but the enviroment was strict and restricted many posibilities for positive qualities.
bad,"Kroger was a ok experience great for gain experience to talk with people but the pay sucked especially for what we do there we work hard and are one of the lowest paid stores"
bad,Stocking shelves helping customers and general cleaning makes up the bulk of the work on any given day. Environment with co-workers is laid back. The stress of every day goals are very high as there is not much time or enough people to do them.
bad,"I work in the meat department. My need for a fulltime income and also my decent coworkers are the only reasons I stayed for so long. Here's why I cry after nearly every shift:"
bad,Too much favoritism that would be the biggest issue if you’re working your butt off 24 seven or eight hours a day for 40 hours a week and that’s my vi
bad,"I worked at Kroger part-time as a ClickList attendant/picker. Since it was a new department, there were many growing pains. We started with not nearly enough employees so we were running around like chickens with their heads cut off. My supervisor was terrible with scheduling and would schedule too many people on our slow days, not enough on our busy days, or would schedule us outside of our available hours. Too many of the employees were slow and could not keep up to speed with the work. I enjoyed talking with employees from other departments but not the ones in mine. Perhaps things have improved with the department as it grew but for me it did not work out."
bad,"A typical day at work is busy. Not enough associates  and and cashiers. Employees call off a lot."
bad,"Honestly it's not much better than a high-school or college part time job. I mean it wasn't a terrible environment, but it's not the greatest place ever."
bad,Every year they have a survey that all associates must take that they claim they use the data on to improve the workplace. I have seen no changes in the time that I've been there. In fact i believe that things have gotten worse. They continue to cut our hours even though we fail to keep enough registers open on a daily basis. The company does not provide enough hours to distribute in order for us to have an effective work day.
bad,"It was time to move. Didn't want to leave but the store manager treated it as a high school, and it may have been due to the fact that they employ minors. With that being said it would seem as if he'd forget that I am not a child and it would feel almost condescending and I called him out on it."
bad,A typical day at work is very demanding but mentally and physically when your trying to cram 16 to 20 hours worth of work in a 8 hour shift. I learned working in retail is very stressful. Our core management within the store is good the corporate level is a whole different ball game. The work place culture is family oriented. The hardest part of the job is getting little to no help. The most enjoyable part is the employees and the customers.
bad,"Management will always give you unachievable goals."
bad,"My job requires me to run backstock daily and put up one or two grocery orders. That is on top of conditioning and facing the asiles. Most nights there are only 4-5 of us for 12 asiles, some of which take a while to condition and face. New management is also becoming much more assertive when unable to complete order and run backstock. For only $10/hr it is too much at times."
bad,"I worked hard to ensure the store was as it was suppose to be and got no recognition and was treated as if I did nothing. Gossiped about behind my back and had roomers spread to downplay my hard work and praise ""friends"" who did nothing but stand around and eat. Extreme favoritism and only personal favorite employees are recognized and rewarded. Single handedly ran store, even after months of understaffing complaints, only to be told I wasn't doing enough"
bad,"Kroger promotes itself and its work environment as family oriented. While I have had managers and supervisors who try to foster such an environment, not all managers and stores succeed. There is a lack of support in many areas. There is a lot of “this is your job, go do it”without adequate training or hours for the job. In certain departments,the work load and job duties are not fairly compensated."
bad,"Kroger is a good first job. It's the one you get fired from. If you don't get fired it is thirty years of grind. Most of the folks I worked with were playing the disability game. On your feet, on concrete all day listening to people complain."
bad,"Kroger requires a salvia test. Low pay, they go off how much experience you have. Each year is like .25 cents more. Not very busy. Have to use knifes and cut meats"
bad,The job itself was fine and the pay was OK. The issues I had with Korger was working late evening shifts with a 17 year supervisor who would take their friends and leave the front end for hours leaving me alone even at busy times and when I needed a lunch or break. Often could not find the supervisor.
bad,"Poor compensation and company culture. Is not a good company to start a career with, at least at the store level. There is some potential in the management program."
bad,"Worked with the company for 12 and a half years, was always told how I would get a 'full time position' but never saw the light of day for that ever happening. Department head was amazing and a very nice person, as well as a few other associates I had to work with but overall Store Management was always hounding your back and looking over your shoulder as if you didn't have nothing to do. Would work my tail off only to get talked badly about behind my back by my department backup who didn't do as much work as me or other people but thought it would be fun to say how much of a worthless worker some people are in the department...not a very fun place when it's full of so much drama."
bad,"Management was not the greatest, but it could have been worse. Managers did tend to like me because I am a very cooperative employee with great customer service."
bad,"As a produce clerk in my time here, a typical day for me included unloading produce/floral trucks, stocking and rotating items on the floor, doing mark-downs, and assisting customers in the floral department. Truthfully, there is not much I took away from this job, other than the fact that the days were long and stressful at times. Management was rather poor, and they expect quite a lot from employees with very low pay. As a result, workplace culture was also quite poor. There were only a handful of people that I met in my time there that maintained positivity through the stress of the job. The hardest part of my job was the physical demand- lifting boxes of produce for most of the day that often weighed 30 or 40 pounds, sometimes more than that. It became exhausting very quickly. The only enjoyable part of this job were the handful of people that I met here that were positive and friendly."
bad,The pay is a little low.Maybe a job for a teen for extra money.It is very busy at kroger.Sometimes their was never enough bagging people or cashiers working.
bad,not a good place to work unless you really need a job. Management is really bad and some coworkers don't do their job so your doing more work than expected
bad,"working at starbucks , it is busy but at certain hours of the days, during the remaining hours it is slow and you have to keep yourself busy. Management team they reassure you that they do their part but they don't communicate effectively with the employees, hardest part of the job honestly is just getting through the day. Most enjoyable part would have to be taking a break and enjoying the lunch period."
bad,"kroger is big and has lots of jobs, they're everywhere so transferring is usually not a problem if needed. but it's retail grocery. you know what to expect, especially as managers can change from store to store."
bad,"Kroger is ok to work with when in high school but in college or tech school can be very stressful   to much work wanted to be done with little pay and lack of people and poor management , its to much for one or two people to do sometimes during the week."
bad,A LOT OF WORK for little money. Was a bagger and hated every moment of it. Very negative work environment. Managers were terrible and very ungrateful for the amount of work we did.
bad,working here you dont get paid a lot. and they dont give you a raise for doing accounting or becoming a supervisor. very easily to advance but they just dont pay you for it
bad,"Kroger was pretty decent for the most part but overall every one there was fake and talked about each other. You pretty much have to learn for yourself because most of the associates were rude and lazy. Management was not good. I only liked one manager, the other told me he would terminate me on spot just because I wanted to go home one weekend and I dont live in the area."
bad,Working with people that have been with the company for 20 years or more is not a positive thing. Change is slow and does not happen often. Technology is outdated.
bad,"I worked in the pricing department and executive assistant for a total of 5 years. I was in college and working part time. This is a great option for those wanting to get into marketing and distribution career; and or logistics data entry position.."
bad,"Don't work there if you are a minor, you will make literally no money, pay union dues, and be very stressed out about your low-paying un-fun job that you want to quit."
bad,"Preach opportunity but not the case.  Opportunities are granted first to those next in the ""que"" and not based on experience.  Management not Leadership tends to bend or change the rules based on friendships not policies.  Although lower in management rank, the facility is steered by the ""good ole boys"" brought in from Layton, Utah and not by the Senior managers."
bad,"If had to say about Kroger for my first few months, it would be ""This is all right"". Now, I'm doing twice as more and its only been a year and a half and I am making only a dime more when I started while someone who walked in half a year ago is making $2 more and have no retail experience and does less than I do. Or even a new cashier comes in and gets $10, while I'm stocking shelves and running errands for my department and still get minimum wage plus a dime. Work here if you're young and still in high school, but get out and look for better opportunities when you're over 18. In addition, don't go to Kroger if you're older than 18. Save your time with other stores that will pays well."
bad,"So the typical work day at Kroger's Clicklist is a stressful, but lay back sort of way. They will seem nice and talk very supportive towards you, but other than that it's just words not actions. They take little care in keeping or supporting any of their employees long term."
bad,"Kroger is all about the money, that means the customer can do and say whatever they please. I was almost fired, as a department manager, because a high spending customer called corporate for making him follow a policy Kroger put in place."
bad,It was really frustrating couldn’t give the hours I needed in order to sustain living a decent life so I ultimately ended up picking a different career choice
bad,"Kroger is a great job for a high schooler or someone for that's working through college, not anything that someone should do permanently.  Despite all of the work that the employees do, they're underpaid and sometimes mistreated."
bad,"It was an okay work environment, the management wasn’t always the best although. They didn’t really consider that people had lives outside of the workplace."
bad,"Working at Kroger is not a fun experience. It's definitely a first/in-between-jobs job, as there's no room for advancement while working here. The manager in the deli plays favorites and takes their frustrations out on the employee's hours, giving them less hours if the clerks get on their nerve. If something is broken in the deli, the management of Kroger takes a very long time to get around to fix it. Working the closing shift, as that's the only shift I can work with my current schedule and transportation, a lot of weight gets put on your shoulders because you're the last one there during the day, so the fault is put on you if something's not done or done right. The employees have a lot of drama between them and it only adds to the stress. All in all, Kroger is not a good place to work for an extended period of time, yet the managers have no idea why the turnover rate is so short."
bad,"It was a ghetto and unprofessional work environment, with low pay, and managers trying to get over on employees by threatening to fire them if they did not want to stay over. There were times people were forced to stay way beyond 8 hrs."
bad,"Honestly like any job you may or may not hate it. But with the management cycle it's hard to have a store ran correctly when there's a lack in proficiency, lack of enforcing rules onto customers, no since of urgency when customers need help. I wouldn't recommend working here for long if your a college student, it's extra stress for not enough pay."
bad,"I was wkyeed at Kroger for 5 years and very disrespectful manager, no appreciation no respect! They take advantage of all their employees and if you  stand up for yourself woatchbjyt they will fire you and write you up for whatever that can. Management at 613 is the worst!!!"
bad,Didn’t really like this job it chill for a lul untill they had me working harder then others also the favoritism is what really pulled me away from the company
bad,"When Kroger took over Fred Meyer many things changed Managers were always unhappy and so was the front end staff. I had the position of KPF and we went through 2 corporate managers within months, it tore our team apart. Many stay only because they have many years invested in Fred Meyer, but would leave in minute if something else came up."
bad,the managers at the Kroger I worked at would always yell at their employees and overworked the little staff that they had. I was only sixteen and was being scheduled for forty hours a week as a supervisor. They don't care about their people
bad,All they want you to do is one job winch usually meant fore me to stand in one place for 8 hoers and checking people out its boring repetitive and dosn't pay that will.
bad,The culture has changed and not for the good.  It isn't fun anymore and there is a lack of coaching and developing.  It appears everyone is only looking out for themselves.
bad,"Started off fun and exciting except for the fact that I was basically thrown into the mix without any training. After two week, I was grilled a bit about my speed and then was made fun while I was in the next aisle stocking. The managers were making fun of me due to a mistake I made and was not made aware of it until they decided to shout it out while stocking a missing product in that area. I also missed a day due to a pinched nerve which hindered my ability to walk so I unfortuantely had to call in. I had the next two days off after that to rest and then came to see that my schedule for next week was reduced to 1 day for the week. When I spoke to the manager, he deemed me as ""unreliable"" since I missed a day and only gives hours to those he thinks can work."
bad,"Kroger would not be a bad place to work for if they paid a decent wage. And the upper Management had a clue as to what was going on. I can not speak of course for all stores but the store I worked at was unorganized, lacked motivation, and basically made me hate working there."
bad,Unless your a kid in junior high looking for employment . Krogers is not for you. They start you off at 8 dollars depending on position.  I work there for a short period of time. then I left.
bad,Kroger needs to increase the pay if they want to keep people or good workers for that matter. Walmart even pays their employees better now. It's time Kroger stepped it up.
bad,"The pay is very low, but the benefits are very good. Health insurance is very good and is very cheap. Management is pretty incompetent and will not take responsibility for anything."
bad,"The company itself is pretty alright to work for, but the management at my store was the worst that I have ever worked with. I don't know anyone who still works there that enjoys their job, but it pays more than nearly any other retail type job in the area."
bad,it was not a good place to work. I did not enjoy my time there. i never had a consistent schedule. i liked the managers and supervisors. there were some i disliked. i got along with the coworkers well. if you dont like dealing with idiot customers dont work here.
bad,"A typical day at work; You get yelled at by customers because they're coupons did not work. You get yelled at by customers because the self checkout machines are ""too slow"". You try to talk to your supervisors and they blow you off. Its like highschool but at a job. Always drama, bad pay. My pay was reduced due to ""Glitch in the system"". Store Managers/Supervisors will not let you transfer to another store."
bad,"When I got hired at Kroger I was working for The Honey Baked Ham Company out of  Beckley, doing a temporary job passing out samples. One of the managers came over and talked to me one day and I ask about a job and was hired. The coworkers I had there were nice people for the most part. The managers were nice and a couple of them would step in and help when needed."
bad,"There was no team effort.. Hostile environment. Lack of training."
bad,"A typical day depends on the day . Sundays seem to be more fast paced and stressful than weekdays. Management, now that depends on the manager. Some are great, others not so great. This may also depend on who is asked.  Different employees have different opinions. The hardest part of the job is dealing with upset customers. The most enjoyable part is interacting with workers and customers(who are not upset)."
bad,"Possibly a good first job, but every adult I have spoken to says the same thing. They can't pay their bills on this pay. It's ridiculous. Our store manager is great! But there is a lack of communication amongst the managers and most departments are poorly ran. The training is pretty much throwing you to the wolves and hoping you survive."
bad,"A typical day at work for me is usually hectic. Mostly every shift I work we are under-staffed. Management shows poor examples of how to act inside of a workplace. The workplace is very cultural but the hardest part of my job is not having someone on my team (more people) to satisfy costumers. Work is never a pleasure when entering,"
bad,"Company is horrible to LGBT and PoC employee's. The managers and supervisors are great, but if you are a minority... good luck getting promoted! They will turn you down every time."
bad,No good place at all. management will drive you crazy and be real rude to you. the General manager will micro manager and make you feel very uncomfortable
bad,people would call off all the time. I guess people don't have bills to pay and dont need to show up for work.  I was always there on time and had to fill in
bad,"kroger is not a bad place to work the place itself is very friendly and fresh the people that manage the placement of kroger is really the problem (front in wise) managers made some baggers feel like they were worthless and baggers would always leave kroger continuously. i personally experienced hard times with my management as well to the point i just really couldn't take it , it became unhealthy for my well being so i had to take myself out of that situation"
bad,"Kroger is full of great people. The majority stay with the company because of benefits. But it takes entry level people so long to get into a full time position, that very few stay.  Most can't make enough money to survive and have to find employment elsewhere. In return this places a huge stress on tenured associates because the same amount of work is expected with low staff and usually no overtime allowed. Great opportunities if you know the right people. Work/life balance could definitely use some help. Not consistent in every store. Just depends on management."
bad,"It was okay place to work for part time- not full time, I would say most time it was steady paced. There is not a lot of help due to attrition. They treat customer very well employees not so much,"
bad,It is not the best place to work but it is not the worst either. The management is alright. They did not pay me for all the hours I worked one week and that was kind of what put me over the edge.
bad,"The mobile market is a one of a kind position run in only one store so it is actually impossible to apply to. Kroger and Roundy's hardly seem to be actually invested in the program. As far as working in an actual store, it is more based off of which store and which position you are seeking to work at that will make a difference. If the managers do not hold all of their workers accountable, more often than not it becomes the duty of a select few in each department to keep their department afloat. It appears that as long as you show up on time and do not steal anything, security is fairly set. Moving up in the business depends on how long you wish to work with them, and how much extra work you want to do to prove to them you want to move up."
bad,I didn't learn a lot here from others but through my own struggles was able to pull everything I could from there. I was constantly expected to work multiple departments even though I was only hired and paid for one and I am not the only person who is put through this struggle. I feel like there should be a level of professionalism that keeps people working and completing their tasks within the allotted time.
bad,"I worked at five different locations with this titles and had varying experiences. However most locations expected us to pick up extra work due to  staffing problems with no extra compensation or intent on replacing the missing staff members. Also there was normally a huge lack of communication between upper and lower (us) management."
bad,No life/work balance. All about work. Being salary means you do not have much of a life and the expectations are too demanding and have little resources to be successful.
bad,It is too big of a company to make any good changes. I have had both of my fryers break and it has been that way for months. I've been frying chicken with one broken fryer. They can't or won't keep enough people hired to properly run the deli. I had to run the whole deli by myself last night from 5 pm to 10 pm.
bad,"Although had friends to work with, my manager was great, some people were unprofessional, had unrealistic expectations, made for work to be very stressful and aggravating, some previous management did not treat employees well at all"
bad,"typical days at work are cold and brutal"
bad,Slipped a disc in my lower back from slipping on ice on the freezer floor a week into working here. The week I did work was treacherous and stressful. They have the highest turnover rate I have ever seen and don't do much to reward you. Starting pay changed from 12.25/hr to 15.50/hr in 2014 because too many were leaving the company.
bad,If store was managed and properly cleaned it would have been a decent place to Work Management does not know what's going on from one shift to the next employees do what they choose when they choose to do so would not recommend Kroger's on West Washington to anybody to work at
bad,"I just don't like it for me."
bad,You work 10hour to 12hour days. There is a bunch of pressure to out do other competitor. There is a lot of confusion between upper management and no career direction
bad,"They expect the world from you but don't give you what you need to succeed. And that's somehow your fault. They under staff the front end and expect you to make it work yet get mad about check line wait time. If i don't have the cashiers, customers are going to wait in lines duhh!"
bad,"Day-to-day involves bagging groceries, restocking, cleaning, or bringing in shopping carts."
bad,"For a company like Kroger, getting paid $8, was very low since the job was not easy at all. its hard to pay home bills with such an amount of money."
bad,"horrible place to work at, unless this was your last place to work. coworkers are rude and obnoxious, management was poor, always said one thing and did the other."
bad,as a stock clerk its horrible company been with the company 8 yrs managers are very disrespectful they make the job harder than it is there unorganized  never prepared.
bad,"I have been working in customer service at Kroger for about 5 years. I have learned a lot of patience, time management, punctuality, and social skills. I love my direct managers at the store, but higher management and corporate is a different story. I feel as though they don't value their employees. The pay is very low, and the benefits are mediocre. However, I love my coworkers and the daily processes of the job themselves."
bad,"I enjoy working with the people and helping the customers, but the minimum wage pay for employees are too low for what the company expects out of them."
bad,"a typical day you will have atleast 100-200 customers."
bad,The upper management of the company is not together at all. The store director at the South Loop location is terrible. He does not know how to talk to people. He is an open racist and he will degrade his employees and talk about them to other people.
bad,"It's a good place to work, but I would not recommend staying there to long. The pay is not worth it and management is horrible.  I just feel like they need to up the pay and get more help for the workers"
bad,Never understood why Krogers had such a high turnover after working for them I still dealt with everything that went on I loved my job I guess it's just the public I like working for very few stores keep employees for very long times the store I worked at had a hundred and 20% turn around why is that I now know
bad,"Yuck, do not apply. I worked here for 4 years. Managers are terrible and scheduling is bad too. The only department that seems to be worthy is the Home Department."
bad,"I worked at this job part time, I started out as a bagger for about a month and then moved to fuel technician and that job was a lot more fun and exciting in a sense then bagger, I did enjoy that position and worked well with my manager and co-workers. I think the hardest part of that job was not getting any real life experience when it came time to deal with real emergencies life fuel leaks etc. Was trained to handle it but I think training is not enough, it helps but that's it."
bad,"Would not work here again. The location I worked at was a circus..."
bad,"I found the work place to be ""dog eat dog"" There were a lot of cliques, and those that didn't get a long with the clique had there time at work hard and demeaning. "
bad,A typical day working at Ralph's was very stressful at times . I learned how to interact with people in a great way i did love my job at times but also did not. I had a some great management who helped me out a lot and pushed me to be the best i could be. I would have to say the hardest part of this job was the holidays  when we have a store full of people and lines as far as the eyes could see. The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with the different people that came in the store.
bad,"I did not really enjoy doing this job. It was a lot of hard labor in all kinds of weather. It involved working with customers who were frequently disrespectful, management who wasn't always helpful, dealing with some quite disgusting bathroom situations, and working in a dark, poorly lit parking lot very late in the evening in a parking lot on a very busy street."
bad,"This company is, sadly, a sinking ship and there doesn't appear to be any hope for better days on the horizon. Avoid unless no other options are available."
bad,It was terrible job place. They work their employee very hard and pay very less. I must say they give opportunity to everyone to get their first job started.
bad,"fun work place to be around all my coworkers were real nice always helping out, one thing I hated that was the only one working on my shift even though I had two other people on the schedule I always showed up on time and no one else ever came into work."
bad,The job I had at Kroger in Hinton West Virginia was a mediocre job. The downsides to working with Kroger was that there was not enough work for as many employees as were employed.
bad,"Don't work at north Huntington Indiana Owens/ Kroger! The store manager is a major jerk! He's  insulting, belittling, demeaning, arrogant, lazy, narcissistic... I could go on."
bad,"This company no longer fulfills my basic needs as an employee, and this had led to me trying to find a new job as quickly as possible. I do not feel like this company values its employees."
bad,"Kroger was fun because I learned a new department. I worked in the bakery and learned a lot of new things, got to work with a few good people, and made a few good friends there. I also worked in the Starbucks and that was fun too. Management did not seem to really care about certain employees and was pretty unprofessional. Always talked to employees about other employees and I found it disrespectful. Didn't get much gratitude for the hard work you put in and made it kind of unpleasant to work there. Pay is also not competitive as they falsely advertise..."
bad,"Learn to:"
bad,"Although pay is enough to make you stay, the management needs work. Often you will work 6 to 8 days straight, and usually 9 to 10 hour days. It is strenuous work in some departments and hard on your body."
bad,"The job is fine, it is just super repetitive and was not for me. I love working in customer service though, I just do not like bagging groceries and standing forever, plus lunches were super short and unpaid. In addition, new employees (me) only got +$1 for working holidays"
bad,"A day at Ralphs consists as a courtesy clerk consists of standing for your entire shift while performing multiple jobs around the store like cleaning the bathrooms, sweeping the store, collecting shopping carts, bagging groceries, working the cash register, receiving shipment trucks, and putting back items that customers didn't buy. The only real communication between workers is usually at the register or when you're being asked to switch to another task as the managers don't like courtesy clerks staying in one place for too long.  There wasn't anything i learned from working there other than why some clerks will stay on shopping cart duty for so long. It wasn't difficult, but it also wasn't enjoyable. The most I got from running around the store as much as i did was back pain that ended up persisting long after i left. That doesn't just go for me though as I knew multiple members of the staff with the same issues."
bad,"My time at Kroger South was somewhat middling. I made fast friends with my co-workers and enjoyed their company. However, the pay I was receiving was not commensurate with the work I was putting in and as a result I had to find a second job. While working both jobs, the management staff at Kroger interfered with my schedule constantly. I was called into the management office several times about my working two jobs. When I completed the training phase of my job at Blackboard my schedule changed and as result I talked with management about it and came to an agreement. That lasted for a week until my college schedule began. I gave them a precise hourly schedule and they refused to allow it. They then made me choose between jobs and I had to quit."
bad,I disliked coming to work all the time. Managers were rude and unprofessional and they were very unorganized. They got complaints from customers all the time.
bad,"- Very busy location, non stop hiring and firing as well"
bad,"If you want a job where you don't actually work much, where a union funnels your money away but never actually helps you when you need it, welcome aboard to Kroger. It's next to impossible to actually make a career here, especially if you want to have your off days off, or get off on time. It cost more to go to work every week than I actually took home because they so very rarely scheduled me. So I was paying money to go to work."
bad,"My position didn't have much flexibility when it came to hours. I don't like how they made the cashiers fight for times like checking out was a race. My coworkers were rude and messy besides 3. The supervisors weren't professional, they wanted my to choose the job over my school work. Wasn't a great environment to work in at all."
bad,"The fellow employees here are great, unfortunately not many stick around for long these days as there seem to be a lot of scheduling flaws.  The sale items sell out faster than they are stocked which regularly causes complaints from customers.  The only employees that have lasted a long time here seem to struggle with attitude issues when new rules and regulations are implemented. The schedule is supposed to come out 2 weeks ahead of time and it does , sadly...it changes daily once it is posted making it impossible to make any plans with family.  Expected to work every holiday and no extra pay for doing so.  Have to wait over a year to get insurance."
bad,You will get paid more most other places ok for a starting job but you're not really getting anything from here except for experience. Leave as soon as you can get a new job if you want any sort of income.
bad,The managers very seldomly made employees feel needed and appreciated. Doing my job was stressful because the head of HR was not very amicable and was not the kind of person you could talk to. He was in fact the opposite of what i would want in someone working in HR.
bad,I loved the customers that I had a rapport with. The store itself was okay. But the management had a negative attitude with his employees. Enjoyed getting a paycheck every week.
bad,The managers treat you unfairly and only really care about the full time employees. You get paid a little over minimum wage and just because of that they expect you to break your back for them.
bad,"Kroger is a great place for a first job, but you start out a minimum wage. The union portion of Kroger is not worth joining at all. The benefits after a year's time are great. To sum it all up, Kroger is a great place for a first job. Unless you move up in the ranks quickly the low pay is not worth staying."
bad,"Didn't have room for growth and showed favoritism, some people had designated shifts others did not, department management wouldn't take responsibilities for the issues of department, company had gone way downhill in the time I worked there"
bad,"It can be a fun job of course because of my co-workers, which is the best thing about the job. The hardest part can be management at times. It is also a very unorganized work environment. There isn't a lot of team work either."
bad,"initially applied to work as a cashier but as I finished up the surveys they decided to bring my position down as a store clerk. I spent much of my job moving carts, stacking boxes of cans to trucks, taking out trash, as well as bagging. The management was decent, although it was obvious all employees felt incredibly stressed. The workers themselves made the job a bit more enjoyable than it was, but each day felt very redundant, with loads of work seeming to be done for less than what could be earned."
bad,I would walk into work and help with the day to day things. Management thinks they own the workers and treat them like they were animals. There were lots of unhappy people at the end of the day.
bad,"Long hours in the snow serving samples impractical samples. No holiday pay. Inconsistent schedule. mangers and seniors randomly disappeared, throughout the day."
bad,"The department managers are mostly good people who work hard at their job. Co managers vary greatly, some are a great help while others are a problematic. Best way to put it is that you ask them for help and they will say yes but only in some circumstances they actually help you. The store manager is just down right annoying and goes crazy when we have store checks. I was working on 6 or 7 carts of cheese we had in the back and while i was working them she came up 5 different times to tell me to work on cheese while i am doing exactly that."
bad,"Each night we either use back stock for the shelves or unload what is just off the truck. So it's almost the exact same thing every night. We couldn't really interact with one another since we were each handling our own, separate isles to stock. For me, it just wasn't a very entertaining job to do every night."
bad,ok job for a student or someone looking for extra cash. Not a career choice. It is a job that will get you through until you find something better.
bad,"While Kroger was not my first pick for place of employment, I went into work knowing that each day led to me being able to make my way in the world. I worked for a short time at two separate locations. At this latest location I found a typical day to be an uphill battle. The store was regularly understaffed and talking to my supervisors I learned that management was regular giving departments less hours than needed. While I found myself at odds with one particular manager, I found the management to be helpful to some extent or at least approachable to a decent degree. I personally found myself going to management when problems would occur and in most cases they were able to help in a productive and mindful manner. I believe that for anyone thinking of working for this company it's important to realize that in some cases you might be left to attend to a full departments amount of by yourself. Where a full department of workers might need 3 people doing work over the course of a shift, there might just be one person covering everything, and that furthermore you will be blamed if you fall behind."
bad,"A typical day consisted of mostly rude customers who were always trying to get more than what they pay for. The job itself felt like more work than what was worth the pay. We got paid minimum wage for doing not only our own job, but possibly 2 or 3 other jobs as well. The supervisors and managers did not seem to care about their employees at all and did not care about what we had to say or ask. The co-workers were pretty friendly, because we were all in the same boat and could relate to one another."
bad,For the wage that we work at it is expected to be able to do everything. Cashiers think that they are our boss when they are not. Management plays favoritism.
bad,Hard to level up. Director make reference to your age to more than one older worker. Will find another job ASAP!!!! Other workers rude.
bad,"Management sucks but other than that you make really good friends with coworkers."
bad,"not a bad job for a young kid to start out and learn to keep and hold a job and learn to  work with other people. lots of good memories. "
bad,"it was fun while it lasted, due to management trying anything they can to get you in trouble, you have the union having your back! its pretty fun interacting with customers and keeping a smile on their faces even when they're having a bad day but kroger pay is so so horrible and your benefits dont kick in til 40 years later"
bad,There were about for managers for one store. The bathroom always smells bad. Lack of training in new employee. Quick to give raises.
bad,I love working with most the people there and they have great health benifets.However the company it's self wants too much form one person and it's not easy to move up or positions becuse being so short handed all the time
bad,"Kroger is a company that takes advantage of it's people. The compensation is far below average for the work that you do. Very hard to move up, They expect ALOT out of you but do not want to give you the pay for it. "
bad,"The Kroger company could possibly a fun place to work, however they do not pay enough money and the managers I feel are not considerate of our personal lives."
bad,The average day goes by rather quickly but it does not pay well enough for me to stay. My social skills have improved because of this job and I am thankful for that experience. I need a better work opportunity and I need it now.
bad,"The Hillsdale Kroger is an excellent place to work if you enjoy having a lack of decent management. One would think that a store would be just fine with 2 managers but nope, three is the magic number. There seems to always some sort of feud between mangers. Also, id recommend NOT working thirds, you always get yelled at for doing your job, even if the store is perfect."
bad,"I worked for Kroger for 3 years, in 2 different positions while I was there, including a co-manager position. If you're a good worker and friendly to the customers and co-workers you'll have no problem getting a full time position and moving up in the company. There's a lot of overtime available for certain departments. If you start from the bottom you will make very low wages, but department heads make decent money so it gives you something to work towards. The benefits are fairly good, and the union costs aren't too bad. You WILL work weekends, different shifts, with different days off for a long time and maybe always. I knew very few managers that were good leaders, usually they just seemed to be doing the best they could but were overwhelmed and didn't have the power to make anything better anyway. Some managers were terrible and didn't care about anyone else. I left the company because I had an opportunity to make the same money with a set M-F day schedule so I had to go for it. I got tired of never seeing my family on holidays and weekends."
bad,"My hiring manager had been dismissed within 2 months of beginning work because he had lied on his application for employment. He insisted on demeaning work that offered little to the benefit of the workplace."
bad,The most difficult part of the job was the inconsistency and the constant understaffing. They also failed to value and appreciate the employees who had the most experience.
bad,"Consistently hiring new employing and cutting current employee hours. Only thing I personally enjoyed was working individually in floral, without having to work around other employees."
bad,"Management will state they are interested in making positive changes affecting pharm techs and even are in the process of doing so, but it was never a reality. Only RPH's or PharmD's saw any improvements to their work environment. And so the story goes......."
bad,Hardest work i've ever done with little reward. Work any where from 5 to 6 days a week even after having 6 years of seniority. Only two shifts to chose from with awful starting hours.
bad,They promise the world but fall far short when it comes to delivering. Your supposed to be in charge of your own training but they are always understaffed so training is nearly impossible.
bad,This job did not have really any pros. I always did what was asked of me if not more and I did not receive any thanks from the management.
bad,Constantly doing things on jobs that are not in the job description. We push carts outside without the managers checking on you.
bad,"Management is not friendly. I worked there and can get along with everyone, but one manager not friendly at all.  I would walk in and say good morning and i would just be ignored by him. I was never fast or did anything good for him.  Was fired because they said i was ""stealing time""  because i didnt clock out when i was suppose too.  I was there with another employee closing and she wasnt done yet so i didnt clock out until we were leaving/closing the store.  was told it looked bad on them and i was stealing time.  My opnion thats not what stealing time is!!!  i was there working!!!  BAD BAD BAD"
bad,"It was an okay place to work. Some of the co-workers were nice, some of the managers were nice too. It wasn't the funniest place but wasnt the worst either."
bad,"This was my first summer job out of high school to earn some money before college.  It is a local factory in my hometown.  The hours were incredibly long, often times being 12-16 hour days.  The hours wouldn't have been that bad, except the job itself was incredibly physically demanding and also very repetitive which made it slightly boring.  I often went home thoroughly exhausted and basically made it to my bed to fall asleep just to get up and go back to work very early in the morning."
bad,working for kroger is busy I assist customers with all kinds of situations.The cco-workers are very informative and easy to get along with. the most hardest part of the job is dealing with angry customers thats not willing to listen to you . the most delightful part of the job is being able to interact with the public and satisfying the customers.
bad,"An okay place to start out, especially if your not at the branch I work at.  They can't seem to keep up with turnover, have a lot of trouble attracting enough employees to replace the ones that leave.  Takes a very long time to get anything done.  Lots of people at different levels seem to struggle with their tasks.  Pay for those without much retail experience is pretty low compared to other retailers.  At least the managers were good natured, even if they didn't seem to know what they were doing."
bad,"Kroger doesn't give any hours, but wants you to wait by the phone on your off days, so they can call you in. They say, its competitive pay. No it is not. Competitive hours. Summer hours is a great time to work there, but once September hits, its no hours. There is a lot of hear say."
bad,"If you need a job go for it, but don't get comfortable. The management wants you to be some kind of a superhero. They expect a lot with very little compensation. The general staff is awesome. The people there are genuinely nice and care about assisting teammates and customers. On the other hand, it's too little pay for too much work. You can make more money doing the same job with almost any of their competitors."
bad,"Not paid enough for the work and expectations of the company in general.  Work full-time hours with part-time benefits and pay, pay increases are low and rare."
bad,"Worked only when a truck came in.  Had less then 20 hrs a week most of the times,  at times no hrs. had to pay union dues even when you had no hours.  worked every weekend when there was a truck,  was on call if a truck came in when not scheduled."
bad,Most of the employees lacked in their duties and I had to pick up after their slack. Management were very kind and responsible.
bad,The people are great to work with and you get good training for whatever department you work in. But they lie to you about your chance at promotions. They also hate when you try to get another job or go to school. even tho they cap anyone under management at 25 hrs a week.
bad,They really do not acknowledge their staff or promote those who deserve it. Its a fast paced environment. Staff are often faced with angry customers.
bad,"I have been there 3 years and still no advancement, other than that it is an ok place to work. i am looking to move on from the company and start my career elsewhere."
bad,"Culture is non existent. Company tries to have managers create a positive atmosphere but it is obviously forced. Its an ok place to work if your one of those who just wants to come in and do the minimum expected job duties and punch out. No overtime expected, they push you out the door at the 8 hour mark."
bad,"This job was by far my least favorite job. My boss did not care about anyone but herself and would throw anyone under the buss to save herself from blame. She was hardly around and almost always in a bad mood."
bad,"I typical day at work consisted of bringing in carts so that they would be available for customers to shop with. I also had to bag groceries and check customers out. In addition to that, I replaced unwanted items back onto the shelves. I learned great customer service skills and professionalism. My managers were great when I first began working at Kroger. During the last year of working at Kroger, my new managers were terrible! They treated me unfairly and gave me no room for promotion or advancement. MY co-workers were great. However, there were a couple of co-workers that treated me extremely unkind and were very messy! The hardest part of this job was bringing in carts in the bitter cold and ice and also the scorching hot weather. The most enjoyable part of this job was always knowing the exact amount of hours that I would receive every week and helping customers."
bad,"A typical day as a pharmacy technician, included filling prescriptions, interfacing with customers, (which was the best part of the job), up keeping inventory, cashiering, tackling insurance issues, supporting the pharmacist."
bad,"too many bad experiences happen to me when i was there. there were no separate identities when it came to pick n save. the management was very flirty and inappropriate when it came to getting what they wanted. so advisement to all who wants to work at this establishment, ""just work and then leave""."
bad,Not a good place to start a career. Though I met great people there while working but the pay is to low and there is a minimal rate of advancing in the store
bad,Tend to work long hours while doing the work for two people. Hire incompetent workers who are not up for the lifting or labor that is needed to perform the job.
bad,Not a very pleasant experience. Loved the people I worked for. Not much room for growth. Management can be a headache. Job was super repetitive. Only got 40 cent raise in 3 years.
bad,Kroger was good for management experience but I am interested getting back in my field of work for my particular major of Computer Science.
bad,"A typical day consists of customer service and whatever other duties management needs you to complete for the day."
bad,"A typical day at work was arguments between co-workers and management, dirty stations, fights and management thief. I have not learned anything, but how to not run a business. Management was not the best, not enough leadership. My co-workers were well aware of the lack of leadership. I got along with all my co-workers even management. The hardest part of the job was nothing, it wasn't a challenge. the most enjoyable part about it was interacting with the customers."
bad,"long hours with little pay, management was ok for the most part, co-workers were good if they were not full time workers, no parts of this job were enjoyable"
bad,"When working for Kroger if you aren't full time, all Kroger is really good for is a second job. If you need extra money this is the place for you. I've been working here almost a year and im still part time making 7.25. I don't even get 30 hours a week. You do the math, you cant live off of that, and management doesn't see that. like i said if you need a job to get out of the house or just need extra cash this is the place for you. If your like me having to pay bills this should not be your primary job."
bad,"A typical day at work at this particular store is often stressful. One does not have many customers to assist, but it can be straining to be the only person in the department and have to help several people at once. Mostly, one was heaped with a good deal of things to do with no help and often had to pick up the slack from the day shift. The most discouraging part of the job was that all the day shift workers would talk about me and the other night shift employees behind our backs, saying how ""worthless, lazy, etc."" we were. The department manager was no exception. It was discouraging to see the manager engaging in such unprofessional behaviour. However, because the department was always short-handed, they would pretend to be civil to one's face but as soon as you weren't there, they'd begin to speak ill of you. The constant negativity only exacerbated the departmental ""drama."" The manager also had temper tantrums at times. The upper management did not seem to follow through with their promises, and it seemed as though they did not care to resolve the issues at hand. No one but the night shift believed in teamwork; day shift's motto was ""every man for themselves."" They did not say this, of course, but their actions and countenances spoke for them. "
bad,"I learned how to manage my time but the management sucked. Supervisor wasn't really good at teaching the new employers. He always rushed us without explaining the objective at hand. Seasoned Employees were a good help and were easy to communicate with, if needed help. Nothing was hard about the job but the breaks were cool to just sit back and communicate with others"
bad,"It was not a mind-blowing experience of course, it was pretty standard with some busy periods here and there. Especially around holidays. Staff tends to be pretty cool, customers are more open and positive in the better neighborhoods."
bad,"A lot of communication is done via e-mail.  Most decisions are made at the top and many times they are reactionary.  You sometimes have a difficult time trying to stay on a strategic plan for the long haul as there is a lot of input to the direction.  The hardest part of the job is trying to guess what management wants as they change so much.  In my time there we had 4 presidents.  That meant changes and adaptations everytime.  Which is okay, you just have to change to a new philosophy and direction each time.  The co-workers are great to work with and that is what makes the job enjoyable."
bad,"very stressful and not rewarding at all, management is incompetent at best. the people you work with are great, but customers are rude. not a hard job, its just very stressful and annoying"
bad,"This isn't the worst job in the world, and several other employees ive talked to seemed happy with where they were at, i think that i was probably influenced by the managers at the store that i worked at. in the two years i worked there, no one, not a single person, recieved any kind of raise other than minimum wage raises and the mangers were jokes."
bad,"A typical work day for me involved coming into work not knowing exactly which department I would be working in. Though that was kind of the nice part, it was an ever changing job, so I was constantly on my feet and ready for anything! The hardest part of the job was probably also my favorite part of the job, it was the ever changing of departments. My coworkers were all completely different, it was almost like a different world there. Everyone ranged in age from 15 up to 75, which almost gave it the feel of a family."
bad,"stocking shelves, showing customers where items are located."
bad,"Typical Day was doing work that previous shift didnt finish. I learned Supervising Skills."
bad,"Typical day can vary from day to day, you never know what to expect. I have mastered the art of decorating and learned how to deal with the general"
bad,I worked as a cashier handled cash and interacted with customers.
bad,"I loved working with the customers, wasn't all to happy with my position or the manager. They made it nearly impossible for advancement and use favoritism in the work place HARDCORE!"
bad,Great learning experience. Company has gotten too top heavy
bad,"this was my first jobs, meet and greeting new people everyday, i learned how to stock work the cash regeister management was better then excepted get in good with the right manager you""ll move up and work hard "
bad,Come in and make sure no one called in if so call to cover shift. Look at the sales for the day to see how much revenue we increased for the day. Make sure that the carts our off the lot. If busy pull in a register and get the lines down. Give out breaks when needed. Learned how to deal with issues that may come up and over come the customer issue and solve them to make the customer happy if irate or upset about the service they have received . Help customers find what they are looking for in the store as well as auditing the tills after the cashier is done working on them. If needed giving more cash to the registers. Dealing with employees issues as well as coaching them. The hardest part of the job was under pressure still remain Calm and just do the best customer service even with the irate customers . Most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know the customers the regulars that come in there and knowing them by name. 
bad,most of the employees and managment sem like they have a chip on there shoulders there are few kind employees and tons of gossip about who is doing what outside of work. the hardest part is dealing with everyone personal problems and them trying to drag you down into there misery. 
bad,"Responsible for accurate and friendly consumer transactions. Assisted customers with Self Check transactions. Assist with restock and overstock inventory items. Responsible for assisting customers with locating items throughout the store."
bad,"Typical day at work - Came in at 6PM on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays (hours were limited due to schooling) and immediately began cleaning the room where the meat was ground and cut. This consisted of breaking down all the machines in the room and in the cooler, spraying it down with water, covering the room in soap and letting it sit for 20-30 minutes, and spraying it off again. After this, I would wash all the dishes and tools that were used throughout the work day. When 8pm rolled around, we had a service counter where we served pre-portioned slices of meat and fish. If a customer wanted an item, I would serve them with a sense of urgency and professionalism. Once these counters were broken down, they were properly stored in the cooler. The last thing I did at night was to break down the delivery truck. We had 2, sometimes 3, pallets of boxes of meat, lunch meat, potatoes, etc. come in that had to be sorted by brand, type of meat, etc. before the night was up.  "
bad,Too many politics between the Union and Management. Lots of rampant gossip. Fast pace and makes the day go by quickly. Good if you like working with people. And there is the added bonus that you will always be able to do your shopping and know what is on sale.
bad,This company will work you to the bone -- even on Christmas day. There is no work life balance. Management is very political. The hardest part of the job is the interruptions. The most enjoyable part of the job is the public interaction.
bad,"I've never had a job were I felt so worthless to the company. Management belittled you in front of customers and other employees. One of my managers repeatedly tried to intimidate me on a daily basis. I was unable to enroll in school because and I quote ""If your availability changes, I'm afraid we won't have a spot for you."""
bad,I come in and stock the floor and walls. I broke down truck on the weekends and did most of the sanitation in my department. I found the hardest part of the job was meeting impossible expectations and having to put forth ideas to a management team that did not want to confront problems.
bad,"customers were the best.... most of them anyway.... management was good, the hardest part of the job was being alone in the store at night....."
bad,Job is okay if you are Fulltime - not at all worth it if you are part time.
bad,"Kroger's is a day of experience, fun that can boost creativity, productivity in a workplace, and employees work well with others. Give employee confidence in motivating each other in a working environment. Management can bring fun into workplace to stimulate sales by keep his or her employees happy. The coworker must understand they show leadership to improve standards to keep customer coming to Kroger to shop. The hardest part is working, as a team makes sure everyone is on the same level to see what the customer wants and needs are. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing customers walk away happy. The hardest part of the job is the stress level of making sure the task is done,it sometimes requires us to do management work,working in other department and doing department head duties."
bad,A job of this setting was only a stepping stone for me to groom my interpersonal / customer service skills.
bad,Good people work here but the people who run are not so much. There is no room for a raise nor a placement
bad,"The store overall isnt bad. The management sucks, don't get lunch breaks, seniority goes out the window! co-workers are what I think is the only good part."
bad,"A typical day would be bagging items, maintaining carts and some customer service. Then at night stocking the store. I learned that you need a lot of patients. There wasn't really nothing hard about the job. The most enjoyable part of the job is that there were many cool co-workers."
bad,Busy days filled with fun time with co-workers. I learned alot from my deptmant manger(will teach you anything you want to learn). Never get done there is always something to do. Enjoy taking to customers.
bad,"Typical day would be customer first attitude, counting of tills at night for the next day business,preparing deposits for Armor pick-up,Train cashiers as needed,Sales book"
bad,Very fast paced. Learned that you just have to be you go to far in life and not be what people want you to be. Co-workers fun to work with and be around.
bad,The work place was typical like any other work place nothing really special we did not have a ping pong table just a tv .
bad,"This company holds no value on service, cleanliness or quality."
bad,"The crew of this store are lazy. Soon after I started working several cashiers left. Production slowed and soon I was the only courtesy clerk being called in, under those circumstances I was not able to perform all of my duties. I expressed this to the manager and she then proceeded to tell me I didn't talk enough to the customer despite not being able to get a words in edswise while she was talking to the customer. I left soon there after with the feeling that I was used as cheap labor."
bad,"It was hard work, it was a union job but they excepted a lot out of you. I would do a lot in a single day, bag,cart stock."
bad,Overall a decent not so bad job. I would only recommend this job to people with sense of humors. Good first job while youre in school or whatever. Kroger promotes within so there is some advancement opportunities if interested. Weekly pay is always nice. Union benefits are a plus. Kroger is a good ol boy network so just remember that not a big deal just a fun fact. Wouldnt say its a bad job it pays the bills yo. Also I love to watch old grumpy couples argur over where to put the crinkle fries in the cart.
bad,"I like the fact that I got to work with great co-workers and interact with great customers, although mangers were never clear I kept a line of communication"
bad,"Because of the union you cannot be easily fired from there but that seems to be the only thing they do as many if not all of us do not get raises, a lot of restrictions apply to getting what benefits they do offer. Management is usually not reachable and only one of two foster an atmosphere of happiness and trust while the others do not seem only seem to care if you fear them and they want your respect even if they havent earned it. The stores in general are very filthy and even when they get a sum of money to fix the problems kroger decides to squander it away on petty if not down right useless things."
bad,"This company is good to work at for people new to the work force, or anyone looking for extra income.  Most positions within the company do not provide enough compensation to fully support a family.  Also, with the amount of grocery shopping moving to on-line services, longevity is questionable."
bad,Some managers are not that friendly  and have bad attitudes and.  But employees department  are friendly and nice to others.............................
bad,The work wasn't bad. Just not good management and bad customer service.  They didn't really think about the employees they were hiring but good pay. Pay is biweekly so that's a plus.
bad,"#346 Howell mill Atlanta,Ga has poor management ,Weak Staffing,And No Organization unless there’s a visit from Corporate, And A Lack Of Motivation to work ,Also doesn’t feel like a company but a high school!"
bad,"Kroger is a seniority based company. The people who have been there the longest tend to get the better hours, workdays, and pay. Be sure you are completely okay with being flexible with your schedule, as it will likely change every week."
bad,"A cashiering position at any super-store isn't the best, but in my experience with this company, it's more about fast paced scanning. The management does not take into consideration personal issues, goals, or even basic moral standing sometimes. If you're looking for a quick, easy job, this is your gig. If you're looking for long term payment, I'd seek elsewhere or apply for management."
bad,"Kroger is a company that is in decline in every way.  Management has no regard for the pharmacists that work for them. Unrealistic clinical services are expected to be inserted into the busy, understaffed work flow."
bad,"You can feel lost working in such a large company, not knowing exactly who your supervisor is or who to talk to for certain things. I worked in the starbucks kiosk and it was the black sheep of the store where we kind of just got forgotten about."
bad,"If you have a fair manager, who knows what's going on, you have a good chance of succeeding. If you have a manager who spends most time in the office or taking smoke breaks, they are more apt to delegate someone who only worksonly when the boss is around. So the delegate, delegates all work to everyone else, and none to self. Causing there to be more work than workers."
bad,"Typical day of managers making mistakes and you making up for it. Work was often boring, customers relentless, and any hard work you put in would be ignored for long periods of times with no acknowledgement."
bad,Overall not a terrible place to work. Holidays are heck tick. Most of the coworkers are friendly. Biggest issue is pay and hours. Not enough consistency week to week.
bad,"Kroger is a decent company but the pay is very bad. The starting pay in the meat department( Dallas Divison UFCW 540) for meat clerks(non meat cutters) is $8.25 and once you hit 60 months(5 years) you top out at 14.90. "
bad,"My time a Kroger was short but, unpleasant. They paid barely above minimum wage. Managers played favorites and treated some better than others. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to meet different kinds of people and help them daily."
bad,"It want like I thought it would be good I found a new job wasn't  getting along with the manager I feeling I was getting picked at "
bad,Work here wasn't all terrible but it wasn't great either. This place was my first job so didn't expect much out of it. But management at my store wasn't super great half the time and when we did have good manager the ended up leaving to go to better places cause they released that this wasn't the best place to be. If you plan on working here prepare to overworked without anyone caring about your life outside your job.
bad,"Done with retail, does not help employees cause not enough decent employees.  Always stressful , don't want to pursue any advancement.  Want to step down."
bad,"If you are wanting a fun job, this isn’t it, it’s very hard work! "
bad,"I worked for this company for YEARS and as time went on, the company adopted ideals that are FAR from taking care of their employees. The hours are garbage. The management is hit or miss (but usually a miss), organization is minimal. Pay is not worth the work."
bad,"Very Busy workplace from the beginning to the end of day. Handling company objective, Customer issues and Staff needs."
bad,"Its not terrible for a first job, but wage increases are absolutely terrible no matter how long you're here for or what position you're in. For instance ive been here almost two years and make as much as my friends who've been here for five years. I make two dollars less than some department heads. Its really bad."
bad,"The Kroger Company and Managers gave me a really hard time. I have Sickle-Cell and I get really sick at times. When I explain to the managers about my sickness they were uninterested and act as if they didn’t care. For example, I woke up on more in pain so I had to be rushed to the hospital, I informed my managers and they basically told me that I had to come to work no matter what."
bad,"So so...needed to move on and better my work experience.  I tried to express my concerns, to no avail.  Thought about staying...then moved on to a better company."
bad,"Unfair favoritism, no respect for personal lives, advantages and perks given to lower seniority employees over higher seniority ones. The pay is alright (for me, only because i’ve been there 10 years). Benefits are decent. Paid vacation. The downsides are mostly anyone who is in charge of anything doesn’t know what they’re doing or value you if you don’t make Kroger your life and reason for waking up in the morning."
bad,Bad management and corporate decisions. Kroger refuses to hire enough employees while still expecting the current few to meet the demand. Kroger has one of the most difficult self-checkout systems.
bad,The company doent know how to run there stores. Regardless of which store you work at. Mangment are people who simply a a degree not people who worked in the stores and knows how it actually functions.
bad,"The work there was solid, good growth however it felt like management was always lacking somewhere, there was issues with scheduling and I was paid less then I should’ve been for at least a month and a half. The culture was great, the people were good to work with and it was fun."
bad,"click list area needs more supervision. no supervision led to confusion on schedule, job description, break times,job responsibilities. no clear chain of command"
bad,"At first I loved the idea of working there. But that quickly changed when I noticed management either being flat out lazy or flirting with some of the other staff members . I had multiple co-workers who did less than the minimum and would stand around not doing anything causing me in association to get in trouble for barely anything when looked at in whole the following morning by the GM. After getting sick and falling from health issues it was made abundantly clear that my life meant nothing to them. Oh and if you like to get the breaks that corporate ""strictly enforces,""(chuckle) then you really want to stay away from the grocery section."
bad,I didn’t enjoy working worst management ever always messed up my checks and when I worked they never knew who was working that day always busy treated baggers like trash
bad,"Poor management, little to no advancement, and the company stretches it's employees thin by having them work in nearly every department rather than focus on just one or two."
bad,The union prevents management to act effectively in eliminating employees that perform poorly and make other workers jobs difficult. Staffing is low and pay does not meet expectations.
bad,"My job duties weren't detailed to me during the interview. I was told I would be working a salad bar position, where my main duty is upkeep on the salad bar. I come in the first day, was laughed at by the manager because I didn't bring a sweatshirt (I didn't have one that would abide by the dress code and didn't think I would need one). Turns out, my position was only partly to do with the salad bar. A really small part. Two hours in and the salad bar was done. The rest of the day was spent cutting and packaging fruit for their to-go wall. Never was I told this would be my main duty. Never was I told that I would be spending 8 hours in a freezer with fruit juice all over my latex gloved hands. I have a medical condition that brings me severe pain when exposed to cold for too long. After I began working with the hiring manager to find a better-suited position for my medical condition, I overhear the produce manager talking behind my back about how it's my fault I'm so cold because I didn't bring a jacket. "
bad,"The management there is okay the work is good but the customers are the only reason I stick around so long. "
bad,"the schedule is always changing .hard to make plans when you really don,t know what your working .It can be very fast paced but i like that . Need to pay a little better ."
bad,"Store Manager very unprofessional, store manager let department heads use foul language during morning huddles, store manager speaks very low in morning huddles about upper manager in corporate. store manager take sides with some department head before hearing both side."
bad,"Very, very high-paced and competitive. My store cared about being the best of the best and did not settle for anything less. People worked extremely hard with nothing to show for it at times."
bad,"You are overworked for the amount you're paid"
bad,"Had no real opportunity to move up and advance, no matter how good you felt you were. Compensation is underwhelming unless you’re a salaried member of management. Worked for company for nearly three years and only received two pay raises for a total of fifty cents, which is not nearly enough when hours range from fifteen to forty depending on your department. Understaffed in almost every department but hours are still sparse. Unable to keep the good employees with have, which is part in due to the low compensation, forcing the good employees to leave for a new job. Turnover rate is ridiculously high and rate at which they replace those lost is too slow."
bad,I love what I been doing for 11yr.But over the years Krogers can't keep enough help that the store meeds because of pay.So I stay because I love my customers&aome of the people I work with.I just want to do something different.I been cooking since I been working for Kroger.
bad,Kroger was a good job to start out at but not for a long time. Management wasn’t good and I felt disrespected as an employee. I shouldn’t have to tell my manager exactly what I am doing in order to get my day off that I need.
bad,Kroger and the Union is allowing part timers/scabs to work whenever morning hours they want and a 20+ year employee is stuck working 2 nights a week.  Kroger makes out as they don't have to pay these scabs any benefits.  I said this isn't right and they told me if I don't like it quit.
bad,The starting pay is low no matter which department you are in. The corporation is stingy when it comes to raises and paying their employees the deserved amount/
bad,"Total Compensation is good.  Senior leadership is demanding and won't acknowledge that they have huge issues with lack of good data, poor systems, 30+ systems to try and find something and a revolving door of leaders, management and other personnel.  You'll learn about the retail, food & beverage market, but the company will turn you into a dinosaur in terms of technology and robotics.  "
bad,The pay isn't  worth the work  and stress you have to put up with nothing seems good enough for management. You may or may not get a chance to take a break even though its paid.
bad,There was never enough people around to get the things done that were needed and everyone was punished for only one or a couple peoples mess ups. the raises were only about 5 cents at a time and many stores are union so you top out on pay.
bad,"I worked the Deli and it was nothing but drama between workers. "
bad,"Customers are rude especially at these stores, be prepared to handle that. Management changes a lot, but they do listen to you if you're important enough to them."
bad,"Work life balance is awful.  Benefits are excellent.  Good insurance, good pay. 10+ hour days, minimum of 50 hours a week, normally more.  On the sales floor over 75% of the day, not a desk job if that is more what your are looking for."
bad,"Maybe the job wouldn't be so bad if you were treated with as much respect as everyone else, but instead you are at the butt end of everything, and the job pretty much consists of doing things no one else wants to do."
bad,"The job itself wasn’t hard, the management is awful and most of them are new and don’t have managing skills. The lack of advancement is horrible. It’s simply a grocery store job for ages 16-18. Unless you’re looking for supplemental income as a second job."
bad,"My first 6 months working in Kroger were pretty good, the managers were cooperative and they provided me with plenty of hours. Soon enough, I came to realize that they care about nothing but the budget. After new management came through it went downhill. Hours were cut, I didn't get paid equally for the work I did, and there wasn't much of a chance to move up in the store."
bad,"The management is not good, the duties are boring and exhausting, and the hours are terrible. I worked there for 1+ years and haven't moved up from my position."
bad,"After my time working there, I've realized that Kroger isn't the place to work if you want to make somewhat of a living. I would not recommended this job if you're a college student, but it could serve well as high school student's first job."
bad,"the store i worked at wouldnt talk to you if they were upset with you, they would just cut your hours, the store manager once told me that ""they didnt come looking for me to work there so i should change my attitude or get out"". my ""attitude"" was that im not a very smiley person and i guess i gave the impression that i was upset over being forced to stay late for the 8th time that month when no one else was even asked to stay. i had a report filed against me by a customer saying i ignored her when all i did was turn away for a second to tell my friend who worked with me he hello. terrible store with terrible customers."
bad,Store Management has complete disregard for people on medical restrictions. I was forced to do things I was medically not supposed to do due to being pregnant which I believed caused my baby to be born 5 weeks premature via emergency c-section.
bad,i learned how to help people better i learned how to make huge ammounts of coffee an how to clean a food service area i also learned how to do lottery
bad,Everyone is trained to be out for their section of the store and you can not do anything to help others or you fall behind or they take advantage of kindness.
bad,"I personally didn't like it here. Management was always in your face about something. They need to be more nice to their associates. Pay is ok if you are in high school, college or some kind of learning program. But wouldn't recommend it if you want to live comfortably just doesn't pay enough."
bad,"Customer service. Setting up sales, stocking shelves, and taking care of customers. Kroger is a respectful place to work. Hardest part of the job was putting up with management."
bad,"The overall initial environment wasn't bad, but the more time you spend inside the culture the less fun and harder it becomes to work there. I would not suggest it to anyone looking for a semi permeant job or permeant job."
bad,"I have been working here for over 6 months. The pay is mediocre, you aren't allowed ANY overtime as well as the call off system punishing people for being sick and rewarding those who don't want to work. If I can't afford a cheap studio apartment while working here, something is wrong. The people you interact with while at work (customers, coworkers, etc.) are the bet part. The store I work at is smaller than most so the pace is slower and on occasion stagnant"
bad,"Was my first job but terrible expirence."
bad,"The job itself was straightforward but there was a PR problem when it came to how one must request time off, and I was terminated when no one reached out."
bad,"Management was rude and very short with the staff, often bringing some of the women to tears.  I was even in management and the managers over me treated me the same way!"
bad,I found this to be kinda a bad place to work as it wasn't enjoyable however if you like quick money its an ok place to work because they pay weekly so that's nice but other than that it's not super enjoyable and it's not fun. what really irritates me is people are always really rude at this store. Personally I don't enjoy working here.
bad,"Customers are mean and aggressive. Management does nothing to ensure the safety of staff.  Customers, call names, shove, throw things and employees have to smile through it."
bad,I was a courtesy clerk at King Soopers the hours were very fluctuated they didn't give me nor some others the time we wanted off I liked some of the head clerks but HR was unprofessional and we were always making changes to others schedules to get through the day our breaks were scattered id get some right before my shift even ended or some forgot to give outbreaks.
bad,"My typical day working at Kroger always has something for me to do, unless the hours I work are from early evening until closing time. I'm expected to bag and handle customers' groceries with haste and optimization, and to give them a friendly shopping experience. I'm also expected to handle the return of any unwanted or damaged goods, as well as re-delivering items to their proper place in the store. The easiest part of my part-time job has been holding a conversation with the customer(s), and returning items to the store shelves, but everything beyond that is a challenge in itself."
bad,"When I was working there, I felt there was a lack of communication within the workplace, especially with management.  One person would say one fact, and the other person would oppose of said fact.  Would always get called into work, with high turnover rate and people not willing to pick up the load.  And one of the locations did not have cross training for employees in their original plan.  So I had plenty of hours when the staff was low, but when there was a lot of staff, my hours were extremely cut."
bad,"I am a very flexible person, however, the hours were odd for me to work. For instance, they once had me work for only two days a week and on one of the two days I worked it was a 12-hour shift that lasted into midnight and then my next shift was at 7 am in the morning for the next day."
bad,The. Management is constantly riding you about your job and won't leave you alone and let you do it .the job is very stressful. You have somany. Things to do and minimal time to accomplish it.
bad,"It's unfortunate that Kroger treats their store level employees as ""trained monkeys"".  There is zero care about their people unless you are at the corporate level."
bad,"Working there is just a pain. Management treats their employees like a simple number. You show up and do above and beyond everything asked of you and more. Then when you ask to move up and or be trained to move up, you cant."
bad,cashiers are so under paid with a lot of other responsibility other than scanning groceries and accepting payment. it can be very stressful and demanding at times.
bad,"Working at Kroger is a great first job but after a year or 2 you are wasting your time. They will tell you that you're a good employee yet not give you the pay, time off, or anything else you deserve. Long term you could benefit from Kroger but the question is is it really worth the time it takes to get there?"
bad,Kroger does not give people enough hours! They need to hire more people because they need help! They are real stingy with money and try to cheat people out they money.
bad,Not much to say overall it has a lot of responsibility with little reward. Very focused on saving money . Senior leadership has very high expectations
bad,"The hardest part of the job is satiating entitled customers, being evaluated via customer comments, and keeping up with the company's ridiculous procedures. The most enjoyable are the bonds you make with your fellow coworkers."
bad,I used to think Kroger was a great company to work for. 15 & 1/2  years with the company used to mean something.  We were told at 1130am our division was closing. At 12pm the public was informed. Since pharmacy was non union our siverence was only 2 weeks no matter how many years and insurance til end of August.
bad,"Overall working at Kroger's the management was very well mannered and took care of anything the worker's needed,but at night the lead grocery clerk always jumped down everybody's back."
bad,"Working at Kroger's wasn't the worst job a person could ever have, but it was certainly far from an ideal job. Management didn't seem to clearly communicate with one another on several occasions, and some members of the staff simply weren't willing to work with other employees. Depending on the job it can also put a strain on one's mental and emotional state."
bad,"Kroger is a dying industry trying to incorporate new tactics to implement a new way to grocery shop. The store had difficult management due to the interest in trying to implement newer and younger management, but that lack skills necessary to be a proficient leader. The workplace is difficult due to the unnecessary aggressiveness from the management trying to establish their place in the workspace. Kroger in the Clicklist department is different from the rest of the store but it is still a new and growing opportunity for Kroger. They implement new ideas with old techniques to properly make such an idea work."
bad,"I was a cashier, office clerk and supervisor. It's a very fast paced, hectic and stressful job. We always had people to call in and made us short handed, which adds to the stress. Working with the public is a stressful job."
bad,"Kroger is great for teenagers and senior ready to retire ,but once become"
bad,"When I first got to work with Kroger I was alright with it. But as time went on I found out that the ""annual raise"" was only going to be ten cents... Then finally, after moving three stores, I was starting to move to different positions and learn new things. Thing was, I then found out that you do not  get a raise for every new position that you learn. The management never took the employees side and made it seem like you could never call them. I don't know about other stores, but the one I worked out never made payroll."
bad,you need to stay busy at all times. most days are pretty fast paced especially on a Saturday and Sunday. it's important to work as a team with the others around you to help get the job done.
bad,Not really enjoyable at all. always did not like working there. The management was not to be desired. People would come and go all the time if that doesnt tell you people didnt like the job.
bad,"The employees have a zero tolerance policy so when not if but when the customer customers call you stupid you take it and just smile back. Some customers will eat the product and not pay for it or ask you to do something for them that will get you fired. They do not accommodate your schedule, so if you go to school or have other jobs to go to they will make it so they're your number one priority."
bad,"I enjoy my work. "
bad,"Kroger is flexible with employees and always make a costumers day, so therefore i enjoy making people smile. Also  l learn new thing each day, like for example being sales person for a day."
bad,Typically worked alone or with a single person which can be extremely stressful when you man register and make drinks. Paid $7.25 at my location and was unable to get more then 16 hours a week.
bad,They need to invest in there associates. There is no reason for being there. They no longer offer full time status. Insurance is getting harder to get. The day is overwhelming at times because no help. Job task getting heavy.
bad,With working night shift didn't have much of a home life. I wouldn't recommend the night shift if you have a family you will never see them. But the pay is great and I worked by myself
bad,"There's three immediate jobs. That you have to do. These include bringing carts from the lot. That were left overnight. Next is the ""Bottle Machine"". You have to clean all the gunk and wasted pop from the bottle machines. The trash needs to be took out. Then the floors need to be mopped. Lastly you have to clean the bathrooms. Once those three things are done, you have to bag groceries. That's your typical day at work."
bad,"Due to the pressures of the changing market the company has struggled to find where it belongs alongside regional competitors that offer super-friendly service like Publix and cheap wholesale oriented services such as Amazon or WalMart. Add to this the pressure to go Green and be natural in presentation and promise (plus the addition of Sprouts, WholeFoods in the market) has left Kroger without an identity."
bad,"working with untrained associates who either don't care to learn or haven't been given the best training . At my previous store there was accountability , there was training ,communication and Standards that we all most do. The store I'm presently at there are no standards of cleanliness or accountability ."
bad,"Working at the store level for the Kroger company is suited only for high school or possibly college students who are looking for some disposable income while in classes, but is most definitely not a viable choice for a young adult attempting to live on their own. Due to the nature of the union that has monopolized the Kroger company, wages are delivered by the lowest common denominator, and raises are only awarded through seniority. In effect, this does away with any type of meaningful reward for the quality of your work. Factoring in the abysmally low dollar amounts of raises awarded (often only $0.05/hr or $0.10/hr) and starting at minimum wage, it becomes clear that the Kroger company views its store employees as expendable, and treats them as such."
bad,"Hardest part about working here is finding the appropriate culture. Management is competent, benefits are good, pay is extremely low. But if you don't like the store you can transfer, and management is always being cycled so it works out in the long run."
bad,The job was fast and in the summer pushing carts for 30 minuets at a time can get tiring really quickly. The amount of management was slim to none and the breaks were short.
bad,I typically stock the shelves and help customers find products. I feel that I do not get paid enough for the amount of labor that I do as well as dealing with rude customers. I have learned how to maintain a clean work environment as well as how to work within our electrical system. The most enjoyable part of the job was my coworkers.
bad,This is an ok place to work but I felt I was a great employee and was told by many customers they would not even get in line at our customer service desk if I wasn't there yet my pay was really low.
bad,"Working at Kroger was exciting, and I enjoyed everyone of my co-workers (regular associates). What made the job stressful was the lack of having enough cashiers. Lines on average stretched to the back of the store, and management rarely came down to help out. Management team was beyond selfish and lazy."
bad,"depends on your store some are better than others, can be stressful and fast paced, otherwise very flexible with hours,good management,a typical day involves a lot of engagement with customers and things happening very fast"
bad,"Management never hired any new employees, so the store was always understaffed. The management would get upset for employees going to do their jobs, but we were understaffed, so that made us lose a bagger and lose cart pushers as well."
bad,"So I worked for Pick n' save which was bought by Kroger, I think pick just didn't want to run their stores the way Kroger thought they should. I think if  they were run the Kroger way it may be a better place to work."
bad,"The company has gotten terrible, especially management. They show favoritism & treat some of the employees like whatever. Some of them don’t even know their employees names & don’t care to try to!"
bad,"People don’t follow rules, allow speakers for music hard to learn. People cut you off . People would steal your center rider. Touched a lot of rotten food."
bad,"Do not work here, poor pay scale, raises are consistent, put they are consistently a dime, management is awful and and take no consideration from employees"
bad,"The mangers would rush you and compare you to other employees just because you cant stock a large pallet that night in the requested hours it should take to get done which was impossible, its good at first then the managers and everybody gets annoying 9.80 a hour really was not worth it. If you have no life and want to be rushed and bugged every night work here."
bad,"Management was often out of touch with working staff. Often, advancement felt like a game of politics where you only got promoted if the right management liked you."
bad,"Fred Meyer Jewelers is a fantastic place to work if you want to be part time or you are just working for fun. But if you have a family, no. Because they certainly don't pay an Assistant Manager a living wage. Management is OK at best. As long as you never voice an issue about anything. But the pay is minimal for everything you have to do. Training is minimal. Store Managers don't want to train new people to reach their fullest potential because they have such unrealistic goals themselves, they like to keep the high dollar items to themselves. Even when you crush sales goals month after month and year after year, there is not even a pat on the back so don't even think about a promotion or raise that's more than $0.35. The goals are unrealistic for the most part. The people are cut throats and the only care about themselves and will steal your commission at the first opportunity. Management has option to give you back your commission, but unfortunately there is so much favoritism, that was never an option for most. This is not the place for real sales professionals, this is not the place to look for a career!"
bad,The leadership there sees you only as a number while just trying to push people on through. The culture created by the employees is great but the management needed some work.
bad,"Honestly the only thing i like about this job, was the people i worked with (co workers) and we got paid every week. Everything else sucked, management sucked and didn't do their job well."
bad,Not the best place to work. Some of the department managers can be very unprofessional and will use their employees as scapegoats rather than accepting responsibility for their departments not making numbers or being up to standard. I'd recommend trying other grocery stores before you work at Fry's.
bad,If you are willing to relocate and work 50-60 hours per week with no set schedule with almost impossible goals to hit this isn't a bad company to be in management for. The hourly employee positions are not bad positions considering you can make about as much as a manager and only have to be over one department.
bad,When I first started I loved it because it was really my first job.The pay was bad. I worked over 20 hours just to get to a 100 dollars then we got paid every week and money wasn't adding up. I felt like I was working for nonthing. I worked other people hours just so I could make more moeny
bad,"Management was incredibly incompetent, pay was low, positions constantly changed, couldn't keep employees. Never had enough people working at any one time, making work incredibly hard."
bad,start work at 4am bale cardboard lift pallets and heavy boxes and make sure the backroom is clean before i leave. Managent was horrible. Job was easy.
bad,"work is physically and mentally exhausting, never hearing about the good things that are achieved, instead only hearing about what needs improvement are the low points of the job.  however the benefits out way the poor management style the company portrays"
bad,"Ring customers up make sure they found everything they needed. "
bad,"A typical day at work consists of standing for long periods of time with a 15 minute break, 30 minutes if u work more then 7 hours. Managers are always on top of you and pressuring you no way to comfortably do your work. Customers can be very difficult and often very persistent on making you mark down something when you're not supposed to and when you do the right thing and don't do it, they get mad and ask for a manager. The manager will come up and make you look like a bad employee and reduce the price anyways against company policy. I do not recommend this particular place of business."
bad,You are constantly expected to go above and beyond for minimum wage pay without much incentive good starting job in high school would not recommend as a career
bad,"Working at Fred Meyer was a good first job, but I would not see myself returning to the company."
bad,"Coming into work you never know what's going to happen, friendly co-workers are the only thing I look forward to working at Kroger, this place has the meanest management I have ever seen anywhere no matter if you work your hardest its never enough. I do however enjoy working with the cool people."
bad,It wasn't for me they don't pay me my last check so I quit . They said the hours didn't match up but I clocked in daily so they never paid me so I quit
bad,"I worked as a department Manager for 3 years with kroger and hated my job 4/5 days of the work week. I loved the people but never had enough help because of company hours being set to low. If you ever work for this company you must expect to work hard and be thrown in as a new hire with little to no training. Management will just expect you to figure it out for yourself. Also, low pay as most people start out as minimum wage unless you have years of experience in retail then you'll get some experience pay. Goals are set to high from corporate and makes it impossible for employees to reach because there is no help."
bad,Kroger tells you a lot of good things during the interviewing process and during orientation but you soon learn that in reality it's all hogwash. People with years of seniority dictate how things work and can basically get away with anything while new hires are left to do all the work with little to no training.
bad,"fast paced work atmosphere, great place for customer interaction. benefits were above average due to the collective bargaining agreement. management is under a lot of pressure."
bad,Working for a retail grocer is a grueling job that is similar to your days back in high school. I was given one office position and found myself doing my job as well as many other positions in the store as well as upper managements.
bad,"Kroger, and as I understand it most if not all retail, is cutting out salary and benefits of all workers, forcing wildly fluctuating schedules, with only the tiniest percentage of the workforce provided opportunity for advancement."
bad,"I like the people that I work with at  Krogers. Since Krogers bought Roundys I haven't had a lunch break yet and its been going on 14 months, I eat my lunch on my way home everyday. Work keeps piling up and there is no end to it, management tells me to work harder. I could put in 60 hours a week and I still would not get there."
bad,Would not recommend management could not keep product coming in to meat the demands and were always understaffed on the sales floor                                                                     .
bad,"typical day would consist of meeting with my team leader and him giving me my task for the day of what needed to be done. This list would vary between either grocery, frozen, and dairy departments.  I would stock shelves for either department.  for frozen and dairy I would unload the trucks we had received that  day.  I would organize and put of the truck to proper locations.  At the end of the shift I would condition the work area for the overnight crew."
bad,"Kroger was an excellent first job, but now that I have more experience I would never go back to work there. The pay was just enough for a college kid with few expenses to live off of."
bad,Didn't really like it. Bad management and little hours. Although the people who work there are fun to work with. Also it was a very easy job to get and was a decent first job.
bad,"The compensation for work at this position is much lower than other locations. Tasks include, bagging groceries, pulling carts into the bay, and helping customers out to their vehicles."
bad,store that i worked at was very playful nobody took the job serious. it was a good store/company to work at until they don't give you the pay you should be getting.
bad,doesn't pay enough money and will try to work u hard with small amount of hours doesn't like for their people to succeed . didn't wont people to reach full time
bad,"Aside from the (expected) hard to work with customers, you have co-workers and management who are unprofessional. I did not enjoy my time inside of this company."
bad,"Working at Kroger was not the best job, but most of the employees treated you like family. The management is always revolving and depending on what department you work on you may work your hardest and get little acknowledgement."
bad,Have pretty good benefits and allows for a fairly flexible schedule.  Company seems to be putting more and more work on employees with less hours to work with. No holiday bonuses like some companies have.
bad,"Management varies but it's generally horrible management.  Terrible advancement policies, takes a really long to get a raise. Only good thing is the schedule flexibility."
bad,"Love to be able to help people"
bad,"It's nice in the sense of meeting people, but management really sucks. Less qualified people get promoted simply because they're liked by management more, but not necessarily by customers. I do really enjoy interacting with customers. I even know a few of them by name. But the management really ruins it for me."
bad,I would receive items off the truck. I would stage them in the correct area. Next I would scan all items with my RF gun then stock items on the shelves. All older dates would be moved to the front in order to sell first before expiration
bad,"its a pretty relaxed place to work although, you wont get a lot of hours. They start you at minimum wage and just about never give wage increases. After two years my wage only increased .15 cents."
bad,"The pay is not something you can live on and the manager of the store and my department lead were not well suited for their jobs. If your job is to stock supplies, keep in mind that this is a physically demanding job."
bad,Sink or swim without instructions. Retail is a fast environment where they are paying associates minimum wage with the expectation that they will work with a sense of urgency. 
bad,"I overall found the work very boring as I prefer to move around. They also rarely scheduled me and wrote me up  and fired me for ""calling out"" when they would continuously schedule me on school mornings, knowing I couldn't go in as I am a high school student"
bad,overall have not had a good experience as being an outside hire to the deli.  i just dont feel the proper training was provided or the support during the transition.
bad,Kroger is good company to work for. I like benefits we get and pay scale. I have great customer service skills and deals with large of money. Answer phone calls.
bad,Kroger's wasn't the best to me when I worked there. It seemed to be a unprofessional place to work. They dump things on there employees and make you stay over your time.
bad,"I have no problem with hard work so long as you are at least somewhat paid properly for it. "
bad,Good job for people looking to get into the work field. Manual labor is required and can sometimes be strenuous on back and joints. Pay is minimum wage but hours are flexible.
bad,Its a good place to work if you're a teenager without a lot of bills you average between 16 - 22 hours. If make friends with management you'll have a much easier time. You have to do a lot of work for minimum pay when compared to other stores that do the same job but pay $2 or $3 more. Management pretends to care but as long as you  don't do anything that can go back to them they'll let employees go about the day any way they want.
bad,There is always two people working together for safety. I learned how to deal with customers and money. I also learned how to train new people and do the store labels and tags.
bad,"When I was working at Kroger, I was the Grocery Clerk. My job was to stock shelves. And it isn't easy, it is a lot of heavy lifting and pulling. So it's a pretty physical/tiresome job to just get paid 7.25 - 7.35 an hour. But I still went to work because I needed to do this job so I can take care of my child but how much they were paying me wasn't barely helping for me to do all I can for my child. But it's not the reason I left, it was something personal that was going on that was interfering in my work life, so I quit. Besides that I loved all my co-workers and sometimes I actually enjoyed my job."
bad,It was ok at first but and then they keep on making that hours shorter and shorter everyday and then sometimes they didn't have me go to work for a week at a times.
bad,"Management needs improvement but a fun experience all together, especially working at the Murrays Cheeses shop."
bad,Worked in the front end. I was in customer service and had to run the front and keep up with breaks. I also had to work in accounting and count all the money every night.
bad,"Not a good place to work for!  No teamwork involved, never gave you a chance to learn their ""ways"" of performing the duties that they required to pull your own weight and no proper instruction in bringing out the best in a new employee!"
bad,"Management was very UnProfessional. No support or guides on your first day. CoWorkers are very rude and unHelpful, sometime do things to make a job harder and take longer. No guaranteed number of hours a week you would go from 40 to 8 with no explanation or advanced notice."
bad,"Front End (Courtesy Clerk, Cashier, Customer Service)"
bad,"Kroger isn't a TERRIBLE place to work, but it's not really a great place either. For starters, be prepared to do a lot of things that are in not in your job description. I was a courtesy clerk, and in the year I worked there I had worked in, just about, every department whether I knew what I was doing or not. I was even unloading trucks. Also the breaks are really short and the management was incompetent; it was almost as if they didn't know what it is that they were doing at all, or just didn't care. The department-heads(supervisors not managers) were rude, and the pay was low, and we were constantly understaffed. Also, there is, really, no room for advancement at all; typically where you get hired is where you stay. They offer great benefits if you're full time, but the chances of you getting a full-tine position is slim to none. Also don't expect any real over-time unless you're a manager or supervisor, and the hours fluctuate if you're part time and are very inconsistent; expect plenty of hour cuts. On the flip side, the coworkers are friendly, and since I was only part-time the balance between my work life and personal life went incredibly well. The work was simple(so long as you don't get moved somewhere and end up having no clue as what you're doing), and the hours are quite flexible. Overall, this is a job you get if you need some quick work experience on your resume, or are still in high-school and need a little extra money, but don't look to this place as a stable career, or means to provide for yourself or loved ones."
bad,Very high stress environment.  Long days and a sporadic schedule make having a life outside of work incredibly difficult.
bad,"Honestly this job is very strange. I have only recently started and they are putting me on 7 and a half hour schedules, just shy of keeping me full time. Managment can be good or bad, but it's mostly pendant on which manager you're talking to. "
bad,"Working for Kroger Corporate has more negatives than positive. There is a lot of information that you must learn in order to be successfully at completing this job. There is a two weeks training class that you have to go throught and you will not learn half of what you need to know to complete this job. So be prepared to fake it until the end. Information within the company is always changing without notice. For the job I was employed to perform, I only had three days of training. Which required way more work than an phone Ambassador. You must be a quick thinker. Meeting metrics, even though some of your cases can hold up to 10 or more extra cases that you do not get credit for. Most of the time, the job is to give the customer a unhelpful answer. Most of the people going through Kroger is unqualified to assist the customer and they will expect you to know everything."
bad,great learning experience but I didn't get the proper lunch and breaks and I am a diabetic but my co workers was great my trainer was wonderful
bad,"My store had a habit of axing off good management and quickly replacing them with people who were, for lack of better terms, insane. Very little creative flexibility at this job; the work is a mindless, routine and management is constantly stepping on workers autonomy. The inexperienced and lazy get rewarded meanwhile some of the best associates got 40 lashings over the smallest of mistakes. The work isn't balanced among department members thus, people get burned out and irritable very quickly. Upper management is nonchalant in their approach to problem solving. Initially small hiccups evolve into huge issues that halt productivity and decrease the quality of the work environment. "
bad,"this is one job, that is very stressful and demanding.  the managers within the department, dont get along well with one another.  causing the battle of the wills.  not enough employees in the department to accomplish tasks that need to be done, to please customers.  having way too many call offs, putting the weight of the employees working of task that need to be done."
bad,"Good start for a first time job, but not a place to make a career out of. The turn over rate is uncalled for and we are always understaffed."
bad,I really didn't enjoy working with the company. Management always had a problem if you did something good and really tried to hard to satify customers to the point where they would lose employees.
bad,"I started working in the fuel center of Kroger almost 3 years ago. I have seen many changes, not so much good changes. I have met and worked with great people, but the management isn't as strong as I thing it should be. I work as hard as I possibly can and make sure everything is the way it should be and every once in a while get a thank you. I make $8.50 and I believe it is not enough for what I do for this company. Honestly I would not mind the pay if I got a thank you every now and then. I also feel like no one is reprimanded the way they should be. They have rules we are suppose to follow yet they let some people slide on something's, I don't believe this is a way a company should be ran. I love having my regular customers. but poor management has became very overwhelming."
bad,"Was in highschool when hired. At first it started out great, however management changed right in the middle of my being hired, had to do alot of interviewing again and paperwork. Working there was fine, however often times there were too many people working, leaving management to send some home early. Also tended to not have enough workers as well. changing hours was a harder task then needed be, and when school sports and  group activities came into view, the store was less than accommodating when looking to change shifts to suit both school and work."
bad,"The most important job, I had was make the customers happy.  I would help them find items, listen to complaints, make sure the cashiers and the utility clerks were doing their job to the best of their ability.  The hardest part of the job, was when the new management, kept changing my job description, day to day.  I love relating to people, and I got to do that and meet some really nice people everyday.  I have always been a multitasker, and this job reinforced that skill."
bad,"The workplace was full of people who had good intentions and were good at heart. However on your typical day, you could expect a massive workload coupled with high tension from the previous workers ending their shifts."
bad,"I've worked for this company for nearly 6 years now and have seen just about $1.50 in raises. The management would rather cut up and joke around that help. If you become best friends with the store management you can get away with pretty much anything. Being a union company sounds nice, but that just means the bad, lazy, do nothing employees are hard to get rid of once they pass their probation period. Half the employees don't want to work and the management wants to throw the rest of the work on top of the good employees who already struggle to finish their work load. Occasionally you will get decent employee discounts, but those are rare."
bad,"A typical day of work consists of loading and unloading the trucks and the product. During the day there would be stocking on the floor, as well as writing an order for the Nutrition Department. I would also cut up fruit and clean the department. Providing good customer service is a must."
bad,"It is only as great as the employee's make it, the company is better to the employee only because it is forced to by a union and completely takes advantage of any ignorant employee."
bad,What was apparently once a great company with a rich history has fallen to rampant consumerism and trade offs for quality. While I am not an advocate for spilling company secrets; my time at Kroger was not a very pleasant one. What passed for health code work was lax and the management cared little about it. Profits were the main concern of many upper managers and while that is the main goal of their market it should not come at the cost of their clients well being.
bad,Building food orders throughout the day. Co-workers was great but management wasn't. Hardest part was lifting heavy things for multiple hours. Most enjoyable part was cracking jokes with co-workers.
bad,"Pick n Save was my very first job. My coworkers were really nice and we all developed a rapport than enabled us to work efficiently and happily. The management saw that we were talking while dealing with customers (and always including the customers in on our conversation) and repeatedly told us that ""you can't work and talk at the same time."" The smiles on the faces of the customers we served told a different story."
bad,A enjoyable day when you're able to serve the customers. The job is hard at all.  The only concern is the management being unprofessional. You're unable to ask questions and get a timely respond. Had to write corporate a few times. Other then that the customers made my day.
bad,Poor management and the hours go up and down every week. There's no job work/ life balance. you will stay productive because of the shortage of staff. It is an easy job. Simple repetitive tasks. co workers are friendly.
bad,This was not my favorite job at all the manager stole from me and fired me for it then the company found out about it so im not a big fan of this job
bad,"A typical day of work would consist of me doing everything while majority of workers don't do anything but sit around. Things I have learned is to have a much better attitude and how to keep my mouth shut even if others are wrong. My coworkers aren't really what you call friends never tell them anything or else it will end up around the store. The hardest part of my job is when they have me doing everything under the sun even if it is not my day to do it, because the other workers are LAZY. The most enjoyable part about this job is when they finally let me go HOME!"
bad,"Get a better job making more money, this job can not pay for anything but food and gas. good bye car, house, insurance, phone, etc."
bad,"I have learned a lot about customer relations and leadership development in my nine years with Kroger.  I have had excellent management teams in the past, but in more recent years the professionalism of management teams that the company has hired in has declined.  So many of my co-workers are unhappy, but the few of my co-workers that are happy; you can really tell that they enjoy what they do.  The most enjoyable part of my job is leading others to reach their full potential within the company."
bad,"busy great place,, people where friendly. Loved working in front meet nice people"
bad,"- go into a checklane, and wait on customers. "
bad,"Your schedule will change each week, High management doesn't care about employee concerns, you'll be brought in as a bagger and "" promoted "" if you aren't fast enough, carts are terrible on hot summer and cold winter days, bottle rooms are always a mess, supervising teenagers who don't want to do anything got quite stressful, too much is placed on the LCC's on the front end."
bad,if you're in college or high school a grocery store is a decent job for you. They were flexible with my schedule but on weekends I always had to stay until midnight. I basically had no life and the staff was quite unappreciative. But I couldn't complain its not the hardest job in the world.
bad,"This is my first job ever and I hate it. Some co-workers were nice but there were people who treated me like I was dumb practically everyday I was there with them, another coworker hates my guts (and I hate hers equally), and on top of it they're basically teaching people to be fake and backstabby to make sure they keep their job. It's sickening. The pay is the only thing that's keeping me here since Bistro pay is quite nice, but I am so ready to leave. This job has made me have two mental breakdowns at least since I've been there. (I started on the 17th of June.)"
bad,"Kroger does care for their customers overall, just one store manager  and co-managers used to make fun of his customers.Depending on what store you work at. Very double standard values when it came to their associate expectations."
bad,Slicing and serving meat and cheese.  Cleaned deli equipment.
bad,good for a short term job but for a career wouldn't suggest it
bad,"This was a nice place to work, but after I had kids they cut my hours so I had to quit because I wasn't getting enough hours to pay my bills."
bad,"I enjoyed what I did when it came to dealing with the customers and the employees I oversaw. However, I was never trained how to do my job. I had to figure pretty much everything out on my own and only found out I was doing something wrong when I got in trouble for it."
bad,fun workplace
bad,This company allows their employes to ask if they can be transfered to other departments. Their is not much room to grow within the company unless you have been there for a long time.They sell a variety of products that are sold as fresh.
bad,"Over all a great place to work, although management lacked in what they chose to stand for, customer service. Had a very difficult time with scheduling, and consistency. They valued the companies needs more than the employees needs, even if it meant being deathly sick and still making employee come into work etc. Many employees were treated very unfairly, including myself. Favoritism places a major role in the store, especially on the front end. We were always very understaffed due to a fast turn over rate within the store, causing chaos and things to be out of order. Also"
bad,"Good part was the pay, bad part was the hours. 45 hours a week with school was too much for me. I started failing in school and I just couldn’t do it anymore."
bad,The hardest part of the job is being limited to what you can and can not do to complete your job. Employees picking and choosing what they want to do.
bad,Wasn’t the worst job ever! But definitely could get paid more for what we do! But other than that the people were outstanding And the managers were always respectful!
bad,"Job is very hard work, being on your feet for 8 hours, plus heavy lifting.  Company is very inclusive of all manner of individuals.  Co-workers were very helpful.  Overall a good company to work for.  Making a customer smile and engaged was what I enjoyed most.  Learned something new everyday."
bad,"Kroger is a great place to work, you feel at home with the people around you, the only thing that sucks is no OT is ever offered and it’s always very chaotic"
bad,This job was excellent until Kroger took over and our hours were cut. This made it very difficult for all of us to even survive. Most of us quit. Was awful.
bad,"Not ideal , pay is not good . They expect too much from you . No work life balance, unless you’ve been there for 30 years. They don’t care! Keep looking ."
bad,They need to learn how to speak to the employees and customers. A lot of people left because lack of communication and how they were spoken to. We shouldn't be forced to do something if it's not within the job description.
bad,"Decent first time job for teenagers. Not good if you need vision or dental."
bad,Employees over worked and unappreciated. Too many bosses in one store and none of them communicated with each other so each one would tell you to do something differently or do something totally different then the others. Too many cut backs. They dont care about employees or customer just the bottom line of getting more money.
bad,"I had no responsibility for anything at the register and had to get the manager for any little slip-up, instead of being able to correct it myself. No living wage."
bad,"High stress environment "
bad,It is difficult to get full time. The company overall is good but the schedule is very inconsistent. the benefits are great if you are looking for part time.
bad,"The job was fine once I got used to it. (It was my first job). It's fast-paced, but that's something you can get used to. I learned proper customer service and work ethic at Kroger."
bad,i really did like working there but i was going throw some personal things and i had to stop due to loss of my husband  . he passed away that year of 2014 and i had to much to do at home and i had to let this job go
bad,Over the years there has always been a high turnover rate. No support from the store management. As long as you would put on a show when the higher ups came in nobody would bother you.
bad,"Fast-paced environment, checked out customers quickly. Scanning items were counted and had to be at a certain percentage. Standing on feet hurt a lot throughout the day."
bad,"A typical day at work for a cashier is going to be somewhat busy depending on what time you are scheduled to clock in. Being at self-checkout, you have to be prepared in case a machine is down for technical issues or whatever the case may be. I learned to have more patience with the general public and I learned how to better multitask when it is very busy and every customer wants/needs your attention all at once. If you have the tendency to get overwhelmed easily , I highly advise against trying to work as a cashier. The culture is pretty laid back and diverse. The hardest part is dealing with the customers when they want tobacco products and most enjoyable when nothing goes wrong"
bad,"It wasn't particular stressful but it was boring and demanding due to poor management, employee communication, under staffing to save money and competition among employees and department supervisors for hours."
bad,Every management is given standards by the company which they simply can't deliver on. Kroger isn't very careful about who they hire. Call offs are very common and there is never enough help.
bad,"I have been shopping at Kroger for years and when I was hired, I liked it at first until it started getting too much. Management was never that helpful with your actual occupation. The pay was average for a grocery store but the hours weren't the best."
bad,"I was a cashier and we always had 3-4 cashiers and 2 baggers. At kroger, the customers expect to have a fast experience because of the baggers. Half of the time, I didn't have a bagger and I would have to bag everything myself and it might now sound bad, but the conveyor belts were designed to go all the way to the end and pile up there, but you can't reach it if you're the cashier. Anyways, the managers would group up and just talk for an hour in the middle of the store. I am not a racist person, but all the employees were black except one other girl and none of them liked me and when i'd try to say hi, they would turn their noses up. It was real hard getting a bagger. There was a bagger that had a crush on me though so I knew when he was there that I would almost always have a bagger."
bad,"It’s an okay job but management sucks , they mess up you’re hours and it’s a lot of complaints with the supervisor jenitra i wouldn’t recommend working here."
bad,"When I worked, in the deli, there were days where there would only be 2 people to work the entire deli and serve customers the food on the other side, and there would also not be enough staff in the back to keep up with issues in the front. Days like this were extremely stressful and often times things did not get done to the unrealistic expectation of management, and there was often very little understanding from management and hardly ever anything done to fix the issue. On the other side of things, management thought that they needed to overstaff during the least busy times rather than the most busy times. Supervisor compensation came in vouchers or coupons for free things, which they thought was appropriate for the stressful and often times debilitating environments."
bad,"Kroger was a surprisingly wonderful company to work for.  Associates were appreciated and work was busy but usually fun.  Recently, the company has been making some changes that are not only detrimental to the staff but are fundamentally against what is needed to provide assistance to the customer.  They are no longer the priority.  The hourly associates and department managers have it rough but the store management is feeling it even worse.  I think the store level management is doing their best to hold it together but the pressures put on them is currently out of control.  I'm sad to see a wonderful caring company lose their way."
bad,Can get very busy and you are always understaffed. Management doesn't know the first thing about running your department but will constantly yell at you. Will be expected to work shifts to cover for managers but not receive additional compensation.
bad,a typical day of work was wandering around the store looking for something to do besides cleaning bathrooms. What I've learned is how difficult it is to get a position different than a utility clerk than a cashier. workplace culture is jus everyone being collectively ready to leave and cry themselves to sleep. the most enjoyable part of the job was watching law and order in the breakroom.
bad,"fast pace "
bad,"I do not wish to talk about it. there is too much pressure on employees. they want you to work twice your ability within less hours and help needed to do so. they need some robots, or really in need employees to say yes to any unbearable situation"
bad,"If you have set hours you need to work because you have a child to worry about don't count on it. The managers will tell you they are flexible and will get you full time hours to get you in the door then not recollect ever speaking to you about what hours youre availing to work. Poor communications and work environment, but the pay is good if you want to be treated like trash!"
bad,"It was a good summer job but I would never work their full time. There was a lot of internal issues going on. Great hours and the work was generally easy. My manager was really good, but the stores overall management was terrible."
bad,"They will make you work every weekend, even if you put you're not available to. Majority of my coworkers were lazy and focused on none important task instead they watched me struggle while I helped service the customers. Also was understaffed all the time which is unacceptable especially on Sundays."
bad,"Kroger grabs your attention with the starting benefits, 3 weeks vacation a year for a starting ASM, 6 PTO's/holidays and full benefits after the first day of the first full month. There is bonus potential but the company makes it so difficult to achieve that no one really makes a bonus. There are so many discrepancies in the rules that they can nail you on any behavior or process. My store manager was awesome, the district and higher management were not likely to be welcoming."
bad,its a decent workplace but the corporate is currently asking to much. they want you to do more with even less than before and the level of tediousness has increased dramatically over the past 4 months
bad,This job has been a great experience for me. It has helped me learn some customer service and how to deal with certain situations. It has taught me patience and now I am ready to go for bigger and better.
bad,"There is not much support from management so it tends to have a negative affect on its employees. The environment at kroger can be filled with so much joy when it comes to handling customers. My favorite part of every day was when I got to interact with customers, however, the hardest part was wanting to go that extra mile to get things done because it was such a hostile environment."
bad,My main store Manager was good. others not so much . I worked so very hard all the time I love to work so  any one bring it on   . Some employees and Managers stuck up  and very rude .
bad,"I worked in the dairy department of kroger, the work was simple but the amount was massive, especially during the holidays. The managers were mostly hypocritical and unfriendly. The coworkers were nice people though."
bad,"Management in my store, and two other stores in Salina were very inconsistent with things they would tell you, and very slow to want to help you. A lot of times people would be scheduled outside of their set availability without anyone asking their permission. When you change titles or positions, there is a raise with it, but you have to scheduled in the new position 51% of the time you are scheduled, they held me back at 48-50% so that way I didn't get my title change or pay raise. Very cheap company that is not concerned about the employees."
bad,"I work at self-scan, after clock in I would fill my work areas with bags and dust them down. I also wipe down the areas keep them neat and clean for customers. I assist customers with their orders throughout the day. At the end of the day, I count my draw, wipe down the area, and restock the bags for the next day's shift."
bad,"consistent changes to the jobs leads to high stress"
bad,"Very, very busy company always changing and trying to keep up with the times.  Never time for home, family always given more work to do with no time to do it.  My job was to help people and I loved doing that but job went online.  Loved the lobby giveaways encouraged you to shop for that item, very good idea, had a large number of friends throughout the company."
bad,I’ve been with Kroger for 5 years and the only way to move up is if you work up front. I still don’t even make $10 an hour after 5 years. The only things I like are that it’s fairly flexible with schedule and some of the people I work with.
bad,Springfield's Ruler Foods is understaffed with a high turnover. The store is overly busy for its size and cannot handle the amount of business it receives as a result. It is not possible for it to be ran the way it needs to be managed as a result.
bad,The typical day was doing what was asked of you. I was the best employee in my department so i was asked to do the most while i was still a student. They didn't take in to concern my college career and left my tired.
bad,"Kroger is a great job for a high schooler, someone in retirement or someone that really doesn’t have any major responsibilities. Definitely not for anyone looking to make this job a main job, the pay is way too low. I work in the clicklist department which can get really busy and it is a pretty good deal of work for minimum wage. The store management place too many expectations and then don’t supply the tools needed to meet them. We are always short on people. The hours aren’t that great and like I said before way too much work for the rate of pay atleast for this department. However the employees and direct supervisors are pleasant and friendly, can’t say the same for some of the customers."
bad,"This may just be for the bakery department, but it was quite stressful, as well as monogamous. Typically, I would get to work, and, if I was lucky, start putting donut dough out on racks. If not, the people before me were most likely behind and I was working on packaging of some sort, and then would get onto setting out the donut dough. From there, I would go onto setting out bread dough onto trays in a very specific pattern. I was told it could be done in 45 minutes flat. It took me two hours. To finish off the night, I had to clean. All of this was done hoping general management didn't come and ask me to do something, and while writing on cakes for customers. The people that I worked with were honestly the most enjoyable part of the job. I met my boyfriend in the meat department and even made a few friends - which is astounding seeing that I'm not a very social person. I learned how to work with stressful coworkers while there. I had one coworker who could never remember what he was told and then claimed he was never told how to do stuff when he was demoted. Working alone or with him were the two hardest parts of the job, as well as when everybody else was behind during the day, which made me behind."
bad,"The overall work environment was okay, however new employees didn't seem to fit in.  Asking questions seemed to be frowned upon, figure it out. Very vague answers from lead personnel. I'm not sure if all dept were this way but mine was. Lasted 30 days......"
bad,"If I took anything away from the job, its that I needed to learn to be more cooperative and more patient. Learned how to manage supply and inventory."
bad,"You are expected to work odd hours and including nights and weekends as well as holidays. Most time off is approved by seniority as well as scheduling. "
bad,"Constant moving and assisting associate and customers, as well as stocking shelves. Learning new ideals from customers and associates. The management team work together to complete daily assignments. The culture is like family. Communicating is a must and the headset provide that extra communication. Assisting customers and associates is the most enjoyable part of the job."
bad,Yet again things where unorganized and the employees did whatever they wanted and did things right under the managements  noses and nothing was ever done to prevent anything that was going on between the employees especially because at the time we had a new store manager.
bad,"Kroger is one of the lower paying retailers for salary positions. Depending on your direct management team, most stores are not terrible to work at, as long as you get along. "
bad,"over 19 years of working for this company, I had many ups and downs... but mostly down when it came to store management and their supporting staff. There is a sever lack of communication from corporate level to floor employees. Policies would change it at one point it took years to get the the workers. (this instance cause loss of benefits for myself and other)"
bad,"worked for Kroger for 17 yrs. Even came back to them after the Army and got into management. Wish someone had stopped me from going into managment. Pay/benefits was great!! Worked more 6 days than i could have ever imagined 50 hour work weeks, lol. More like like 60-70. Still think it a great company, burnt me out after 5 yrs in management."
bad,if you don't like helping customers then don't work for retail. the only day the store is closed is Christmas. They will make you stay late but tell you no Overtime.
bad,"The culture of the Kroger i worked for was horrible. Most co-workers didn't like working there the managers were fine, but team leaders were bad. Its not a place i would recommend to my friends!"
bad,"I cant speak on Kroger chains. I only can speak on what I experienced with there Atlanta (Buckhead store). Located on Morosgo drive.It would be a nice place to work if they were to get rid of the whole management team.Bring on someone with morals and ethics.Outside of that, It needs to be scrapped! As well as the lead man,He needs to be replaced badly.."
bad,"A typical day at work was fast paced, had to work around customers all day and it could be frustrating at times. The main thing I learned at Krogers was the inventory computer backlog which was new to me at the time. Management was always back and forth with each other and were always taking frustrastions out on employees the work culture was good at times, the hardest part of the job was dealing with frustrated management. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting new friends at work."
bad,"It was ok. A temporary job is all it was. The coworkers were pleasant, the tasks were not exciting. But it got me money and that's all I was wanting out of it."
bad,"The most rewarding thing is to make a customer's day. By smiling at them, asking how their day is going. Making them feel important. The regular customers are awesome also."
bad,"Not a bad company to work for, if you have 5+ years to invest in making a decent wage. They do offer benefits to some employees, but not usually in the first year."
bad,Kroger is a company that changes every other week. The corporate management need to do people training for the manager. Train the managers how to relate to there employees. The company in itself needs to increase the wages so people can live and feed there family.I know the people that are working don't have degrees.But when you have been a fixture of that company for over 20 to 40 years you should have a decent living. The employees make the company great.If you rise the wages you will get better help. The company needs to ask the employees what we can do to make this company better.
bad,nice people and very interactive job but the hours weren't enough and the chance at advancement wasn't there. that being said i wouldn't recommend getting a job here as a primary job
bad,"Working in clicklist is not as fun as they make it seem. Going in they tell you its fun, but it is actually very challenging, hard on your back and the managers are rude."
bad,"Kroger had a management position in the Digital Media department that was  a non-union position yet treated as a stocker.  Digital Media  Managers were required to assist another department in stocking products along with union stockers with the direction of a union department head."
bad,Low pay 7.25 despite 15 yrs in customer service. Kroger doesn't acknowledge experience unless you were exchanging money within the last 5 years. Some management walk past you like they don't see you. I mean you can at least speak. A lot of favoritism is shown. I only work part time but I think I will be looking elsewhere. Breaks are short as well.
bad,Most managers I have come into contact withe are due and unprofessional! I have had a maybe two good ones. I wouldn't recommend Kroger unless you absolutely have to!
bad,"Ring up and bag customer groceries. I would help customer with money order, lottery, and western union. I would make change for the other cashier. I would cash pay checks."
bad,Kroger don;t enough there benefits are good but if you are part time it wouldn't be a good idea to put yourself on their insurance because it not a guarantee you will be able to get 30 hour you might get 12 or 20 hours a week depend on how the schedule is made out
bad,"It was fun to work there up to a certain extent. My training was pretty good at the store that I trained at. When i got to my official store, it was unprofessional at first. It got better overtime. They didn't want to change my schedule (I got to school and it's my main priority) and I missed several classes due to the incompetence of them."
bad,Day was busy and very fast paced and the days were great. The bad thing is that i didnt really learn any new skills and the management was seriously lacking in the communication department. The communication issues between members of the management staff is why i am not currently working there.
bad,"co-workers are very driven and determined. Good energy, needs more positive energy. Kroger is overall a good company to work with, great benefits, decent hours and okay pay depending on your position. I Have learned to always think customer first no matter the circumstance."
bad,"Great co-workers"
bad,"Good management, fun co-workers. Great place for a first job, but the pay isn't the best. Overall rating of being a Kroger employee is fun. Depending on the mood of the customers is how your day would go."
bad,Really disliked working here towards the end. Would not follow through leveling me up. Co workers kept to themselves most of the time. Would not recommend working here
bad,When i first started working there 7 years ago i loved it. Lately not so much due to new management and constant change in everyday job tasks. I would not recommend kroger to anyone who wishes to build a career.
bad,"Was there for a short period of time but I think overall the company did have better benefits than anywhere else I have worked and the management team seemed more responsive to our inputs/efforts.  The only hard part were the long hours.  Not good for mental healthy, physical health, and family life.  There is also one big negative that comes to mind...you have to select your vacation 1 year in advance.  I think that is hard to do.  I can understand 5 to 6 weeks in advance but scheduling it 1 year in advance is hard."
bad,It is not a bad place to work at first. It is relatively easy and the pay is not to bad. The really only bad thing after working there for 2 years is management. They simply do not understand how to run a single department let alone an entire store and when things go wrong they just blame it on other people.
bad,"Once you get to the job you walk in go clock in and then you go to the section you work in. Then you would wash your hands put on your apron and start working. I learned how to fry, bake, and make food. The management would always try to help you if you did not know how to do something in your area or answer questions. My coworkers were very hard working and would always push me to make myself better. The hardest part of the job was being on hard surfaces at all times. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I got to talk to the customers and get to see others smile."
bad,"very stressful long hours horrible work life balance. not very favorable to employees "
bad,"good place to work for High School graduate and experience seekers. Pay are terrible, managements are bad and lack of communication."
bad,"Always a Challange. always have smething to do. cant miss a day or your a day behind. everyday is important."
bad,the benfits are great no complaints there. They don't have enough workers to get jobs done. Not very healthy place to work.
bad,"i was always on time. I didn't really like the hours they were providing me, works less then 15 hours. Prepare the register to began ringing out customers. Try to get customers to sign up for the Kroger card."
bad,"As a Manager for this company I was unsatisfied with my time spent there. Very little communication between the directors to the managers and assistants, as well as the lack of training provided to associates when it comes to promotions within the company. On the other hand working for this company gave me to opportunity to verify if I'm a self sufficient person being able to maintain composure in high stress situations; Also in the sense that I taught myself everything I needed to know post/prior to becoming an assistant. Hardest part of the job was dealing with the inattentiveness co-workers ranging from entry to directors, but all in all the customers made the difference day to day, that's why I was there. Benefits are very accommodating probably one of the better things about the company."
bad,"It is nice to shop in Mariano's, but working there is a whole another issue. The management expect too much out of the employees where the employees have to not only go an extra mile for effort, but an extra light year. No discounts for employees or any meal. The break-rooms are always dirty and filthy. Do not mind how the break-rooms are, because you will not even be there for long due to the measly 15-minute break that you will receive. This company is all about appearance. Co-workers are half-decent, because they are your 'struggle-buddies' in the store."
bad,"You can make a lot of friends at this job however, management and especially the supervisors treat the employees unfairly. There is a lot of favoritism at this company, but what do you expect? These people don't perform customer service, so expect negative attitudes. "
bad,"The only thing good about Kroger itself is the benefits, otherwise than that, it's the customers that make your day more bearable.  I've learned to keep a watchful eye and ear regarding some of the store manager's.  Kroger HQ needs to send many of these manager's back to training especially the ones that belittle their associates in front of customers and other associates.  My co-worker's made it more bearable as well to deal with the BS from back stabbing store manager's.  Hardest past of the job was watching the non qualified new associates step up the corporate ladder instead of those that hold seniority to a better position.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the co-worker's, customer's and the punch of the time clock when your shift ends."
bad,I loved my job in the pharmacy. Great time management. No incentive to work hard though. No advancement options. If one person does not do their job then it falls on another tech with no correction for the other person. The company itself is only worried about money. Great place to get experience. Not a place to stay at
bad,"The work hours varies from day to day, which was both a good thing AND bad. After a year or so it turned to a feud between our union and the actual company which in hindsight made it even more stressful to make production. Overall, great pay, but a serious toll on your body."
bad,"It was an ok place to work. Did not like the pay but something is better than nothing. My now ex co-workers were cool, the supervisor(s), management were great and it was good. Sadly, all that was lost when I was let go back in December 2014 because they say that my speed wasn't good enough, even though I gave it my all. But I learned that not everywhere is going to be perfect."
bad,"I worked there for a brief time, and only because the supervisors kept letting the employees who had been there longer use seniority over the newcomers. So basically I was barely working. So with one child at the time (now two), I couldn't afford that."
bad,Working for Kroger's was a experience within itself. very satisfying in some areas yet it lacked in others. that's all I can say about the company I don't know what else indeed wants me to describe about Kroger's.
bad,The Kroger corporation is alright to work for.   The bad thing about working for Kroger is all the drama.  My co-workers are good to be around a lot of them are good company to be around.
bad,A typical day at work is slicing meat and cheeses and selling them to customers. What I learned was customer service and meeting deadlines. Management was varied with the people I get along with. People either like me or hate me and there was some of both. Co-workers were fairly catty. The hardest part of the job was the mealtime rushes. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to the customers.
bad,I've learned a lot from Kroger. Its a small town store. The customers are like family. Coworkers are like family. Union Based. 10% discount.
bad,i was a high school student and over joyed to be working period!!!
bad,Moving up the ladder is possible as long as you keep producing results
bad,The company itself is strict but Managers don't enforce rules and very  good at picking favorites.
bad,good company to work for. good job advancement if you are will to go back to school..
bad,I really didnt enjoy most of my time at kroger.  No real room for advancement and hey show quite a bit of favortism with employees.  At times i didn't feel safe working for them.
bad,keeping up with the daily customers. how to handle picky customers. no management. The co-workers weren't the best. The hardest part was grabbing carts in the snow.
bad,"I appreciate the opportunity to have worked at the Holt Kroger; however, there are very many issues that I do face with Kroger. Management isn't very helpful at all, management talks about you behind your back, they do not get on the lazy workers, but instead expect you to pick up anyone's slack in your department, and because we have so many call in's from employees with a lot of seniority, if you are in the seniority pool you are mainly a call in. I've been working there for over a year now, and I've been scheduled around 16 hours a week, but because I was called in my hours for the week would exceed 30! Also, if you work hard, your efforts are neither rewarded, but they are unappreciated as well. Because Kroger is a union, management has a hard time cracking down on the workers who barely do their job, and instead put the blame and responsibility on those who do. There were times when I was doing job responsibilities of my supervisors. They also play favorites at this institution which makes it hard to stay professional. I have learned to give great customer service, how to help, train, and lead my fellow employees, and also how to multi-task with completing a transaction and handling money in a timely manner; however, despite all the downfalls of this business."
bad,the hardest part of the job was getting to know all the different breads
bad,I did not like working for this company mainly because of my co-workers. I am a very friendly person that is very organized I did not like that the company would let some of the employees be disrespectful to customers and do whatever they wanted.
bad,management: very poor
bad,"A typical day at work for me at this job was getting there at 12 am, and immediately stocking the items in the lock boxes that needed to be replenished. The truck with pallets then came in around 12:30 or 1 am and we alI unload them and put the items in the designated aisles.There was 3 of us, and each of us were assigned certain aisles to stock and maintain. I would then start working on the non-grocery aisle and stock, then face. When I am done with my non-grocery aisles, I'm permitted to help with the Grocery aisles, to speed things up. I also got paid .75 cents more to do that. When the store opens at 6 am, I stock the front end with candy and gum. After all this is done, I do a walk through of the store and make sure that everything is faced, and in the right place. learned how to merchandise very well and how to use a bar code reader. My co-workers were friendly and hard working, but the management on the other hand, i found to be extremely disappointed and not helpful in any way. It might have to do with being an overnight shift and never being able to get in contact due to shift differences. But that was just it, it was impossible to get a hold of anyone. The hardest part of this job for me was the schedule, and getting used to it. It was 12:00 am to 8:30 am or even sometimes later. It took awhile to become acclimated to it, but it is actually very do-able. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was being able to work after hours and mostly alone. While I do enjoy working with people and being excellent at customer service. it was definitely a nice change from the"
bad,clocking in and ringing customers. positive: tuition assistance
bad,A typical day would consist steady flow of customers and patience and balance is the key to overcoming challenges presented. I have learned many concepts of accounting and business services that our consumers rely on to keep them sustained. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that I helped the customers and they are satisfied with my quality of service. My co-workers are work as a team to complete certain tasks and the managers are always there when I am faced with unforeseen obstacles.
bad,"Good benifits, Poor schedueling 4 hours a day for 6 days will not get full time was told by my manager. Must have 30 hours a week for family benefits. will have a job as long as you work part time."
bad,Kroger is a very hard place to work. Work life balance is almst zero. managers are very rude. No one there lovs their job. you should only go there if you have no other choice.
bad,"It was nice to work for this company unfortunately someone made me feel VERY uncomfortable and that is what made me leave, along with poor hours of work and an upsetting paycheck."
bad,Too long ago to write a decent review. I was a student trying to get some side money and it was a part time job as a cashier. It is face to face customer service.
bad,Being a bakery clear was new and exciting. But I was not trained very well and believe I could have done better with more advanced training. But the job overall was not that bad.
bad,"Sometimes my job have me do things that I really don't enjoy doing, but I do it because I don't want to lose my job. They have my work in utility when I should be in the frontend as a cashier."
bad,Save yourself the headaches and donot work here unless you have to use it as a last resort. Its not worth the time you will lose there while they suck out your soul.
bad,Overall Kroger is a decent place to work. The only downside is poor management. The manager doesn't know how to talk to people without coming off as rude and hateful. She cares very little about her employers and more about trying to impress upper management. Pay is also very poor for the amount of work you are expected to do.
bad,I wasn't in love with Kroger. They didn't really care that I was in school when I was with them and they wanted me to put work before me high school education.
bad,"The management was lacking fellow employees were rude undertrained "
bad,"My store was pretty bad but overall kroger is ok. Hours are flexible and if they need you to work you will get hours. They never schedule you outside your availability unless they call you in early and you say yes (if your available). If your a part time courtesy clerk, your pay will hit 9 dollars and stay there. Just do your work and they usually don’t bother you. "
bad,Good place to learn and get experience. Pay could be better. Good insurance and benefits. Works is fast pace in the summertime the winter slows down a lot.
bad,"I worked there for over a year and the union you pay for, does absolutely  nothing for you. You do not get paid for your worth and everyone that I have worked with has hated being there most days from how poor management is."
bad,It's a great company. But management needs major improving! They lack communication and expect way too much on a minimum hours. If you get overtime they try to make you cut it. The only pros about working here is certain supervisors will work with your scheduling. They also have great insurance.
bad,A lot of Management issues there. There was no real organization of how the store should be running. One method would be introduced and the following day another method was introduced. Great work place bad management.
bad,I don't really have anything nice to say about this particular place. i did work there for 9 months but it was purely to pay for insurance and help my parents. The people were rude and they were not helpful at all.
bad,"Kroger is truthfully not an awful place to work, it has a great environment and everyone is very nice and laidback. The problem is it is always understaffed and especially I the pickup department employees are expected to stay over their shift almost every time they work. It can be very stressful, exhausting, and make it hard to maintain a work-life balance. Not really worth it for a part time job. O"
bad,Doesn’t paid well for everything you have to do. I applied for part time hours and they give me full time hours instead. Overall it could be way better place to work at.
bad,"Started off with a great concept for team work and a family friendly environment. Lack of communication, sales, and overall motivation throughout the store location caused a decline in the previous mentioned team work."
bad,Great store and great job opportunity. Loved my coworkers but the managers singled out people by treating them unfairly. Was not offered benefits at the time I was hired.
bad,Management makes good money but has terrible hours switching shifts regularly. The stress from upper management to push your team to succeed is ridiculous considering how little laborers are paid. The company constantly adjusts the stupidest things like how to do paperwork but never fixes the main problem. If you want to hire and retain quality workers pay them more and make it a less hostile work environment.
bad,Kroger is all about getting the most for the least. They want the least amount of people to do all the work that should require many more people than they have.
bad,"I am not a fan of working at Kroger. The management is a joke and I'm treated like I've been working there for years and not 2 and a half months. I'm hardly ever listened to and they never consider my situation outside of work, all that matters to them is ""Kroger, Kroger, Kroger"". It may be the particular location I'm in, so another Kroger may be better suited for me. For now however, I do not enjoy this job. Would not recommend."
bad,"The job was pretty boring and draining, it was my first job I ever had so there really was no complicated work. Due to those reasons I got bored of the job quickly and quit."
bad,The managers don’t care they favor workers. The store I worked at was terrible nothing but stress. Employees were lazy and put more work on theirs co workers and managers did nothing to handle the situation
bad,"Undervalued, unappreciated, too corporate minded, profit hungry, management not very knowledgeable, always trying to protect themselves, not a very upbeat atmosphere, doesn't contribute or match to your 401k, high turnaround because there are better, higher paying jobs."
bad,I worked fast pace. I did cashing and did other jobs like bagging or helping other too the car. I did restocking. It was fun talking too the coustmers
bad,I work for kroger bout a 1years and 8month currently not working for the company anymore and trying to look.for another job as full time and im sigle mom with a 2year old son and really need a job asap
bad,"You'll be busy, tired, and broke. It's ok for a kid starting of on their first job, but not for someone who has experience and needs a good pay for bills."
bad,"No raises, no promotions, the only way you get hours is to go in on your days off and you are consider part time no matter what and no benefits .Sometimes management would try to disrespect you by saying things in a sleek way, but you would have to put them in there place then every thing would be fine"
bad,It was  ok  they never really  told me what was going on as far as why my name was on the schedule but no hrs. The weeks before  that I would only work 4 day with 4 hours  a day
bad,The management at Kroger need a lot of work they are a lack of help and storage of hours customers are great the pay and benefits are as well. But things overall could improve
bad,"For me, not a career choice I’d want. 2 years is enough. A difficult job if you have a bad back, knees, etc. For social anxiety, it can be stressful and overwhelming. Customers can be hard to deal with. The pay could be worse, but you could do much better easily at a different job."
bad,Very upsetting place to try to work in. you're overworked treated unfair and overall expected to do the work of 2 if not even 3 people within a very small timeframe.
bad,Typical intern activities were done such as filing and copying documents. Drove to different local stores for various training and shadowing managers.
bad,"The Kroger Company is huge. It's market share of the grocery retail space is enormous, but the years of growth are behind it. Kroger struggles to competitively care for its associates, and finds retaining them difficult. Its leadership and strategies are antiquated, as demonstrated by its falling sales, stagnating stock, and fleeing employees. Kroger fails to provide anything close to an adequate work/life balance, which leaves associates feeling stressed, unappreciated, under-compensated, and frustrated."
bad,"There were clicks and you better be in one.  Store manager"
bad,"Almost every aspect of working as Utility at Kroger was just not pleasant. The job sucked, the payment sucked and the management was even worse."
bad,"Would not recommend anyone working for Kroger. Has went downhill, and fast. Upper management is led by people that have zero idea how to run a business. If you miss one process in an 8 hour shift, you get wrote up, and they still expect you to get everything else done too on no overtime."
bad,"My specific Kroger experience working was not quite where it should have been. This would most likely fall under the category of my specific store rather than the whole company. This store didn't entirely hold the values we were trained to follow in. There was an uneasiness. It did not work as a team, but rather a race. It seemed like the majority of employees were against one another. Leadership did not hold the qualities I typically look for and did not seem to adjust to help those around."
bad,The company as a whole has changed a lot. Very paranoid about their appearance.  The customer is always right in every situation.  Do not take employees feeling in consideration at all.
bad,"I worked at Kroger for almost 2 yrs it was OK when I started, but slowly turned bad. The pay, is horrible it isn't a livable wage even if you do get overtime. Experience pay is a joke, along with the new union contract. (Hence why I left.) They expect you to work yourself to death, and you get nothing in return. It is extremely hard to move up in this job. They say so much about seniority but when it comes down to actually advancing, along with your hours that doesn't matter in their book. They take money out of your checks to be part of the union which isn’t even helpful. Supervising on the front end is just a glorified bagger position. Supervising once was about keeping the flow of the check lanes and making sure there was no backups. It ended up turning into an extra person going in for cashier/self checkout breaks, and bagging in between. Originally, they did not want supervisors going in for breaks - and if they did a manager was to come to the front and then take the place of supervisor momentarily. That wasn't ever followed in my time there. A few of the service desk workers were lazy as well. If a cashier needed a bagger, the desk workers were supposed to come help bag - if there were no customers at the time at the desk. There was countless times of me checking and having to bag for myself, while the desk workers stood back, watched and talked amongst themselves. The work environment is toxic, and coworkers are fake.There is always constant drama, and if you do one thing wrong, or make someone mad, there will always be someone talking about it behind your back. Kroger"
bad,"I’ve been working at Kroger for a while now and I feel its time for me to find something better. Working at Kroger has not been all bad , sometimes I enjoy my time being there. I have customers who come in who I have grown a connection with which always good. The pay at Kroger is still very low and its something that i can no longer accept. Management team is always replaced which is unfortunate when you get use to them."
bad,"I worked here out of high school and it was kind of fun. Just a standard retail job, people seemed to work when they felt like it -- which I guess means you could too."
bad,"Tha company is ok, I just need more money. Teamwork is good. The people I work with are very nice. The hours are not guaranteed I guess because I'm part-time. Some people have come in and make more money than I do."
bad,I worked for bakers as my first job I eventually stopped when I had school the hours weren’t really flexible and I couldn’t get the days I needed off.
bad,"I was not paid enough or I didn't get paid the amount I deserved. Some of the front end managers are very rude and have many power trips. The store managers don't really care about their employees. Everyone is treated differently, depending on how well you are known in the store."
bad,"Working at Kroger Part time has been a good learning experience for me. It taught me valluble customer service skills and how to deal with difficult work situations,"
bad,Went to work for Kroger.  They were supposed to transfer me to Colorado springs.  A month later and I am still waiting without a job.  Still haven't received last paycheck.
bad,Working for Kroger as a produce associate was pretty easy. There was usually a floor plan involved for were what food went were. I learned that fresh food is important and making sure to follow all the food rules for people to stay healthy and safe one step wrong could cause problems as I learned from out breaks of crops brought into stores.
bad,"Kroger is great if you're 16 or 17, looking to get your first job to pay for your car gas or something similar. The pay isn't great and the hours aren't flexible, but hey, it's a job."
bad,"Poor management, they dont care about your personal life, they cut hours from people who were hard working, decent people and didn't think about how it affected them"
bad,"They cut hours therefore less help and also pile on more responsibility with a lack to tools to work with. Management is not consistent or enforces policy. Miracles are expected,  Poor rate of pay therefore turnover is very high."
bad,"This was my first job as a college student. It was ok, but it took a long time to grow with the company and they cut hours allot. Liked the people I worked with."
bad,"A difficult company to work for but job security seems to be strong. Kroger is a union company, which can be a good thing or a bad thing.  Pay is not enough for the pressure you have to endure. Little or no support from upper management."
bad,"New Management made it a horrible place to work. I loved my job and my coworkers but when the new management came in, it went down the drain. It became more stressful than it was worth."
bad,"It really came down to who you worked with. There were no activities for team building. Work was just work, there were no review periods or bonuses. Yep."
bad,"The entire clicklist program was an absolute mess. From top to bottom, store manager to lowly grunt, it was an absolute mess. It wasn't even the fun type of wreck, either."
bad,Very poor bottom of the barrel working place. It's a starting job however as a courtesy clerk you're treated as if you're less than human. This should be a job as a last resort starting job. Especially if working with customers stresses you out.
bad,"This was one of my first jobs. This was a miserable job. I worked in the winter and had to obtain carts on a daily basis. I guess as a 16 year old this was an ok job, however it was very boring."
bad,stocking shelves and sweeping. super mean manager. acts like your not a person who had a life. doesn't care about family very very rude and untrustworthy
bad,"A typical day at work includes bagging items for customers all day and when its your turn to bring in the carts, you have to bring them in for an hour, bringing in 6 carts at a time."
bad,"I started out with good hours, between 25-29 a week. Then corporate cut only bagger hours and now I have only 12-17 a week. I would not recommend this job for anyone with bills."
bad,"A typical day at work for my role was to bag customers grocery's that would enter my isle, when the store would start slowing down i would be sent to stock items and put merchandise back in the produce section."
bad,At first I loved my employment there until management and associate advances hanged then the atmosphere in the store changed and made it more complicated to enjoy being an employee.
bad,unorganized and not very caring of their employees as they profess  they do. they don't give raises that can compete with other companies in the area.
bad,"The management is very unprofessional, while most supervisors and managers are young they dont act professional  . The pay is great and benefits are better than most jobs."
bad,"When I worked there a few years ago management was terrible and always agitated, coworkers were unhelpful to both other coworkers and customers. There is just a vibe of everyone hating their job and it rubs off, whether the job itself for you is bad or not. Courtesy Clerks however definitely get the short straw; lowest paid and the ones that are asked to do the most."
bad,"As a part timer and part time student, I was working early morning shifts into the evening putting me at 72+ hours a week, filling in for management positions and running departments without the pay or benefits. I was constantly exhausted and my health started to deteriorate from the stress and strain."
bad,The appomattox Kroger building is extremely old and a lot of things are falling apart and are not functional anymore. You get payed almost nothing to do hard manual labor.
bad,"overall, i enjoyed working here. the customers and co-workers were very nice and helpful. management was okay. flexible with schedules and worked with your availability."
bad,"Ok for a starter job, but not worth going back. I learned data entry, customer service, ordering, returns. Management was the hardest part aside from rushes. It sucked if a mistake was made because the pharmacist would call you out in front of customers and coworkers."
bad,"I worked at Kroger for four years, it wasn't the bst job but it was ok. long hours and even longer during holiday seasons. the only holiday you have off is Christmas. the hours are kind of flexible but not too much. the pay didn't match the work put in."
bad,"I worked under the e-commerce/clicklist department and let me tell you worst thing I could've done. They over worked you and pay  VERY little. I feel as though you are a PERSONAL shopper for someone,  you're running all over the store getting various things for people only to receive $7.55 and hour?!(that is what they offered me). I find that totally ridiculous and unfair. If they wanna continue this service they need to pay more and get better management."
bad,"Overall, this is an okay place to have your first job. However, you'll quickly realize how irritating and annoying it is to work at a place like this."
bad,Kroger’s is a good place to shop at and some locations are decent to work at. They just need to update the stores and have more advancement opportunities. If you have more experience then required you should start out more on the pay.
bad,"A typical work day i restocked produce items keeping the area clean for the customers. greet the customers as they come in."
bad,"I particularly did not like this job.  I have a lot of friend who work at Kroger and love it.  the particular Kroger that I worked at was not very understanding of my ADHD, Autistic, and Anxiety faults."
bad,"Kroger intentionally pays less than their competitors because they want people to work for them based on the idea that ""its an awesome place to work"" actual quote from a management meeting. Not only that but their wages aren't anywhere near what cost of living is in the area."
bad,"Terrible way to spend your life if you are considering staying here for months on end, maybe even years. if you need the extra money then so be it. but I recommend going somewhere else. Low pay. Idiotic customers etc. Cause here at Krogers they have a ""Customer first policy"""
bad,The corporation is becoming more profit oriented and trying to follow other corporate Pharmacy models . As such working conditions and pay scales are deteriorating.
bad,"In Kroger pharmacy as we can't compare with hospital they different operating system for dispensing medication path and many customers with insurances ,medcaid ,medicare"
bad,Im just ready for bigger and better things. Its a good job and had held it for years. It is flexible and understanding.  Its can motive and yet dissapoint.
bad,Management does not have any people skills to speak of. The workplace culture is not a positive one. The hardest part of the job is trying to maintain composure while be directly and indirectly disrespected as a human being. The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting and connecting with new hires.
bad,I enjoyed working with other's and enjoyed helping our regular customers. But the pay is way to poor to make a career of for a working family and raises were like a five cent raise after an entire year.
bad,High turn over rate and temporary status of many coworkers added to stress. All leadership positions and management were stressed and managers seemed to be over worked. My positions helped me to learn how to manage people while resolving customer service issues. The stressful atmosphere involving customers did help create a team like attitude among the more permanent employees.
bad,I enjoyed my time with Marianos/Kroger. They always gave me the opportunity to make my schedule and move up if it was something I was willing to work for.
bad,"store manager was mean and evil. they didn't care about working with your outside activities, breaks never giving on time, only thing I enjoyed about working here is I got to meet a lot of different people everyday"
bad,"Always had a problem with taking time off and it being ""my fault"". The online schedule was down more than half the time I was there not exaggerating. Wouldn't recommend"
bad,At the beginning everything was going fine but a few months in they started to make me work 6 or sometimes 7 days and it would always be short-staff in the evening.
bad,Pick n save was a ok place to work at because the pay was very low and they cut my hours a lot. And the hiring manager was not honest with me in the interview.
bad,"Love the customers and the coworkers in my department. I am loyal, dedicated, bubbly but feel that I get taken advantage of because of my personality."
bad,"Management was poor at my location, drama was imminent and no one seemed to know what they were doing. Scheduling was always a problem for many employees when management wouldn't listen to their needs."
bad,"Worked the deli counter. Management was way too lax about certain issues, such as the overly toxic 'seniority' culture that deli clerks developed. Clerks that had worked there for longer would think that they have more power of clerks that just started or only worked there for a little while. It was incredibly disheartening to know that you couldnt rely on a clerk because they felt entitled to do whatever they wanted to do because theyve been there longer, and would sometimes answer a request for help or a request to do something for you with a solid ""No, i have seniority, you do it."" Other times, management was way too strict about certain things, like needing a load of boxes loaded up into the freezer from the truck port in 5 minutes on the dot. Ridiculous, and an overall bad job in general."
bad,When you work part time for them they make you work full time hours and don't give benefits. Then when you have to work another job to make up the difference they still expect you put them first.
bad,"my opinion is the store needs lots of full time workers who are willing to work at any positions, they needs help, and they don't treat peoples right, and they don't care if you get hurt or not. the end"
bad,"great job and training received,  Fast paced atmosphere, maintain precise medical dispensing.  Work environment fast pasted, several stations to learn, process pills, assist customers and have prescriptions entered in the pharmacy software."
bad,a typically day at Kroger  was slow then ends up busy to the point mangers have to jump on the register to have the line die down . The mangers were ok.
bad,"I show up at 10 pm, clock in and start sorting store merchandise. Once all the merch. is sorted we pull all the pallets onto the sales floor and proceed to work the product onto the shelves until we break. After our first break, we return to work and continue until our lunch break which is 30 minutes. From there we work what product is left, take trash to the back and then condition our assigned aisles and then an hour before we leave we receive our last break and then at 6:30 am we clock out."
bad,"Handle cash, credit, and debit transactions for each customer as needed. Organize and ensure customer goods are properly contained. Provide additional assistance to customer cars upon request  or personal judgement of load. Generated profitable income by creating the perfect shopping ambiance."
bad,"I am a strong minded person, so when the managers started getting belligerent, we kind of butt heads. I then realized that they didn’t even know how to manage. Me and a few coworkers were going to work when told, clocked in and out when we were supposed to, and got nothing. Kroger claims to be pro moving up and raises, however I saw no pay increase when the time came, and I saw no higher position offered."
bad,"The Kroger Corporation treats employees well, offers benefits and positions to help those in need of employment while helping take care of their families. However, as in many jobs in California, the pay and hours are not a feasible income for one to create a life and help others to their best ability."
bad,"Good people to work with, great job for people in high school or trying to make it through college. Had multiple issues with management, the store went through many different managers in the time that I was working there. If you are a good and reliable worker they will over use you."
bad,I worked at kroger for about a year during high school. It was a good job in a sense where it made me want to go to college so that I wasnt working there for the rest of my life. The only good thing was the co-workers and the free pastries that were some times in the break room other than that I would not recommend this job to anyone
bad,I joined up and took overnight crew because it offered a dollar above the base rate. my co-workers who were several times my age. The workplace culture was fairly abrasive.my coworkers were unhappy about a younger worker blowing in pulling the same level of work as some of the 30+ year veterans. Pay/benefits were contractual and favored years over merit.
bad,"Within less than three years of employment, I received four promotions. I often felt that my work was left unrewarded, but they were quick to promote those who put in hard work for the company and are willing to learn."
bad,This job was very stressful and I don't really recommend this job to anyone with anxiety/ depression because they will not understand and they'll make you feel bad about it
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of cleaning our carts, getting the order and quickly moving through the store picking all the items needed for the customers. I learned a lot about time management and how to handle unexpected issues that pop up. I enjoyed most of the people that worked there and the overall very fast paced work, but there were some supervisor changes and people considered for promotion for the openings. When that happened I felt like the department became very hostile. Anyone that was rumored to get the spot competed with others and reutinly got in arguments or targetted others to get an advantage. There were people more qualified for the job, but I was told they weren't allowed because someone else has seniority within the union. I was personally targeted in the ruckus that occurred, even though I was not considered for any promotions nor wanted any. In the end, I left due to the hostilities and what I perceived as the managers trying to fix it, but unable due to their restrictions from corporate and the union."
bad,"I worked as a bagger sick and still would have to go outside and get carts, working as a Cashier wasn't bad it was jus a little boring waiting for a customer to come to your lane if the store wasn't busy, and working as a Deli/Bakery associate was a little stressful dealing with customers, employees, and complaining super advisor. The hardest part was win chicken went on sale and 50 or 100pc orders during the weekends. The best part sadly was putting in a two week notice."
bad,Most of the people I came across were pretty friendly but there were some customers and employees who really didn't care for others and were rude for no particular reason.
bad,"low pay, only part time employment and inconsistent schedules."
bad,"It was a decent place to work while I was in college, flexible scheduling, etc. But I currently work in a very toxic department. Store management was involved with trying to fix the toxicity but nothing has really changed."
bad,Kroger is just a job until I get a job that I went to school for. Kroger is a very routine job. it's all physical work. The job itself is very simple not mentally stimulating. it's not exactly splitting atoms.
bad,The company itself is not too bad but they only want part time employees so they do not have to offer benefits. I did enjoy working with many of the employees and still shop there weekly.
bad,"I love working as a cashier i really have to use my math skills which is fun. "
bad,I didnt have much help with anything from the management my schedule was all over the place and most of my co-workers almost did nothing or as little as possible
bad,"Kroger used to be a place where work-life balance mattered. No longer. Employees of all levels are expected to drop everything and run for Kroger. Instead of a people oriented company who is customer-driven, the company has become solely focused on numbers."
bad,Circumstances that I had   With transportation  and I needed to get some time off away to focus on my  school work but  they where kind of bad to because of pay .
bad,"Nice staff and good people. Although, very outdated office with outdated equipment and needs a remodel. Definitely not in line with current trends or industry standards."
bad,Growing up in a small town is hard when there aren't many job choices. This was technically my first job and I was treated very unfairly. It was mostly the union dues and my age of 17. It cut my pay by half of what an adult was paying and I was still paying large amounts of union dues that I shouldn't need to pay. The job was stressful and I hated it. I now work for a competitor and lets just say that competitor is winning.
bad,Kroger was not a bad place to work because you got to meet nice customers and had great conversations with them the amount of business card that were given to me was lovely. I did not care for being micromanaged all of the time and I also did not like being slighted by coworkers because I was new
bad,"This place was one of the worst places I have ever worked. I worked there when I was in high school, trying to save money for college. They gave me a 25 cent raise in 2 years. Pathetic."
bad,I was a stocker at Kroger.  I was able to expand my customer service skills.  Most difficult aspect of the job was the short shifts at random hours making it difficult to schedule appointments and life activities outside of work.
bad,It's not a bad company to work for. I was promoted within weeks for my work ethic so they do notice hard work. It just wasn't the job for me its more for retirees an highschool and college students
bad,"Kroger's is a great place for someone just getting their first job. They provide a decent health insurance and dental insurance. The staff there are like a big family. The job itself can be stressful at times and slow during the other times. Management can be strict, depending on who's working throughout the day."
bad,"Typical day at Kroger, is simple, mundane, and monotonous. Management seemed less than interested when an employee needed assistance. managers who were helpful, were never around."
bad,"Busy, posting monies from different insurances to Pharmacies, Working and meeting great people, outside of manager.Hardest part of job was being belittled and Cursed at by manager.Never acknowledge of work well done but pulled into office daily for non work related issues/pettiness"
bad,"Poor management, no succeeding employees were very rude a lot of unprofessional employees and I was hired at Midwest Title Loans. I received new job better workplace"
bad,Kroger was a good place to work and gain knowledge to further my career in both the retail and private sector. It provided  challenging yet rewarding opportunity.
bad,You will work a minimum of 50 hours a week.  Management pay is low compared to similar jobs in the industry.  Little to no work-life balance.  Benefits are good
bad,Not any place you want to have a long term career. The customers suck and everyone higher up than you treats you like the dumpster out back. This is for teenagers only.
bad,This is a job for someone in high school looking for a first job. They do not advance their people well enough to make a career out of it. Stores are paid differently depending on location.
bad,"As a first job, Kroger was really easy for someone new. Unfortunately, the slow days and lack of career advancement was not setting a good example for my future careers. There were too many times where I had to do work that my fellow coworkers decided not to do, and yet they were given raises despite my efforts to show that I was a hard worker."
bad,"Management was negative towards suggestions and people who had higher levels of expertise within the department. They were not supportive, and gave worse roles to people who were coming from experienced roles."
bad,"I haven't started working here for too long at all. But for some reason one of the managers never put me on the schedule for a whole week. And when I do come to work I feel like I keep on getting picked on, I don't understand what I'm doing wrong and I've also asked what I can do, to do a better job. But I still feel like I'm getting treated like I'm not doing anything right. It makes me not even want to come to work, but I've talked to management and we will see how things will be taken care of. I really need a job to pay for bills, but I don't want to come to work, to be treated like this."
bad,"Walton, Ky Kroger put too much pressure on its employees to perform and out do all others in the districts. Employees who had part time positions were working over 40 hours a week with no benefits. Employees were often criticized for mistakes and rarely praised for good work."
bad,This would have to the last option for when it comes to jobs. If your in high school and looking for a job then yes this is great but besides that than no.
bad,"You have to deal with rude customers, and you get don't get paid a ton, but for a teenager who needs spending money it did just fine for me. It's a good job for high school students."
bad,"If You ever want to revisit high school, work at Kroger. Hard work is rewarded with a small chance of a bonus, a sticker for your name tag, and maybe a new work shirt. There is a high degree of attrition, which makes morale suffer. Rarely is there ever a moment of this job that could be considered truly enjoyable."
bad,I have work for kroger about 4 years. and i would like to take my chances and get started with a new job. Its a well balanced job. I have alot of experience in working in two different departments. the culture is every different race and nationality . There is no hardest thing to do at my job. Its a okay part time job. Its so many managers you deal with different people every day u need people skills to work at that job u always supposed to help a customer and be very friendly to others and your co workers.  Just do your very best.
bad,I feel as though Kroger does not not value their employees as they should!  We should be at the top of the pyramid!  Valued and appreciated and given raises that are due.  I havent worked there very long but all employees seem so unhappy!  On the positive side they do give you 2 fifteen min. paid breaks. and after a year you eligable for benefits if you keep your hours up.  Seems like quite a long time to work before benefits are offered.
bad,"It's a good job to have for your first job. The pay is adequate with some great benefits. That being said, good luck on ever trying to move up. The management is nice to your face and aren't horrible people, but when it comes to being promoted it's an uphill battle that you're going to lose. The only way to move up past supervisor is to leave and work at another store. When it gets to upper management it's all outside hires."
bad,"The hours were horrendous, the managers were rude, the policies were bologna. So much chaos for such a huge company and location. Too much friendship to remember you're at your job. Not best friends house."
bad,"Everyone is welcoming, and it's a comfortable place to be. Overall they should focus on more ways to improve like the well-being of the employees and their lives."
bad,The job was very boring. It is very boring which makes it extremely boring which isn't a good thing. And it's also really boring. The worst thing about this Jong is that it's very boring
bad,"operation,sales ,hiring,daily wage budgets,store conditions,profit & loss,scheduling of 150 associates weekly,training new & old associates and customer service........a typical day."
bad,I am now to the point in my job duration where I am not questioned on why I do the things I do because I am doing things for the betterment of the department and store as a whole. I started that job with plenty of help and we were able to go 100% on tasks instead of having to multitask and not going 100% on many different things because of lack of help.
bad,"They were always under staffed, so I was scheduled twice the amount of hours than what I wanted. I was in highschool and I worked almost everyday. The customers were very disrespectful. I was paid not very well. I was barely trained for most of the things I was doing there. Would not recommend working here."
bad,"worked there almost a decade ago, had to carry the weight of the department i worked in.  the union helped keep miserable and less than average workers around. there was a sense of accomplishment after a days work though. overall it was an okay experience"
bad,Originally stated to work there part time because I was still in school was quickly increased to 40 hours a week sometimes more. I usually had to close with no help every night.
bad,The Managements will tell you anything to get you to work them but turn around  and not honor to work you that is if you are in school.The Managements are never happy with nothing you do and always putting the blame on someone else.Most of the costumers are always happy are give you good feedback.
bad,job was job was bad job was not fun workers were old and bitter about job and life was hassle to deal with them and their old ways with job too old job for young job like me
bad,"I worked various positions with Kroger, even in different states. I worked in the drug gm department including holding an assistant manager position. This job was not a fun type job. Aside from customer service, it's just alot of stocking and freight. I did assist in opening a new store, which was fun. There, I became a merchandiser, which I enjoyed.  Most of the management that I encountered were not very nice or personable. This job was just not a good fit for me."
bad,Krogers is a great store with great customer service. Everyone is nice and polite and it's easy work as long as you  try and get your work done!!!!!!!
bad,"The place itself was a decent place to work at, with friendly people( for the most part). In terms of management, you can tell that there are people who are favored over others, which made pleasing any person within management pretty hard."
bad,"During my typical workday, I was personally responsible to make sure the GM section of the store is well-stocked for our customers. Assisting in receiving, storing, and stocking of products while ensuring proper product rotation and quality. Building that ""team"" mentality, nothing beats individual attention when it comes to individual motivation and leaders set the example. Employees feel included and in the loop on important decisions , was a family culture and excellent support. I personally was familiar with all the tasks I have performed after couple weeks - love, comitment and determination to my job made every impossible task into possible one. Having a great manager and obliging colleagues at work."
bad,"Better management, typical day is customers shopping, workplace culture is at a fast pace, most enjoyable part is helping customers, hardest part is disrespectful customers and managers."
bad,"Area was very bad, to much was going on with the some of the customer coming in stealing. Night supervisor was very rude to workers and customers at times."
bad,If you enjoy customer service and hard labor of kitchen cleaning and organizing this will meet those needs.  There is never a dull moment in the Deli!
bad,The managers were not nice at all. The workdays went by slow. There was no hard part to this job. My coworkers were real nice
bad,The company overall has great people and great business. The environment was very nice and it was open. The call volume was pretty high so it made my job a lot of fun.
bad,Krogers was not for me. I really had a bad experience. The customer and co workers were very rude. The boss treated me unfairly at times. I worked there as long as i could.
bad,"Many people at Kroger were very kind. Management and co-workers were pleasant, especially the manager himself. Unfortunately, this is one of the busiest Krogers in the state,which means the workload is difficult and the supervisors are tough. The supervisors are usually very strict, needlessly so."
bad,This place had a lot of drama. As far as work it is easy money. They hired any and everybody. The hardest part about going to this job was dealing with the coworkers. I'd rather deal with the customers which was the most enjoyable part of the job.
bad,I was misled when I was hired.  I was being hired for Receiving Clerk but was hired as a cashier until the receiving clerk job was available.  The store hired from a different store.  Some of the people are great to work with they explain things to you so you have a better understanding as to why things are done the way they are.
bad,"Kroger was a fun and easy learning environment. The people I worked with were awful, so I don't plan on going back, but it was a great place to work."
bad,"If you are in high school or in college this will be the place to work."
bad,They need more caring managers.I didnt really enjoy it. My manager was rude ... More customer assistance. Better baggers. Cleaner bathroom's
bad,Management was very rude to its staff. They were very unsympathetic to staff personal conditions. Regular customers could be very rude at times.
bad,"I did not like working for this terrible place. This place is not a place to work at if you are under 18.They under pay you, over work you, treat you like trash."
bad,"Whatever you do, do not go into management. The stress is not worth it, especially with the company now accounting for every cent over their ""budget."" I used to be a regular associate, and that isn't terrible. Flexible hours and cheap insurance. However, management is an entirely different, horrifying story. Hours are constantly spread thin (and continue to plummet) and all management does is complete audit after audit with no plan to actually help the departments in these areas of concern. Kroger has become petty to the extreme and is micromanaging their associates to the point that people are quitting or stepping down left and right."
bad,"I had full time status, Kroger management kept giving me 20 hours instead of the minimum of 32. I stuck with the company so long because of friendly co-workers but eventually I switched to another position in the store and management was still as bad."
bad,I normally worked morning shifts which consisted of stocking the fruits and vegetables on the tables for the day. I learned how  much hard work can help you advance in the workplace.
bad,"It was well a job that's busy from the start to finish. I've learned alot about presription drugs and all the interactons within each and different drugs. The management was great, my co-workers was such bug help when I was learning."
bad,"I worked harder than most people, got paid the same. Not worth it. The carts are heavy and are taller than me. Feet hurt at the end of the night. Gets brakes regularly though."
bad,Depending on the department you work in the environment is decent. Very bland job. When you just get hired you get the worst hours because it's by siniority
bad,"this job is mundane, and not very rewarding, you'll have no authority or chance for advancement if you aren't within the company for a long time"
bad,This was not a job for me. I didnt like how dull and boring it was. Im more of a physical person and do not like to be in doors all the time so this was not a job for me.
bad,a typical day at work helping in each department taking care of store manger needs making sure customers come first overall its just a job
bad,"This position has very limited room for advancement. And when the advancement opportunity comes, it usually takes about 3-5 years. Pay is weak, and travel is extensive."
bad,"While working here, it was slow at times while busy at other times.  The hardest part of the job was getting buggies from outside."
bad,The main boss isn't the best at all.. He doesn't speak to many people unless your a favorite.. Workers there are sometimes stuck up.
bad,I worked there for two months due to the fact that I lived in Marysville and worked in Powell so the gas was horrendous on my pocketbook.
bad,"Working in produce is very physically taxing, it's not worth $7.25 an hour. But benefits are good, and management is hit or miss, but over all good. Being 20 while working with people almost 3 times my age is a big depressing. It's a good first step for me I guess."
bad,I did not like this job at all. Where I worked I experienced a lot fo sexism and favoritism.  I left only after 3 months along with another girl because we knew we were being treated poorly.
bad,Filthy environment and unacceptable attitudes. But great food and food service associates but front end is terrible and unorganized .
bad,"Provides the highest level of prompt and friendly customer service; greets and thanks customers"
bad,"nothing much to say here, meet a lot of cool people some i wish i haven't but it was all a learning experience. hopefully I would never have to run into that again!"
bad,Kroger's is a good place to work. Kroger's could pay their employee's better. I wish that Kroger's hired their employees full time instead of part-time only.
bad,Kroger is a good first job. its gives you an idea of what its like to work and helps your build customer service skills. Builds your strength and character.
bad,The managers and employees wont speak to you unless youve been there for years and have formed a click. Your like invisible and noone introduces themselves. The break room is absolutely filthy. The job is a work out and you stay busy all the time.
bad,"one day I was scanning a customer out they had a alcoholic drink and Kroger's was very strict about I.ds for alcohol, so one day it was just one of those customers and she got very upset that I did it ,finally got her to go to her car and show me I.d my the time I was done cashing her out I apologize and explain how concern Kroger's was about underage drinking and how unsafe the world is without rules and she began to understand exit with a smile."
bad,Kroger is very under paying of a position that requires education and that you have to test for in order to be a Pharmacy Tech. Also they do not pay for education what so ever.
bad,it was a good place to work but I don't think there was an opportunity to grow with the company  and I don't think they ran the story very well and they had a lot of gossip and a lot of complaining there
bad,Its a decent first job but you'll grow tired of it after about three weeks. They don't have enough people so you have to work extra hard to get your duty's done.But it is a good resume builder and it will give you an opportunity to start your savings. And the people are nice but the job itself is horrible.
bad,"This place was not at all what i thought it to be. Management isn't really for us, I actually will be glad when I get another job opportunity."
bad,"really not a great place to work. Great starting job. Management was terrible, never available when you needed them. Career advancement  takes potentially few years to advance to another area."
bad,Horrible pay I worked my as# off just to get harassed by several co workers I worked and went to high school had to stop because it was to stressful and my grade dropped I would not suggest anyone to work there
bad,"typical day of work consists of ringing up customers, bagging groceries, and sometimes even going out to the parking lot and getting carts. Management was horrible."
bad,"Honestly, working here wasn't that exciting. I didn't see any opportunity of advancement, and the management wasn't very communicative with the front end. As a cashier and service desk representative, I learned on my own how to talk to the customers. On the bright side, it was always nice because I got to meet new people every day."
bad,I did not like working for Krogers. The management team was not good at all. They were mean and expected me to learn everything so quickly but did not want to train me properly.
bad,Every store is different.  However the one I worked at wasn't the best of stores.  Store management was awful.  I worked there for YEARS and they never got my name right.  They didn't appreciate the employee.  Nothing was ever good enough.  It was work first and then family.  I wouldn't work there again.
bad,i didnt approve on how my manger treated her coworkers nor her customers. i learned the different type of meds and what they are used for.
bad,I could not stand working at that place. The management was horrible and unorganized. The schedules never went together.
bad,Laid back and enjoyed work place I learned a lot working there. There wasn't any hard part about the job. The enjoyable part about the job is helping people and being social-able.
bad,I dont think that customer service jobs are for everyone .This one however is really bad .I was a cashier and it was terrible.The customers are rude.The supervisor give false hope to expand in the company.
bad,I don't thing thy value there employees as much as they should. They will schedule you a minimum of 15 hours per week. This is a job for someone that is still in school and only needs a little extra money or trying to gain work experience
bad,"Management gives brief instructions, then left to do job mostly unsupervised.  Gathering of carts requires strong arms and abdominal mussels."
bad,Kroger is the lowest paying retail company out there. It doesn't seem like they care for their employees either. I would rather work at mcdonalds.
bad,Did not feel I had a very good work experience at the particular store I worked.  My training was not complete for the job I was hired.  I also suffered a bad personal experience with management which caused me to leave abruptly.  I did enjoy my interaction with the customers and most of the employees.  I learned about their computer system but would have liked to learn more.
bad,A typical day working for Kroger was eventful. There was something new to learn everyday I was there. I met new people and had a great time doing whatever came my way each day.
bad,"On call 168 hours a week, 20 stores, reduction of staff and other factors made it a difficult environment to be in.  Good company but after the transition and the continuation of more job responsibilities being added, it was difficult to feel as if you ever accomplished everything making job satisfaction nearly impossible."
bad,"A typical day at work started at 5:30 a.m. for me when I had to open the department. After clocking in and turning on the department appliances, you'd check the ""ready board"", as it was called, for any notes, sale advertisements, new product logos, etc. We would then do ""periscope"", which was a stock and production management system that we used to do a daily inventory count of produced department items such as sandwiches or take-n-heat meals. A production list is then printed for the day that is based on stock and sales. The next task would be ""flipping the case"", where salads are removed from the case and placed into clean bowls and the inside of the display case is wiped down and sanitized. Next the meat is freshly cut every morning and displayed neatly. Time is carefully managed in order not to fall behind, however early morning customers tend to hinder progress. By the time the department is ready at 8 a.m., the second deli hand arrives to take over the counter and production while dishes are done. Depending on the scheduled employee, the day tends to run smoothly. We begin preparation for the hot foods counter at 10 a.m. in order to be prepared for the lunch rush. The display case is kept neat and full through out the day while production is wrapped up before the closing shift arrived between 12:30 and 2:00, depending on the available hours and who was scheduled. If were one of the closing individuals, you attending a ""afternoon huddle"" where we talk about our departments current condition and preparations for ""prime time"", which was between 4:00 and 7:30. During this"
bad,they screwed me over in my military leave when i wanted to come back so i quit that job and moved on to people who care
bad,Working here was horrible. Everyone was always unhappy and they gave me too much work for one person to complete. Not worth $7.45/ hr.
bad,"Even though I liked my job at first it became verry stressful towards the end. I worked in the deli and it was very confined, multiple people in a small space can be very frustrating."
bad,Retail pharmacy within a grocery store setting with enjoyable customers.
bad,worked without supervision...low pay scale for the employees that had been there a long time.
bad,Job required nice smiles and great customer service. Multitask exercises along with fun coupons given to employees.
bad,"Had fune everyday, fun environment, just had some mean managers."
bad,"A typical day at work in the bakery meant working non-stop to keep the department organized."
bad,"Enjoyed working with the people and doing what I did, hard labor pushing the carts, really enjoyed the job. Just didn't understand how the management ran things and how hateful they were to employee. Would tell employee one thing then yell at them for not doing another."
bad,Was able to start working for the company at 16yrs old which taught me what it was like to have a job
bad,"I did not like this job. That is why I didn't last long. The fellow associates were unhappy with working there and therefore not nice to me,I kept being ask why was I there? And given the wrong numbers for the meat to be tagged, so it caused allot of problems."
bad,"To collect past due balances over the phone."
bad,mangers dont care to fix any problems. dirty work environment
bad,"co workers were rude  & lazy, workers were rude to customers. managers were lazy walked around on there phones not working."
bad,When i started at the company in 2006 the company was actually worth working for at the time. Over the years the company became more invested in their company then they were their employees. It's a good job for a high school kid. The people that work there and stick around are generally hard working people.
bad,"-making sure the customer had excellent customer service"
bad,I would not recommend. The managers and supervisors talk to you so rude. It is no help around when you need. Its a all around bad place to work.
bad,"Zero work-life balance for managers.  Great pay, but a stressful job."
bad,Handled customer service issues. Good company to work for.
bad,pay was not good no lunch or breaks for a 8 hour day very little training
bad,it was a decent job while i was a freshmen in high school. easy.
bad,Kroger is a wonderful company to work for I only left due to relocation.
bad,management weren't helpful. Job was not fulfilling and the store moral was very low.
bad,It was an introduction into Customer Service and taught me skills and techniques to dealing with difficult situations/customers.
bad,"management wasnt very nice kind of reminded me of high school bullies, i had a few friendly co workers but honestly i didnt feel protected as an employee, people would start fights and they never would get fired over it"
bad,"A typical day at work for me is based on customer service. When I am not helping the customers, I am baking cookies, making cupcakes, prepping bread for the following day. In my line of work you learn to be quick and efficient. My department manager is terrific, and I love my co-workers. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to do what I love- bake."
bad,love the fast pace...just looking for a more personal job...i was able to smile daily with meeting alot of friendly people
bad,I believe other stores may not have the same kinds of issues and might well be a great place to be working in but the location where I work does not do this. 
bad,Take maintenance requests from 62 corporate stores. Order parts as needed.  Hire contractors required to repair problems.
bad,"Started off with just going in and straightening the shelves, then unloading the trucks when they arrived. I worked by my self most of the time, which was okay because the store was rather small. "
bad,Working for Kroger wasn't exciting. The employees was very messy and kept up alot of gossip and the manager only gave hours to her friends. I will never work for that specific Kroger again.
bad,-Abundant opportunities to communicate with doctors and provide recommendations.
bad,"not the best job in the world, but valid for a fifteen year old kid."
bad,Hours are being cut to the point that customer service has suffered.
bad,promotes from within. plenty of opportunity..fast paced..good learning experiences..nice co-workers
bad,Supervised multiple employees at one time. Managed break times. Provided excellent customer service. Learned how to speak to customers and apply that to future career.
bad,"In my three years working for this company, I was never truly happy or proud working for them. The slow and low raises did not compensate for my hard work and issues that I had to deal with daily. The management was poor and often unhelpful. I felt that they did not listen or care about the issues that often came up. Many times I did not have back up help because the company was underemployed. Some of my coworkers were great to work with but most of my fellow coworkers were upset almost every day. Definitely not a happy place of employment."
bad,I was treated good. But at the same time I was treated as nothing. Missing at least a month a pay they will not acknowledge. Co workers ignored me. Management ignored my needs. I could not clock in so I had to write my schedule down. They ignored it. Bad place to work. Beware.
bad,While working her I acquired great customer service skills.
bad,"Irronically its exactly like working at any grocery store that you can imagine. Consisting mostly of stocking new merchandise and helping others find what they are looking for. The pay was decent compared to the work expected. Managers were terrible and sometime verbally abusive with a ""if you dont like it leave"" attitude. Paychecks issued every week."
bad,A job that was okay while attending school. It's not a good job to make a living from.
bad,Kroger never took the time to look at my resume.. they assumed that since I put anytime on my availability and that I am a bigger stronger I was willing to move down to become a Courtsey Clerk and retrieve baskets and bag items.
bad,constantly moving i learned how to go a very fast paced steady job and to communicate with others. management was great worked fair with employees. co workers quiet we didnt have time to talk. the hardest part of job was keeping up with your percentage. the most enjoyable part of the day was knowing that we had almost finished and everybody was at the right pace with each other probabley around lunch time.
bad,I had an issue with my manager and they did not work for me. in my opinion there should be no unions out there.
bad,"I had worked for this company in 2009 and they had laid me off just a few months into working there. I recently went back and was under my 90 days. I had some problems and needed to go to the emergency room, even with a note from the doctor and talking to a manager who OK'd my call off, they let me go."
bad,I learned how to operate a cash register and learn to manage and handle cash. The hardest part was learning all the codes when i first began my position as a cashier.
bad,"Answer Telephones, Filing, guard front door, assist clients to the store"
bad,"Very fast pace, I kearn alot about the customers that come into the store.. I have a very great team.. The managers are friendly and hard working.."
bad,It is wonderful if you want a job where you don't get paid enough but are expected to do a lot of everybody else's job.
bad,Starting out again at the bottom as a Courtesy Clerk was not so bad. They were quick to promote me to a Cashier position. I was happy to get paid more and that the Store Manager at the time kept his word about paying me more.
bad,"A typical day here depended on the department you would be working. Cashiering would typically go by very quickly, because there was almost always constant customers. Produce stock went by quickly but was a little more fluid and less stressful. I enjoyed my co-workers a great deal. There was really no hard part to this job and I enjoyed working Floral the most."
bad,"I think it was just that I started at the wrong time, I came in at a time when it was thanksgiving and Christmas, so it was difficult to get the proper training I needed, which lead me to leave shortly after in January."
bad,It is an excellent first job but it can burn you out quickly due to the monotony of the work.
bad,"high pressure environment, inconsistent workload, hostile managers."
bad,"If there is one thing that working at Ralphs has tought me is to be a hard worker. There is alwasys work to be done at Ralphs, espcially in the service deli. Learning to manage my time is also another tool i picked up from working with Ralphs. Very importanat to balance time between customer service and other duties in the service deli. Being punctual was also a standard Ralphs will hold you to."
bad,I was treated like dirt! I learned how to deal with customers. The hardest part of that job was bringing 8 carts in at a time. The most enjoyable part of the job was break time!
bad,I have worked in 4 different dept. at pick-n-save since I started and I enjoy the deli the most because it was alot like Taco Bell for me in the sense of the job duties and I was able to catch on quickly and now I don't have to think of what to do because it is like second nature to me.
bad,"The company is linked with a Union but the way they determine pay with work experience I believe is unfair. They do not count part time jobs as a full year experience but as half. With my past work experience I should have received a higher pay rate but because I worked part time, I did not meet the full past experience qualification."
bad,I was a scrub. They were not willing to work around my school schedule
bad,"A typical day at work: Doing more work than that you can handle all around the store, as well as things that aren't part of your job that they will make you do. Bonus work to be added to your day if your fellow employees in the mornings didn't finish theirs."
bad,"Kroger has offered me the opportunity to provide for my family most of my life.  I advanced quickly from being hired as a clerk to store management and my financial compensation is extremely competitive.  Work/life balance, however, has become challenging to say the least, and is a product of not having enough resources to complete my job successfully on a regular basis."
bad,I worked at a poorly ran store but my overall experience wasn’t horrible I met good people and learned a lot from the older associates and managers however our store manger was a poor leader
bad,I was terminated from Kroger over a false harassment claim. Management let employees drag my name through the mud and did nothing to stop it. Management at my old store is extremely bias politically.
bad,"The most starting out will be $11 an hour. The most walmart will offer is $15 an hour. You get a small .25 cent raise every 6 months until you are capped off. After working there for a year you quality for a weeks paid vacation. The pay for that week is based off your average hours. You can get a second weeks vacation after being with the company for 5 years. As for the job itself there are hardly any hours. You have to work for Kroger for at least 10 years before getting a full time position. If you Are not hired to bag or ring don’t worry you’ll still be expected to do it. They will train you on the register so they can pull you out of your department and make you ring out customers. Don’t worry, they will also yell at you for not completing everything while you spent a third of your day on a register."
bad,Very understaffed and routine. Civil customers. Really good place to advance within the company. Rarely got my breaks on time. They're part of a union so you get multiple breaks throughout your shift.
bad,I will be completely honest if you plan on getting a job at young like high school. Then Kroger is for you other then that it's not a long term job unless you climb your way up.
bad,"Unrealistic goals with the amount of staff they give us on a daily basis. Pay is little, a new hired employee makes just as much as someone who has been there 4-5 years. Corporate gets raises yet our wages are frozen.  It’s all about numbers to corporate. They see a line of people and stand from a distance and watch you drown instead of helping! What great leaders they are! Never positive comments from them it’s never good enough!"
bad,I have been working for Kroger for one and a half years and I have never been given a raise. I have constantly asked why and they would just say that they would fix it and nothing happened.
bad,"I am unable to speak for other departments but working with the people at the pharmacy has been a great experience. I have met amazing people who have helped me tremendously with my years at the store. Unfortunately I don't feel that I was able to get everything out of being a pharmacy technician that I could because I was not properly trained. The store I worked at was very busy, high-energy and very fast paced. Unfortunately there was not a lot of down time to learn new things during the weekdays and sometimes during the weekends which made things more flustered in frustrating. Overall I have gained a lot of experience at the pharmacy. I learned a lot of different things about medicines and different interactions that are very interesting and helpful. The best part about the job was meeting some of the amazing people that I am happy to call friends."
bad,"As a produce clerk I walked in and met up with my produce manager to see what duties are to be done.  With whatever section of the department I would focus on that day, I would check the quality.  I would see if I had to throw it away or restock more of that product to the shelve.  I made sure that the department was fresh for the customers.  I also broke down the pallets that came in that day.  I would also assist the customers with whatever needs that needed to be met.  There is a vast abundance of content in the produce department."
bad,I would not recommend this company based on the store that I worked at. Everyone is unhappy and consistantly stressed about everything and they worry more about customers happiness than there own employees.
bad,They where very nice people but they where not consistent I just didn't like the job it had to much going on and they wanted you to do other people job for the same pay
bad,"A typical day at work would be come in grab the list on what to do for the morning shift."
bad,"OK place to work at, they are always under staffed so I was completely over worked. working up to 40 hours a week while in high school. They are somewhat flexible with scheduling, my system didn't work and they wouldn't allow me to write notes of days I needed off, so I had no way of letting them know days I needed off."
bad,"when i first started working for the company, it was fun everyone seemed happy,and enjoyed what they do. As of late i see people are grumpy, because people arent being held accountable for ther job duties. people are just going through the motions of work like robots. every year company events raise prices, we barley get any hours."
bad,I was mostly stocking and working in produce and and Drug Department but when I did it interact with customers it was helping them find what they needed about working there showed me how to interact with customers and how to treat people better it really taught me how to be customer friendly
bad,"The amount of work that needed to be done constantly fluctuated. The managers were competent at best, almost abusive at their worst. The weekly pay was nice. Hardest part of the job was easily the customers. The people that I worked with were great."
bad,"I am used to a more controlled work experience.  Things are somewhat not right.  In the time I have been there not once did I attend a meeting about policy change or any change.  "
bad,"Started out as a Tech Trainee with pay of $10.50 an hour. Was told by several managers and fellow employees that once certified, I would be bumped up in pay to $15. I certified in late October. i gave it a few months for the paperwork to be processed, but after February passed, I started to inquire as to when i would see the raise. I was informed via email that there was in fact NO pay raise and that Kroger does not differentiate between Trainee and Certified tech. I now make $11.50 per hour. One of my fellow technicians started out as a trainee and received the pay raise once certified."
bad,"This Job is not what people think it truly is because, everyday is something different. Working everyone's job is not something i would prefer for anyone to do but, it happens obviously because everyone has their own job to do and you really should stick to it but it doesn't happen how it should. This job doesn't have good team work, when you are working to them there is an I in team when truly it should be working as a team. Being a Utility clerk was alright even though it became difficult when your doing others work like i said before plus your own job. Cashiering is much better from a Utility clerk especially when your not doing carts. Workplace culture is definitely not how it's supposed to be either by being judged or discriminated shouldn't be accepted although in this work place i feel it shouldn't be. The management is not the best they don't do there job how they are required to. I have learned that working here was temporary but, it was a job."
bad,"If you can handle the job culture it may be okay for you.  Those who are favored by management advance,  Those who are not, don't.  The schedule made it difficult to plan if my child had after school activities.  I was a single mom so my daughter was mad about all the things she had to miss out on cause my job wouldn't let me leave to pick her up and take her home."
bad,"Kroger makes promises to their employees that they do not honor. They give incentives that they never follow through with. The people are nice, but the leadership needs a lot of improvement."
bad,I didnt really like this position. They didnt utilize my skills to there advantage. Too much red tape even if you are skilled and certified in certain things.
bad,"Lack of help and is stressful since Krogers is ran like a skeleton crew."
bad,"A typical day at work would be to fry chicken, restock cooler, get food off trucks and slice meats/cheeses for customers. What I learned is that this is a hardworking job."
bad,I enjoying working there and love what I do although it can be very stressful at times. That being said I love tre people I work with they make a stressful job a lot easier than it should be
bad,only thing good is the insurance you will not get enough hours to feed your family with and after all your raises you max out at 15.00 dollars no matter what department your in  you get paid every thursday
bad,"I had asthma and they would not take me out of the freezer. It made it difficult to beathe and therfore difficult to do the work they asked to do, They did not help me at all they left me in the freezer till my 90 days when there was always room in other areas"
bad,Kroger for me was a school part-time but it's not easy to move up and their pay is ridiculous for the responsibility you have.
bad,"Management is good, at least at my store. They tend to stay out of the way for the most part. Job is stable and easy enough if there are enough people in the department. Coworker relations depend on which store you go to, but for the most part they are friendly and pull their own weight. The hardest part of the job is during the holiday season when the workload triples and they don't hire extra people to take care of it."
bad,Kroger was more interested in quantity than quality. Acknowledgements of excellent customer service were not recognized unless customer call limit time was not met.
bad,"Typical day at work was to clock in and immideatly be prepared to engage with people and remember codes to all the foods and ring out  people. Learned how to deal with many sitations with customers, Learned how to ring out people with certain procedures. My coworkers were great, as well as my management. The hardest part of this job was standing on your feet for your whole shift. Engaging with people was the most enjoyable."
bad,i worked in the deli with 3 other people everyone had their own task and stayed busy. I learned a lot about making orders for customers and taking orders i also made trays and party platters.
bad,"My typical day started very early baking bread and then dealing with customers.  My manager was quite likable and fair,."
bad,"The union tries to snub the management and the management treats the workers like slaves because of it. Overtime hours are obnoxious, especially when you have to maintain a certain efficiency the whole time. Super huge turnover ratio because of the harsh performance standards. A lot of injuries also because of it."
bad,"My typical day at Kroger was filled with lovely co-workers and amazing customers. I had so many great customers, I loved to pieces. One of the reasons I stayed as long as I did. The hardest part of the job was my managers, they didn't care about you as a person. I learned not to take things for granted after I left the job."
bad,"Kroger is an overall great company to work for. They just have some major thing they should fix regarding there associates. As far as pay and labor goes, kroger pays the least out of all the retail stores and each associates position requires them to do way more then they are actually getting compensated for. Basically you are working for little to nothing but you are doing everything. Kroger has great benefits and retirement for full time workers but part time suffers really bad. If you are not in a full time position and are not in high school then this is definitely not the job for you."
bad,this for is kids who just want spending money and to hang out with or just for some older person looking not t be bored or something other then that this cant pay your bills
bad,"If you need a job for health insurance this job works great.  However if you need a full time career I would look else where.  Having four years with the company; I have compiled a long list of pro's and con's:"
bad,"A typical day was busy.I learned how to keep a smile while under pressure dealing with mutiple attitudes in a fast pace work environment.Co workers was helpful ,cool,at times hard to work with but I managed.Hardest part was keeping cashiers calm and accepting of customer attitudes.The most enjoyable part was knowing that at the end of each day I gave the best customer service through what ever obstacles or problem came at me!!Be"
bad,Management and the business team are very unprofessional. Manager couldn't rely information on change of policies to employees until we were written up. A lot of favoritism.
bad,Management needs to treat their employees better. I've made a few friends while working there. We do have a union that provides job security and health benefits.
bad,Kroger is a great place to work for teenagers because if u have a family you will not be able to take care of them making 8.60 hr and 20 hr a week and we talk about pay but nothing has been done
bad,"Typical work day is stressful, hours are minimal. my shifts are 4-6 hours and they want the same outcome of an 8 hour shift. "
bad,"I just dislike upper management, they have their favs and sometimes ask regular employees to do manager work. Which isn’t fair. The most enjoyable part of the day is chatting with coworkers and helping the regular customers that come in. It used to be a family environment at work but ever since the old store manager left it has became just a regular job to me. Also they hire new upper managers every month and they all have different rules we have to go by. The thing i hate most about this job is that I’ve been working her for almost 5 years and only got a 2 dollar raise and they changed the pay so someone just starting the job can now make the same hourly rate as me which isn’t fair."
bad,They work you to death then treat you horrible if something tragic happens in your life and you have to take a leave from work.  The only thing good about It is the insurance and discounts.
bad,"Do not work here, the company does not care about anyone. You’ll be just a number. The pay is terrible worked with Kroger almost 8 years and barley made above minimum wage."
bad,"I open the store each morning with a list of customers whos orders need to be fulfilled. I act on my own judgement when it comes to choosing items. problems that occur that include deciphering"
bad,I loved working at Payless besides the pay everything was just fine the pay was poor very poor but if I can go back I will long as the pay increase the mangers was excellent peoples I worked there for 8 months didn’t have a problem with no one while there
bad,"For the past month, my paychecks have been LATE with no reason given. Payday is thursday, yet the paychecks arrive on friday. If this continues, I may just press charges."
bad,i genuinely liked working at Kroger its just management. I had two people who were like in control of my department which was produce and one was sexist i feel all the ladies in the department were getting fewer hours than the rest and werent recognized for the amount of work we've contributed into our jobs. Other than that everyone else was great my coworkers were all nice and the other department leads were super nice as well.
bad,Job was fine and work was no problem for me. It was the low pay and not all the managers but a few specific that really ruined it for me. Also my job had to pick up other job duties off people when they were swamped but nobody did that for us and the fact there were only 2 people doing my job made it difficult to balance which is fine I can handle it but it makes it more stressful when you get paid terrirbly and terrible hours. I would be scheduled to work 9am to 5pm one day and the next day 5pm to 1am and it would be like that all week but I would only work four days so im getting around 160-200 a week because I wouldn't even get 40 hours.
bad,This was my first job at 16. This is a good start out job for teenagers but i would not stay any later than that. pay is below average and some customers can be rude
bad,The manager was rude and i didnt like the job at all. I didn’t get many hours and they had me do the same thing over and over. They didn’t work with your schedule at all.
bad,"loved the people they were great, as far as the company they mirco manage every aspect of everything so it make it a little hard to complete tasks your told to do and then later told to do something different by someone else"
bad,A typical day at work would be I would go in and package and pull the frozen stuff for the overnight bakers and close down  the department. I learned how to package and clean never was trained really on how to bake during the day. The management was ok it was not the greatest. The hardest part of the job was having to close down the department by myself and having everything to do. The most enjoyable part of the job was the coworkers that I was surrounded by it was like we were all family there.
bad,A typical workday in my role was being sure that all the management team had the necessary paperwork communicated from the district office so they could make changes that may be needed. Following up with department leaders on information they should communicate with their associates and making sure we didn't miss any deadlines. Running reports to update communication boards throughout the store and keeping everyone updated. The hardest part of the job was trying to get others to do what they needed to do for a particular project so I could respond that the task was complete. The flexibility of hours made it a great place to work so you could still take care of your family and needs.
bad,"This company has a lot to offer and would have been a great place to work at for a career, however their attendance policy is rediculous and needs to be revised. I had a medical emergency while at work and had to go to the ER. I returned the next day and was let go do to ""Attendance issues."""
bad,"Overall, I had a very poor experience working for this company. Very low pay, yet decent benefits. Odds are, you will be cross-trained in at least one other department and you will always be expected to do more than what you are paid for. Management was very poor and communication is little to none. Job security is tight thanks to the contract Kroger has signed with the Arizona Workers Union. There's always room for people move up if that is what you desire but be prepared to dedicate your life to the company if you wish to make this your actual career. Otherwise, it is a great job for High School students or College students trying to pay smaller bills."
bad,"It was alright for a first job. Although working front end is very stressful, you're always stressed to keep up with the pace and feeling like you have to be fast."
bad,"I had just gave birth to my first kid and i went on break, it was clear i was sick, i could barely stand, they let me go for being sick one time while being under union"
bad,"I wouldn't work for Krogers ever again in my life. I would never recommend working for them to anyone unless you want to destroy your mind, heart, and body."
bad,"I enjoyed working for kroger for the most part. There was lots of opportunities there that i took advantage of. They also gave us 10% off all kroger brand items that you purchased, That was a huge savings each year. I meet alot of wonderful customers while working there and enjoyed working with the public."
bad,Corporate pushes down many things that are nearly impossible to accomplish. Very difficult corporate management. Unclear goals.
bad,You work with some great people. Mangement needs work though. Its a great starter job I would never want to stay longer than a year or two.
bad,co workers are great . Management was very reasonable when situations happen. work environment was ok
bad,Working for Krogers can be very demanding at times. They wont officially hire you in full time until after a long period of time but will leave you part-time in their system with full time hours.
bad,Kroger is a good company but i can't advance to a higher position. I get along with my co-workers. Management can be okay sometimes. The hardest part of my job there is keeping up with the demand of product. 
bad,My years of being a Kroger employee had its ups and downs. One thing that i can say about my employment location is they were all down-to-earth. from associates to customers.
bad,"I was happy with the hours I was given, and my position was a fun job."
bad,Kroger is a good environment to be around. The people around me who I work  with are very positive and encouraging. I loved being around the happy customers who shop there.
bad,"Kroger says they treat their associates like family and offer a career there. After spending over a decade at the bottom of the company ladder, I can say that is not the case. "
bad,"Its ok if you don't have any bills, They will start you part time and one week you may get 30 hours and the next week you may get 10 hours. But further than that they work with you on your schedule."
bad,"Meet New Friendly Workers, Work Hard, Flexible Schedule, Not enough pay salary, No Pay raise, i can't think of nothing else. Sometimes slow but not slow. Only time it get slow is in the morning and afternoon but in the evening and night, it's get busy because people just getting off of work or school."
bad,"fun place to work due to contact with a diversity of people. It is a busy work environment. As a Supervisor, you get to interact with many people with different issues."
bad,Kroger is a ok place to work. It depends on fellow associates and your store manager. And in danville kentucky it is not exeptable. They promise things that you wont get like raises and days off. Enough said.
bad,"We met and exceeded our goals selling jewelry at Christmas and the mall raised the rent on our store, so we were given a 2 weeks notice that they were not renewing the lease and we had to inventory and pack up the inventory. Only 2 week notice and right after Christmas."
bad,Kroger was a good place to work at . everybody was friendly and got along good ... I had good hours but the breaks was always short . it was very fast paced
bad,I like that they work with my school schedule but the management is terrible. they have added the mangers duties to the parcel (curtesy clerk) and have to many incidents where they have treated us terribly and unequally. They get on to the curtest clerks too many times when they should be focusing on the people inside the store because us parcels are the hardest workers already and they count on us to much to get other peoples job done as well as our own. I see people In other departments standing around and talking where as we have people watching us push carts and doing what they want us to do. We have already lost 5-6 parcels in the past 4 months because of how they treat us.
bad,"My typical work day is very challenging never a dull moment dealing with customers and their complaints . Kroger could be a better Company and treat their employees much better than they do, more money on the hour increase vacations and more respect of mankind"
bad,krogers is a good work place I have learned a lot I have learned too control myself and be around great people. my coworkers was always a team and got the job done. my manager answered all my questions and helped me through out my journey I was blessed.
bad,I didn't work for Kroger for very long. This was due to the terrible management I dealt with. The managers were always in the backroom on social media sites. It became a big problem for the new employees (me and some) that were training at this particular store. None of our hours were turned over for a two-week period. Fourteen people had to go to the main store and collect a pay advance. This store can't really say much for Kroger as a company.
bad,"This job was okay. I really didn't like it too much because we was always under staffed. Especially in chicken shop there was just one associate working a two man plus sometimes work load. my coworkers was okay, the hardest part of my job was completing all the the many task they give. I completed them but, I felt like if that's the way its going to be, the chicken shop operator should be paid more."
bad,I don't work else where and have asked and offered many days to work but often getting the bear minimum and I ride a bike to work and back home going eight miles a day making barely over a hundred a week in freezing cold temperatures.
bad,"The job is fair and easy on a daily basis, I learned a lot bouncing around different departments around the store throughout my first year. From sacker to overnight grocery. Management varies, they change ever 2 years."
bad,"Management and employees are super nice. Flexable working hours for the most part. Desperate for employees due to low pay, Kroger attracts teenagers and older people for employees. Work is basic stuff.  No overtime. Somewhat unorganized management. Ordering system is off resulting in too much backstock, unorganized back rooms."
bad,"You'll start off with minimum wage, you'll be a baggier, and pushing carts. If you work there for a while or 18 and up of age you'' start off as a cashier."
bad,I was promoted quicklyand recognized for hard work. I would oversee store as a whole as well as employees. Open and/or close store on daily basis. Sometimes difficult managing everything with little help. Also enjoyable seeing the stores individual progress and being a part of helping everything run smoothly.
bad,"typical day; Its was okay most days"
bad,Kroger's is an excellent company. It has a great impact on the community in that it employs numerous special needs and challenged individuals who otherwise might not work.
bad,"A typical work day involves me cleaning up after the morning crew, taking their trash and cardboard out and doing their dishes because they simply dont ""have time"" to do it and doing their work when i need to do my own. Over the past 6 months that i have been there i learned to write on cakes and decorate cupcakes and set out product and give great costumer service. The management there are very nice people, but not my co workers. Ive been wrote up 4 times in two weeks because they blamed things on me that i wasn't doing, and it turned out to be them.The hardest part is at night, you have to close by yourself and don't have any help with costumers, breakouts or cleaning and often run behind every night. Id have to say the most enjoyable part of this job is getting to know some of the other co-workers in different departments. Not everyone there is like the bakery. Produce, Grocery and Drug GM are great to get to know and eat with on your breaks."
bad,Kroger didn’t have enough opportunities to get raises and that’s what made me leave. i couldn’t excel. I was an amazing worker but sometimes hard work is not enough.
bad,"Flexible hours and fit schedule,cross training. They offer multiple benefits   I learned more than they department I worked in and I also learned more than I knew about Kroger"
bad,"they didnt give me the hours i needed,  and couldn't change my hours to work around mg schedule , short breaks,  they wanted you to take people hours and more"
bad,It was a job it help previde for my family I like the job it was very nice it was fast past and evedybody was nice....I enjoyed all of my time there and I met a lot of people
bad,I enjoyed working for Kroger it's a great place to work.. I am just trying to find something with more along the lines on set hours.
bad,"Kroger is a union company! Great benefits but wait us a year of employment before you get them also no sick pay. Is a lot of sexism, duties to perform task of upper management; don't get pay. A lot of lies to get you to do task, once you step into a management role not allowed to get sick"
bad,"the most enjoyable part about working for krogers was that the people there were awesome, the customers were always fun to help and seeing smiles all day was the best, because it showed that people were happy coming into kroger."
bad,"Fun work place, minimal room for advancement, great benefits, flexible hours, management can be an opportunity, great department managers who train their associates."
bad,"A typical workday at Kroger would consist of bagging groceries, and replacing misplaced items.  We also would clean the restrooms as needed and help customer find what they needed.  A great first job."
bad,things were not handle professionally. the supervisors were rude and not helpful.
bad,"I am currently a bagger for different customers, bagging their groceries for that particular order"
bad,"I loved the customers they were daily"
bad,"My normal routine while employed by kroger consists of clcokingn in and then going to find the manager on duty to find out what register i would be on for the day. I would then go to that register sign on and begin assisting guest with the process of checking out, I also helped the guest bag groceries and carry them out if needed. Depending on how many hours i work for the day and the time i came in i would receive a break for 15 or 30 minutes. I would then return to my register or be moved to another if i was closing and finish out my shift. The management team for the most part were very nice and as helpful as they could be but at the same time they lacked organization which effected us not only individually but as a team. i felt as though they weren't realy concerned with their employees as people it was more about what they felt was important in keeping kroger running. The most difficult part of working this job for me would be having to stand for long periods of time and getting paid close to nothing without getting many hours.  It makes trying to survive on your own almost impossible without a second job. The most enjoyable thing would have to be being able to meet different people and getting to know a little somethig about them, being able to make them smile, and making there shopping experience the best!"
bad,kroger is a wonderful place to work at people there great people
bad,A typical day at work would be me making the fresh Kroger pizza in the cheese department. I learned many things about the many different cheeses.The Management was great. My co-workers were so-so. The hardest part of the job was getting someone to train me in different areas of the deli depaerment. The most enjoyable part of the job was tring the many different cheeses.
bad,I loved it the management was nice and the pay was great. I enjoyed making different coffee beverages and learning teas.
good,I Did not like this job because I had work in bad conditions. The Managers did not treat the workers well everyday. I don’t recommend anyone to work for Kroger .
good,"Fast paced, senior leadership leaves early.  Often get bumped from requested vacation. They will transfer you anywhere within 20 miles of your home. Bonus is lofty expectation."
good,3 out of 5 stars for paying weekly. I did not feel valued at this company. The manager that was there had been fired for saying racist slurs. I feel that over all the Koger is a ok company that has poor mangers scattered about.
good,"They do not have enough help!!!! Don't have enough time to teach you, when try to a customer come and they have to stop, no cashier, customer be very upset!  They need to do better all around!"
good,"I have had better jobs. This one is best for those who are going to school or are trying to get back into the work field, or need a second job. They are not very family friendly."
good,"Kroger stores are really a luck of the draw kind of deal. If you get a good team, you'll be willing to work there for a while. The company overall does not have a good track record with employees. They pay bare bones minimum, treat you like a criminal and ask for a lot considering how little they give. Insurance and perks are laughable. There is little to no room for advancement. This is a place for teenagers to build a resume or the elderly to have something to do, not a career place."
good,"I have worked in all positions, but not limited to: General merchandise stoking health and beauty aid to the liquor. From gm to the meat and seafood, to the dairy box to the deli department.  I was only working at best 24 hours a week."
good,You work 9 hour shifts for little pay and work every weekend. It can be the worst job if you don't have friends to make time go by. The benefits suck its Cigna PPO were they pay 80% you pay 20%. So don't expect to get regular doctor visits or your teeth done.
good,Kroger has many different opportunities for many people. They have many different positions which many can grow in. Kroger offer all typs of benefits and vacation time off.
good,"overall I gained working experience. I gained skills, and the education that will take me futher in life. Good attendance and good performance are extreamly important."
good,My job wasn't so bad but the managers and some of the other workers were very disrespectful and looked down on you for no reason. And some times the customer would be rude.
good,Productive workplace with opportunities to grow and develop skills. Always room for improvement. I learned a lot from this company and greatly appreciate all opportunities that were presented to me.
good,"The job was very demanding, and you get called in on most of your ""off"" days. They had no regards to family emergencies. The store managers weren't very helpful or nice to employees."
good,"waiting on customers and keeping things clean and sanitized checking on temps on refridgerater foods, deli display, kept filling, and cooking chicken, decorating cakes, baking cookies, clean up and shut down chores."
good,Constantly moving around. Customer Service is what I learned there. Management was fair. Work place culture was ok. Hardest part of my job was I did not receive no more than 20 hours a week.
good,"Working for Kroger was more of a step down than i had expected,"
good,I was a 3rd shift email ambassador whom answered Customer Service email from Kroger Shoppers. I learned a lot and was able to further stretch my Customer Service and Office Administration skills.
good,"Awful management "
good,Although i informed management the i would be leaving soon for personal purposes before they had hired me. They still hired me well aware of my position and after i left the city i had been living in where the kroger was located. i asked to be transferred and that didn't happen...
good,I wouldn't work here again. Work place is disgusting. Unsavory people hired.
good,"Start cleaning all restrooms.Take back perishables.Stock all items.Retrieve all carts for an hour every other hour all day Clean all spills.Clean,mop, the lunch room.Clean bottle area. Fix bottle machines.Build bins pull with pallet jack. Bag groceries in-between all jobs.Clean and empty all trash from the whole building. Retrieve all carts. Lock main doors. Restock all items not sold during the day."
good,"In my over-all experiences working at Kroger's,it was such a cinch after I'd gotten the hang of things. I learned that even in the most cruciable situations, everyday was a great-day because of my customers. I typically have the greatest customer service skills which makes my days more than just typical! I had one of the best managers that any one could ask for and my co-workers were pretty gracious as well. The hardest part of the job was trying to help my co-workers reconize scammers @ the gas pumps because sometimes it turned out to be a disguised little-elderly lady swearing that she paid for gas and didn't. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was coming to work everyday ready and looking forward to serving my customers knowing that they were looking forward to seeing me and to get great customer service!! Working at the fuel-center was very rewarding.I received a few accomodations from co-operate where my customers called or wrote-in to speak on my behalf .Futhermore, I would love to be a part of that team again if given the opportunity! In the end, Kroger's could have paid better than  minimum wages. because the job, however rewarding it was,it was still very hard and strenuous. Union dues were paid and such poor representation.."
good,it was a job i took because i need the income it wasnt much money and did have room for growth
good,"Waiting on and assisting customers, I learned how to use a meat slicer.  Management was ok.  Co-workers were good to work with.  The hardest part of the job was not getting enough hours, then some weeks you got no hours.  Most enjoyable, dealing with the customers."
good,The fact that the management would not respect a college schedule.
good,just make sure you have gas cause your going to be driving. And the money dosent equal up to the gas your wasting
good,the company doesnt care about you or your family they work you to death. my dad had passed away and i was expected to just get to work. they rased money for a coworkers brother who had passed a week after my dad and i wasnt given a card or told im sorry they let coworkers speak Spanish and in our hand book we arent aloud to speak that with coworkers around
good,"I worked every holiday,  never had a scheduled weekend off. Was supposed to have set hours and I didn't.  Team leader never told me good job or job well done.  Never gives a salutation.  Team leader has a very poor attitude."
good,"All of my managers were inconsiderate of my hours and would not respect my outside life. The managers there were very disrespectful and same with the cashiers, almost nobody kept their mouth shut if they had something to say about you and would consistently critique my work even if they were in a different department."
good,I was a very hard worker and went above and beyond for other employees. The managers are every rude and condescending. Reported harassment and hate crimes and they never did anything about the situation. The HR manager was very kind though.
good,"Treated unfairly by supervisor "
good,I enjoy working at Kroger. The staff and managers have a hard time keeping employers hours consistent and offering far less hours than I would like to work.
good,Not to be rude but kroger doesnt care about their employees. Managemnt talks down to you like you are dirt and never listens when you try to provide feedback. The work environment is toxic and makes everybody miserable.
good,"They expect us to do so much in our jobs. At the moment, we are understaffed and they are doing nothing about it. They keep telling us we have to deal with it which i feel is unfair."
good,I don’t recommend working at pick n save at all the pay is terrible for what u have to do and go through your better off at a warehouse the management sucks
good,"Union run and people with poor attendance and job proformance are not fired.  Hours are extreme differences and never regular week to week."
good,if you want a job  where you have little to no direction or guidance then this is the place for you.  do you like passive aggressive supervisors or leaders then this job is for you.  do you only need a part-time job where you work 20 hours or less? then this may be for you
good,"I used to love this job. I really did. I enjoyed being on my feet and being busy. It was until the management kept putting me into situations I asked them not to, but because I was not new my voice didn't matter, and the fact if I was sick I was harassed or forced to stay at work even if I had to leave multiple times. It was run very unprofessionally and I wish I could go back because I have friends working there, but the mistreatment was too much. Plus, I filed a report that should have been taken more seriously, but instead, they allowed the individual to still work with me. I had to ask them to leave multiple times. Management was a joke."
good,"Kroger has its days, but if the management doesn't want to try and make the store run as well as it should, then the rest of the store falters. This can apply to any department of the store."
good,Extremely stressful working place with little to no growth or come aation at low levels of employment. The management at the location I worked at was a joke and had communication with the employees.
good,long hours and constant callins. my night shift manager shot down every request for time off that I made and never did the orders right. the other employees were nice.
good,"It is a good job for a teenager or an older person with other income. The job requires certain employees to work, while others are not required to work as hard. Too much workload on the responsible employees."
good,Working at Kroger was very fast paced.  Lots to do but never enough help.  Management was very laid back. the hardest part of my job was putting up with unsatisfied customers
good,I worked as a cart attendant and as a cashier for kroger. The benefits were not the best and overall I would rate the experience from working there as poor.
good,I wish I never worked for this company. Three weeks in and I could barely get up in the morning from being so sore and the management is laughable. I had coworkers on drugs during their shifts but I would get screamed at for misplacing a bag of ham. Avoid working here like the plague. The only reason to work for Kroger is their discount is nice for associates.
good,I did not care for the environment at the Kroger store. The job itself was rewarding but there was a complete lack of structure to the behavior of the employees due to poor management. There was also the pervasive atmosphere of no one wanting to do their jobs well due to being unhappy with them.  I enjoyed doing a good job and providing quality customer service.
good,"I arrive at work at 10:03 am scheduled for 10 am and get wrote up! Yes, for being 3 min late. If I'm scheduled to get off at 6 pm it's not happening! The good thing I guess is you do get a lil bonus and paid time off!"
good,would never work there again short staffed all the time management was very poor   store was very dirty totally unorganized. customers were the best part of work
good,Loved the employees and customers. Has way to much micromanaging. Company advertises promotions from within but then hires outside of the company. Most have little or no experience what’s so ever so they can pay at lower grades. No work life balance as you are handling business during off hours and staying later.
good,"If you are a ""newbie"" you are dirt under their feet.  They will use and abuse you till you quit. should you stay... they scold you if you aren't up to their unreachable expectations"
good,Most times was a good place to work. Too many employees coming and going...no one seemed to want to stay.The ppl are nice but alot wanted to do nothing but cause drama. More interested in the going and coming of some than doing the actual work needed to be done.
good,The management treats us like dirt. They are demanding and they don't realize that there are people like me with mental issues who can't handle being yelled at.
good,I chose to leave this place due to work hard and less pay was not my fortay. Recognition was not there unless you kissed up to the right people. I work very hard wherever i go and this place didnt recognize the accomplishments i gave.
good,At first it was an okay job. But after a while things really went down hill. Coworkers were yelling and complaining about other coworkers going to slow or wasn't going fast enough with scanning the items while checking a customer out.
good,"boring, tedious,not worth my time. long hours, they did not follow my availability schedule, i do not enjoy going to work, work long hours and many days in a row (8-10) without a day off."
good,I worked at the one in lake city.My responsibilities was to check customers out and keeping a well stocked store. A day at work is clocking in the retrieving my till then  start ringing up customers and assisting with questions.Then cleaning up the store and putting back returns.
good,"I use to love where I worked but the work life balance was horrible.  I love to work but there would be several times I would have to work from 7 am to 1130 pm with no one to relieve me for a break to go eat, I was forced to have to find something there and never would see my son.  My favorite job with the company was a Shrink coordinator. I helped stores find there shrink and help educate associates on reports, programs and where to help shrink loss to gain more profit."
good,"There is no such thing as job security here with Kroger. The worst part about this company was that they would rather hire someone in from the streets or a completely different apartment in the store, to run an apartment that they have no idea about. I trained my supervisor to be able to do the things I were already capable of doing and have done for several months before."
good,"Often found working an entire department alone with customers and shipments needing to be put away. Never receive breaks because the staffing and available hours are not there to have another person in the department so you can take breaks. Management team is not aware of our work conditions, never offers to help, and never acknowledges the work that we do."
good,on 2nd manager and assistant in 6 months.  some managers have no communication skills and have good old boy theme.  expect part-time employees to do full-time work when they can't keep the store employed with enough part-time employees.  will try to work you to death.  pay needs to be better for part-time employees.  Regional Manager also needs better communication skills.
good,The Scot Lad divisions were well run and profitable. The parent company Roundy's  was poorly managed with no vision creating a major drain on the companies it purchased
good,"Continually promised full time hours and position with no follow through.  Union representative was of not much help in that area, so I was continually looking for other employment that offered full time hours with benefits considering I had previously worked for the same employer for 20 years."
good,Is when its busy and makes your day go by faster. Also meeting new and regular customers
good,"I really like the job they was very good to working with me, flexible hours.. Great  benefit if you met there requirements"
good,"Was a temporary position, and was close to home.  Nice people to work with."
good,Customer service is a daily must. Great people to work with and a friendly customer base.
good,"Really was tough trying to persuade ew buisness owers to purchase machines."
good,"After a personal injury to a spinal accessory nerve from a perfectly executed sneeze while ill; I was laid off for the inability to lift heavy objects. Although there were mentally and physically disabled (including a man with only one hand), they refused to place me in another department while I addressed the injury."
good,Need for urgency! Management lack knowledge of company procedures/policies. Lack in Customer assistance ability.
good,terrible. decent first job. stay but leave when you can. as soon as you can
good,little known rule that is not talked about or discussed but when I found out and asked about it I was lied to. Unless you get your very low pay rate changed within 60 days of hire they can keep you at that rate. Raises are only 10 to 20 cents per six months. I had almost 10 years experience and it was not considered. If you are an adult with real bills it is not a good company to work for.
good,The managers are young
good,There should be a lot of improvement made to the management and store as a whole.
good,This job has been nothing but stressful. It is a disorganized operation with managers who don't feel the need to do their job.
good,"10-12 hour day, managing ever changing company objectives, coordinatore group of 9 with different objectives, managing up to 130 associates, 2-3 thousand customers per day."
good,It was ok working here it had a lot of drama and mangament seemed unorganized to me.
good,I didn't really like working here because it was a very slow pace job and i didn't really do much of anything. The pay wasn't all that great either.
good,"Working for Kroger was very unstable. Hours are always low, and the pay is minim. If you have large bills to pay it is hard to work for them"
good,"Battled with discrimination from management,and union reps couldn't seem to do anything about it.management has favoritism towards workers that would make it hard for honest workers."
good,Some days are good and others are bad. One day you could be the best and the next they kick you when you are down. Loyalty means almost nothing and the pay is a complete joke..
good,"You dont get a lot of support from management you are expected to figure things out on your own."
good,"Kroger has been a good first job, I learned about how the Process in Clicklist works and how to do about everything you can do from, picking orders, to attending, to being the clerk. Yet they will not give me a raise after being here since May 2018 so I’m making 10 an hour along with the others who show up with no job experience and I find this very wrong. I feel that with my over a year of working for Kroger there shouldn’t be people getting hired on with no experience making the same as me so I’m looking for a new job."
good,Just looking work elsewhere now. The management really doeant apreciate thier workers here. They only want their paycheck and to go home. I just feel they dont care about employees at this location..
good,Store Manager in starkville ms is prejudice. Only takes care his own color. He should go join his president. management is horrible they do not know how to lead or be leaders. it takes more than a dilatation to lead. pushing people around is not the way to go. He screams at employees.
good,"My initial experience was amazing. I worked at the district store and truly enjoyed it. I ended up in a different store with a chauvinistic sexist manager that did anything he wanted to make me feel uncomfortable. I was terminated upon returning from a short medical leave for an attendance issue that many others were also a party to. Very negative environment where other good people "
good,"Easy and fun job made hard, at times, by lower management due to inappropriate behaviors and attitudes of being better than others. I will say that I did have more fun than not due to the good coworkers and awesome customers!"
good,"Despite the fact they tell you you're guaranteed breaks, don't count on it. On a 8hr typical day I don't get a single break, and I'm lucky of I can slip away just to use the restroom. The union at this store is pushy and overbearing, and will essentially strong-arm you into joining. If you show even an ounce of work ethic your whole department will push everything onto you and not do anything, and you'll be the only one that gets in trouble if you forget even one miniscule thing. The store is understaffed so you're constantly getting called in on your days off. The managers actively avoid learning about the departments in depth and refuse to acknowledge any problems presented to them by employees. And, despite being the highest grossing store, the pay is garbage and benefits are miniscule. The only benefit to this job is that there's some really great people to work with that you can complain with because everyone has the same sentiments - the place sucks."
good,Good place to work for highschool / colleges students. But for people who are looking for full-time they get your hopes up then CUT your Hours even if you've been there for 6 or more years. They only give you part time.
good,"The work at Kroger is very simple and easy. I stock fruits and vegetables and sometimes help with floral. The job itself is not bad, but the management staff doesn’t seem to care for their employees."
good,"I liked Kroger's at first it was fun crew was easy to work with,but it took a drastic term when all the crew started being lazy and quitting after that it got really frustrating"
good,"I have almost worked here a year.  Constant turnover of employees and managers.   No structured consistent schedule,  whenever you are scheduled you are to work.   Hard to schedule anything personal"
good,Part -Time  maybe 20-25 hours a week. Washington Rd did not have enough clerks to assist with bagging.Management suck / Unorganized.Overall easy Job if you intend on being a Cashier.
good,Was extremely stressful. Was not enough flexibility to balance regular living and work. Forced to work in extreme conditions and not much way around it. Do not recommend
good,It is demanded that you work ALL weekends there!! Most co workers are friendly and others are annoyed that they are there all the time. It's a fast paced work environment but makes the day go by fast. Was told I could have Sunday's off but was lied to.
good,Not a fun place to work at bc the mangers will expect you to go above and beyond everyday that you are there. For example if you have a 16 hour truck and your the only one working on it they expect you to get it done in the 8 hours that you are there.
good,For training they have you read on a pc and do pc test then they throw you right into work without really showing you anything.  It’s very repetitive but that’s understandable being in the food service.  The higher ups will definitely try to take advantage of younger workers.
good,"Beyond my control I fell ill and was admitted to the hospital. Even though I had medical documentation I was put on medical leave for 60 days so that I may get my health back on track sounded reasonable. I was told that I was a good employee, and I made all of my numbers. I was never late and never missed a day of work, until I fell ill. When I inquired about coming back to work after my health was on track I was told, if I wanted to return that I would have to take a pay cut to minimum wage for 6 months."
good,"I enjoyed my job but constantly received negative comments from my boss and coworkers. By the time I quit, I had no confidence or self esteem left. My boss constantly told me all the things I did wrong, compared me to other workers, made allowances for others but not for me, and threatened to have me fired if I didn't fix my relationship with my significant other."
good,"Needs a lot of work. Poor hours, scheduling, favortism, penalty’s for sick days.. doctors excuses for missing work are not accepted. Poor communication from management.. lazy employees"
good,Great for a first job but depending on how high in rank you get they preach that they value home work life balance but in reality they don’t I understand that there is goals that have to be met by end of year but to set goals that have to be met and cut hours to do it makes for a stressful environment and the higher in rank you go the worse your shifts get.  They do have great benefits though once you have been there for a year but the pay is not competitive like they preach it is
good,"A typical day of work for me consists of providing great customer service, assisting customers, jumping on a register to get the lines down, do refunds, give employees tasks, send employees on break, collecting tills and closing the front end. I helped in vero, smoothie, grocery, sweet shop, bakery, clicklist, and produce. The past year management changed which resulted in the work environment changing. A lot of the employees steal, give each other discounts, and steal time. Management is aware but avoids confrontation. There's a lot of favoritism as well, pick and choose when to apply the rules. The Bucktown store doesn't have any control over their employees. Employees barely work after the managers leave at 6 everyone was always walking around, has headphones in, and  on their phone. Management is unprofessional, nobody cares. Hardest part of the job was trying to take control of the front end employees when they do whatever they want, management would be informed and their wouldn't be any consequences. Workplace culture isn't great, a lot of drama, employees arguing, rumors, and departments don't work as teams."
good,Customers are Great!! Office/Store politics not as great. Too much Favoritism. Repetitive and bad behavior does not get addressed as it should. Unless ur in the in-group your abilities to Move forward is stagnant. Information to advance is only given to the employees they desire and many times hey fo not stay. Cut of hours were high yet constant new hires?
good,"Management in my location was terrible. No experience managing a small crew, poor scheduling and tasks often reassigned to lower employees. Sales goals are unrealistic in a dying market and high value customers are usually poached by management. Strong pressure to sell based on value, not customer needs"
good,"Terrible benefits, constantly short staffed, and constantly pushed to working limit. No breaks and not enough time to do mtm, vaccinations, sync patients, and push rxs out quickly."
good,"I left many days crying because of the comments about me asking for dayshift or to at least be off by the time my sons daycare closed, or schedule me for when my husband worked. The only reason I asked was because we had one car and both of us were working at the time."
good,"It was an ok place not the best place in the world to work especially with horrible management practice and low pay, but it was an ok experience overall."
good,Kroger could be a great working environment if they could communicate better and listen to one another. Overall it is a great job if you are someone who love to be in the kitchen. Better pay needs to be set in stone.
good,there were plenty of times upper management acted as if they were better than us as general human beings as opposed to pulling rank when needed. They made us feel less like people.
good,"If you wish to be made to do EVERYONE'S job instead of just your own, then the fueling station is the best place to go!  Inside the store isn't as terrible as the gas station, but its a close 2nd!"
good,Maybe if  manager where professional I would of came back but instead she wasn't and she never bothered to apologize for how she spoke to me.I love working for Kroger I love my job and I love my customer.
good,"The managers at this store were not good and consistently made you second guess your work. They were not supportive and only cared about the ""power"" they had over you."
good,"Typical day or say night was unloading product and taking it out to the floor to be disassembled for each aisle. Then stock product accordingly. After,making sure to recycle cartons and plastic."
good,"How you feel working here only depends on management & how ""cool"" you are with them. Seems like all the favorites get morning shifts & good hours..Moving up is impossible especially as a woman, only men are moved into department such as meat, night crew, dairy, & produce..getting a raise takes years."
good,"There are either too few employees or employees would don't care about their jobs. While department leaders are generally great, the assistant and store managers do not do their jobs or seem to care about any opinion you have, even if it is a way to make things run smoother or have a smaller shrink for the store. They also do not pay enough for anyone, but management to live off of. The best part of the job is the other employees and that my jobs is to be creative."
good,I enjoyed with most everyone there. They tend to have favorites within each department. They seemed not to value their employees and there needs. The customers are awesome.
good,"It is not what they say it is , they promise a lot of things and they never give them, there is no ripe of respect and everybody do whatever they want there is no sense of control"
good,"Working at Kroger has its ups and downs, depending on the day. On a good day, you are moving around and having a good time helping customers. On a bad day, you are crazy busy and you don't want to be there and you aren't allowed to move."
good,"This was my first job and I was here for quite some time. I was 16 at the time and had not yet fully matured so this job showed me literally everything I needed to know about working with the public. The customers are ruthless and exspect you to ask ""how high?"" if they say jump....some of the employees have been there for years so they are cow tied to the job and dont like new faces. Everybody steals that's including customers and employees and they both get away with it. "
good,"Kroger is usually busy and not too stressful. The most enjoyable part of working at Kroger was talking to customers. I learned a lot from seeing and speaking to them. Managers were not flexible with my hours. I always had to work hours that I was not comfortable working. I reached out to management several times to change my availability, but they would not change it."
good,I worked at Kroger for a year and a half and I loved it for half of it but management changed and good people started quitting. Customers became more mean and unfriendly and I hated the shift I worked.
good,"Senior management at my store location is very poor, no sense of team, only concerned about themselves.  "
good,"I come in a work day to day. the job is easy stock, and face. The expectations are too much for what they expect. They lie multiple times. The management style is no suited to everyone."
good,"I had a very poor experience work at Kroger. Total lack of management, routinely out of required inventory, work schedule would change over night without warning, ext."
good,"Its just like another business. its good and bad. somedays are really good and then others are bad, Its hard to get good people hired and to stay with the company."
good,"My time spent as a Kroger Technician was Very stressful. the work was mind numbing, and I felt as if i was under constant attack from my supervisor for unjustified reasons. Certain areas of the maintenance department aren't as stressful as others, but my experience was miserable."
good,"- A typical day:  I come in pull up my disputes & charge backs that i have to the day & work them electronically.  "
good,The store had a click they liked who they liked and treated other employees really bad. Most Management had their favorites and let them do as they pleased.
good,"People avoid doing their jobs from management to baggers. As a cashier you are stuck in one place, often ignored by coworkers who should be helping. When I was in a position to help I was appreciated by cashiers but, treated poorly by other Customer Service personnel."
good,"High turnover with management and employees therefore management was not responsive."
good,"It was a standard cashier job. I had to help customers with money transactions. The managers were alright, but not the most friendly. It has not helped me advance my career."
good,"The employees are great but the management is poor. Their approach is almost still seargent like. Thought I would recommend working for kroger, I believe that they need to choose a bit more carefully who they hire as a manager."
good,"Underpaid for responsibilities "
good,"I loved working with my team but the department manager needs help with her work ethics. Most of the people that work for the company are good, hard-working and friendly and that's one of the things I liked about working there. The hardest part of working there was that there wasn't much communication between  departments in the store. Whenever I helped customers, I gave my best customer service and they would appreciate the time I took to help them out. It was the best feeling in the world to see someone happy with their order."
good,"A decent enough first job. If you don't have a degree you won't be going far up the ladder. Started at minimum wage. Typical customer service, be prepared to be humbled."
good,"Bake fresh cookies etc..."
good,The company and associates are great but upper management has too much pressure on them causing them to stress and get ugly I wish they would actually listen to associates
good,"I took the job because it was the only one who called back, not my first choice at ALL. I would not recommend if you do not like being on your feet all day, gross bathrooms and cleaning center in back, or being outside sweating by taking carts in for almost three hours a day."
good,I have been working at Kroger for the past 3 months as the head of the department and have been refused the pay increase.  I had to fight to get the correct pay when I covered for my old boss on her leave of absence and continue to fight to get my rightful pay as Department Head which I have been refused.
good,"Ive worked for kroger for a year. it was alright, but the pay wasnt very competitive and you were required to be a part of a union that took quite a bit of money out of each paycheck. I only liked one manager out of 5 at the store. The average work day was either very busy or very slow. My coworkers were probably the best part of the job because we all got along. We all knew the store/managers weaknesses and tried to fix things. One problem with kroger is that they rotate management too often."
good,"Poorly managed it was in Warrenton Or. And no one wanted to go make sure it was being ran right so management did what ever they wanted to do "
good,"Great company, but will not promote within the company. If you excel in one area they like to try to keep you there because they don't want to lose you. Also lots of overtime to get things done due to lack of help."
good,Just ok you put in LONG hours dose not allow for much  balance for anything outside of work. The pay is good but that is assuming that you can find balance.
good,I loved workin in the Pharmacy until it was time to get paid and i was always missing hours on my check. Even when i tried to get the issue resolved it seemed to take even longer to straighten every thing out.
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with but management is horrible. They make promises and do not follow through with them. The left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing. I had to work in 3 different departments and still only got 12 hours a week.
good,"I would work nearly 7 to 8 hours shifts a day while also balancing college. The work place is fast paced and gives daily use of skills involving communication and problem solving. The management at my store is not the best as they make work and balancing life very difficult more often than not. It is a good job for those who have day college and need afternoon work, but I would highly suggest trying to talk to other coworkers there before applying. The hardest part of my job is customers who are very rude and impatient as well as some coworkers. However, I would sat the most enjoyable part of my day would being able to talk to random customers and get to make them smile."
good,A typical work day as a cashier at Kroger goes by slow. Depending on the day or how many cashiers that worked that day I either got on the register or helped bag. The store manager was very disrespectful. The hardest part about the job was the store manager and the customers. The most enjoyable part was some of my coworkers. It was somewhat better when you had fun people to work with
good,Mangers are not the best. They constiantly change. Employees constantly leave and come due to the work placed. Employees were great and it was a great place to start. Union fees suck
good,"Unfortunately, my experience with Kroger has had many ups and downs but more downs than ups. The store I work at is strangely managed and there is always a constant fear of losing my job. I have been working at this store for almost 8 months and I have missed work willingly 2-3 times. I feel as if my personal life isn't important to management. Not to seem ungrateful for my experience but I would like to feel more comfortable knowing that I can ask for a day off or call in sick without having a fear of being terminated."
good,"You may be able to move to different locations within the store to get more hours, but there are some members of management who live by favoritism."
good,"Be prepared to have your scheduled changed without warning, and be at the bottom of the totem pole as a clerk.  You'll be blamed for everything and anything, while management takes credit for everything.  However, you will get cross trained in multiple areas, and given responsibility early."
good,"I was hired in the coffee shop, StarBucks, and transferred to the deli to increase hours. I worked in the deli, for almost 1 year and a half. I transferred to stocker (APC) Overnight stocker. That was the most challenging. It was a very difficult job, hours were abundant, work was extremely physical. Having a high volume of products to stock in a 10 to 12 hour shift, with only having a $1.00 increase of pay."
good,"A typical day at Kroger is short staffed and chaotic. Break times and lunches always run late. Communication at my store is awful. They do not want to hire enough help but expect things to be done perfectly. I've worked on the frot end for a year now, and I hate every day of it. I do more than what is asked of me everyday and I've watched people that I have trained get the better positions than I have."
good,"Working at Kroger made me realize how much you can be taken for granted. Management took advantage of the younger employees, making us work longer hours than the veterans. We also had poor pay."
good,"I assisted the baker by bagging and pricing baked goods in the morning, then displayed merchandise. In the afternoon set up break out racks for the next morning. I baked, packed and priced cookies. Organized and cleaned the bakery department."
good,"Poor pay, Poor management. Poor communication between management and regular workers. Especially overnight. The whole time we were woefully understaffed and they never put forth much effort in filling the spots. We wound up overworked and underpaid and we were constantly threatened with being fired. I saw several good workers and managers come and go out of frustration . Definitely One of the worst job experiences I've ever had."
good,"They only offer part-time positions, schedules are unpredictable, pay is awful, and there are very few opportunities to advance"
good,"talking to over 100 customers a day, give them the best you can do because it will pay up later. the management was good as well as my co-workers the hardest part is standing 8 hours. the fun part is talking to different people everyday."
good,"I love my job at Kroger. I mean even thought I wasn't getting much at all, I enjoyed working there. The change of management and employees, made me seek new employment."
good,"This was an easy job. Stocking shelfs, wanted a lot of people to do several things at once. Insurance depending on location could be good or bad. Benfits were overall ok and pay was better than most."
good,The management at kroger were really no help to me at all. The environment in a kroger atmosphere was not very good because everyone in kroger had a reputation for having a bad attitude. One thing i loved about kroger were most customers because they were very polite and always had a smile.
good,It was a good job for me while I was in high school just to make some money. The hours weren't all that great & neither was the pay. The only thing I didn't like about Kroger really was the management.
good,This was a short temp assignment.  I don't feel one way or the other about it.  I was there for a very short time. It was a long time ago.
good,I have felt like since I have gotten new management and a new front end manager that I am just a number to get customers out of the store. The hardest part is dealing with certain people that is below me in senority getting promations that I know I have asked for and am not getting. I enjoy engaging with my customers and talking to them.
good,i didn't like working there because management was unfair and untrustworthy but my co-workers were the ones that kept me motivated.
good,"A typical day at kroger consist o helping lots and lots of customers, happy and unhappy customers."
good,"A typical day was busy, interactive, and productive. I learned how to communicate, judgment skills, and adaptability. I was young and didn't really know too much about management and how things were supposed to be. Co-workers and I worked as a team. The hardest part of the job was when we were understaffed and had a rush. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with people."
good,"The days I spend working in Kroger are spent much the same. I go inside the store, clock in, and head outside to the fuel center. There I greet my coworker, whomever I am to relieve, and count my register. When this is done, I usually head outside and wash the windows, check the trash, and the paper towels. Once everything is taken care of, I go inside the fuel center, and swap places with my coworker. The day from then on is pretty simple, I sit in a chair, help people with their gas, and take care of problems as they come up. I typically end up cleaning the fuel center to pass the time. When my shift ends, another coworker comes in, I count my register, and leave. "
good,"Supplied 25 mins of on the job training and then the cashier was on their own and if they had an issue or didn't know how to do something they had to call, wave down or page and wait on another employee or supervisor to assist them. This making customers wait longer than needed some of them becoming angry and taking it out on the poor cashier who wasn't taught or shown just once how to do something."
good,Wanted me to preform head bakery duties without the extra pay with very little hours. Could of just been the location I was at. However I did enjoy my job.
good,There is a lot of harrassment in this facility and I am currently seeking something other than being in retail because I dont get the respect as i deserve and there is an employee that is currently working there and he is the cause of people leaving the facility and we currently just had 5 former employees quit because of this employee. He is a bully to everyone and doesnt give you any respect. Kroger's is union and i contacted union in the last week and they are not going to do anything due to the fact because they think that this issue can be solved by just going to management and sad to say it that management wont do anything
good,"When I started in 2008, it was very good place to work in.  We had a good working conditions, plenty of help, and sufficient hours to work our schedules. The benefits were good, but our union was not helping  our needs.Management was also lacking in understanding the  employees needs, when  it came to religion. There was also trouble with some co-workers, there  was no teamwork.The hardest part of the job was, that there was not enough help to accomplish the tasks at hand."
good,Keeps you occupied at all times. You are always on the go. There are so many things to do no matter what.
good,"I would get yelled at almost everyday because I was not liked there by my boss."
good,"I was hired temporarily as a stocker until my probation period was to end. But, before that could happen, the permanent position that I was to be moved to was taken by another employee. So I was laid-off instead."
good,"Everyone worked hard and usually it was pretty pleasant. Generally it was hard work and fast paced as well, but all together a valuable learning experience."
good,"Working for Kroger was dreadful, The management is poor & they don't want to pay their workers a decent wage. The store manager and other employees treated me like dirt."
good,"Very fast paced, where they wont even give you a break when you need it. Not going to suggest it to anyone. It is for teenagers with nowhere else to go."
good,"Great training system. "
good,I loved my boss and the people that worked there... it was very peaceful and not hectic.
good,Customers where always fun to talk to and help. They were very appreciative. Managment was good except when dealing with schedules. Coworkers were awesome to work with.
good,"A day at krogers was most of the time negative. But I really did like working there it was just turned into a bad work envirnment over the years. I learned alot like good customer service, how to run a department, and the co-workers was great it the management team that was negative all the time."
good,A typical day at work is long with endless policy rules and changes they have so many that you cant scratch your butt without them saying its against the rules. The people are ok depending on who you encounter. Management needs to look harder for compentent people rather than just pulling people off the the street. The hardest part about my job is the pay not enough to live off of and the customers are tacky. Theres nothing really enjoyable about it. The union tries to help but all it does is keep good people out and bad people from losing their job.
good,"I liked my job, until i had a bad car accident then management didn't understand how bad and wanted me to come back to work the next couple days and couldn't so i had to quit or they would have fired me"
good,"Depends on department to the department, but when I started working there they had a new hiring system. That I got lost in. I was never in my own department because I was constantly on a register. The managers constantly change and everything was overpriced."
good,good day to work in the fuel center that is the latest place I trained in co-workers are nice Management could be a little better 
good,Not so much fun. The hours a flexiable but you really dont have a say when you work.
good,Working at this place was something new. I had never had a job like this one. It is a fast pace job and it has good pay and great benefits. The management is poor and you have no time for family or anything else.
good,Interacting with different customers was the only exciting part about the job.
good,This was my first job in retail. I had to learn how to deal with all the different personalities that you get working with the public. This job was fun and not stressful at all but very repetitive.
good,I had a good day a work but I was always drama with the other co workers so I did my best to stay to myself then I got the ideal to go back to school so i did.
good,"Needs better Management, hours arent that great, Seems like a lot of work for not too much pay."
good,"This job is fine if you just need the money, but other thatn that, I don't recommend it"
good,They do not compensate you on being certified start out at minimum wage no matter what type of background you have
good,I worke at kroger for a while until i was fired because of extended sick leave
good,The supervisors push you too hard to learn where the items are on the shelves. The pressure gets to you too much.
good,I really enjoy working here because all the co-workers are like family. I love the customers usually become a friend and you can talk about just about anything with them.
good,I injured my hand and my manager accused me of lying about it and blamed me for it happening. Which come to find out what they were having me do the OSHA rules states I was not supposed to be doing.
good,I absolutely hate it here after only a month. We dont get paid enough for all that we do. management is ok but they dont allow enough time to clean all that needs it at the end of the night and because of that my friend had a mental breakdown and quit due to the stress
good,"low wages hard work, not a good job if you have a lot of real bills. They tell you that you will be promoted with better pay and they consider better pay a 10 cent raise."
good,"Manage the product for consumers . Putting out product, making sure it was fresh, not out of date. Customer service always. Also safety for the customers in the store."
good,it was fast paced and sometimes slow. It was okay for a first job and I got interact with others while being a working employee at Kroger. If anyone is looking for a first time job. go to kroger
good,"Consideration for family and health issues not considered. "
good,Good company at first but too many changes and people not adding good direction of the company poor judgement of management and not including hours there's no work life or balance
good,"The Kroger  i worked for was not very organized, i ad to do other peoples jobs because they left or didn't want to so i was made to pick up the slack, that is the big reason why i left."
good,"The hours were so different every week. It's also a union store and if you aren't a part of the union, you really don't matter. I worked anywhere from 36 hours a week to 10 hours. It changed every single week. I don't want to be there any more"
good,"Under staffed, management plays favorites, hard work doesn't go recognized, benefits have continued to decrease for our health coverage. I should have gone back to school sooner, at least a degree apparently gets you somewhere in this company, cause you aren't going to get promoted unless you are in good with upper management, thats for sure."
good,"Working as a selector in e-commerce at the time I began was a newly developed department. It was enjoyable at first, but with demands increasing and poor management, it quickly became stressful and intolerable. Unfortunately this was not a good department to be in, unless you were comfortable racing around the store to shop for online customers, while ignoring customers around you. With that being said, I was not able to change positions, such as a cashier or deli/bakery clerk without advancing or perfecting my selecting skills. As an associate who values customer service, it did not suit me to be in that position, even though I had an engrained sense of urgency, it was not enough."
good,I was not happy with the way I was treated when I worked the fuel center. People there play favorites. Management doesn't hesitate to switch your schedule without asking you if it fits their needs but won't help switch if you need it so you have to lose hours if you want a day off.
good,"My first two years were pretty good, I got shuffled around multiple departments and i enjoyed trying new positions. Later on had a horrible manager, very vindictive."
good,The pay was terrible had a new manager every 6 months if your the only one that knows how to work or has a little bit of work ethic congratulations you now have to do everything and look at as a leader but the lead pay goes to the actual lead if you have an emergency or something they give you heck if you try to call out cause they need you but then you come to work one night and your there by yourself
good,Depending on the store it can be a hit or miss. The store I worked at worked me to death and didn't listen to anything I had to say or offer with assistance on improving the store. Hopefully you work at a better one where they care for their employees.
good,"it was a job, nice supervisors, some but not enough training, my husband worked there and that made it hard for me.  no vacations, time off, low pay 7.45 a hour"
good,"There are good people who work here but they're all used by Kroger. This leads to massive burnouts. "
good,"This job started out great but since the implementation of online order fulfillment and Amazon breathing down Kroger's neck as a competitor, Kroger has become nothing but stressful and un-enjoyable"
good,"I tried my best and at one point I had to call in and told them I would be five hours late. The lady told them five minutes. I got taken up to my boss' room and he started to use vulgar language and accused me of lying. I explained that I needed to get my permit or the class was going to expire and I would have to pay $500 again. To sum it up, he told me to ""Suck it up"" and ""Everyone has a life and can't do the things they want"". Keep in my mind, I was only 16. Not the best place to start your first job."
good,"working for this company was tough due to a lot of things in the environment. it all depends on the store you get chosen to work at. i previously worked at two, and the last store I worked at wasn't the greatest. they over worked you and weren't grateful for it. our front end manager was really rude to you and didn't care about your social life, your school schedule, or any of the above. he was very insensitive and cared only about numbers. yes, this company does give benefits, BUT if you put in hours on end. being a part time courtesy clerk, it was kind of hard getting a lot of hours per week because my manager had favorites and also over hired ALL the time. it's an okay job. wouldn't say it's the worst. you gain experience, but the pay is horrible for the amount of labor and physical/mental exhaustion you go through."
good,Working in the deli with my original manager and team was a learning process.. I grew with my manager and trained many new employees. I didn't need to work I wanted to.  The company treats its employees with little to no respect management is on a better position but the employee doesn't the work.
good,"Schedule changes every week, never consistent, days then nights then days. You are able to get days off when needed. Everything is about profit not people."
good,Great for part time summer work. Hard work and dedication is not rewarded. I would not recommend this company to someone looking for advancement opportunity.
good,"The job itself is fine and just about the best you could find in retail, but the management makes or breaks the experience. If you have good and compassionate managers then the job is a joy, but if you have bad managers, which sadly seems to be the norm, then they will cut your hours for no reason, shuffle around the schedule with no prior notice, cut your hours as retaliation for asking for specific days off because of doctor's appointments or other obligations, try to run shifts with a skeleton crew spread far too thin to actually perform the duties needed to keep the store running"
good,"Working for e-commerce with Kroger is a nightmare. We are either consistently over or under staffed,we get told to do way more than what we can handle or the staff gets sent to other departments when we get slow. Management isn't going to help very often, we have no real control with how many orders we get daily, even if we asked to be cut off earlier than normal. We are very good at our job and we get the low end of the ladder when we don't have stuff in the store."
good,"Promotes within, pushes you to strive to be the best you can be. However,  work atmosphere has changed "
good,"The managers treat all their employees bad, especially if you work at the gas station. Get blamed for stuff that is out of your hands. Long hours no breaks."
good,I felt that I wasn't appreciated by my store managerial team. I felt that I was not being used to my full potential. In my area of work I felt that the department leader was biased towards others in his department thus treated them differently.
good,"In my experience working at Mariano's Fresh Market, I started out part time, working five hours a week for five days working in the hot foods department, working with pizza and the hot bar, the work isn't the problem it's the people in charge that are typically the problem, it's a lot of high school drama, lack of accountability, and politics."
good,Was a decent place to work. Couldn't really move up in the deli area. Was working full time shifts when I was only part time. Never told me what I did wrong so I couldn't even learn from my mistakes
good,"The expectations for this specific job in the company for the area was overall too stressful. Many reprimands are quick to be given, but the accomplishments were not. I wasn’t trained except for a few days before they had me go on my own since there was a lack of employees in that department. I had to learn most things on my own, which I didn’t mind, except when I was reprimanded for something that I wasn’t trained for."
good,"Mist employees are willing to help, but the management is usually never seen around the store. Shelves are not always stocked. Some products are being discontinued."
good,Stressful environment they didn’t work around my schedule. People are snotty and rude and disrespectful. People are usually up in your face starting drama
good,"The people you work with will eventually make you feel like family. Everyone cares and supports one another. Management however, is absolutely horrible. They constantly are reminding you that you are always on thin ice. They are constantly breathing down your neck. Management demands you come in even when a doctors note states the employee to not attend work however many days. Management does not care for their employees. Pay raise is supposed to happen after months of working there, but employees do not ever get it until they work there for years or transfer to another part in the store."
good,"I do appreciate Kroger for what it taught me, learning to decorate and talk to customers and how to help. Taught me production and time management skills. Wapping and pulling was a good day and decorating was a fun day. Management was a bit rough and not very forward about want need to be done. The hardest part was when management yelled and didn't treat us like normal people that we are. Coworkers did make up for it, working with people who understood and helped was awesome."
good,"If,you're interested in making $8.10 for 10 years if experience,then go for it. Lack of hours during non holiday time. Co-worker do help you out."
good,i worked here as a teenager so i was a little more oblivious to their sneaky ways. honestly if you're looking into pharmacy work/career as pharmacist this is a good start. super easy processes pretty good training (on computer) and that is about it.
good,"I did not like working here, and felt completely ignored by my superiors. I was the only person working in my department and was yelled at when i asked of assistance for my delivery days since it could take longer than a shift to change all the stock on my own."
good,"Kroger is a decent company to work for however they are more focused on only one core value and have strayed from caring about the associates. The work life balance is becoming non-existent and they have an unrealistic perspective of what it takes to keep a chain of such popularity stocked. Especially due to the lack of training provided."
good,The in house staff claims that they cannot help employees even after years of being with the company to gain pay raises. Advancements are based on who you know in house not what you know. the district staff have been in their positions for over a decade each and gives little room to advance further past the store level. furthered district staff is involved in the stores that they oversee and when issues occurs that have been made clear would happen if actions are not taken they play the blame game and threaten rather than guide or help stores with issues.
good,For me Kroger was an OK job. i feel like they under pay. they make too much money for the hourly pay. i honestly feel it is a good job for high school students and just to have money in your pocket but not to live off of.
good,"Greet customers as they come up to deli. Slice their meats & cheeses, serve up salads or fried chicken as per request. Just don't get sick, or you will be out the door."
good,"The job itself isn't very hard. Yes it could be stressful, but it taught me how to handle upset customers in an acceptable manner. The management there at the time I left was poor, which is why I left. I'm sure it's gotten better since then."
good,"It's a fun job but pay is an insult to those of us who work really hard. A $.15 cent raise is not fair, it should be based on performance not a set rate. My store is not fair to older workers, management is lack."
good,Not a job to make a living on.  Their is no job security and staff was treated poorly.  All managers in every department were not helpful and very rude to own staff.
good,"Kroger is a company that you thrive at if you know the right people. They don't pick the most qualified candidate, it's all about who you know and not what you know. They have lost a lot of employees because of how poor their compensation is."
good,"My say begins with making doctor calls to clarify or change prescriptions. Translating from English to Spanish for the pharmacist.  Daily huddles were always held by register 11, never by the pharmacy."
good,"The management is the worst aspect of this job, especially if you work in grocery. You get treated horribly and unfairly. The pay is also sub par. Minimum wage isn't near enough for the amount of work you do. However, if you're a minor, it's a great job simply because they will hire you"
good,I actually enjoyed my time as a florist. As for everything else i wasn’t really happy with. My floral supervisor started out really nice and after a couple of months working there she became really rude.
good,"Just your typical day, walking into a high stress volume environment with a lot  of authoritative individuals and not enough workers. That means the work load is doubled for the current employees and no one is appreciated."
good,"If you do your job well at Kroger, you get all the other work dumped on you too. They are great at favoritism as well. If you don't fit in, you don't get the credit you deserve and the favorites get to treat you poorly and get away with it"
good,I felt as if the courtesy clerks did a lot of work and if you are undr 18 you get paid less than minimun wage which wasnt fair to me. The other people that worked ther weren't very nice.
good,I  like working at Krogers but I prefer to be promised something that is the truth and wont be a lie. I believe if they were a little more organized everything will fall through.
good,"The reason I say this is a good first job, is because it’s the kind of job that you’ve had experience doing and know you never want to go back to it. I was 15 when I got the job. Bagging was okay but it got boring or I had to deal with some rude customers. And cart pushing could become very tiring, especially in extreme weather conditions. When I would ask for time off, you had to do it way in advance and sometimes it wasn’t even a guarantee that you would get that day off. The only thing that was “good” was that I learned how to deal with difficult people or situations and it helped me grow as a person. But definitely not a long term job."
good,"It depends on who you are going to be working with when you have a lead, and a supervisor (who doesn't tackle the issues in the department). As well as the HR who claim they will solve harassment issue and make an excuse that you can't ""change people's personalities""."
good,"The store was a good place to work but it has alot  of flaws . There is a no security, and in this day and age security is severely needed. Overall I did love my experience"
good,"I stayed for 9 years with the company and was denied a transfer (per the store manger) after moving an hour away. My position was given to another employee, who was incredibly under qualified, and I was basically forced out of the job. My store manger, district team and district manager all knew of my situation and did absolutely nothing to help me retain my job."
good,"Work gets very tiring after a while, no promotions. If so, not worth it. No raises or bonuses except for poor holiday pay and raise of minimum wage. Lots of people come and go too often."
good,"a good starter job, lots of hard work, its customer service so you have to deal with plenty of unpleasant people. Management is poor and at many times incompetent."
good,"Not a bad job, can't make any money but overall it's laid back. Management can be jerks and your schedule is all over the place, the union is a joke. And uniforms are nerdy"
good,"Would usually have to work busy days by myself because they didn't schedule enough people for the days. Worked friday fish fries by myself and then they would get mad I didn't stay after even though i was there for a couple hours after shift."
good,A typical day at work depends on if it was a game day or not. On game day it was slow.  Sometimes it's fast and we have to work super fast. Working super fast is super stressful when you don't have a bagger and you have a huge order.
good,Kroger of Milledgeville is one of the most stressful jobs I have ever had and I don't get worked up over much. The management is awful and it is a popularity contest everyday for equal treatment.
good,While working at Kroger I found that my voice as an employee was not heard even though I spoke with each manager countless times about the same problem. I was the voice for most of the front end and even then my voice was not heard nor taken seriously. On many occasions I have warned the manager that over half of the female night shift workers were worried about their safety and only when I told them I was going to leave if no solution was found that I was able to have a plan in placed if the occasion caused for it.
good,"Being with Kroger has been full of empty promises. I have been trying to get a promotion and management and people of corporate keep telling me that it will be coming soon, but nothing ever happens. Working in customer service you are constantly yelled at by customers."
good,I liked it at first but then it started going down hill. Kroger is not how it used to be. At my location there is no balance between management and associates. Poor management.
good,Training for pharmacy is on a computer that you can not read because it is so small. You are expected to be able to walk in and completely know how to work the system. When asked question my manager was rude and condescending. He yelled at me in front of customers because I didn't know how to do something on my first week.
good,This company would be a great place to work if you aren't seeking advancement. The days are long and hectic. Managers don't care about your work/life balance. The hardest part of the job is communicating with your coworkers and the daily changing of the rules.
good,The store managers won't work with you about anything. My nightshift manager is pretty laid back and quite a good manager. The store and employees overall act like they hate their job ( some anyway) .
good,"No incentives for hardwork which allows other employees to slack off because there was no repercussions. No room for advancement unless a department manager quits, meaning you will be paid minimum wage the whole time you work there"
good,"Many of the other employees were kind, but about 15 of the original 22 cashiers quit in unison a week before my hire due to the rude management and under compensation for such a busy location."
good,"Cleaned the deli to make sure it was sanitary for serving customers, served hot and cold foods, maintained cleanliness and of the work space and took out the trash."
good,Kroger has a lot of changes they've been making. Some haven't been finalized but i still think Kroger has a lot of improvements they can make to helps their associates outside of work. If these changes won't happen people will keep applying and leave within months or even weeks due to their work feedback.
good,"typical day at work consists of unloading trailers and stocking product. "
good,"The first manager was great, always helped out and was willing to work with you on hours. New manager was okay. Didn't want to help  the team out, would put you down emotionally. Orders would get packed up and she would stress out too fast and didn't take time to figure out a plan to get them done on time. She blame others for orders not being done on time. "
good,"Ask more of you than your pay scale. Uptight management at store level, often overlooked for the job well done. No work life balance, you are looked down upon if you have to request a weekend off for something that means a lot to you"
good,I'm appreciative of the time I have worked at Kroger but I am looking to join a company that offers better benefits and compensation for the work that is performed. Sadly as a whole the management of Kroger leaves a lot to be desired. I'm excited to find another company to grow with.
good,to kc your a bad manager man you don't even know how hard I worked to get to other positions just move me around mark and alex where so cool I miss those guys work is easy just get stuff done when you can
good,I've worked for Kroger for almost 2 years and it is the worst place to work. They don't offer the good workers any chance to rise up in the company and they always reward the bad ones.
good,The days are long.  You don't feel appreciated very often and depending on the manager on the front end will mess with your schedule when they decide to and without warning.
good,"Long hours without recognition. No real opportunity for advancement unless you know someone.  Great associates, customers, but too much drama day to day."
good,They do not care about the health and or well fair of their employees. Employees are kept on the lot in 90+ degree heat for extended periods of time with little or no help.
good,"The manager at my store was nice for the first few weeks. He then became rude and inconsiderate. When you look for a job, make sure you're on good terms with management."
good,"As a whole the company is decent, but when your break it down it gets worse and worse. Managers play favorites with their employees and said employees get away with ridiculous amounts of things. for example; an associate smacked another in the face with a box and management did nothing."
good,The job itself was simple. I was there for a short time while transitioning from my maintenance job to my current job. My department manager was great to work with.
good,"great job for high school students. "
good,"Like many big box retail the best employees always seem to be overworked and underappreciated. Standard benefits, ok pay. Also depends on which location you get to work in. Varies greatly store to store depending on the store manager"
good,"High stress, low pay, long hours, lazy management , no employee discount, high turn around, rude unrule unpredictable customers......................."
good,"Kroger has decent benefits, however, the pay is less than desirable.  Raises are minimal. Once a person gets into management, benefits and pay increase drastically. Most employees do not have a set schedule."
good,"I was only suppose to be working in grocery ,, but they had me working that and the gas station . then they refused to pay me what the fuel clerks were making ."
good,Good job to have if you're looking for your first job. Pay could have been better but labor was very demanding when it came to stocking overnight. Management was ok but not very understanding.
good,"I am a college student who has not been able to find a job in the healthcare field, I have been working here for a few years and I have shown interest in moving up in the company. I felt like if I couldn't find a job in healthcare, I would grow in the company that I work for currently. They offer to teach me other jobs, but they never kept in touch with me even after I would repeatedly tell remind them of it. When I finally did move up, I didn't get a pay raise. They told me there was so difference between my job and the one I was moved to, and I know there is a difference. I have gone up as high as I could go asking about it and they did not care. The managers I have had have not been any better, in the past 6 months I have had 7 managers. And we just got a new set, they are disrespectful and rude to their employees.They pick favorites and move people into my job because they don't like that I am perky and loud. My personality is one reason why I have never been short on my registers. Just because we work in a grocery store doesn't mean we don't need to be professional."
good,A productive place to work and expand my learning experience in the chain of grocery retail. Similar workplace cultures as with their competitor's. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with others and being able to meet new people.
good,When I was working there I didn't feel appreciated. My supervisor wouldn't listen to me and it seemed like the higher ups didn't even care. I didn't work there for every long because everyday I felt more and more unappreciated.
good,Although I enjoyed most of the people that I worked with there were many that are allowed to behave badly because they hold key department positions...such as produce...they are mean and nasty to fellow employees and customers. Management looked away from this issue because produce is profitable. I was in charge of employee culture not just for my store but for the district and my hands were tied. I was the store Managers go to girl for anything that he needed to be taken care of...and still I was laid off because a woman that was on pregnancy leave came back....
good,"It's a busy place to work at and good for someone who's in college or school, if you want to become store management you need to get a degree in something but overall it was good and it had its moments of rude customers but it was easy to deal with."
good,"working at Kroger has taught me to always remember to look at the people at the bottom of the corporate ladder, as they are the ones dealing with everyone's bad decisions. That said, it is excellent for the experience, and is great for resumes."
good,First job so I would describe it as the worst job managers were horrible they would hate some people and not tell them they would just make them work extra. Asking for a raise or bump up for another possision was almost impossible people there talk a lot behind people's back
good,I loved working here in the beginning I love shopping here but as I work there overtime I noticed there were favorites it was all about meet your goal meet your goal beat your go as a cashier that's not what I'm here for I'm here to service the customer The best part was the employee discounts that we were able to use on Kroger items only
good,Not every day is the same.  You never know from one day to the next what you will be facing.  The schedule varies weekly and there are many days that people are called in early.
good,"Where I worked, everything was unprofessional and unorganized. Communication lacked between supervisors and clerks/cashiers. Starting at minimum wage is not worth it either. McDonalds pays more."
good,"A typical day for myself is customer service, maintaining equipment, and working as a team with my co-workers.  I have learned how to manage my time and work with different individuals.  The most difficult part of my job is fluctuation of my schedule.  The most enjoyable part of my job is assisting customers with their needs"
good,"First off, Mariano's is very customer service orientated. Uniform is ""classic"". "
good,The employees are nice and breaks are given like clockwork. It is a very clean store with good organization and great advertising ideas..
good,"I would never work for this company ever again. The workplace is very hostile and management needs work. I working under direct supervision of the Store Manager taught me certain things but never enough. Although I had great respect for him, I also would be the last to know about things that were very vital to me as an assistant. The workload was too much for anybody to handle as my Store Manager could not even handle it. It is also in the most horrible neighborhoods in Salinas and there were things seen unimaginable to an ordinary person. Overall is just not the best place to work and too many complaints if you even ask for a day off."
good,"The management at Kroger fail to be leaders. The employees are left disillusioned and frustrated with what the see ineffectual and incompetent managers. It really does affect morale. That's something Kroger is quite short on at this time. Everything is completely controlled by corporate, and you are discouraged from taking initiative as a manager. Pretty much they want a college educated warm body to check the box. You have to wait several years to earn a store, and I don''t know how many millenials Kroger thinks they're going to get to stick around for that long. Why sit stagnant and wither away waiting for your opportunity. Come on Kroger, you've got to do a lot better. You guys need some serious leadership training for your management teams on morale and retention; and how leadership correlates to that!"
good,"Mariano's Fresh Market is a nice place to work for.  I really enjoyed working there.  I met a lot of nice people, customers and co-workers.  Most of the management team is very easy going.  I learned a lot from my department.  Learned how to make Lattes, Cappuccinos, and other cold and hot beverages.  My job as a Barista was very easy, but it did require a lot of attention to all the small details from drinks to cleaning."
good,"Very old school place to work, limited ability to advance. No work life balance, every department is ran like it is the grocery store."
good,I managed to get this job at the age of 16 and despite a few quarrels here and there about management and the amount of time i had to work despite my schoolwork there are not to many bad things about it.
good,"Kroger is a good part time job for young people, not a place to wpork if your trying to make a living. they do not offer full time employment, and you will be written up if you try to do any overtime. Great place to work in order to make your car payment. Management is not that great."
good,"I worked in several different locations.  Meat department, backdoor receiving, cashier and other departments.  The hardest part of job was when the expectations were very too much for one person to accomplish.  The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to the different varieties of  customers.  I am a people person."
good,"The Kroger Co. is a very large corporation of conventional chain grocery stores all across the country. I have provided service to five locations of this company. All positions are customer service oriented and many positions provide special attention from preparing a meal to customized orders of specific products (meat cutting, floral arrangements, etc). "
good,They do not care about the associates that work there.  They are all classified as the numbers that higher ups need them to get to.  Management is delusional as well as some supervisors.  Would not recommend this to anyone.
good,I learned how the dairy department operated. My co-worker's were good people and great to work with. The hardest part of job was trying to finish my job in my department and other people department too.
good,"Did not like working there - poor staff environment."
good,"My department had two managers who fought constantly, to the point that one had been moved to another store for a number of years prior to this new store being built, then both managers were at this store in the same department. One manager treated me fairly, the other was nasty to me because she wanted to spite this manager. The two managers fought over me so much, that the three of us were even called in to the store manager's office for a meeting. I worked there for a long time while I was in college. One time I needed to schedule around my final exams, so the nice manager accommodated for that. Unknown to me, the other manager changed my schedule. I went in to work one day and found my schedule had been changed and discussed it with both managers. They got into a fight. I walked outside. I seriously could not take any more. I went back in later to find that the company had ""fired"" me because of the walk out. Never mind I only left for a few minutes and it was because of the management fighting, which upper management was well-aware of. I was not allowed to work there since. It was otherwise a nice job that would have probably worked out for me as there may have been chances for promotions. Too bad the stress of final exams and management bickering got the best of me. It is disgusting to think that upper management, knowing this problem existed, didn't try to keep me and maybe do something with the managers instead."
good,Excellent short term employment.  Has a very high turn over rate.  Nice people though. I don't have anything to say about this former employer.  I wish I was still working there and then I would not be currently homeless and almost broke
good,"When you clock in there are about 15 things the manager already has you pegged to do and when you don;t have them done in your first hour of work they breathe down your neck asking why and watching you for the rest of the day. Depending on where you work at, the customers are very entitled."
good,"Poor Management, terrible scheduling process. The management team doesn't respect religious cultures although they should and there is little-to-no room for advancement."
good,"Productive work place with friendly employees. They allow you to have the opportunity to be rewarded for giving great customer service, or going above and beyond at your job."
good,"Kroger Company is a good company to work for, however, the staff at the particular store I worked at were very uncaring professionals."
good,"Kroger was a great place to work if your a high school student. If you are a person that works your tail off they don't appreciate it, they take advantage of you. I started out at the fuel center and worked my way inside the store and became a customer service accounting employee. I enjoyed my work and what I did, but Kroger didn't value the employees that worked hard and who did everything to meet the customers needs."
good,"I have learned a lot working for Fred Meyer.  I have learned customer service skills, training, office procedures, filing, and what it means to work with a team."
good,"Most rewarding is being able to resolve an issue for a customer."
good,"I worked in the fuel center so I had to deal with customers more than I had to deal with management or co-workers. The job was pretty mundane once I figured everything out. Most customers were easy to deal with; a few were not. The hardest part of the job is learning all of the small nuances involved. After that, things become second nature and the job is quite pleasant. Except for there being no outside bathroom."
good,"on your feet and on the go, busy busy work back in the deli/bakery."
good,"Don't expect to be treated with much respect or integrity by your management team.  Dont expect to receive any compliments about accomplishing goals or reaching sales goals.  Theres always something negative your being put down for.  Im not referring only to my experiences, but what I've seen other employees deal with, even some with 10+ years experience.  Only positive thing about this place is getting paid weekly.  I am a Dept Head, and the work compared to the pay is the worst I've ever experienced when looking at the expectation."
good,Typical day of work would consist of me playing role of manager while the manager would leave behind extra slack. I had to tend to customers who would be angry with service because of mistakes the manager would fail to fix. Answering calls for cutomers processing money orders and transferring.
good,"Always busy and long lines"
good,"Kroger was just a job to me. Since it is a mainly a grocery store chain and a pharmacy second it's main focus was on the front store. We were never supported by management at store level nor corporate level. The customer was always right even if they were wrong. And Kroger has a habit of giving out gift cards to upset customers even when the customer is wrong. No support, No understanding, Demanding more of you with less hours and no extra employees, plus with holding bonuses because we didn't meet outrageous expectations!! Kroger like every other pharmacy chain out there is only interested in the almighty dollar not their employees!!!"
good,"This location was always steady and busy which made working enjoyable. However the process of advancement within the company was difficult at times. I have a family and my continuous different schedule made things hard for me. There would be days that I would work an over night shift (10p Sun - 6a Mon) then be scheduled to return back to work 8 hours later (4p-12a Mon) which would give me exactly 8 hours to go home sleep, eat and take care of my family. I tried to discuss this numerous times to try and make a little more of a set schedule for me. I did get along with all my co-workers and was always willing to give a hand where ever it may be needed. The most enjoyable part though was definitely the interacting with customers."
good,Working closely with recruiters to provide grocery retail stores with best-fit candidates for hourly positions. Assist with day-to-day operational activities associated with the recruiting function. Provide an effective recruitment process for candidates applying to Kroger grocery retail positions.
good,"A typical day at work is basically a headache. We never had enough people on the ""busy"" days and had too many people on the ""slow"" days. What I learned was I can not rely on management to complete anything. My co-workers were amazing, well some of them were, we were a really good team together. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with all the call outs, the lazy people, and the back talkers. My most enjoyable part would be my favorite customers that came in everyday to see me!"
good,"Union workforce that spend more energy avoiding work/customers then actually being productive.  The result is workers such as myself are left to manage a whole department alone.  Management does not staff ample workers at peak times creating longer wait times for service."
good,"A typical day would start by showing up punching into the time clock and going to the front desk to see what register/department you would be in the unless you were getting pulled into the office to be ""talked"" to you would pretty much be on your own the rest of the time. A little interaction of your progress and how you are doing would have been nice."
good,signing in patents. getting vitals. work with NP's. we're in a grocery store. Getting along with different people good and bad
good,"Enjoyed working with the company, learned how to stock up groceries, and how to do returns, the hardest part about the job was working with coupons especially if you were new to the company. I was so upset because people thought I worked there for the longest. But I caught on after watching older employees."
good,Good job got people that need a first time job. A little unorganized and lack of pay
good,"I started off as a courtesy clerk, which was fun because you get to meet and greet everyone around the store, you are pretty much doing cleaning tasks, making sure products are orderly, helping customers and great for high school/college students. I was then promoted to bakery, which was cool because you get to learn about baking stuff, but my manager was too lazy and would dump her assignments on me which made the job unbearable. Keep in mind that benefits arent great, pay is minimum and you have to freaken pay a union every pay check! I hated that! If you work hard enough you will move up."
good,"Worked there for fifteen years, and went from $3.50 to $9.00 an hour."
good,"Accepted and checked in deliveries. Inspected merchandise and sorted, between damaged, outdated, discontinued, and overstock. Checked weekly ads to make sure we had the right price and item. Use a telzon on a daily basis. Preformed the prime time shelf review daily. Entered information into the computer, printed reports then distributed the reports to the manager and all of the department heads daily. I reduced the price on all seasonal and discontinued merchandise. Shopper’s tour guide, I would help the customer’s with their problems. Whether there is a problem with the price of a product. Finding a product for them or putting in an order for the product. I would make shelf tags and merchandise signs when needed. I conducted food sampling and demonstrations when scheduled. Helped other departments when needed and helped create displays when needed."
good,Roundys has no idea how or what is involved in running a pharmacy
good,"Everyday was exactly the same. I would go in for my 8 hour shift, clean messes made by the person working before me, and get started. My job was to clean parts of the store I worked in, cut fruit, make orange juice and guacamole. The pay was 10 cents over minimum wage, but on a daily basis I did 3 people's jobs. The person in the back left early and never finished their work, so I had to. The people who stocked the produce area always asked for my help and since I helped, they tended to slack, and I had to be sure everything I had to do was also done. Most the time the manager would tell us about events on short notice so we had little time to do a lot of extra work."
good,"A typical day at work could be described as, fast paced and energetic. I learned that working together as a team is extremely important for the success of a company. Although the store I worked for had rather poor management I believe most of the employees came together and made up for the lack of leadership. My co-workers were very pleasant to work with. The hardest part of the job was the lack of proper management skills, it makes it hard to work for a company and give it your best when the management team is unaware of correct store procedures. The most enjoyable part of my day was interacting with the many familiar customers that would often visit our neighborhood store many times a day."
good,Management was good. Treated with respect but pay is not good. Job was good.
good,"Unless your management, this job sucks. People call off all the time leaving you short handed and with a lot of work to do. They take to long to hire you in full time. The hours are terrible, look forward to working every weekend."
good,"Too much responsibility is placed on very few people who actually care about their jobs. I started working at Kroger with high hopes of being able to stay there for several years until I graduated from college, but several instances of sexual harassment were ignored, any suggestions on how to improve performance in several departments were not taken into account, and personal requests were catalysts for severe consequences (i.e. loss of hours, change in shift time, etc) I enjoyed many of my coworkers and many of them were very hardworking and dedicated but there was little opportunity for job advancement and they were far outmatched by lazy employees who left them with the work of at least four people per one person."
good,management needs improvement.
good,Its nice for a small time job but dont stay there to long they will try to walk all over you.
good,Worst job I have ever had. I would not recommend working at Pick N Save. I would rather be unemployed.
good,"Cashierd,stocked closed store had to balanse cash drawers,produse dept. was fun an the co-workers where fun also.Management was cool they where the oweners we where one big family."
good,"co-workers are great management is not so great. the hardest part is doing a lot of work for little recognition best part is the ""good customers"" the ones who it is truly a pleasure to serve."
good,"On feet all day, working around other people, trying to be fast paced."
good,"Hampered by union vs. management issues, employees get stuck in the middle. Low pay, few hours, and little opportunity for advancement make this an ok job for high school students who want to make a little extra cash."
good,"multiple locations,"
good,My store manager is rude and treats her/his employes terribly. Mostly all of the management in my store are rude and don't care about their coworkers. Half the employes at my work don't care about there jobs because the managers are always bringing them down and don't encourage them to do better or praise them for the good things they have done. Terrible pay for hard labor work. I've had plenty of customers complain about my store manager to me personally and has called corporate on her/him; talking about how rude they are and disrespectful they are.
good,It's just a job. It does not require much except accuracy and consistancy.
good,"responsibilities far exceed authority, could have been part of the culture that led to company closing"
good,Kroger is a decent job experience. I worked there for a total of 7 years during those years a worked all over did a little in every department. i also learned how to handle customer and employes so you can really get a chance to enhance your people skills
good,"The lack of communication w/ management resulted in worker confusion and frustration.Policies or proceedures were created just so someone could justify having a position. Too much work given to too few employees as well. They trimmed out everyone, and doubled to work on a few, w/o compensating anyone but the higher tier workers."
good,"Barely any job security, management have vendetta issues, no respect for employees whatsoever, most benefits are extremely over exaggerated, no care for workers under the management's supervision."
good,After corporate was called about the safety of our store we were put under new management and everything went downhill and they let go of all employees.
good,"Management doesn’t care  Deli manager in Waterville is a detriment to Kroger  a mean vindictive woman  upper management puts up with her  sad  in"
good,It was a nice work atmosphere until the management changed I was a hard-working and willing and able even with my disability of only having one hand I can use in arm what are the job titles will put on me cuz other people wasn't picking up the snap it at work which I didn't mind at first but then after a while I started getting tired and lack of ours was a big issue but I like being paid every week
good,"My first job seemed to be an introduction to the horrors of entry level jobs. Most of my day was punctuated by complete lack of cooperation from my equals. It seemed like I was the only clerk who took their job seriously. I usually did most of the cart collecting even if multiple other associates were sent out to the lot. On days with inclement weather, we were provided with minimal protection from the elements. I will say that the free water bottles stopped us from suffering heat strokes or dehydration. Perhaps if I had worked with people around my age who weren't so lazy, I would have left that job feeling more than a bitter taste in my mouth. Funnily enough, the connections I did make at that store weren't even working the same position as me. At the end of the day, I only enjoyed working out on the lot because of the tips."
good,"I was poorly treated as far as only getting 12 hours a week and having to pay bills. I asked Kroger for about a year to help me get more hours and they never once reached out to help me. So, therefore, I have to find another job."
good,"Poor management,poor communicate among everyone,over worked,underpaid,I understand now when they say this kinda of job is not meant to be a career and probably why the place is ran so poorly,they are everything I am not when it comes to how to treat co workers"
good,"Back in 2015 raises were .25c once a year. And I left the job of courtesy clerk after almost a full year making $7.45 hr., which isn't enough to live on for two people. And the manager wouldn't advance me to other departments. Other departments paid more per hour."
good,its a great place to work. i loved working there. the work enviroment is great along with coworkers. they give lots of hours  and they are very nice and welcoming
good,Great with full time and part time benefits. But their job security is trash. Especially for employees with proof of medical disabilities. I believe its every man for hi
good,"Kroger has a revolving door for management, and each manager cares more about the daily sales than their employees well being. They are unfair with scheduling, and accuse their young employees of lying constantly. Extremely busy job for a 16 year old, much more physically demanding than working in a restaurant as you are bagging groceries all day and every hour-30 minutes you go outside for an hour-30 minutes gathering carts. Cars do not watch out for pedestrians so you are constantly compromised by cars. We were not provided water in the summer and were told it is not their job to provide us with water though they had us outside pushing carts every 30 minutes. Good start for a job but a horrible company no one should stay with. Only plus was the friends you make and the bonuses you got. Compensation never went up unless the minimum wage went up and you were only allowed a 15 minute break if you were working under 8 hours, from there you got a 30 minute break. Horrible working conditions for a 16 year old child."
good,"My time training consisted of 3 weeks in a store and then 1 week in Louisville at the division office training. You do this for 12 weeks and then you will get assigned a store. Training was great no issues there. But once you get assigned a store is when all the trouble begins."
good,"It's a nice place to work where you have help all the time, when everyone is scheduled correctly and payroll is set up properly. Dealt with problems with management, staff drama, problems with scheduling and payroll."
good,I wouldn't recommend working at Kroger. They dont pay well. Management is not very understanding and management  is not concerned about the ethics work of their employees
good,"If you go to school they can work around your schedule. All stores are different in terms of product and how busy it is. If you want to move up you have to work hard and you have to be liked by your manager. At my store, if you weren't liked you weren't moved up. Also at my store, a lot of new people didn't make it past a month. Definitely the type of place you get stuck in."
good,"My schedules were never the same,which is extremely hard for a young mother. I was underpaid because of my gender for many years. This place is all about who your know and not how well you do your job. The morale at my store was extremely low and was always a negative environment. I would suggest that this company is best suited for a young single person who is available at all hours and/or is very flexible in their working schedule."
good,Kroger was my fist time working as just a cashier in a busy store. You get paid minimum wage to stand at a register for 6 to 8 hours a day. Your role is to be kind to the customers and to ring up their orders correctly.
good,"No more than part time hours, and they are with the union meaning even more gets taken out of your checks, not the greatest job especially if you are looking to live off of it  and the hours depend on how long you’ve been there meaning you won’t work the morning if that’s all you’re available for because people who have worked there longer get those morning hours before new people are able to  supposedly that’s how their computer system makes the schedules"
good,"Overall, Krogers is a great general store for a first job. I would just expect more hours on weekdays and working around school hours. It’s hard managing school and working with co-workers and mangers making things difficult, If you’re not meeting those requirements that is expected for working. They’ll try to not schedule you for weeks on end to make you want to quit."
good,"I have worked here for over a year and I have learned that management is much more worried about the store rather than how their employees are doing or what is going on. The managers and supervisors pick sides and if they don't like you they will show you and make sure you know it. A typical day is understaffed and crazy, always calling people from the back to the front and of course, late breaks. The culture is fun, if you make friends, otherwise it is awkward and fairly annoying. The hardest part is definitely dealing with the after church rush/before football game rush. The only enjoyable part of the job is leaving."
good,Because of management I thought kroger was very stressful place to work and I realize that we all have to start somewhere but they hire entirely too many kids that do not want to work
good,It was boring and only paid $7.25 an hour. The managers sucked and you have to go outside a lot so it is either super hot or pretty cold. I would not recommend.
good,"Bad work environment, poor pay, bad management/over management, treated like you do not exist by customers, over worked by company and when I had a problem with my schedule the manager threw a fit. Also when I was hired they gave me the wrong position and would not change it right away."
good,"I don't care to tell of my work experience at Kroger"
good,Most of the managers on duty do not care about their employees. Other than the managers Kroger is not a terrible place to work. They do give older people better schedules than younger.
good,"I worked for this company/store for 3 years and they have always made it hard for their employees by not having enough help, poor management, and unreal job expectations. The compensation you receive is low compared to your workload they put you on and they often offer new people more money then their current people. They don't even offer benefits until after your 90 days and unless your a full time employee. Not to mention that corporate constantly harasses this store even for their great performance over other stores. The only good thing about this store was the people who worked with me to get our task done."
good,Allow relatives to supervise one another. Blatantly biased towards family and friends. Management speaks condescending to minors in front of other associates.
good,"I was working when they couldn’t decide on how much to pay people and I was moving away, my experience is unique, but I did not enjoy my time with them."
good,It helped with quick pace moving fast. I learned how to be quick and organize when doing go backs. I enjoyed helping people when they couldn’t find their items.
good,My review is I did a learn a lot working at Ralph’s and had more experience.  I learn about management and the staff from there did train to be at the Deli and and bakery management and of course cashiers I been a cashiers for more than 10yrs
good,They don’t want to give you enough hours to become available for full time and when you change your availability they give you like no hours for they will work u 5 days a week but your only getting minimal hours and it doesn’t pay the bills
good,"For most of the day you will be extremely slow unless there is a sale on salmon, there will be occasional times where you get 4-5 people at once but the work is usually slow; If you are the closer you need to close the meat and seafood section, deal with customers, clean all the dishes for both sections, pack all the food up with a wrapper that is positioned to hurt your lower back, and clean every surface. all this needs to be done within an hour or two or you will get in trouble, so you better hope to god you don't get a lot of customers while you're trying to close. Also my manager would put expired food out, so be careful shopping from seafood departments."
good,The majority of fellow employees at Kroger were lazy and disrespectful towards one another. The management was inconsistent and irresponsible at best.
good,Poor management doesn’t appreciate their employees they have changed a lot of managers since I left heard that it’s getting better place to work would go back if management gets better enjoyed working until things started getting unbearable
good,Management was awful and the hours were little to none thanks to all the good shifts going to the people who have worked at Kroger for decades and made a part time job for high school students a career path. I have nothing positive to say about Kroger except i got paid.
good,"Working with Kroger wasn’t at all what I was expecting. For one, I applied full time, expecting full time hours which I think is around 40 hours a week if not, sometimes more if needed. I only received 20-30 hours a week, sometimes over 30 if I was lucky. And the manual labor I had to do, given I was trained both as a Buggy Boy and Cashier, the management threw me on registers when it got busy and threw me outside to get buggies when the current buggy getters were slacking. It was both physically and emotionally draining especially given the poor hours and all around pay I was awarded."
good,It is extremely busy and the pay is not enough for the job. They constantly change the schedule so you never know when you are going to work. They will cut your hours randomly.
good,Fast paced work environment. Management is not friendly and not enjoyable to work under. Did not treat employees well. Lots of callouts from other employees.
good,"Recent changes in the leadership in the Cincinnati/Dayton division has changed the culture, morale and direction of the company and not for the better."
good,"It was hard to move up the ladder, I worked as a customer associate and the pay was low and dealing with coworkers was not always easy to work with coworkers."
good,"As an assistant manager, all I can say is be ready to work. The service deli is highly fast-paced. You must learn how to manage your time and multi-task."
good,"I used to love working for Kroger until I moved into the e-Commerce department. I was given a lot of responsibility for very little pay. When they rewrote the union contract it affected everything. New hires were making $2 more an hour than me, who was in a leadership role. The hours were all over the place and I didn't have a say in what shifts I worked."
good,No help. Over worked. Too many task not enough people. They work you like a dog. Only worry about center store. 0 training in new roles. Management treats you like dirt
good,"I haven't even been there for a full month and management has been talking down to me and treating me poorly. All they do is chat and gossip. I also haven't been fully trained, so they have also scolded me for not knowing what I'm doing despite not having me trained. It's learn as you go which isn't fair at all."
good,should not hire for positions they know will be cut shortly after the person is hired then stick them in a position you told them at the interview would not be a good fit and would not be something you would be able to do. Then stick them in that same spot and demand performance  that isn't in my abilities
good,"Its a big box grocery chain, so really what do you expect here? Management always giving you the run around, impossible to ask/receive raises, and the company is so customer oriented that it forgets about employees. EVERYTHING relies on the customer surveys, even keeping your job secure."
good,Beyond sorry place to work......  They want you to slave for four hours and very no over time but work for little pay and advancement. Make you wear and tare you body
good,"I worked in the deli and the front end. Most times the front end will give you plenty of hours. They can even give you 40 hours, but before you work 40 hours of 12 weeks they will cut your time. Why? So they won't be forced to make a full-time position. Part-timers are less expensive than full-timers. They get healthcare, guarantee 40 hours a week, plus the benefits everyone gets(discounts of Kroger brands, 10% off clothing with an extra 20% off Kroger brand clothing, and life insurance, seniority over part-timers).  The downside you have no control where you go and what shift you have. "
good,"Seriously, you need a review about a place i worked at 5 years ago? And there's no option to skip? This place was a nightmare with management. The end. Accept this."
good,"it was an okay place to work at. "
good,The managers regularly allowed for employees with seniority to bully the younger and newer employees despite multiple complaints. Changed management way too often and turnover rate was ridiculous due to bad workplace habits.
good,"Kroger does not really care about you as a person, only that your work is getting done. Culture there is strict, and brutal. Kroger does a lot of good in the community, for it's customers, but as an employee they make you feel like another brick in the wall."
good,"I would not recommend anyone work there and I do not plan on going back. The pay is good and I knew work would be fast paced, but the managers are rude and blame their employees for things they didnt do."
good,"When I first started at Kroger's they were willing to work with my hours at school. Now they have cut my hours to 2 days a week knowing that I need a minimum of 3 days to meet my bills.  When I ask to have more time and to be transferred to another department to get more hours, I am ignored."
good,It was a fast-paced environment the new department was interesting and fun it first then it became very challenging and I expect a lot out of you without wanting Do you compensate you. I was unsatisfied with the management at the store
good,"Krogers is a fine work environment depending on the managers you get that day, schedules are semi-consistent but enough sudden changes occur that its a hassle"
good,I enjoyed this job because I got to help people.I started as a cashier and worked my way up to office clerk and supervisor. I learnt a lot by working at Kroger.
good,Just had a part-time cashier job while in school. Weekly pay is always good but if not in management then the pay is minimum wage or a little more depending on your background.
good,"Kroger isn't the greatest place to work, but hey at least they pay minimum wage and pat weekly. Theres no benefits, sick days, or overtime at all. Forget paid days off as well."
good,I believe i was wrong to call off during the probation period It is my fault I was let go.  I believe that I should have been given a verbal warning before my termination..
good,Every time it came up for me to be hired full time they denied it even though I was working full - time hours. I was even put in a managers place and still denied full - time.
good,"Kroger is supposed to be a friendly, fun place to save money and have a good experience shopping. it is also supposed to create a feeling of family between the associates(kroger term for employees). at least, this is what the orientation video told me. Unfair management, high seniority people being allowed to play with rules and regulations and overall a lack of information from most people. Im sure other kroger locations are better to be employed from, but the location in Stanton ky is misery. ask most people working there, and they will tell you the same. eight days of work for only four hours a day, working part-time employees 39.75 hours a week to avoid full time benefits(actual example of a week I was scheduled for) and a loose, unstructured schedule are some of the problems at Kroger. The job itself is great, but the management are not. once, while the current store manager was on leave for a few months, a replacement was brought in from a larger store. during her time there, customer and employee happiness was much higher. productivity went up. not to say she was lenient, I was written up by her more than anyone, but it was fair. instead of being written up for things you couldn't control, she would fuss over things that mattered, and try to help you become a better person. she was friendly, honest and sincere, traits management now need desperately."
good,Company was fine untill they cut number of employees used in the postions. Caused stress level to rise and didnt enjoy getting yelled at by customers for rising gas prices.
good,"Clock in, start helping the bagging line. Go out and get carts and bring them to the foyer. Breaks were super inconsistent they were never on time. A few of the workers didn't do anything. The workplace was kept up with and clean. Learned that even if people were slacking off doesn't mean you should too. Management was alright but not the best. The timings on somethings needed improvement. Hardest part of the job was dealing with the incompetent people.Most enjoyable was putting smiles on customers faces when they looked down. Plus helping the kids out and seeing the smile was very heart warming."
good,an ok starter job however after 2 or 3 years its not recommended to stay there it can become a very toxic environment. the work conditions are not great either and no focus is ever placed on that part just the exterior so that many customers are drawn in. i do believe that there are some good qualities  working there like learning good customer service however it can become very unsatisfying very quickly and before you know your only there for the money because you have responsibilities to uphold not because you enjoy it.
good,They expect alot from you with very little pay. You will get burned out very quickly. Your hours vary and its hard to have a life outside of work. Im a single mom and work more than anything and I'm always getting called in.
good,"Stressful and negative work environment, super busy, not a lot of employees willing to work hard. Management hasn't done much to make the place better."
good,"Retail. High volume, so enough staff to relieve you for lunch. Comparable compensation, but constantly requiring more with no further compensation. They recently took away raises. Too much emphasis on customer based reviews without accurate ways to record them."
good,"Management was not welcoming, and did not provide the necessary training on required programs. Their expectations were not consistent          with all employees."
good,"Kroger is trying to stay proactive in keeping relevance in the new digital environment. In order to invest in this future, policies were placed that significantly reduced cooperate headcount without any reduction to work that needed done. In time this investment will pay off, but for the time being, it is increasingly more difficult and stressful in the cooperate offices. This has led to significant turnover, which further complicates the already stressful work levels."
good,Floor managers were very miserable people who would take their frustrations out on the associates and anyone below them in rank/ position. Not worth working there for long term.
good,"It really is a typical grocery job. I was in the bakery so I decorated cakes, then moved on to management. You do stand on your feet a lot and picking up heavy boxes is typical."
good,"The management was inconsistent. Some would be harsher than others. There was no ""set"" policies in place for what was to be done and what wasn't. Some managers would let things slide while others were strict. They hired in management from areas that had no idea of what retail food service was like and wouldn't listen to the people that did know."
good,"I've worked here for four years. It's been really stressful. Usually short-staffed. You'll do the same work as the leads, but get paid significantly less. I used to get two fifteen minute breaks, but since we're short staffed constantly, I only get one fifteen minute break now."
good,"Kroger is a good first job, when you're in high school. After that, it's probably best for you to move on. I worked for Kroger for 4 and a half and personally felt, I was being severely underpaid."
good,Very challenging and fun at times. Most customers questioned everything they were charged for. Some supervisors would show anger in front of customers and belittle employees in front of them.
good,"The last year i worked there i was working the customer service desk,  I supervised employees making more than twice what i did because the union voted in a multi tier pay scale..  I also only had 3 weekends off the entire year.  I realize it is retail, but there are 52 weekends and only having 3 off was insane."
good,"Extremely fast-paced environment.Poor communication between Executive Leadership and Store Management. As mid-level management, it was difficult to foster a positive employee culture with constantly changing Corporate priorities."
good,"I worked in the deli/bakery which was constantly understaffed due to hiring non-motivated workers- mostly kids fresh out of high school or in between semesters at college. The pay was despicable and pay raises even more so. I was their head cake decorator pretty much from a couple months into the job until I left. I was expected to fill my cake orders and also leave my post to help on deli counter, constantly bouncing back and forth. It got so bad that I barely had any time to complete my own duties, having to beg my supervisors to get me some help with doing cupcakes for the cake cases among other duties I could not fulfill due to being dragged to the deli counter constantly. I was paid barely more than minimum wage at 8.50 and I would constantly ask for raises since I was basically doing the job of 2, sometimes 3 people, and they would refuse everytime."
good,There is room for advancement only for a select few who strive at working here and only if there is an opening in an upper level which is rare unless it's a larger store.
good,Kroger is only concerned with the bottom line dollar. They treat hourly employees horribly due to the unions. There is no cohesiveness even for the salaried employees. Horrible Stressful Environment.
good,"The store doesn't run effectively due to always being under staffed. Management claims that there are too many on staff, even though there are almost always long lines at the service deli and when the department personnel ask for assistance, the help sometimes takes over ten minutes to arrive; then the deli staff is treated like idiots because they asked for help with a customer to deli clerk is sometimes 20 to 1"
good,"It is about keeping the customers happy. If customers aren't happy I am not happy. It is a quick paced job that can be stressful if you allow it but I was able to stay calm. I payed attention to one customer at a time and took care of them first and then worked on to next customer who needed help. I learned that customer is always right no matter what. The three A's were appreciate, acknowledge, and assist. The hardest part of the job is trying to get all the carts out in cart corral and when there were not enough bagger's, it was hard to help all the customers bag at every lane. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to do different jobs as a bagger such as going and doing bathroom checks and cleaning to take a breath when it got super busy and were bagging for awhile up front. Also being able to get to know the customers and helping them out."
good,corporate cares more about profits and keeping customers happy than they do about their employees. They haven't worked in an actual store for 20 years if at all. They keep appointing bad managers that they think are good because of that. the manager at the store now likes to treat good employees like garbage while treating bad employees like gold. They pay people who've been there for months the same as people who've been there for a year or two.
good,"For the most part this job is easy but it doesn't pay well and the management seem to think they are the greatest, most supervisors/managers act as if the other employees are dirt."
good,"Managers are just thrown into the role. So usually, they have very limited knowledge of management practices. The good managers are so few and far between, they will get transferred all most as soon as they came to the store. Great job security and if you are willing to work and are friendly/outgoing then Kroger is a good company. You are protected and can usually achieve full time status to receive benefits and other options. Pay is not great and the raises go basically un-noticed."
good,"It has been quite a few years since I have worked at Kroger, but I do not miss it. I was a cashier and at times worked at the service desk. You were consistently busy and sometimes did not get breaks. The pay was minimum wage and you never got a raise. I actually moved to 3rd shift just to get the extra 50 cents. Full time is not an option unless you've been there for like 20+ years. Getting the hours you needed during the week was hard too, they would give the better hours to people with seniority."
good,The work I did was not worth 7.35/hour. The store manager and department manager were very rude. They would talk about other employees behind their backs and very two-faced.
good,"Working for Kroger can be a great experience for some but sometimes it can be difficult because of time management as far s scheduling , but other than that it's pretty cool."
good,"Kroger at Inglewood has been a pleasant work experience.  I am grateful to have had the company and work at the time I was hired; however, the work is incredibly physical and my needs have changed.  I am ready to move forward."
good,"Great company itself but when I was there the management was none existent,if you ask me. At my time of employment I was not satisfied with the work environment or the ppl . Then a while after that I was wrongfully terminated for he say she say."
good,"You don't receive breaks on time, management is not very friendly and do not take the time to help or listen. Hours are constantly being cut, and they do not want to discuss the issue. Harassment is okay by management unless you are in their pocket. I did not enjoy my time there."
good,"More care for numbers and profit versus the workers themselves."
good,The managers there were just rude and didn't know how to talk to the people under them. I wanted to quit everyday i worked there. The hours were longer because of that.
good,"While working at the Saint Albans Kroger, I did not learn much at all. The schedules were very inconsistent, workers there were very harsh towards other workers, and customers."
good,"Kroger is a good first-job for a high-school student, or anyone who is looking for part-time work. Starting salary is minimum wage. Your schedule is flexible for the hours that you choose!"
good,"I was a deli associate at Kroger for a short time. I feel poor management takes place on how coworkers interact with customers, as well as others.The work area was very unorganized and unsanitary. There was not enough freezer space to put frozen products (only a small freezer) inside the deli. Deli items were not tagged with dates, spoilt, molded items in glass showcase. Which is where workers filled orders."
good,Krogers what a pretty good starting job it taught me a lot. For example it taught me how to do an interview and how to open and close a krogers store.
good,"After being there for almost 3 years, I have gone from enjoying my work, to tolerating it, and now seeking a job that can help me advance in my career."
good,It's fast pacework place. The workers or management has no regards to safety. The workers drive around not paying any attention to safety for co-workers.  Management has that by any means necessary attitude. As long as the product gets built and shipped out that's all they care about.
good,Management was very inconsistent with rules. Store manager was very strict and did not follow union policy. Was asked to do every minor task and was consistently the only courtesy clerk in the front.
good,"you have to work retail hours which is probably the worst aspect of the job.  Working in the deli is similar to working in fast food. you have to prepare hot food as well, deal with customers, and have you peak times where complete pandemonium breaks out.  Depending on the people you work with the job can be bearable.  Still has low pay and wonky hours. However their scheduling is done by computer, so you can change your availability to work, but you have to remember that even if you do that, its based on retail needs and might not come out the way you want."
good,I've been at Kroger for a little over a year and seems like you have to kiss butt to get opportunity for advancement. They work you hard and the pay isn't good. The best thing about Kroger is the health insurance package.
good,"If you're looking for one of the only part time retail jobs with fairly good benefits its here, if you can put up with the immature atmosphere of the other employees. They will do anything to put you down, both personally and job related to bring themselves up."
good,The work did not commensurate with the pay at all.  You are always part time no matter what.   You had to apply for full time not work hard and earn it.
good,"A good company to to work for if you are looking part time work. Specific location I worked at really needed better managers. Overall enjoyed the job, I had to quit due to a sick family members needs"
good,"While this company pays some peple well, like me, the high levels of stress and pressure put on employees by management is like no other. The amount of hours given to the departments for scheduling is a joke, so the store is always severely understaffed, but the managers do not take that into account. Managers consistently come to different departments, asking questions about task completion and offering no helpful feedback or contributions, while making employees feel awful. The employees and coworkers are wonderful, and I have made a few friends here. The department heads are usually great, but management makes this place an awful place to work."
good,Working for Krogers had several Pro's and Con's. Krogers was my first job experience the pay rate was low and how much money you made was based off how many hours you received. The schedule changed every week so out schedules was not consistent which could be inconvenient. Overall this is not a job I would refer to anyone.
good,"Learned how to deal with people in a friendly manner."
good,"Great beginner job for the youthful incompetent naive and/or elderly retirees"
good,"I worked in the deli of fredmeyers, which I was told was the hardest department. It was extremely understaffed and the manager was unorganized. I tried moving to a different department multiple times but was lied to by two higher ups about the policy of moving. The hardest part of the job was serving all the customers fast. The most enjoyable part was my co-workers."
good,"This was my first job and there was a lot of miscommunication. I left because I did not like the environment. I understood that it was not a job everyone wanted, but that does not mean you can treat the customers poorly. I loved working with people and I truly miss them, but I do not miss the workers."
good,Most of the people were nice to work with. I didn't like the way they would work me 48 hours for 11 or 12 weeks and then cut me down to 30 hours so you didn't get insurance. They had a bad habit of doing that to people. I worked the graveyard shift for a while off and on and I liked it.
good,Work with great people and customers.  Always new things popping up. Advancement opportunities from part time to full time all the way to management and or training areas.
good,"Never expect full time hours only about 19-23 per week, or a chance of advancement.  Very late nights or very early mornings. Only get a raise when the union elects to give company employees a raise."
good,"work life balance is hard and a constant struggle."
good,"Did the management training program and hardly learned a thing. If you're from the outside the employees who are below you won't respect you. They give you no clear guidelines on what you're supposed to do so you aimlessly walk the store for hours. On your feet for 10 hours a day, but have to dress professional so comfy shoes are not an option. Higher ups have high expectations for the stores but won't pay more than $8.25/hour for employees. So when they walk in they're not happy at how the store looks, yet you're way under staffed. Constant changes with management and moving around. When you hear the salary it sure sounds nice, but you get paid once a month and once you factor in 50+ hours a week you are making way less money than you should be."
good,"This job was good for high school and attending college full-time, my personal treatment was not the best but that's why they are a corporation. They did not offer full-time to anyone, but expected us to come in every time they call us in."
good,"When working for the union stores, you knew what to expect. Do your job to the best of your ability and to company standards and you were treated fairly. After stepping down from a department managers position to an assistant department manager in order to transfer to a store that was non union but closer to my home, I had no idea what can of worms had been open. The department manager at the non union store was very agressive and insecure. Insecure to the point that it border lined being a hostile work environment. The store manager quickly made sure it was understood that since we were so far away from the office, we did things his way, and he did not care how they did things in Denver. A couple of employees were hurt on the job and very questionable means were used to prevent the employees medical treatment. The job itself was very stressful but enjoyable, the behind the scenes activities made it very hard to work for."
good,The people who were in authoritative positions were very demeaning and chose to treat people with the least respect possible. It was very hard to ever get a day off that was needed for things such as appointments and events regardless of how long of a notice was given.
good,"Tried to manage conflicting priorities, but failed at least one person each day. My lead favored certain people. I didn't make enough money to fight for my reputation everyday."
good,The management took very little interest in this area of the company.   Some of the workers exposed their cell phone choices of inappropriate things on the web.  Did not take any interest in their employees who worked 2nd and 3rd shift.  Pay was not that great.
good,Nobody could use your register without your password so you didn't have to worry about anyone stealing under your name. The people were friendly and it made working easier.
good,"Kroger is a good place for a teenager to work as a summer employee, but as an adult trying to support your family it is difficult. Pay is average, but the cost of living is not a concept they take into account. They are constantly pushing to get more and more out of their employees for less money. The stress level of their full-time employees is totally unnecessary."
good,"I worked part time and was given close to 30 sometimes 35 hours a week. Was overworked for my pay and didn't receive a raise. You get no lunch break, unless of course, you are a manager and you smoke. Breaks are short, and you are overworked."
good,"terrible place to work at if you want a life outside of the job. They don't care about you having free time. Its all about what you can do for them. if I could do it all again, I would have just gone to college and been done with this company a long time ago. the holidays are coming and its about to be ten times worse."
good,"My experience here was not too good. I put in 2.5 years and had a 10 cent pay increase. They make it very hard to move up as well. However, for a first job I would recommend it, just so you have some time under your belt."
good,"My first impression was bad w/ orientation lasting over 7 hours. The  picking operating system used in clicklist is awful, but when it did function, most of the job was pleasant. As a team member, you have to accept that you're likely not going to get a raise. You also have to have decent social skills to interact with customers on the floor and in click list."
good,Management is usually just worried about the bottom dollar. Some of the non management personnel were awesome but other than that it's way too stressful for $8.25 per hour.
good,I generally spend my day/evening cooking food throughout my shift and preparing food for the following day. A lot of my time is spent doing dishes and cleaning.
good,"I worked at Kroger for a number of years and worked in many of the departments. It is your typical retail job, where weekends off are hard to come by and you work every holiday. Being Micromanaged every day began to grow tiresome and I decided that it would be better for me to leave the company and see what else the world had to offer."
good,I enjoyed working at Kroger but the Management dropped the ball and could use some improvement. A typical day at work was usually slow in the mornings but round lunchtime it would always become really busy. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with required amount of scans at the register.
good,"I worked in the Bakery/Deli and it is non stop there. I did learn a lot such as how to cut deli meats, be creative with trays, how to cook in large batches, decorate cakes and cupcakes, bake cookies and pies. It was hard being the only one who would run all 3 areas Hot food deli, cold cut and cheese counter and the bakery. I really enjoyed making the customers happy."
good,most stressful job ever the management is horrible and they can hardly ever keep employees and the employees they do get can't hardly seem to learn the simplest tasks
good,"It truly depends on which managers style you get along with. All of our amazing managers left and so did I. It is a decent first job, but unless you plan on having stressful days and no advancement, it is not a very good career."
good,A typical day at work starts out with opening the cooler and checking for items to mark down or scan out. Then its time to check on your deliveries for the day and make a plan to put up your existing product to make room for the deliveries. I learned a lot about responsibility and time management at Kroger. The managers are usually friendly and are easy to get along with if you are working hard at your job. The hardest part of the job is managing your time for the many tasks you have daily. The most enjoyable part is that you have a set schedule and will almost always work at the same time everyday.
good,Extensive overtime due to lack of employees. Leaving after 10 hours was considered early. Management at the time of my employment constantly demanded the impossible considering the crew size.
good,"GREAT customers Not enough workers scheduled for busy days, No technical resource provided to check inventory, Too many irresponsible workers, no time"
good,"I learned a lot of the rules for foodbourne illnesses, but cutting fruits and veggies & keeping a clean environment were the biggest and most important part of my days. The hardest part is picking up the slack for the people that don't do their jobs and having to do your work too. I'd say the most enjoyable part of my job was having customers coming up to me requesting more of what I did in the kitchen and saying what a beautiful saladbar I had compared to other coworkers. Management wasn't exactly the best which is why they lost a lot of employees and can't keep workers in there."
good,"You will start out extra board or a yard driver. You will get odd looks and very few will speak until you get to know fellow drivers. Favoritism is at a all time high; meaning: You can work here 4 years and drop a trailer on the yard and get fired but work here 6 months, Run a truck in a ditch on the highway and keep your job. This is a good employer with good benefits and it will pay the bills. It has a union and the dispatchers will constantly remind you of that when they try and screw you and you are unhappy about it. Although I do recommend this job, I also recommend keeping to yourself, do your job and go home and you will be fine."
good,Management constantly want to place blame on lower level associates and they are terrible at listen to issues that that hurt the company. Management does communicate well
good,I started working at Kroger as a Bagger and I wanted to move into management really bad and I was going to do anything to get there but now I really don't want to do it. I see Kroger as a great company to work for it's just the people who are suppose to represent the company like managers who gives Kroger a bad image when it comes to working there. There are so many issues that needs to be addressed that people forget is there and they continue to add onto the problems that the company already has. It's 2017 and I am scared because I don't know where the company is headed. Now I know that companies have their good years and their bad years but this is getting out of control. I will hope that the company can bounce back but it's like will the company hit rock bottom until they realize that there's a problem.
good,Lack of communication from corporate to store level is awful.  Management doesn't find out about certain store related issues from corporate until after the problem is found.
good,For a starter job this will get your feet wet.  The work is clean.  The demands are often very stressful.  The turnover is high creating a heavy burden on those who are the experienced worker.  It is a Union job so there are no performance raises.
good,They won't give you raise. Store manager don't know how to talk to people's she very disrespectful. I was a universal clerk doing cashier but wasn't getting paid for it. I was on time did things as though I was the manager
good,"A typpical day at work was stressful and hard, once your clocked in you go straight outside for cart for more than an hour at times. After doing carts for a hour or more you spend the rest of your time standing and bagging up food, also cleanign and doing go backs. Sometimes your breacks or lunch will be two-three hours late. I learned that you have to be strong to withstand thess conditions. On a goodnote the people you work with will be some of the best people you'll ever meet. I would have to say gaing and meeting new friend was the most enojyable part of working at Kroger"
good,learned to interact more with customers. the hardest part of the jib was when you had customers in a bad mood. A typical day was you were always busy.
good,"If you need additional income or are in school and want some extra money, this is the job for you. If you're trying earn a living, look elsewhere. The people I work with (excluding the managers) are great to work with. My customers are usually very friendly. "
good,not good pay. no opportunity growth very stressful working with people who arent experienced or dont comprehend english.  not enough breaks. over worked for the pay given.
good,Pay sucks for all the work you have to do. Part timers and closers are treated unfairly. weekly pay is a plus. Great if you get advance senority. Hours are not always available.
good,"A typical day at work involved a lot of cleaning and frustration that would usually pay off.  I learned how to reach out to customers and up sell items that may prove useful with other items purchased.  The management from Kroger was not helpful when it came to our department, however the management from Starbucks was quite helpful.  The workplace culture was dull and non-eventful.  The hardest part of the job was learning how to make everything.  The most enjoyable part was the relationships I made with every co-worker in my department."
good,This was my first job it was very stressful because the management does not train you well you have to figure it all out for yourself if you asked a different employee a question they would be annoyed.
good,"I have worked  at Kroger  for 13 1/2 years. Started as part time, now fukk time"
good,I didn't like this employer at all. The compensation is poor and I would only say that this job is good for kids in high school. and not recommended for people whom have great deal of financial responsibility. I am however grateful that Kroger hired me and the money although low helped me to pay some of those financial responsibilities.
good,"It't not a bad company, they expect a lot from employees but do not compensate them for the hard work they put in.  Can be difficult to stand for 8 plus hours a day on concrete floors."
good,"My typical day started very early at 5am and was completed whenever i was done.  I have been there as late as 8pm.  I enjoyed my job but management was another story.  New manager came in and started making changes before he understood the job.  Made for a crazy environment since union environment.  He caused many other managers to leave after i left before he got fired.  Other than that, good job with very good benefits.  Good people work there."
good,"Basic job that'll essentially get boring over time.  The only problem you'll find is that climbing the corporate ladder is slow, boring, and not that fulfilling."
good,If this is your first job then it's a fine choice because it will expose you to the worst of the working world early on so everything else wont seem as bad
good,"Don't expect consistency hour wise if you're part time. They will work you an entire week with different hours, and then give you nothing the next week. Overall, the people are friendly enough and usually very patient, but their policy leaves no flexibility and you cannot count on your colleagues when it comes to shift coverage. "
good,"This was job was mediocre. Low pay, horrible management, and unappreciated. I would have loved to grow and be in different position but the store manager put a freeze on promotions because of budget cuts."
good,It is a relaxed and fast paced environment. Customers are normally really nice and don't give you a hard time. Some employees are under paid for the amount of work they do on a normal basis.
good,"The entire company revolved around who you knew.  If you were in the cool club, then you had no problem advancing.  The union reps were not very helpful."
good,As Customer Service Associate I worked with Western Union and Cashier associate. The best part was the different cultures you get to see and learn from. The hardest is the management changes constantly.
good,Kroger is a good place to work if  you are single and have no kids. It would be best for school age kids and for retired. They don't work with you when it comes to kids and having issues with them.
good,Typical work day is fast paced depending on which hours you work. The experience you gain is that of working in community service so it doesn't provide beneficial experience. Management is great though. Hardest part of the job is the scheduling.
good,The co-workers and Customers are great but within the managers there is lack of communication in regards to employees availability. Overall it's a place for high school workers honestly
good,"You don't get a lunch break no matter how long you work, breaks were always extremely late, managers over the store and floor were horrible, I wouldn't work here ever again in my"
good,"the benefits the company offers are nice, if they let you have them. to get the benefits they offer, you needed to work a total amount of hours a month. However no employee was scheduled the amount needed. there seemed to be no room for advancement because they would hire from outside the company constantly. the FOUR managers i had, stepped down and promptly left the company due to mistreatment."
good,New environment filled with people who always want to help. Hardest  part of the job was probably learning the retail prosses and career. Best part of the job would be learning new things.
good,I used to love working for Kroger until I realized my manager didn't care about anyone but the people she was friends with. They were the only ones who had opportunity with the company.  It sucks when you have issues with others and can't go to upper management to discuss them.
good,Too much favoritism is portrayed by manager. No bonuses for job well done.  Too much taking advantage.  A lot of work is expected from one person who doesn't get breaks and is constantly on their feet.  Not enough pay for what employees are responsible for doing.  Too many shift duties expected yet not enough pay.
good,"Working at turkey hill was my first job, and I really didn't know what I was getting into. Lets start with my coworkers, they were truly concerning. I wouldn't say that they were bad people but they did things that I didn't agree with, like bowl with oranges and yogurt containers. My supervisors knew of these actions and did nothing to handle them. The customers that shopped there weren't any better. Some of the customers came into the store with the soul purpose of stealing something, but the worst thing ever was when they decided to befoul the bathroom. it was the worst working experience I have ever had."
good,"Store manager never spoke to employees, pay was way to low for job performed, union dues taken out each week but union never helped. Good for high school students but not for someone looking for career."
good,"Title petty much says it all, It's not a bad place to work and other stores could be different but the one that I worked at wasn't too great because of the management. Anything you discussed would go in one ear and out the other."
good,I worked for Kroger for 6 years. In those years I moved front a bagger to a department manager. The opportunity was great but the pay was lacking. I only got a .25 raise for that position. I had to work long hours and sometimes would not get a meal time. The benefits were expensive and did not cover much.
good,"Very repetitive, not much change from day to day. Stock, cull, juice, clean. Learned better communication skills. Management changes quickly. Not many people like working here. Hardest part is the rush times especially with sales. Most enjoyable is meeting new people."
good,"We generally started the day early, we would get our case numbers for the day and would have an idea of how long the work day would be. I learned much about working with others in different and even hostile enviroments. The hardest part of the job was the physical labor but it taught me a lot."
good,It was a busy majority of the time. Got the opportunity to meet a lot of different people on a daily basis. I enjoyed going to work because I was taught all the different departments in Kroger.
good,It was a job wasn't the worst job I've ever had but I've had a lot better. I think they pay more now too. I would probably not want to go back though.
good,Promises by management mean nothing. When there is an issue no one does anything about it. Most enjoyable part is dealing with customers because I would take care of them.
good,I worked at Kroger for 1 year and I had asked to move departments and they let me work in my desired department for one day then proceeded to put me in the position I told them i didn't want. ALSO MANAGEMENT IS VERY RUDE NEVER CARES ABOUT YOUR OPINION.
good,"When doing the job at nights I loved working there. Had no one I had to worry about. It was my time got to listen to music while I work. It help get through the work faster. "
good,"During my employment with Kroger Co. I have come to understand the reason for the uneasy or uninviting atmosphere. While the lower level employees do have their shortcomings, its the management that I wag my finger at. Mainly their unprofessional approach to conflict or any situation for that matter."
good,"I was told when I was hired that they never hired for higher positions from outside the company, but time and time again I find that to be false. I have been cross trained in all but three departments and I have been stuck as a cashier since a month after my initial hire date. They do provide benefits to part time employees as well as full time employees, but good luck getting them. You have to qualify for full time, which typically isn't that big of a deal, but when you have management going behind everyone's backs and cutting hours just to up their end of the year bonus, it's hard to qualify for anything."
good,the place just sucks and management is horrible depending on who was the manager during the day and the workers besides a few are lazy and dont belong there i hated working with the high school kids they are too lazy and the most enjoyable time was either when i get to go home or go on break
good,"Breaks are consistently hours late, some employees are lazy and lackluster, customers are angry at one department at least every day."
good,"The pay is horrible and the raises are barely if anything slim to non. The management changes atleast twice a year, which is not good."
good,Worked every holiday and weekend and snow storm. Department heads are the brains and work horse of the business. Long term dedicated employees that have been loyal to the company for low pay. Union environment. Company retirement which is hard to find these days.
good,"•	Maintain the knowledge of products sold within the department and be able to respond to questions and make suggestions about products"
good,Would not work with scheduling with employees. When called in sick and gave 3 hours notice they wouldn't take it and was forcing me to come in. Went to doctor to get note. They then said okay.   They would also say other employees couldn't leave and they would be throwing up. Very not understanding to needs of their employees.
good,"My direct supervisor refused to do his job because ""that is what he has us for."" I continually felt like I was expendable to them. I never felt like I really mattered there at any point. There was very little chance for advancement. I was actually told by one of the managers I had a better chance of being hired as a manager at another store than advance at all here. The customers were great people and I had many regulars come just to see me which was a plus. I also found the job to be rather easy overall, minus the fact that we were understaffed. Overall it was not the worst job experience, but there were a lot of things that could have been done better."
good,"Some days at Kroger are alright, other days we have to work really hard. I learn to interact with customers. Supervise others. My co-workers are so different. The hardest part is when you have a lot of people come in to the store and demand good treatments. The most enjoyable job is when I don't have to be on the register."
good,Called management for help with a product they took a whole hour so  we lost a $20 purchase and a customer who was buying a gift.
good,"Poorly managed store, people would always slack off and make the hard workers work harder. Looked forward to getting off."
good,Its a fast paced job that should be everyones first job. Sets you up for appreciating other jobs and helps you learn social skills.
good,"Most of my co-workers I got along with, some think they are better than everyone, no matter what, so they do have to be put in their place quite a bit. It was a stressful, but fun job. I loved my supervisors in the Pharmacy. If you hadnt been there for a long time, your schedule was pretty much 2nd shift, which sucked, but the person that made the schedule was willing to work with you A LOT!! Pharmacy Lead Tech is an amazing person!!"
good,the management at kroger is not very good they are lazy at times and its very hard to get them to do something you ask they all go and do one thing at the same time which makes no sense
good,"Employees and most customers made the job more enjoyable, but management always had attitudes and always had something to complain about."
good,Krogers pays minimum wage for most of their positions offered. The raises are a joke. They are understaffed majority of the day. Management does not take any staff complaints seriously.
good,"The pay is pretty low and the work depending on the department you work in can be grueling. The hardest part of the job is dealing with other employees and management, some want to do their job and some don't."
good,"The job was at a grocery store, so naturally everyday is at a fast pace with a lot of people with different attitudes and behaviors. I learned how to be more patient with people and great customer service skills. Management was horrible, rude and showed favoritism to certain people while making the others work extra hard with no recognition. My co workers were tolerable, there was no hard part of the job or enjoyable part, it was a boring job that didn't pay well or offer anything to look forward to."
good,"In a typical day, I would stock and maintain the shelves making sure that prices for each different item were correctly labeled."
good,For the work and job duties the hourly rate was too low. And the store didn't give much back to the employee's. I felt that it was very unfair to only receive points to our Kroger card as an award.
good,I love my co-workers. They are great people. To be honest with you the management could be a whole lot better. Customers can get a bit out of hand. If you cannot be polite to someone while they are arguing with you do not apply.
good,"Management does not care about your needs as far as hours/availability goes. Management does not 'value' their employees furthering their lives/careers. if an employee wishes to attend school, for example, management will try to convince them not to and stay with Kroger, putting down the employees decision, etc. They trap you into missing work, then guilt you if you don't show up. You will be humiliated and talked down to, by management, in front of customers. A LOT of favoritism. Very low pay, I made more at McDonald's."
good,"I would normally clock in about 5 minutes before the scheduled time so that I can get started I the department right away. I work an eight hour shift with a required half hour break. There is a lot of stuff that I learn throughout the day, but the main thing is better customer service. The managers try their best, but when it comes to their employees they tend to not do what's best for them. For example, I am one of the closing people in the deli and there is one other person. We are far behind and won't be out on time and we have to ask a manager for overtime. We ask and they don't answer and they walk over to the deli later that night to see where we are at and they say ""you'll get out on time, you don't need overtime."" Even though we are 3 hours behind schedule. This is all because our department head only scheduled 5 people to work on a Sunday, the busiest day of the week. And my co-worker had to leave at a certain time so that she can get to her babysitting job. So I was left by myself. That I would have to say is also the hardest part of the job closing the deli by myself with no help. But the best part is that I got paid time and a half for the overtime."
good,"The company was okay. Some of the supervisors are on a high horse  and the management does nothing about them treating the rest of the team like people,"
good,"While I was employed, the department was always understaffed so there was steadily a full days work to complete. Department manager was cool and helpful and focuses on working as a team and will do what needs to be done to make that happen. The pay certainly does not reflect the work load required to keep up with the demand the traffic of customers brings in. There is a wide range of responsibilities from simple customer service behind the counter to breaking down pallets on a daily basis."
good,"Kroger is a job where you work hard and you really don't get paid for it. You clock in , you go to your register , you start ringing up customers. If it doesn't ring up right you have to get a manger to override the price. The hardest part of working at Kroger is the customers. You have to learn how to keep your composure. I really didn't enjoy anything in Kroger."
good,Front End Management seems always confused about who will work what and you don't get many hours but they call when you're not scheduled sometimes to get more hours but they only give you a ten min window to call them back instead of putting those hours on your schedule they are always hiring and the people that already work there don't get the hours they need to even live day to day
good,Its was always chaotic and too much to do with little help. Management sucked and scheduling wasnt fair. Most of the co workers were snobby and thought they were too good for the job. I kept a smile on my face though and toughed through it.
good,I like the independence but mangers are stuck up and unfair. A lot of negative things happen every day and that's not a good work environment.
good,"Although I rated this company moderate, I learned A LOT about customer care/service, time management, organization. This company made me feel proud of myself everyday I went home, knowing I worked my butt off, and got the job done. It would've received a better review, if they hadn't tricked me my last 3 months, and told me that I will begin training to be the asst. manager. Only to be told a week before leaving the job, ""Oh you didn't sign any paperwork saying you were going to be the assistant manager, so your final paycheck will not have the raise on it."" (Even though they had me writing schedules, ordering products, managing coworkers, writing people up, and suspending people)"
good,"The overall management was poor and lacking in communication skills. Not one to nitpick, but hours, rate of pay and opportunity for advancement were seriously lacking."
good,"The Culture is one of ""be seen not heard.""  There is no collaboration just wait for the most senior person in the room to speak and then that's that. Many of the associates started in the stores only to find themselves in over their heads and not able to keep up with the ""outsiders"" who come in from high-caliber companies.  The veterans feel threatened and will engage in backstabbing and other petty things to make newcomers not feel welcome.  Most will leave within 2-3 years due to the lack of career progression and culture."
good,"Kroger is a good company to work for. However, the rate of pay is not enough and they do not give their employees the full amount of hours that they need."
good,"It had its moments, quick switches between fast and slow, on and off all the time. I learned how to slice meat and cheese and take care of the slicers. I also learned how to do markdowns for the department, even though the equipment tended to malfunction. Management was okay, but I felt that I wasn't really trained and I actually only met the manager two or three times it seemed. I actually tended to work by myself a lot, but the few hours I worked with others, those more experienced were generally very accommodating and understanding. The hardest part of the job for me was remembering customers various meat order, when they would order three or four things of differing weights. Then the second hardest part was trying to maintain the speed in order to serve all customers quickly and efficiently. The most enjoyable part of the job was actually how cool it was back in the deli, and I actually like the cleaning at night, when it was time to sterilize the slicers and organize the cases."
good,"Worked the front line and you had to make sure to be speedy.  I can't say I learned anything new here.  Management was alright but at times it was really hard to get help.  Co-workers very friendly and helpful, would help out whenever they could. Hardest part is standing for 8 hours straight. Enjoyable part was meeting some interesting customers."
good,No opportunity for advancement. I manage my employees in my department. Order writing and inventory control. Keep a clean and safe work environment for employees and customers.
good,"a typical day at work will be, me just clocking in on time and doing my job positively. I never had a hard time at work. I just fold clothes and keep things organized. I loved when my manger made me do stocking and other stuff. it was a little bit challenging and I loved that ,and  it made my day go by fast also. so that would be the most enjoyable part of my job. and also meeting and helping the customers. they are great people, with great story."
good,I enjoyed working with the employees but the store is poorly ran.
good,I was a courtsey clerk which was not what i was told that I was told i was going to be hired as. I stuck it out but i realized that i love serving. Had to get carts and bag people grocery for them.
good,its a small store cramped it wasn't an all good experience I would never work at a grocery store again
good,"Liked working independently, management sucked! Management expected too much from one person, they expected you to be able to do a 8 hour workday in about 4 with just one person. They over load and overwork you."
good,They don't really appreciate anything you do.  The pay sucks because they want so much out of you.
good,I learned a lot from working at Krogers. The management is great. They are very understanding and easy to get along with.
good,"kroger is a great job that just needs more to be really great, tyhe coworkers are the beast part."
good,Job was typically a fun job. I met a lot of nice people there.  I learned a lot about the handling of money and registers.  The hardest part of the job was getting there but that is not a problem now as I own my own car.
good,The manager who I worked under wasnt the best of a boss. I had two small children at the time and had no home life. The best thing about this job is the union would back you up if you have ANY problems.
good,The people you work with can be nice sometimes but management has things little backward and they say they are there for their employee but are really not.
good,"On this job I learned to always do things correctly and effectively no matter what your position is. The establishment I worked has weak management teams. It's an every man for themselves kind of environment. Their in desperate need of customer service consultations. The weekly pay and being able to satisfy my customers daily with great, fast, and accurate service was the best part of my job."
good,Days were long and some customers were disrespectful not caring about your feelings.
good,I enjoy working there but hours are too low. I enjoy the interaction with the public and the work is easy.
good,"- detail customer service, cash handling accuracy"
good,My Aunt had gotten me the position here. It being a small town store everyone knew everyone. As time passed and my aunt had fallen ill.  She got breast cancer. They decided to over step there boundaries as friends and coworkers. Including our manager. She pushed the limits by telling me what or how we should take care of my aunt. Considering she was not the one taking care of her. I chose to transfer stores I loved the company and what they did for our community. Eventually I transferred stores. There I had been treated with great deal of disrespect and poor work conditions. I was doing everything and this individual that I was working with did nothing and I got the blame for it. I even had witnesses to her actions. The most enjoyable were my customers I had regulars and I miss them to this day.
good,"A typical day at work consist of:"
good,"A typical day at Kroger is like being in a mad house. It is always busy, there is never enough help, and our breaks are usually late. What I have learned is to not go out of your way for the company because they don't appreciate what you do for them. The hardest part of the job is having to deal with rude customers and co-workers who complain about everything. The most enjoyable part of the day is getting away from the front end and putting away back stock."
good,"Busy grocery store where I get to do a multiple of jobs. I cashier when busy, when it's slow I put all of the go backs away. I learned that I love talking with all of the customers and that I am good at it. My co-workers are the best. My supervisors are the best and very fair. The store manager on the hand is stoic and hard to read and he makes me fill inadequate which is the hardest part of the job. "
good,"One day to the next was never the same at Pick N Save. Alot of the staff (coworkers and supervisors) kept personal relationships with eachother which caused problems. However, for the most part, many if not all employees would do their share of work. The hardest part of the job was dealing with disobedient employees the most enjoyable part of the job was keeping busy during peak times."
good,"A typical day consisted of dealing with customers causing issue to get something free, managers automatically siding with the customers even though they were clearly in the wrong, and I learned you can't expect all authority to be respectable. The hardest part was working extremely hard to get paid the bare minimum. The most enjoyable part was being able to see my co-workers every day."
good,A lot of work and not enough pay. The hours were hours that the manager didn't want to work.
good,Nice place to work but there is not a lot of opportunities to advance within the company. The management staff can get away with things I have never seen allowed at previous employers. The benefits within the company are amazing.
good,"A typical day revolves around making minor repairs and keeping the store in good condition. Very little knowledge is provided by Kroger, majority of the training is a learn as you go type. Majority of management at Kroger stores use their authority to do as little manual labor as possible. The hardest part of my job is getting things done and not violating their many protocols that cause more issues than solutions."
good,"A typical work day is the same, check out people, get yelled at by people and management. I learned how to use a register. My co-workers were high school kids who didn't want to work. The hardest part of this job was dealing with the customers who really didn't care about you. "
good,"Due to Union Limitations, Kroger is limited on all aspects of a competitive workplace."
good,"A typical day at work is a repetitive day to day hassle. I dealt with all kinds of people and I've learned a great deal in communications while providing great customer service. "
good,My manager had anger issues and would back you into a corner and scream at you in front of everybody. I moved up pretty quickly but never got a raise. I bated working there. I was sexually harrassed but management did nothing. I ended up quitting after 2years.
good,I do enjoy working for Kroger. The job is pretty simple and I like most of the people who I deal with on a daily basis. The problem is that Kroger rarely hires anyone FULL TIME so I have no benefits and the hours are not consistant. Kroger is great if you just need extra money but you can't expect to survive or provide for a family working here alone.
good,"I worked for the Kroger company for over 5 years, and the farthest I came up in pay was up to $8.10, Kroger does not give out evaluations and they do not give associates raises as often as they should. The only time my pay went up was when the state of Georgia minimum wage went up and that is ridiculous. They need to work on giving associates the pay that most deserve and they need to pay for associates who have experience because they do not do that as well. Also Kroger has poor management, I have worked at 3 different Kroger stores and all have had poor management, they're very unprofessional and they do not preform management duties the right way in the work field."
good,"I love the people and friends I had made, but the kroger and union isnt very good!"
good,You stand around all day. Management doesn't really let you talk with each other. I felt like I was in school all over again. Some of the managers are kind of mean and don't understand that employees have other things going on in their lives.
good,"I learned that afther 13 years at this co. they cared nothing about me or my word.I worked very hard ,I closed this store for many years. I was not late.I truly cared about my job and customers.But I was treated like i didnt matter."
good,Fry's is a good entry level job if you are young and still in high school.
good,"dispense and package an average of 60,000 scripts a week. what i learned is that i truly enjoy the pharmacy field. management lacks leadership and direction. there isn't any advancement in the company for the warehouse workers. pay is very low and at the moment i still don't have any benefits. morale is low. not many thank yous for all your hard work"
good,"I normally do break out which means taking breads,pies,etc out of the freezer and putting them on racks to be baked. I help put out the pasteries for customers. I assist with making cupcakes and writing on cakes. I help clean and close the bakery on a regular basis."
good,I worked for Kroger for 3 years. Started off at the grocery store Dillons and then transferred to the Kwik Shop. I would choose Dillon's over the kwik shop for a career opportunity because I think it may be an easier job to do while trying to enter or finish school.
good,"is that your opinion will never matter, But the good thing about it is we mostly had Honest people working thier just working to maintane thier life."
good,Depending on what shift your working the required task differentiate slightly but overall all the shift are required to clean and maintain the fuel center. The gas station stays busy all day and your day would mostly consisting of aiding customers in the purchase of gas and other Kroger products.
good,"I worked at kroger from sophmore year in high school to my senior year, as well as playing sports, and coaching. They always gave a hard time to me when i would request time off for an event. Everyone always faught with each other. It was just uncomfterble to be part of a working enviorment that was confused and didnt know how to get along."
good,"a typical day would be gathering the tags to be hung and running the batches so that the prices would change, engaging with customers, they have a very decent training program, management could be hard sometimes, co-workers were pretty great. The hardest part of the job would have to be when we were slammed pack and trying to get the customers out as quickly as possible. The best thing was my customers!!"
good,"Always busy making sure customers got the right ingredients for every holiday meal, birthday cake, or family dinner. When I wasn’t in the store bagging groceries I was out side helping the elderly with their packages to the car."
good,"On a typical day, it was cool to have a job but i knew deep down inside there was something bettr for me. What I learned from working in this type of enviroment being a courtesy clerk at a store is that you should always strive to reach the top in the company your working for instead of staying at the bottom. My co-workers were really cool and I got along with everyone at the company. The hardest part of my job was having to go out in the freezing cold or the hot sun and retrieve carts on the lot. That was the toughest part besides having to clean bathrooms and other stuff after people messed them up. The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing that I was getting paid to do the hard work that I was doing."
good,Decent but not a career building job. Made it to supervisor fast but stayed there until i left.
good,"A typical day at work for me is, baking, stocking the floor & making conversation with the customers. I really enjoy talking with the customers, sometimes they make my day or its the other way around I make theirs. The main thing I have learned working at Kroger, is patience. The management team there is not the best, so I don't have anything positive to say, so I won't say anything at all. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the different types of personalities, and dealing with partiality. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people."
good,always learning something new.management was always changing.
good,Kroger has great benefits and a union. The management at the Kroger I worked at were rude and demanding.
good,Kroger Co. was a good company but overall I think that the management could've been better and they could've had better benefits.
good,Management often would lie about things and would fill you with empty promises. They told me that I should be happy to work there and not expect more pay. Customers where a nightmare.
good,It all depends on which store you work at. Some pharmacist will work really hard to help there techs learn and be comfortable while other just watch as you figure it out. The job is not for people who are emotional.
good,Kroger would be a great place to work in they would schedule more hours to the employees that actually do their job. Overall it is a fun environment and fast paced.
good,"Very demanding,must devote your life to company.tries to keep up with competition but I feel they have fell behind.i fell they should pay more,or demand more realistic goals."
good,Good for part timers like me who are still in school. They are usually pretty understandable with availability and what not. You can set your own availability and then they will make the schedule off of that.
good,"It could be a better place to work. Less gossip and more teamwork is needed in this environment. Job security and recognition is a plus in a place of employment for employees, this company does not offer this to their employees."
good,Working at Kroger stores is very hard because they care more about the customers than the employee they do offer programs to help employees but it takes so long that the employees tend to end up in bad spots until it's almost too late to get recovery from situations even if they even if the customer is wrong management does not stand behind their employees as they should especially when the employee is doing what they're supposed to do and it's right in every manner the benefits that you get from Kroger stores off fairly acceptable but they could be much much better
good,"I only worked there for 2 months, when I was let go for having to many no call no shows, but I had only missed one day, the people I had worked with said all the non union workers where being fired."
good,"Kroger is a well balanced company, but lacks in certain important places. Management makes questionable decisions with questionable motives. Co-workers are 9/10 friendly and will help new hires as much as possible."
good,"I have only been here a few months, and almost every shift makes me want to cry. Management is corrupt and they do not support or hear you out at all. Even though some customers are so nice, a majority are outright rude and really make it hard to get through shifts."
good,"Even if I say excuse me customers still stay and keep doing what they were doing.   The isle are too small.  Some of the employees think they are the only ones working, and always in you way."
good,Working there wasnt to bad really just needed more employees an good management an also better/more hours I was only part time was expected to work full time but never got the hours like that
good,Pay could be hire...much higher compared to other companies.  Breaks are not encouraged for 12 hour shifts.  Not really any advancement opportunities and the pay seems to vary
good,This is the only job where I've had 4 different jobs and not one rise no thank you for helping us out there. Management there is just a sad site to watch
good,I rated the job itself 3 stars because it’s a nice job if you want to make money bi weekly . It’s great for students or people with two jobs or even people with children.
good,"Kroger was alright, but as time went on the work experience died. Hours were cut due to me being a minor. And seniors with the same job had more power over the new comers."
good,Managers never did their job expected coworkers to work overtime without permission never trained new workers properly absolutely a terrible place to work.
good,"Horribly unprofessional, disconnected management. Miserable,  degrading, stressful work environment. Unrealistic expectations for new employees who are left to do the dirty work for lazy management."
good,If you are looking to be a manager at Kroger and you are used  to being there for your family or you are use to work life balance than this may not be the Job  for you.
good,"A typical workday is cleaning equipment/dishes, making food trays, and serving customers via the deli and bakery counters. I learned to manage time better and to always keep on a happy face. The environment is very fast-paced and slow service is not acceptable."
good,"At first it was easy and fun, Sometimes customer service in not easy. Management would always the customer is right. This Company does'nt always protect it's employee"
good,"At first, the job was okay. Most customers aren't too bad and the day goes by quick due to how busy you get. However, you get one 15 minute break every 3 hours or so, which is barely enough time to get upstairs to the employee lounging area and eat your food. I was hired as a PART-TIME cashier, yet they piled me with full-time hours. I had to personally leave my manager a lengthy note before anything was done. Speaking of said manager, she treated employees like garbage. She spoke down to me when I came in for my interview. She spoke down to me about how I was doing my job, even though I was doing what I was taught to do. All the other cashiers and baggers hated her. She ended up firing me for ""excessive absences"" after I missed work due to strep throat, even though another manager confirmed that I was not allowed to come in and that I wouldn't be fired if I had a doctor's note (which I did)."
good,"The scheduling isn't great typically, with them not doing a very good job on days we need people. Management doesn't always listen and plays favorites. Many of the people have shown anger about the entire situation and want to leave. The (good) customers are probably the best part of the job."
good,The most enjoyable part of being at work was meeting the new people. the work place was very fun. I worked at night so the work place was very quiet and very easy to work. the culture at work was a little bit of everything.
good,Overall was a very minimal job  not a lot of communication from managers to associates. Would have preferred more communication. Many times was forgotten about and got no breaks.
good,Kroger is a place that keeps you under pressure. You're on a timer to see how fast you can get a customer out of the store. They have a high turnover of managers and employees. They just laid off managers. They have a union only for the smaller stores but not the marketplace stores
good,"the store manager was not flexible or understanding"
good,"This job consists of easy to learn tasks and is a great way to learn customer service skills, but there is a lack of organization in the management and inconsistent hours."
good,Store managers need to have their employees back and help them and listen to their needs. Respect their employees.  Build morale within the store. Corporate and store managers need to find a way to recruit and keep good employees.
good,"When I worked for TLC it had a terrible reputation within the region as being hacks and not professional. The team that I worked with at our specific location worked really hard to help improve its reputation. We finally started getting repeat patients and getting good reviews. The upper management response to this was to give a standard raise and used the generic review system of 3 stars. I personally felt like they did not care that both individually and as a team we provided superior service to our community and helped our sister clinics as much as possible. Maybe his is why hey have such a high turn over rate. Being a PCT was easy when the day was good but can be horrific during peak seasons such as back to school or flu shot season. The patients get cranky when there is a wait. Be ready to have people treat you like its your fault that they waited until the last minute to get junior his sports exam so he can start playing soccer ASAP, The schedule was okay basically 10 hour days but with every other weekend being a 3 days. Miss That!"
good,"Ok place but managers have favorites when it is convenient. Really strict absent policy, no taking allowed in packing at all for whole shift. No payed holidays for PT"
good,"Scheduled Part-time (work/full-time hours) "
good,"No one wants to work as a team, and the corporate guidlines dont give room for advancement. Some of the management staff at my location have communication problems in my experience."
good,"You will clock in and then go straight to work. If I worked 1;30-10"
good,"Worked at a Kroger in a small town and the management had a little group of people that all hung out together and if they didn't like you, your time at work would be miserable, filled with unfair treatment and little hours."
good,It was a good place to work for but the management wasnt the best. You never knew what to expect when you went into work it could be slor or it could be rushing all day and getting told you had to stay past your designated time to leave.
good,My typical day of work was long hours and walking alot. My manager never smiled and it was boring. The hardest part of the job was working in the cooler.
good,Kroger is a decent place to work.most of the employees are easy going and very friendly. They are will to help a person when they ask for help. i did not like the fact that some management were rude and were not very professional like they should be as mangement.
good,"This was my first job and it was a great first job, but the management was rude. To be fair they have almost all new management since I worked there. As a cashier it was boring and it’s pretty repetitive but I did work good hours and made decent money for a first job."
good,"Kroger was a great job at first until they decided to get new management. Managers weren't fulfilling their duties, so corporate would get on to them and the managers would take their frustration out on employees. Management hates when employees get positive reviews, especially, in the clicklist department! Overall, the pay was good, but until the fix management issue Kroger will never live up to the full potential"
good,"Kroger is a great Starter job, but not a job I want to have for more than a year. Management shows very little about how much they care about their employees, and show favoritism within employees"
good,Not a fun job very slow pace the workers have nasty attitudes because there tired and everyone wants to get out of there as fast as they can because it’s not a fun job
good,worked in the deli. Was a starter job. Managmemt sucked. union sucked. have nothing else but indeed wants me to write min 150 characters. so yea. good luck
good,I can't see anyone having a livable wage or being scheduled enough hours to make it worth it. Most work two jobs just to cut even. And be prepared to be cross trained to death for jobs below and above your pay. But at the end of the day it was honest money...well coins. And I enjoyed helping those same customers who seek me out while in the store.
good,They have a huge issue with communication. They are unfair in their demands. There is no balance between job and life. They expect too much instead adding need staff.
good,The job was always stressful and things were constantly changing. Managers and employees were never on the same page. The employees made the job better.
good,"Hired as part-time, but work full-time because they are ALWAYS understaffed. Make minimum wage, but often have to do management duties because of under staffing."
good,"I would love to go back for more money i dnt like the way the now manager did me which was very unprofessional and should be replaced"
good,"Terribly mean coworkers and managers, always being put down and belittled. No personal boundaries, personal info was announced infront of cowrokers and customers. Very bright and efficient workers, do a great job, but impossible to work with. Frequent fighting and emotional outbursts"
good,"When I was working there, the management team was rude and never really tried to listen to employees. One or two of them were nice but the overall management team was mean and nobody likes talking to them."
good,It was to fast of pace and I like doing stuff with my hand more like fixing stuff more than bagging. And the inconsistent schedule made it hard to work there to since the hour website didn’t work on my phone or laptop
good,Customer service used to be a high priority of the company and now as a customer I see more and more a changed culture. The price guarantee perk is obsolete. The brand better policy is no more which to me takes away the idea from the employee of doing a good job.
good,"Kroger is great for salaried store management when it comes to job security, salary and benefits BUT those are the only positives about the job as a manager. Job is stressful, the work you do is unappreciated, promotions are based on who you know and what upper management likes you instead of hard work and merit. Executives job is to make your life more difficult, criticize and terrorize the stores instead of going into a store to coach train and appreciate the people that are on the front lines working hard for the company every day. Kroger has gotten away from basic principles such as selling groceries and delivering great customer service and has become a circus. As a manager you will have to manage a store well understaffed everyday but yet deliver perfection. There is nothing realistic about what the company expects anymore."
good,"Great store for the consumer. Overall stressful environment for the employee. Lack of leadership, poor employee moral, low incentive for growth and development.v"
good,"Management of the deli was absolutely terrible-- there was never enough people on staff to meet customer demand, and I was the only cake decorator on staff for a year, despite the demand for cakes being very high. I was the only one capable of doing that job, and on days when customer numbers were known to be high, and days where cakes were frequently due, there was never enough people on hand for me to be able to do my job. Instead, I had to work my section, the deli, and the buffet table. It's too much for one person to do. Instead of addressing the problem, our store cannot keep anyone in the deli because this is a reoccurring issue for anyone with a specialized job (ie baker, chicken, ect)."
good,Work was pretty easy as long a you knew what you were doing. I just hated how even with back problems you couldnt sit down. It made my back ache all the time.
good,krogers is actually a very fun workplace for any age. everyone gets along but the management is just horrible (only speaking for the store  worked at 589)
good,Its the same thing everyday Ive been with this company for too long. Managment is nice and understanding but thats about it. The only thing Ive learned is how to be a cashier.
good,"The store I work for is a nice store. The employees are nice, and management is ok. "
good,"It is a grocery store, you stand a lot, and if you try to get ahead you really can get sore, but for the most part its not bad. pretty good job. you get tired of customers."
good,"Initially, I worked midnight as a grocery clerk, stocking shelves. We were painfully understaffed and my supervisor was overall unpleasant as a person, so I transferred."
good,"I loved the people I worked with but management wasnt the best. Breaks were given late and when you needed help no one was around. Other than that , a great compmay with many benefits to offer!"
good,I really enjoyed working for Kroger and got to talk to a lot of nice customers. I was a cashier and a bagger. I even went out to get grocery carts. My manager and I didn't get along.
good,never worked same days schedule changed every week might get 8 hours one week and 40 the next and you might work a midnight one day and the next a 7am.
good,Friendly coworkers. Lots of gossip. Sucking up provides privileges. Horrible clientele. They've been improving these past few years all of the above still remains however.
good,"Low pay, not a lot of hours. Almost always something to do, so not a lot of down-time, even when no customers, there was ""work"" to do.  Nice people to work with and customers."
good,"Overall, work environment can be stressful and toxic. Most cashiers last only 3 months before quitting. Management is hardly there when you need them."
good,"was promised ""career growth"" and time of hire, which means adding tasks on top of each other and more responsibilities for yourself. expectations for any advancement are all out the window"
good,"Typical day: stock shelves, check out customers, sweep store."
good,"I worked in multiple departments in my years at Kroger. I was consistently over worked and underpaid. Despite being offered promotions, I declined them and left because I never made enough to support myself. I would typically work 50-65 hours each week because we had a rotating door of new hires and people quitting. For a high schooler, this is a good job. However, there was a lack of follow through with management and no appreciation for the people at the bottom of the totem pole. It was sad to see good people worked until they quit or died because they couldn't retire. Even the raise to $10 an hour for everyone wasn't enough to live on."
good,Good company to work for if you are a clerk. but as management you have to be at work all the time and you have to do other peoples job all the time..
good,I worked my self have to death for this company.. It caused me many health problems and a lot of added stress to my life. My mother died  2 years before I left and I was not even given a sorry for your loss or any thing I came to work the very next day after it happened and they were rude to me about wanting to use my death in family days off. I was not appreciated and was treated very poorly by the most recent store manager who has since been fired after I left. I worked through my lunches and breaks everyday to make sure everything was caught up and done due to lack of help and not enough hours distributed out. I worked for many years for this company and the last year I was there was the breaking point for me when my husband required full time care. They showed no compassion or care for the matter or tried to work with me in any way so I had no choice but to turn in my notice.
good,Enjoyed working with the majority of other employees. Have many regular customers that are extremely friendly and often bring a cheerful smile and have a lot of character.
good,"I did the job of a Cashier almost full time for more than 2 weeks, plus extra menial tasks, Made less than half what a proper cashier did. From what I heard, there was almost no opportunity to advance form within, not that I stayed long enough to find out."
good,"This is numbers driven company, meet the goals however necessary. It's good as a after school job or for a college student. For a long term job it's not great. While they ask for employees feedback they don't truly listen. Training is minimal you end up figuring it out as you go. Asking staff above store only ever ends up with a corporate response."
good,"The management team, does not communicate with their department leads. An improvement has been asked for numerous times. No idea on career advancement with the company."
good,First job I had in highschool it was ok didn't really like getting the carts from the parking most days especially in the rain but bagging was ok I still know how to bag groceries to this day from working there lol
good,"My opinion about Kroger is still the same. I was a part-time employee, with no benefits and no paid off time, but it was not awful to go to work. I still shop at Kroger."
good,"Kroger was my first real job, in my opinion. It was the first time I was held responsible for my job title and they were the first to give me an advancement. They taught me to care for my department like I would if it were my money."
good,"My manager and like two of the people I worked with were the only good thing about my job. Everyone else was insane. Multiple altercations in the deli department, angry and rude customers, and absolutely not enough pay for any of it to be worthwhile. I wasn't just doing my job, I was doing the jobs of three other people! I wasn't supposed to be a counselor for the employees, breaking up fights left and right!!! The most dangerous part of the job was supposed to be dealing with the meat slicer, not Matrixing through a literal knife fight in the deli freezer just to get more Genoa!!!!! Anyway, yeah I only stayed as long as I did because I got free food from the reject bakery goods, and my manager lost her son so I didn't want to just bail while she was already dealing with so much. I made sure to give her two month's notice and help her find replacements for my role before I peaced out of there. I hope she's doing alright, but I'm glad everyone else and that Store is in my rear view."
good,"While working at Kroger, I was expecting and had informed them of this at my interview. During the interview I was told I would be placed in the Bakery portion of the store. when I started working they placed me on the Deli side, where I was lifting chicken racks and other heavy boxes I should not of been lifting at the time. I was also expected to meet an outrageous time hack that any non-pregnant person would have trouble accomplishing."
good,"The job itself is pretty easy and manageable, but the management and people around you (at least in my location) is where the quality breaks down. Managers play favorites, fellow employees are disrespectful and start drama and sometimes the communication between staff overall is confusing and poorly managed."
good,My time working at Kroger was good made friends but then they stopped giving me scheduled hours I talked to the management but they did nothing about it so I’m quitting.
good,the work place was great and the co-workers were great but the management lacked communication and the hours were poor. when asking to become full their answers were unclear and at times they would never get back to you.
good,it wouldn't be so bad if the job market in this area wasn't so cluttered with temp agencies. Kroger Employees are treated way better than the temporaries.
good,"My typical day at Kroger, would be the same like always.  Always follow procedures via Assistant Customer Service Manager.  I've learned that no matter how committed you are to the company, the efforts of all associates do not get noticed.  But we do love our job and our team, we work to make the environment fun and family oriented."
good,"I would not like to return to Kroger for future employment, for they do not pay at a rate for a man on his own can afford. The management is quite poor as well, yet it is a great job for teenagers getting their first job, great experience for the work scene."
good,"Depends on what shift you had that you would do trash and clean pumps to going into store and getting inventory to stock product in fuel center."
good,"Denver Central Fill Pharmacy is a very high volume refill pharmacy facility with a lot lot of pressure to meet deadlines.  Management here has typically been promoted from within and lacks real management skills.  There is definitely conflict within and among the staff, especially between the different levels ie Pharmacist, Technician, Clerk, etc.  Working here requires standing for the entire day on concrete floors with aging cushioned pads.  Work environment is often dirty and dusty."
good,"This company is a good starter for someone who just needs experience. However they talk about job advancement, this is a lie. Do your work decently, come in when scheduled, you can pretty much choose your hours, in my experience. It is a decent job if you need a job. You will either get scheduled minimum hours or work 32-40 hours a week, there is very little gray area in between."
good,Working at Kroger is so slow paced. The time you work feels like double because the day takes so long. I like to be busy so time flies but that is definitely not the case here.
good,The people in the deli do not work together. there is a lot of standing around and doing nothing. always have to pick of the slack of the deli manager because she is always talking on the phone or no where to be found.
good,A particular supervisor is unprofessional. There were days when I wanted to leave and never come back. The area I worked in was unorganized. There are some workers who have bad attitudes that are over you.
good,Working at Kroger Marketplace was an okay job for any starting out. I would recommend it for those who are young and need to find some services to work for.
good,"When i had a reliable cree i really enjoyed my job ."
good,It's a great place to start when you are in college or high school. It is a bit difficult to move up but I have not worked there long enough to really see how far I could get up.
good,"Working for Kroger isn't so bad if this a field you want to be in primarily if you want a higher position full time. If your in school or have a second job it can be a pain to deal with. In Drug Gm you're not only dealing with you're own department, but you will be pulled by management in the middle of your task to complete task for others. You will also be called to bag for front end and have to finish your task before you head home for the day or else you will slow down productivity of your department."
good,Inconsistent at certain stores for expectations and goals. Many quality people employed through out the company. Hard to tell what overall vision or path we were trying to accomplish
good,"Kroger is the first job I ever had. It is a good place to start at but, you will never been able to live off the money you make there. So I recommend the job as a perfect job for kids in high school."
good,i would like to see improvements to the culture in helping and increase benefits for the employees with things they need such as higher wages and better benefits to keeping them healthy
good,"The Job can be a lot of fun and co-workers are very helpful.  Can be very busy and hectic at times but if you keep a cool head, you will succeed. Great job for a teen."
good,"A typical work day at Kroger was fast paced and there was always room to grow.  I learned many things about retail just as a sale associate.  If given the chance, I would take my position back.  I enjoyed working with the management and other employees."
good,"Kroger was the first job experience I received after graduation from pharmacy school. Valuable training and management experience was appreciated. As a pharmacy manager work hours can be tricky. The scheduled hours are more than likely less than actual hours that were worked for the week. Being efficient, considerate, and dedicated are the striving acts to maintain the top customer tracking in the district. Overall Kroger was part of a building experience that left plenty of room to grow."
good,Work was very fast paced and you never had to worry about not having anything to do. You were always doing something whether it was checking someone out or showing someone where something was at. But when it came time for your breaks they either did not want to give it to you or make up an excuse as to of why you have to wait and you had to always ask them to go to the restroom even if no one was coming to your line or if business was slow.
good,"A typical work day was go in and sweep most of the day."
good,Kroger is a great place to work if you can make yourself avalible to work steadily. This company is great but for me it was the hardest parttime job i have ever had.
good,"Mangers not there when you needed them or unable to figure out an answer to problems. Shortages on bags, register tape, workers. Good managers taken out and left with inferior ones or none at all."
good,"Luckily I was experienced with food related jobs. the manager could barely communicate with me because i could no understand her thick accent. id ask questions but was put on the back burner for everything. breaks were extremely tight and cut throat. Was trained more by a sponsored Boars Head Representative even though i wanted nothing to do with them. My company is Kroger, of which provides me an income, not Boars Head.  First day working there, me and another new employee were left to close the department, given that everyone left three hours before close."
good,"I did not care much about working at Kroger, as I took this job in between working for Qwest Communications and the City of Phoenix. This was a temporary job, as I have stated, and knew I would be leaving for a better job soon."
good,"For the timed required for this type work they expect cept more than can get done with in your shift. Various dept managers all pointing fingers, and requiring immaculate  job done in so little time. Always asking if avaiable to work overtime when its to benefit the managers goal."
good,"I was to assist customers with needs pertaining to the apparel section of Kroger. Things were OK until I started my semester at college. Management was not willing to work around my very set schedule. I would often get scolded for things out of my control. Upper-management also called me ""table girl"" even though I had a name tag on."
good,Not the best place to work due to lack of benefits and poor management skills. Also the schedule is made every two weeks and changes very frequently regardless of whether you have school or other outside of work responsibilities.
good,"Trucks where almost always to big for the crew we had. We were always getting yelled at when we could not finish stocking the shelves, despite it was not our fault."
good,"It's a good job if you are in high school and college and need some extra money on the weekends. However if you are looking to make a career out of it by working your way from the bottom, be prepared for that to take years and a lot of brown nosing. Favoritism is rampant within the company and many managers and aspiring managers are cut throat and look out for themselves and their friends at the expense of the employees around them. Front End Supervisors are overworked and get no extra pay for their position."
good,Man this was my first job and I had decent time here. I mostly did cart pushing and sacking food and drinks. I also cleaned up the area and mopped the floor and did returns. I help people to their car.
good,Its a good place to work to learn how a business is ran from top to bottom.  The downside is horrible work life balance.  Schedules are not consistent and you will have to work every holiday.  Vacations are not allowed during the week of a holiday.
good,"I think Krogers, at least mine, is a very stressful job. But it doesn't need to be. We are always short staffed and we get blamed for it. Managers also ask what can we do to make it better. nothing. We need to be scheduled enough help. They don't care about us."
good,"I had a rather simple summer job for 3 months in the Deli at my local Kroger. My typical work week consisted of usually working from 2pm to 10pm six days a week. They would balance it so one day you'd only work for 7 hours instead of 8, so that your total workhours would be 39 for the week. The pay was terrible, and was made worse from union fees being taken out of your paycheck. After fees, I think I made something like $5.50 an hour."
good,"HR sucks, don't give hours ""because there's too many to give"". But schedules you when you're unavailable, and they do not provide any help with finding anyone, and blames you."
good,"Kroger doesn't seem to care about whether they train you well enough for the role at hand.  they throw you into a store that you aren't ready for, and don't care if you sink or swim.  they make job advancements almost impossible, and are solely based on projects that are supposed to help the company gain more money, and not help the associates, customers, or yourself.  Kroger only seems to care about getting a fat paycheck to those who are deemed important enough to advance.  they only care about you if you threaten to quit because their bonuses are based on retention."
good,"Kroger is A good first job for a high school student, but as soon as you graduate life hits hard and you realize the pay is not that great and you cant really afford a living off of it."
good,"lack of communication from management, every man for themselves. poor benefits in accordiance with other simular careers, below the average pay for employees, no clear company goals or solutions"
good,"They did not do well to compensate for their workers there was little to know time off and they did not pay well, I may recommend this job to a high schooler but no one looking for full-time."
good,"the company was a good starting job out off college."
good,"Typical day included giving employees breaks, assisting management in various tasks. ensuring customer satisfaction, short breaks, fast paced, great management communication."
good,Not applicable. I do not wish to post a review for this company. The managers are corrupt and like to build people up and then tear them down without a single regard to the employee. They take advantage of workers and like to play games to get you to work harder.
good,"I enjoy working here, but the pay is less than desired and the work environment isn't always a nice as orientation made it out to be. Okay-job overall"
good,"The union life here is crazy ! What a crazy place the distribution center is. Our union stewards ( teamsters) sat in the office with the bosses all night , every night. They got to do NOTHING all night as long as they sold the union out and let Kroger get away with ANYTHING. Kroger isn't even their name now. They have such a bad reputation they keep changing their sign. Zenith, Trans Service, and whatever is next. It wont take long, the union will be gone. Turnover is CRAZY ! Don't bother to learn a name, they wont be here long. My last boss was terminated for drinking on the job !"
good,it paid the bills. it wasn't the greatest job but atleast i had work. the management team what a joke. expect to be worked like no other ad treated like dirt.
good,They also act as if they care a lot about their associates but when it comes down to it they don’t. They don’t really care if you have some problems going on and when you talk to some one about it usually they pretty much tell you that it happens. No sympathy whatsoever.
good,"Pharmacy technicians are hired in with no experience necessary- they just have to pass an exam within 9 months of hiring in to be licensed in Michigan.  This is an advantage and a disadvantage.  It means they can pay you as little as they want, and keep you part time forever.   The pharmacists are not involved in hiring techs.  The store management does this.  This means you should expect lots of dummies coming through who can't count.  In one situation they hired a stripper who had a felony case in progress for illegal possession of narcotics.  She eventually was fired when she couldn't pass the background check for licensing after working for 8 months."
good,"I normally worked 5 hours a day during the week, and 6-8 during the weekend. It was usually slow pace during the week but fast on the weekends. Management did NOT care about employees. I had an issue with one of my front end supervisors and talked to management and they did nothing to solve the problem. The hardest part was dealing with my rude supervisors. I enjoyed the customers the most. They made everything worth it. Within 2 weeks of working there I had regular customers. They would always come to my line, even if there was an open register. The friends I made working there are also really great. The people I worked with there, I still talk to daily even though I don't work there. Overall, my time at Kroger was really good."
good,For pushing carts I was getting payed 8.35  an hour and the mangers kept asking us to do more even when we had no help and if you did not meet the requirements they wrote you up.
good,"Employees were expected too much from them with no help whatsoever. If anything was not done to expectation, normally employees would be talked to. Customers were not too bad though."
good,The environment wasn't organized and the hours keep going down for the work that needed to be done. But the perks were that the staff was friendly and got along with everyone pretty decently.
good,"Working for them started off okay but then the environment became toxic with constant putting employees against each other, encouraged false reports on each other, and lack of career advancement, if you are a cashier and trying to move up there's always excuses as to why you can't. They also give you a hard time with class schedule if you are a college student."
good,I only worked here for some extra cash while living with my parents and going to college. I didn't stay long enough to learn about benefits or retirement.
good,"The management is lazy and ready to pass the buck"
good,It was very stressful but at times could get fun. There was limited space for growth. They couldn't control staffing and was very unorganized. It was not a career type of environment it was a job.
good,"It's good to be a fast cashier or fast bagger to help get the lines down some of the worst times were when like a storm was coming so everybody was in there shopping it was really busy"
good,Wouldn't be all that bad if there was any chance of promotion. When applying for a promotion i was rudely and sarcastically asked why I thought I could apply for the position
good,"Depending on your location and your co-workers, this job could be beneficial and enjoyable. It could also be extremely stressful. Favoritism is shown in various departments. you should work for a management"
good,Depending on area its really not that bad to work at kroger. Advancement is slow and management changes too often depending on area its really not that
good,"My opinion of my time working at Fry's Food & Drug is a collection of mixed feelings. The work I performed every day was likable, greeting/serving customers was enjoyable & keeping my department clean was generally an easy task. However, I feel my experience was bogged down by poor upper management & overall poor team performance.Additionally, I came to a point where I felt I was relied on too much, much more than I feel I am even being paid for. Most of my team was new, which was fine, but they refused to follow proper work procedures even after being there for a couple months; making the job incredibly overwhelming. Most of my days working I ended up staying much longer than my scheduled time, due to the department being in chaos & needing the extra help. There's been many days where I've had to stay overtime to pick up the pieces, just to get yelled at later by a manager for staying overtime. This became such a regular scenario working every day, leaving me exhausted & discouraged. Not feeling like I was even being paid properly for the heavy amount of work I was performing. On top of it all, I get sick very easily & especially during winter; where I was consistently sick. I was told to never come in while sick since I'm working in a fresh food department, however, I'm constantly punished for calling out even if I'm truly not able to work on a given day. There is absolutely no grace time for the worker if they're sick & unable to work, I can understand punishment for calling out two days in a row, but never after a single day. I was even berated by certain managers claiming"
good,Liked the company in general. My major complaint was with union dues being withdrawn I was making less than minimum wage. It was a good first-time job.
good,I got sick and management for the deli was harsh about hours after recovering. even so much as to send a nasty text stating he had worked in the deli with pneumonia
good,Just a lot of bad no so much good highly up under staffed and expected to do 3 people job and alone leadership beats u up instead of helping u achieve unreachable goa ls
good,The manager was not willing to work with me. I had small kids and asked to leave early to take my daughter to er and was told if i left i didnt have a job. other people seemed to like it there.
good,I wouldn't recommend working here. The pay is horrible and you do not receive enough hours to live off of alone. I would say this should be a job you have on the side.
good,Like I'm a single mother and I have worked here awhile and when my kids are sick there's nothing I can do when schools calles and says your child is sick come  get them I have to go get them and this job don't believe in ever calling of I've called off 1 time scene I worked here and left early 2 times and they wrote me up for it I mean they need to understand when people has kids you gotta do what you gotta do
good,"Working at Kroger taught me a thing or two about discipline. I worked multiple positions while I was there, and for me personally, being a bagger was better than expected. You work hard at that job, and you don't stop while on the clock."
good,"It’s not a bad place to work, management that doesn’t really understand what it’s like to work in a department pushes you until you can’t do anymore, but other than that a good job just has no benefits unless you are full time"
good,"Kroger sounded like a dream place to work when initially. Quickly I learned this was a facade of propaganda to make you feel like it was a good place to work. Managers pick favorite employees, the rest (majority of people) are treated like you don't exist. I worked for the company for 5 months and none of the managers ever attempted to get to know me or let alone speak to me ever. I also never got my Probationary Period meeting where they ask how you liked it, etc. Kroger took me back to High School basically. There's gossip and bullying everywhere, something that also made me look for another job. Managers also gossip and bully, so of course the associates get away with it too. Clicklist was overall an okay job, and I did enjoy many aspects of it, but being that everything else in the store was horrible I decided it wasn't worth $8.25/hr plus taxes and union fees. (I made roughly 7.22/hr, despite prior experience) I think it's an alright job if you need the money. Kroger needs to raise pay, and get their act together when it comes to teaching their management how to respect employees."
good,"The Kroger store I worked at was relatively fine. Nothing too challenging or too easy. Co-workers were generally nice and was a decent place to work for a while, not a forever job."
good,A typical day at work was easy as long as you maintained a schedule. I learned a lot about how much communication is neccessary to maintain a business. The management frankly don't care about you. To them your someone that they can replace at the blink of an eye. The coworks that i worked with were very nice aside from when they felt threatened by how hard you work. The hardest part of the job would be pushing buggies throughout the cold and heat. the most enjoyable part of my job is seeing all the customers walking out with smiling faces.
good,"The company doesn't seem to care much about it's employees and their lives outside of work. A certain manager will hang up on you when you call in and others will treat you differently if you don't come in on your days off. "
good,Kroger provided a steady weekend income for someone who went to school Monday through Friday. I didn't like my manager but my co-workers were the best to work with.
good,The job was good but the amount of favoritism shown to certain employees in the store is ridiculous and made work frustrating just watching certain employees break rules and get away with it then watching those employees cause another employee to get into trouble for something. They just did was really frustrating company has the opportunity to fix this issue it would of been a wonderful employer. Im sure the store was more at fault in these practices then corporate.
good,Definately a good place to work as your first job or during highscool. Will literally fire you for anything even if it isnt you fault though. They work with your school schedule. Doesn'y pay well.
good,"the managers only cared about themselves, been forced to pick up the slack of lazy workers, and left by myself to work the deli slicers with multiple customers waiting in line with no one to help me with them."
good,"During my time here, I was to report to work 5-6 days a week directly after school, working until anywhere between 9:30PM and 10:30PM. "
good,"I would arrive and start watering or moving plants."
good,I was hired to run the register and ended up pushing carts in more than actually running the register. There would be several people standing around talking but would make me shut my lane down to push carts in. Around Christmas I checked my schedule and found out I was being laid off for an undetermined amount of time. Because of that I chose to leave the job.
good,"A typical day working at Kroger was fast paced, and occasionally stressful. You have to assist customers with their transactions in a timely manner."
good,Retail jobs at any box grocery store are pretty similar. They aren't meant to be a career job. Most people need a job to get them through college or a temporary period in their life.
good,It was a pretty cool job in first then when the weather started to get bad the mangers just kept making me go outside getting carts . I. The lighting.
good,My average day is I'm assigned to a register. I greet the customer and ring out the products they have purchased! I stand in one place for the entire day with the exception of the 15 min breaks we received.
good,This was chaos with how they would schedule employees. They would hire teenagers out of high school and pay them minimum wage to make them work evening hours in an understaffed and poorly managed environment. not to mention the work itself is tedious and not challenging.  its the same routine day in and day out.
good,Front end can be enjoyable if you work with people you get along with. Management has ranged from too petty to too lazy. Pay is minimum. Front end usually doesn't get enough hours for extra cashiers and bagging help. Calling for managers to help usually gets you no help. Company focuses on stupid miniscule things instead of what they need to.
good,"The Kroger store helped me gain confidence as a man, but its very poor minimum wage pay. The management is hit or miss...some are great and willing to work with you others are too stern and condescending."
good,"Working as a Courtesy Clerk Conditioner, I found the hours were demanding. I'd been assigned the Graveyard shift, and my hours even varied then. I don't remember much about the job, other than that it did gain me some experience."
good,"first started in produce dept. work was enjoyable. then excessive management turnover caused mayhem in store,dept transfers caused bad moral due to lack of needed training in depts. throughout the store. no advancement due to non union and union employees competing for open positions"
good,"Kroger is a great opportunity for someone that is just starting out in the workplace. It is not however, a place that you need to stay and make a career out of. They work really well around your school schedules but that is about it for the pros. There is no room for advancement in Kroger, and they try to keep anyone from reaching full time employment. Management hounds the departments when things are not completed but will not allow any extra time to complete anything. I understand work needs to be done in a timely manner and correctly, but the amount of tasks given are much more than a part timer receiving 4-6 hours can handle. All in all, it's a good company to start out in, but not a place to stay and grow."
good,1-10 they get an 5 because some people are amazing and the other (85%) are just not nice a typical day at work is like being in a room full of people who don't like you but we are stuck there. I learned that everyone is not the same and you have to treat people how they treat YOU because even through one of my Store managers was great the other one always smoke cigarettes without pouching out and tell us to do the opposite sad poor LEADERSHIP. The HARDEST PART of my job was coming into work and everybody acting as if they didn't want to be there. Oh my the BESTEST part about my job was helping and meeting so many Great people and Miss. STEPHINE ON East Michigan Ave Kroger.
good,"During the weekdays would be pretty busy and weekends would be as well, I learned how to be creative  make arrangements and small gift baskets and what kind of flowers their are which i found very interesting and fun to do. ."
good,Terrible supervision  they want you to be comfortable being in one position for a minimum of 2 or 3 years and they don’t treat everyone fair at all in the workplace
good,"The management was lazy plain and simple. Anytime you would complain about something they would say they'd do something but they never would. I was constantly being overworked, 10+days in a row and some days would not get a break even with my 8+hour shifts. it was exhausting. most of the time there were gaps in the schedule and management made it to be your problem and responsibility to fix their mess."
good,"people don't care about you. some management are down to earth and understanding. typical day as a cutter constant cutting,cleaning,and customer service."
good,"I was working as a security guard at Kroger distribution center, my job was to gate in and out Kroger trucks and check reefers, management however was really bad, it wasn’t taken as serious as it was supposed to, making a simple job difficult to want to work in."
good,come into work clock-in go to my line start to bag food then change and stock and clean store! the things I learned from this job was how to handled people and be more friendly and know how to work better as a team. The management here was great they help out a lot. The workplace culture was great I loved it and the only thing I found hard about this job is when someone came in with a lot of stuff and we ran out of bags. The most in enjoyable thing about work was meets all the people that work come into the store.
good,in my time there i was not very happy there. i wish i would have chosen a different job instead. i don't recommend to anyone to work here. i was very unhappy here. i didn't have a balanced life between work and life. it was very hard to work night crew. lack of rest was a factor. managers were so rude and arrogant. my time there wasn't special.
good,There is low work morale overall due to low salaries and large expectations.  The job is not difficult and the coworkers are fun to work with.  Management is under a lot of stress and it shows in the work environment.
good,"On a typical day I would handle a large number of Western Union transactions. I would also answer phones giving customer's information on products or transfer the calls to the different departments or to management. There was also many sales of different gift cards, lotto sales, check cashing services."
good,I don't understand why some people at Kroger been there for six years. The lack of pay and really no advancement. Kroger isn't even a good place to go to school and work. Your better off working a the college then working part time there.
good,"Working at Kwik Shop (under Kroger) wasn't the best time. One person worked third shift, which at times was not the best idea. Lack of advancement, management played favorites."
good,Advancement with hard work. Good On The Job training. Good for first job. Easy part time work. Benefits after full time. Minimum wage pay to start for most positions.
good,"The work was quick paced, emphasized quickly paced decision making and faster action. Management was uncommunicative (with the exception being the assistant manager). The other associates were friendly, helpful, and understanding of the mistakes of newer associates. While the work was enjoyable, being hounded by the manager made it less so."
good,This is a union company. Jobs are awarded according to seniority. Pay is depending on your job and how long you have been with the company. Hours can be bad depending on your location and job.
good,The hours are inconsistent.  The pay is minimum.  The union benefits aren't worth the dues you pay each paycheck.  Every six months you get a raise of .05 and the courtesy clerks only get minimum wage and no raises at all.
good,High School job where I would clock in and see which cashier needed help with bagging and then I would have a block of time where I was needed to go outside and collect the carts in the parking lot. I enjoyed using my organizational skills in order to bag their groceries and help whenever I was needed. The hardest part of the job was being young and wanting something more.
good,Please see above statement. Generous with benefits only due to the Union affiliations. Stressful work environment where good managers seem to be punished and bad management is rewarded.
good,"I was excited about my first grocery job, but the managers made it hard to want to work there. The lack of understanding that I was still in school so I couldn't work at certain times was very hard to get over. The way manager personally talked to their employees was completely unacceptable. I would love to work for the company again, but of course under different management."
good,"Being a cashier was enjoyable and especially when I was able to interact with customers one-on-one. However, I had multiple problems with a particular manager, as well as many others. She had physically pushed and shoved people before, but was so protected by the union that she was never fired."
good,"clean, chase thieves, all managers want something different and it contradicts one another, job duity not in my classification then not getting paid for that job"
good,"lots of nepotism, favoritism, scandals and paranoia. management values that you stay silent when you observe wrong doing unless it's someone that they don't like."
good,it was a seasonal position but the management didnt seem to care about the seasonal employees and seemed really annoyed when i would ask questions. overall decent.
good,High turnover of Management. Replaced one store manager with more than five. Lack of communication between new managers. Needed more produce associates to accommodate new management.
good,Poor management not really making schedule available to where students can make it to class on time lack of communication and poor workforce poor place to work
good,A great job for beginners. hours are flexible and jobs are easy. Management is very nice and the co workers are to. the job is interactive with both customers and people and the environment is a great place to grow.
good,Your experience at Kroger depends fully on the grocery store manager. Some managers think they are above the pharmacists and try to impose their rules on you even though they have no knowledge of Pharmacy Laws. Very frustrating. No support from management. They work you like a dog.
good,"Store management talks to his employees very poorly treats them like trash. No room for advancement and too much favoritism is played at the store. "
good,"I normally work 8 hours a day and I learned a lot about how to cashier and engaging with customers. At times it can be fast paced and a little stressful, but my co-workers make it a little easier."
good,"The store that I specifically worked at was quite understaffed and the management had poor methods of dealing with the lack of workers. I tended to be overworked for the little pay I received. My co-workers were generally good workers, there just wasn't enough of us to make the job easy to do. The hardest part of the job is having to close the entire produce department by yourself. Typically, you're supposed to have 2-3 people working one shift, but usually we only had 1 person working the department which made it very hard to stay focus and complete all the tasks. I would say that the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to assist the customers which their needs."
good,"Kroger (if you get into a good store) can be a really good company. I personal had a bad experience. The management forced me to move departments with no word said to me or to my department manager and started to schedule me in a different part of the store. They told me a day before my next scheduled shift. I work two jobs and told them that department wouldn't work with the schedule and they got frustrated with me, sent me back but then threaten to move me again. Then they knocked me down to working only 11 hours a week. All the co workers were very nice and friendly and a the assistant manager who understood why I was so angry and quit."
good,Sporadic hours for part-time employees. Good discounts for staff. Colleagues are good to work with. Standard breaks built into work day. Do not get paid for days off.
good,Good starter job if you are in school or in between. Not a career place unless you already have a degree. Some decent discounts. Most people who work there are nice and friendly.
good,"flexible schedules, sales calls, making your own schedule for work day, random hours to work. making sale tags, organization of children's clothes, furniture and infant supplies"
good,"A typical day at work would start out cleaning the store as the janitor."
good,I really hated working here. I felt as though this corporation was constrained by strict rules and guidelines without much room for improvement for employee satisfaction. The staff was not motivated and the managers got off on having power over their employees.
good,"To a smaller extent i would recommend it...."
good,"collecting carts, bagging groceries, cleaning, lifting heavy objects. Management doesn't treat you very well.The shifts bare all over the place when it comes to times you work."
good,"Typical day at Kroger, well it all depend on who called in, ran register, gathered the carts and many other various duties. I learned to balance new job skills and utilize them to be a productive employee. The management at times was to overbearing when one was doing their job but good all in all. The workplace was always busy and during the times that wasn't, we were stocking, cleaning and such. The hardest part of this job was when our store manager passed at such an early age. He was a fine manager and taught how to be a great asset to Kroger. Most enjoyable would be meeting new customers and co-workers, Getting to know them personally was a great time."
good,"I applied for a part time position, but was scheduled for more than 40 hours, every week. Towards the end of my employment, I had a family emergency and asked for time off and was denied."
good,Kroger is great at Customer Service.  A union position provides better job security than a management position.  Kroger is a good company to work for while getting your education.  Hard to maintain work/life balance if you are in a management position.
good,"In my experience i have enjoyed the attitude and friendliness of my fellow co-workers the most. the work itself is menial, relatively easy, but hard on the body and psyche due to i high stress and fast paced environment."
good,"The head pharmacist in charge was a good guy, very personable and easy to get along with, but did not do well with confrontation.  All of the pharmacists were great people, but the associates were very slow to learn job requirements if they learned them at all.  The people that had been there for a while had a grasp on what to do on a day to day basis but the new hires were basically taught the minimum amount and that made for an awful experience when on shift with only them."
good,Starting in an entry level role with the company working your way up to new roles will not achieve you pay equivelent to your duties. On the plus side the PTO offer is great!
good,"I started off a dish washer, and it wasn't to bad but all the grunt work wore me out. It got better once the dish washer was fixed. However, taking the trash out was a pain because it felt like that the trash bags weighed more than I did sometimes and I had to haul them all the way to the back where the dumpster is. Luckily I usually was able to find one of the guys in produce to assist but on nights I couldn't it was a horrible pain. Also in order to access the dumpster we had to get a key from a manager, which could take forever if we were busy. My co-workers in the deli were amazing and I can honestly say that I've made some wonderful friendships with some of them. Down side to this job is they definitely do not pay enough for the all the work we do it took me 2 years to make 30 cents above min wage. I would also say in those 2 years I was at Kroger more than home with my husband. Another good thing is they do offer health insurance and we got to sample new products."
good,"The management was terrible, all of them had a superior attitude even when you just try and to ask them how there day was. The pay was average for being a grocery store. All the other employees that I had worked with were really nice."
good,"I think it's a good starting job but you should look for better everyone is stressed from courtesy clerks to management and managers a lot of times make it stressful,as a bagger you got to go through the mud to get to the top,but mostly everyone is friendly and a good job with job security if you just need extra money in your pocket"
good,"Data entry work entire shift.... building orders analyzing data in the system and prior orders and wareshousing information...."
good,"Pays the bills, management does work with the workers.  Hardest part of the job is working with the inexperienced management.  Additionally, working with customer."
good,"After being employed at this company for over 7 years, I make $2.10 more than minimum wage. I wouldn't recommend this as a full-time job because there's hardly any balance between work and your personal life. I will say one of the few exceptions would be if you're currently a student, have a second job, and/or being treated for a medical issue. They do offer health insurance (80/20), 401k (but not matching), discounts on store products and cell phone bills."
good,"Always has been excellent company. With career path , but not recently. Large company, good benefits, but changes in company are not taking employees well being in mind. Many employees gone all the years of knowledge are gone"
good,"Kroger is a great company that is willing to hire just about anyone, however they refuse to assist when it comes to important schedule adjustments or when serious issues happen."
good,I get my trolley ready get scanner and labels and start picking groceries. When done with trolley I stage totes. I also help customers in the store find items they need. I really know Kroger. Management is okay I don't like the politics and trying to get anywhere with human resources is a joke. I wasn't able to get anywhere with them and neither was Sunshine about getting work employment confirmation for Medicaid. My daughter is on Medicaid not me.  Not having a set schedule. Helping customers.
good,"Kroger is a great place to work, the energy is there, but there is no way to survive off the start pay, and pay raises are not enough to keep someone. ."
good,"Management at the store I worked at was incredibly lazy and did not care about their employees. I saw them violate OSHA guidelines many times, but couldn't force them to comply because we were a non-union store."
good,Typical day was standing at the cash register greeting customers and scanning and properly bagging their items. Management could use some work. Most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know the regulars that came in.
good,Worst management I've ever encountered and even worse schedules to match. Best coworkers I've ever had. Made some fantastic friends. Management changed a lot and made employees fear them.
good,I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Kroger......................................................................except when management changed. then everything changed. hopefully things will get bettter
good,"Sometimes I would not get a break even if I worked 7 hours. Management doesn't care, They always put the blame on you. The customers are allowed to treat you any type of way and the management won't care. No one is treated fairly. Only reason I stayed for so long is because I like getting paid weekly."
good,"The management at mariano's was not there. I felt like they had people running the store who didn't know what they were doing. I got treated well but when I were to ask a question, they didn't know what to do."
good,My experience here was okay. I have had better jobs before. Management wasn't that great. I feel like the managers at this store could have been better and more warm.
good,Very slow and unfulfilling work. Low-pay and only worth it if you're in the union. Co-workers very dry making for a very long day at work. Easily distracted because of the dull work environment.
good,"I did not enjoy working here, very few hours, some co-workers were very rood, a lot of gossip. There also was not a lot of training when there was a switch in positions."
good,Management is awful! Its union so bad/lazy workers get to keep their jobs while the good workers work hard with no gratitude shown from management! ...
good,for the most part i enjoyed working for the company i liked my customers enjoyed helping people. i could not stand when someone would slck off they could get away with it  a hardworker would pick up their slack an have to continue to do so
good,It is a good starter but the job culture is not very much provided. it is a very gloomy company with all sort of people working and the customer service is not so great. It is very much business.
good,The company has core values that are soon forgotten by management. The customers are really the best thing about working there. Being able to help is a plus. The managers see that your willing to help and they use you in any department. Hard to be promoted at times if one of 4 doesn't like you. Due to continually changing mangers the rules change frequently.
good,Dealing with rude customers was not nearly as bad as harassment about shifts from my supervisor. She once cornered me and wasn't going to let me clock out until I answered the question of whether or not I would take a shift.
good,"not enough money , no team efforts but thankful to have a job and the position. it is a learning situation a stepping stool.a place were you can learn customer service, the ethics of people , mingle with people having there first job"
good,Take this job to get yourself started but don't stay here long-term. This company does not take pride in its' employees but rather in how much money it can make.
good,Work would flow better if management and staff were an equal balance. Rules not always being followed correctly. Place needs to have it's problems addressed accordingly.
good,Even though i have been working at kroger for 2 years i always get really bad hours. i constantly change my availability   so i could get better hours but im always getting the closing shifts. the managers always change my availability so i wont bet any hours.
good,Uninformed mid-level managers recycling old solutions to tackle new issues. Unhealthy work environment! Individuals with new ideas are seen as a  threat! Too many lifers wanting to secure their positions while the company loses its place in the retail market!
good,A typical day at work consisted of dealing with unruly customers that complained just because they were the customer and they wanted something free at the expense of anyone's job. Other employees often called out so there was rarely anyone to cover employees for a break. The management does the best that they can given the circumstances but there's no teamwork among themselves. The most enjoyable part of the job are the insurance benefits and the weekly pay.
good,Kroger is a great company to work for while you are in high school or college. The schedules are fairly flexible and most everyone is very easy going.
good,A very stressful job since the department can't keep up with the demand of the customers. Rarely was there a full staff and when there were most employees lacked any motivation to complete tasks that needed to be done. Sundays we joked felt like a concert since there was always a mob of people waiting to be served since we weren't staffed well enough.
good,"this job is okay as a high schooler, they higher individuals with learning disabilities, and that awesome.. thy will take advantage of you though if they can, the companies UNION program is a scam and joke, they want your money and have connections with store managers and could care less in helping you."
good,"Worked here for 6 and a half years, and only got nickel and dime raises. Worked in the deli, produce, bagger, front cashier. Not a bad job as a first job. Worked a second job at the start of my career here, and at the end, both for about 6 months."
good,"For working more than a year at Kroger, I have realized that they excel at hiring friendly co-workers but building a team to succeed isn't the key they have. It is a big issue to see some work hard everyday while others slack off in front of management which could lead to plenty of issues."
good,I ended up getting 40 hours; but they were not one to want to give overtime. I had an assistant manager discuss my health issues with several other employees even make jokes about it. I disliked the management and how I got treated there but other than that I liked the job.
good,I enjoyed being a cashier I had the opportunity to meet new people. The management team was ok only thing I didn't like was the seniority. But other than I enjoyed working their the people was very nice
good,"Kroger is a good part time job if you want benefits. But long term it doesn't have a livable wage unless your management or higher. It takes a long time to get to anything resembling a livable way with the pay upgrades being pitiful. The best advantage is that you do get health care, vacation and education assistance after working there for a year as well as access to the union, otherwise, it's pretty hard."
good,"very stressful, lots of work put on one person. You have to be a superhero to get it all done. Management doesn't care about the employees. It is ridiculous the amount of work they want you to finish without help."
good,Bosses was awful and did not care about their employees! Workplace was always dirty and they did nit care about our personal lives.
good,"Was fun at first and i enjoyed working there, but the bosses started playing favorites and inforcing outragious new rules that only certin people had to follow."
good,"Uninteresting and stressful. I did not learn much as I have had a previous baking job. Management only cared about numbers, profits, profits, profits. I worked at my own leisure, the job allowed me to work at my own pace."
good,Kroger is only okay for younger kids looking for their first job. They over work the ones of work and under work the ones who dont.
good,"Kroger provided many opportunities to advance within the company. I could have easily formed a career at Kroger as a full-time deli clerk with union benefits. However, the job was very stressful due to being the busiest deli in the district in addition to facing staffing issues. Overall, I enjoyed my experience at Kroger. I formed a very strong work ethic and close bonds with some of my coworkers."
good,"For the 2+ years I worked there, I didn't have much to complain about, and I didn't have much to be excited about. Not a bad job for when I was in high school. I highly recommend if you want to improve your people or money handling skills."
good,"Usually a very busy day and lucky to have two people in Starbucks kiosk. Hardly had enough supplies to make it through a week, constantly running out of things which would really upset the customers and causing us to lose business."
good,"I have worked for Kroger 4 different times, each time trying to be successful, but management made it impossible.  I went out of my way to go over and beyond the call of duty, and was never successful."
good,"It is a decent place to work, not many advancement opportunities and management does not back their employees  I had a great team that works under me.  Sales and EBITDA have increased since I became Manager"
good,I did like some of the people I worked around. The management was not good and did not have good pay or benefits.  The part I enjoyed the most about my job was getting to help others.  A typical day was scanning products and occasionally bagging the products.
good,Nice place to work on the other hand it can get very busy at times and things get hectic for a second. Overall nice place to work I recommend for very patient and overlooking people
good,"Boring, I furthered my customer experience, management was inconsiderate, co-workers were depressed, the hardest part was going to work, I liked food."
good,Kroger in a way is just plain awful. The company does not always do the right thing according to law. Not great place to work
good,Each store is different. Management makes a huge different in your experience at this company. It's very easy for a managers personal opinion of an employee to affect that employees life. There's no safeguard in place preventing employees from becoming the victim of unfair biase. And the job itself is fueled by your managers personal opinion of what your job should be regardless of what the company believes it should be.
good,"It is a great company, decent salary but the long hours will take a toll after while. It is a great experience at learning how to be a manager."
good,I do data entry for scripts. I fill scripts and talk to insurance companies. I'm in s retail setting so I work with customers ringing up there orders on the cash register. There is only the Pharmacist and myself working per shift. The most enjoyable part of the job is learning new things.
good,"Kroger is a great place to get a summer job, but not a good place to look for a living job or a career. Wages are $2.50 per hour below competitors wages, so there is little room to amass a savings. all hourlies live paycheck to paycheck. "
good,"hard working co-workers, easy to get along with management, work environment was safe and secure, had a easy time learning the process, and keeping ok"
good,"Worked for Kroger for a year as a Co-Manager. 10 week program an external candidate, much to learn. Kroger is a great company to work for but what makes it challenging are its tenured employees. Yes that are so much stuck in their ways which could be changed with so time. Employee and Management work life balance is horrible. Various department heads have vacation time, but most times are pushed back because there is not another person trained to do his or her job. So while he or she is on vacation when they come back its hard because there was no one else doing their job. Employees get their schedule once a week (union), but is not planned in advance due to forecasts and sales. Management on the other hand schedules are put out in a month advanced, hard to get consecutive days off, and its said that management has PTO days and holidays are made up if you worked that day. Most store managers act as if they don't see them. Kroger employees and management are trained to be workers, not leaders although that's what their management training is all about. Benefits of Kroger is their medical. If you are about in your late 20's with a family their insurance is the way to go."
good,the store was currently under going several changes when i worked there the environment was very dysfunctional but still a pretty good place
good,"although This is a no touch place regularly implied to fight and scuffle with shoplifters, no back up, low pay, and trainers that are more interested in playing on their phones than actually training."
good,The work is busy and fast paced. I learned a great amount of knowledge regarding the food service industry. The fast pace of the work allowed me to learn quickly and perfect my skills at preparing the food necessary to improve the service with in the department I worked in. I worked in the hot foods department of the store. I met many nice people. The work environment was friendly and pleasing.
good,"Working at Marianos is not really a great job, however if all your looking for is to pick up a few extra hours each week, or a first time job, its great."
good,"i was consistently in the top cashier spot every month but was not offered more consistent hours, even when requested.  management was not friendly at my location.  i liked my job there and was good at it.  it was disappointing for my first job that it didnt work out."
good,not enough hours in the day to do what needs to be done. You need to have more people than just one person in a department. Management contradicts each other when assigning tasks. No way to relax at home on your day off.
good,It was a joy working at Kroger's even though management at that time was different. I enjoyed it until they started stealing from the registers.
good,"I was there 3 years known 7 different jobs..someone who was hired only for a month got positions that i asked for, and they had to train them compared to me who ran the department with no lead."
good,Very late shifts and a fast pased environment.  Balancing work and school at Cal State Long Beach was difficult during the time I worked there
good,I worked as a contractor - a lot of uncertainty - no sense of direction - one day management approve one initiative and later on they back out... no consistency ...
good,"The management needs to step up their game, and maybe show some respect to the employees who take excellent care of their clientele from time to time."
good,"There isn't a consistent work schedule, during a week you might work 1st, 2nd and 3rd shift. Lack of communication within management. Fuel center has no restroom. "
good,Its not to demanding but it definitely makes you work hard. It's also a plus that you are able take days off without really any issues other than maybe being understaffed.
good,"Do not expect to move up, they won't move you. And if you do, have fun with a extra quarter to your already minimum wage. Management is terrible, and if you're at store 320, have fun!"
good,Working at Kroger's was very exciting and the easiest job in history.The customers were all so friendly .A typical day at Kroger's consisted of always leaving work with a smile but my feet hurting from standing up. I learned how to please my customers despite the way I feel inside or out .The customers were my number one priority . My co-workers were very helping in every process of explaining things I didn't know about .The hardest part of the job was checking out a decent time so my cash-out time wouldn't be high .The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new faces .
good,"I guess it depends on the store you go to, the store I was in, it was better to be a cart retriever or bagger as every other department was run half @ssed, and although some managers were nice, a lot of them were just so disorganized. For instance if you ordered a jacket or vest to wear, it would take getting on managements case to either order it, or get it to you personally once it had been ordered, if not it would be months before you ever saw one. You couldn't even trust co workers/supervisors, you always had some that played favorites, and looked for ways to fire you or anyone else that was new, just for the simple fact that they were disliked, not because of work performance."
good,Work late at night 12:00 till 8:00 am. It real great place  to work at. I learn a lot from colleagues. There was a lot of variety in what I did each day.
good,fast paced physical job with nice incentives. only complaint was lack of full time hours and poor management within the department and store. I believe this is solely due to the personalities of management within this store and that this store does not reflect or demonstrate the core values of the Kroger company. I regret that my employment opportunity was with this store because I have been a Kroger shopper for years and think they do offer a lot including opportunities for advancement and further training to enhance work  performance and resume.
good,"I have been working in the produce department for about four months, making a little over eight dollars an hour. Even with my prior experience controlling my own produce department and also being a assistant produce manager for a different location, I was only able to start out around eight an hour. I have had to deal with issues out of my control from my human resource representative ever since I started working for Kroger."
good,"Paid minimum wage, only opportunity to move up is if you've been there for 30+ years then maybe they'll put you as an assistant manager for a department"
good,"Fun to work when you're not pushing in carts in the snow. You work every holiday and about every weekend. Unless, you're full time hours vary every week."
good,typical day at work basic didn't learn anything but what i already knew how to do is bag things and karts management was ok co workers were ok no hard things about this job the most enjoyable parts was going home
good,"very fast pace which I do like. managers wouldn't work with my schedule. I enjoyed being around customers , the physical parts of the job. I learned more about produce."
good,Some of the staff was friendly. I didn't like getting carts from the lot because I had to do it rain or shine and sometimes I would have my parents bring me new shoes because mine were soaked. It's a good job for someone young.
good,"I worked as a grocery clerk on the night shift, so I basically cleaned the shelves. I wasn't allowed to stock shelves as I went - I was told it'd get the shelf stockers into trouble and ""it wasn't my job"". Great people on the night shift, all really nice and would talk to anyone. The job itself never ended. The pay was abysmal and my manager never worked with my college schedule - even though I changed my availability on the online schedule months ahead of time. Of course, it could be different now because that store changes employees and managers every month it seems."
good,I learned a lot from working and a union because the management was suppose to suspend me for three days before getting fired but they just took me of the scheduled even thou I had followed up with them why that happened but no response from management.
good,This job was not cut out for me. I was trying to work two jobs at the same time and they did not want to work with my hours from my other job. It wasn't such an orderly ran place either.
good,I love working with the team members but the management is not people person friendly so it makes for an uncomfortable work environment. One week the rule is this for example then the next week it changes. There is no uniform structure to the management people.
good,Was not a bad job but could have been better. Could have had friendlier staff and management. Was very inconsiderate when it came to hours and time management.
good,"this was a part time job. It helped with paying bills. when i worked there, management was poor and unfair. i believe staffing has changed now."
good,"- Amazing co-workers."
good,Enjoyed meeting new people daily and helping the customers with whatever they needed help with.I love working for this company but then it became a issue when i got another job because my hours were cut.
good,"Good job, but no time line when you can actually become a Kroger employee if working through a temp agency. attendance guidelines for the call center is very strict. Lose a lot of good employees due to this."
good,"ok place to work, the better employee you are the more hours you get even if that means taking someone elses.  pretty much do your own thing when you're not a grocery clerk."
good,"Kroger Company was different from the jobs I had before, I did learn a new inventory system, I learned how to manage large groups of people at one time. Overall it was a learning experience."
good,mariano's overall its a good company to work for. great customer service and friendly coworkers. the enviorment is great and the service that is provided is awesome.
good,"Having never worked in retail, I thought I would like to work for a store that I have spent thousands of dollars in and have always appreciated their services and selections.  WOW....was that a huge mistake!  I came from corporate life and that was probably my first mistake.  Thinking that the caliber of management and professionalism would be anywhere NEAR the same is far fetched to say the least.  From the moment the HR manager kept stating that I had an IT background (I corrected them so many times that it got uncomfortable...clearly this person didn't understand what IT actually does) to the moment I stepped into the Pharmacy where I was assigned, it was unsupportive, impatient, such low pay it was laughable.  I was told I'd have a 90 probation period in which to come up to speed.  I was given 3 weeks.  After that time, they decided that someone with no retail, pharmacy, medical or cashiering background was ""just not learning fast enough""!  It's laughable.  I don't believe that is truly their expectations of any new hire with no background.  I do believe that the Pharmacist and Lead Tech(had the personality of a brick wall)  just didn't want me in there. Pharmacists are not Managers and actually should be required to have strong interpersonal and Management skills.   Regardless, a typical day was very busy and time went by fast.  It was a challenge to learn all of the products, where they were stored and how, terminology, and for me cashiering because I'd never done it before.  There are more exceptions to the situations you will encounter than there are normal transactions."
good,a lot of people don't work and the one that do. wont managers only  care for there bonus.and saving there own but then tell the truth. less time with the customer more people out the door.
good,"Working at kroger wasn't my favorite job, but alas it wasn't the worst. I made enough money to get by while I worked there. My days at work were all pretty much the same I came in I did what was asked of me and I went home. the hardest part of my job was probably cleaning the nasty restrooms there. The most enjoyable part was interacting with the customers. The management was okay, some of them were okay and I really liked them, others, not so much.I had some really great coworkers"
good,A typical day at work for me is getting to work on time and preparing my station. I would count all of the money and make sure that it was the correct amount in my register. I will then cut on my light to let customers know that I was ready to check them out. I checked out my customers at a timely speed. They didn't have to wait in a long line.
good,"Co-workers are very helpful as well as management.  What I have learned while employed there was patience, customer service, responsibility and hard work."
good,"Day began at 4 am and started out with unloading the truck, sorting merchandise then distributing it to the floor."
good,"this company along with the position I held, will teach anyone patience, give you a better of understanding of your community"
good,"Rude co workers as well as customers. I learned  a lot though. learned how to receive different type of payments from customers. I feel as if maybe I just worked in a bad area,"
good,"A typical day at work as starting off as a bagger, I would bag groceries until I was told to either push carts back inside, clean restrooms, clean up spills, or do 'orphans' which was putting away misplaced or items that were not bought but left at the front of the store. After doing those things the main job would be to bag groceries. The hardest part of the job was being pressured when someone would have a lot of groceries and to bag them yourself without any help, the customers would have to wait and it got stressful at times. Management was okay I suppose, I had around  different supervisors and I called in sick one day and one didn't even remember my name after working there for 6+ months. I was also told after turning 16 I would be trained asap to work the register, I asked about it multiple times and nothing progressed with that. It was a little degrading I suppose as well as rude customers not acknowledging the baggers, but there's not much you can necessarily do about that. I'm sure it would be a wonderful job with better benefits with advancement within the company."
good,"its just a college job, unless you go into management but then they can move you at any time"
good,Pay is ok. benefits are cheap and awesome coverage. Management of the company will stick you in back as soon as they get a chance and they will hold good workers back from moving up into company if they need you
good,"A typical day at work is full of joy. At work I learned how to deal with all types of customers. Management at Kroger's is very awful. My co-workers are easy going, very helpful, and great customer service. Th hardest part of my job is dealing with rude customers. The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting new people and making them happy."
good,"Only worked there for two months and was let go because a recently promoted assistant manager didn't like me. I have NO IDEA what story she dreamed up to tell the manager, but by the next day I was gone. I could tell from the beginning the assistant manager was very unstable, but a good producer so she was in a tight relationship with the manager. I was warned about her by other sales professionals, but never dreamed the assistant was so vengeful!!!!!! I don't know if it was jealousy or just some other issue of hers. It's not worth my time to even think of the situation, but just want others to BEWARE of this culture!!!!!!"
good,I liked this job but wasn't happy that I couldn't make enough hours to support my family and had no chance of becoming full time which I was promised.
good,I enjoy going to work because of the people I work with. The Pharmacy is great you get some great customers but like every other retail job you have some bad ones to. The worst part is that Kroger keeps cutting hours and giving reasons that are false and when that is brought to their attention they say nothing and do nothing. Kroger has become a company who only cares about money. When you work their they tell you everything is about the customer and the problem with that is they have pushed their employees to the wayside. It used to be a great company now it has become to big.
good,"typical day at work waiting on rudes customers ,management showed no respect"
good,A typical day at this job was usually fast paced. I learned patience being a cashier. Management changed a lot. My co workers were fun and friendly. There really wasn't no hard part of this job. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people all the time.
good,I am trying to get out currently and if I could I would already be in a position to do so.
good,"The hardest part of the job is the strain of standing and doing the repetitive motion all day. "
good,"A typical workday was stressful at times during rush hour but I generally got the hang of it.  Ilearned new things about working with Gas in the Fuel Center.  Management really wasn""t supportive because they mainly stayed inside the store.  My co-workers were a lot of fun to work with.  The hardest part of the job was cleaning up Gas spills.  The most enjoyable part of the job was when we passed our evaulations for the fuel center."
good,"Not being sure which job this is for, I have no idea what I am supposed to say. Kroger was a ok place to work."
good,I work evening shifts and weekends at Kroger's. I have learned how many different varieties of meat and cheese there are available. The management is friendly. I get along with all my co-workers. The hardest part of working at Kroger's is the late hours and standing on my feet all night. The enjoyable part of my job are the customers appreciation they show me when pleased with their service.
good,"I worked her for a very short time, but enjoyed the people I worked with. We were able to work at our own pace, which took a lot of stress out of the job."
good,at times very fast paced. on daily basis upon clocking in reporting to meat manager wrap and run the cases straightening and filling as needed while assisting customers. wrapping meat and seafood. checking of daily loads of supplies. after prime time rush takeing care of supplies and cleaning and sorting store oersinnel to assist and take care of items prevailent to daily needs
good,"Kroger is an okay company, it had its up's and down's. But I'd prefer to find something I enjoy working."
good,"This company is okay.  The company is okay about working with schedule, however, will not give enough hours or make someone full time unless you are a manager.  The company has a somewhat high turn over rate and is one of the top 5 lowest paid companies in the country"
good,I didn't enjoy working for Kroger to much due to the lack of people scheduled per department. Seems like they don't care about the employee but the customers money.
good,"My work day go by very fast, fast pace work.The most enjoyable about my job was helping people."
good,"As long as you get your work done, you want have any problems. Pays every week, that's good. Raises every year."
good,Fairly easy to advance but management isn't very helpful when it comes to getting things done.
good,The pay is horrible and had a lot of rude customer's. During the summer you aren't allowed to wear bermuda shorts regardless of how hot it is.
good,The manager didn't know what he was doing . The management team would work you to death and didn't believe in raises nor did they care if you minded not getting health care . I guess that's a union for you.
good,"A typical day begins and ends in a huge rush. Typically each day brings more challenges without any help to overcome them. This company is a great place to learn about customer service, and was founded on principles that are still a main point for upper management today. On a store level management tends to view their own motives as being more important than those of the company. Job duties are ever changing and determined by managements temperament on that given day. The employees are great people and work very well together when management isn't creating problems. The most difficult part of the job is keeping track of the daily changes and not getting frustrated when come. The best part on the job is being able to help provide customers with almost anything they are looking for, or the gratitude they show when the efforts are above and beyond."
good,"Great co workers. High turnover rate, management not very flexible."
good,I learned more on how to handle money and different customers.
good,"a typical day at my workplace would be checking temperature logs for proper food handling also engaging with the employees ensuring everything in on task for the day checking inventory , placing orders as needed making sure great customer service is being given. the hardest part of the job is making proper scheduling,putting the right people in the right place.the most enjoyable part is highly satisfied customer."
good,"enjoyed working with the customers and coworkers, maybe if there was better communication and better attitude with management and those higher up might make it a better place to work as a team"
good,"The work environment set up by corporate/management at Kroger was such it set some cashiers for failure at the start.  There was high emphasis processing a customers order with speed and accuracy, but the registers were not configured in such a way that this was possible for all employees..  "
good,"On a ordinary day it's everyday routine I had by opening up the self check out machines. and helping customers who didn't understand how to work the self check out machine,to scanned their groceries and pay for them.my co-worker were easy to get along with,but the hardest part of the job is when you're helping one customer another customer wants you to stop what your doing with the first customer,to come and help them,but all you can say is I will be with you soon as i'm done helping this customer,thank you for your patient,this was and on going things half the the day.the most part was being able to engage with the customer and make them feel that they can always come back a shop some more,and keep a smile on their faces."
good,Fast paced environment. Interactions with people on a daily basis.
good,"As a cashier a Kroger, I worked the late shift. (6pm - 12am.) All of the employees and management were very nice and easy to work with. For about a month, I worked grocery stock to help out. "
good,"Typical day was long and hard, i learned team work, management didnt care for, co worker where cool"
good,"The co worker were great, the managment was ok. Worked very hard an gave all yet management did not stand beind me."
good,"Customer severs values great Truly , but the way they handle employees, this job was a mess, to understand seen the management would ask so much from one persone, and they would never remember asking you to do it in the first place. understanding the way you must get your job done in one day it was hard to get any thing done with a mess or some thing going wrong, the time of me working there we had 6 managers in one department. and they where always trying to change some thing or think u don't know your job was, it be came to much i couldn't handle it . right down mean...... i guess i don't under stand how any one can run a company like that"
good,Need a different line of work in my life. Need a change. I have enjoyed working here for the past 12 years. Always a good work place.
good,I enjoyed working there and all of the co-workers are very close which made the job easier to go to everyday. I enjoyed my job until the last few weeks where Management was rude and very unprofessional.
good,I spent almost four years working for this company and for the most part it was a good experience. Management has some issues as far as the way they treat employees and advancement is not good.
good,"A typical work day would be dealing with the same costumer from the previous days, coupon deals, and basic grocery shopping items."
good,Not a horrible place to work but it depends on the managers. I multiple times had been passed up for a promotion in a position i was more than qualified for in favor of a younger more in experienced person because she was prettier? I'm not sure. But I had lost all hope for advancement a year into my time there.
good,Employment here is an advancement based on who you know and not your work ethic. The company itself has plenty pros
good,My days was pretty good days.I use to come and check the store be fore I would allow my employee leave.I had a check list that had to be complete. I would also have to count the money that was in the safe and the draw. I made deposits. I learned how to be a leader and responsible. Management was helpful when I needed help. My co-workers was a team player.The hardest part of the job was when a employee was out and I had to come and cover. I really enjoyed being a leader.
good,Not a bad company to work for. Extremely hectic work place. Customer focused.
good,Not very progressive at the time. Upper management very old school and not open to change or new ideas
good,"Seriously, do I need to write about a Grocery Store? It's minimum wage shenanigans. You"
good,- The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing my co-workers also helping the customers.
good,"A typical day at work for me is usually just preparing prescriptions for patients. That requires different steps such as data entry, pre-verification, product dispensing, verification, and release to patient. I have leared all of the drugs needed in a pharmacy to fill prescriptions. The co-workers are half and half; some are really nice and easy to get along with and others aren't. The hardest part of the job is that it gets really busy and it is hard to keep up. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to work with medications and helping/meeting new people."
good,"i would have conversations with the costumers and have (a professional amount of) fun at work, and make new friends everyday."
good,"This was by far the most challenging job I have ever had. Upper management tend to be disrespectful of employees and treated us as if we should just be lucky enough to work in this establishment. Co-workers were amazing to work with. Truly a team effort. The hardest part of my job was moving up through management and not being recognized for it. I was given more and more responsibility, but without salary to back it up. While my other fellow managers were receiving pay raises I was constantly told to wait my turn, which never came."
good,"As a deli clerk for a large grocery store chain, my work was not difficult or demanding. The pay was horrible, but I enjoyed coming to work."
good,"Typical entry level job. Go to work and do you job. Cull the produce, fill it with new product. Also had to pull the truck and down stack and date the new product in the cooler."
good,"I run register, bag items, and handled monetary transactions."
good,"Working for them was educational, physically intensive, management at the base level was more than satisfactory, co-workers were good people that in general could be counted on, the hardest part of the job were the hours required to work. Midnight to nine AM, with no set weekly schedule, the most enjoyable part of the job was being able tohelp customers."
good,This company is all about the money not the employee. You are not allowed to have time off if your child becomes ill. I had to work when my son was in the hospital. Or i would of been fired.
good,"The job is simple to do, the people are difficult to work with at most times."
good,"Management was not so easy to work with, but i did learn alot about fuel centers and daily maintenance of a fuel center."
good,"They promise you a sign on bonus but if you don't get on to them about it then you will never see it. They also promise you full time and you get it for a couple of weeks then cut you to about 15 hours. And you will never see a raise or evaluation when you are supposed to. I worked there for a year and was promised so many things and never saw one of them. They also have a hard time keeping employees and most of their managers are bad and have no business being in that position. You also need to keep track of your hours your self because if you don't, your paychecks probably won't match up."
good,It a good place to work and I would work for them again. you can advance if you work hared.
good,"It was an ok job. Taught me to work hard and fast, be responsible, and to take pride in my work"
good,It is a Great Company to work for It is just hard to advance in a little store. Raises are not easy to come by either. The customer service is great. Employess are wonderful and Mangment is great!
good,"Honestly Management Is Horrid And Kroger Don’t Even Have A DECENT Work/Life Balance Due To An Unset Schedule. Lets Just Say You Call In One Time Due To Lets Say “Death In The Family” They Want Proof That, Thats The Truth And Are Very Selective With Who They Ask Proof From, Honestly It’s Completely Ridiculous. The Only Reason I’ve Stayed Is Because Of My Co-Workers."
good,"There are days I can have a lot of fun, but most days are stressful and full of drama. The drama could customers not being satisfied or complaining or it could be co-workers not getting along. Management does not care about the well-being of the employees and wants us to work even when carrying illness."
good,"I could not have a set work schedule. I have children and I have to be able to drop them off and pick them up from school. Help with homework, cook dinner, and get them ready for the next day. Kroger's wouldn't work around my life, so I quit."
good,This place is a good first job. Their training is extensive. They have a union. They have so many employees and locations so it is probably a different environment at each location.
good,"The people you'll meet at Kroger are friendly, normal people who make great coworkers and friends. The pay is good and you will get raises the longer you work there."
good,"Pretty flexible with availability, no real benefits except on Kroger products. Quick turnaround with employees, most of which are high schoolers. Online coupons are a pain with customers not understanding how they work. Same goes for the buy 5 save 5."
good,"It was fun working at Kroger. I worked at Kroger for a year and a half and it was only started to get bad towards the end of me working, I had got a new job and told them I had to get specific hours or I had to leave and they kept trying to schedule me on days I had a other job to attend too."
good,I worked at Kroger for a few months. I requested more and more hours and the manager of the department wouldn't work with me. I was yelled at and rushed to get things done. I had a panic attack in the back stock room. It was the first time i had a panic attack in years.
good,"The management, those being the supervisors for the most part, have a very loose knowledge and enforcement of the rules. There isn't much of a dress code, and the use of language and profanity between coworkers and supervisors is very frequent. Many workers seem to have small knowledge of their profession, forcing coworkers such as myself to work harder to bring production by."
good,The managers at the location I worked at were stern but flexible with scheduling if you let them know beforehand. Fellow coworkers encouraged each other and help assess any issues as well as help resolve them. This is a good place to develop teamworking skills as well as customer service skills.
good,I was bullied and picking up slack of others. The management did not help with problems they put two different schedules in the store and online. They were rude and dirty they did not clean properly.
good,"Management is bad, if they help you it's because they don't want to hear about it later, they blame you for stuff you can't control, and if you take vacation time if anything goes bad it's your fault."
good,The store was run well. I got along with all my co workers and managers. The only thing I can really say I didn't like was the low pay for working overnight.
good,Kroger is a excellent starting job for highschool students to learn the fundimentals of work ethics and customer service skills. They are very flexible with their scheduling.
good,At food for less I did the best job I could do in the time that was allotted always wanted to do as much as I could to make everyone happy.I stocked the shelves and clean the area of which I was a sign nightly.
good,I like working there the people I work with are great management not so much and pay sucks insurance is good I work long hours don't get appreciated for the work I do
good,The job wasn't hard but the manager and the people weren't very friendly and there was no communication skill in that whole building. The management made it hard for employees to be happy.
good,"It was okay . Better for people who like outdoors. Since they make you do carts for an hour, but I liked some people who worked. Some were mean and racist."
good,"They hire quickly and often. As aforementioned, it's a way to get some money in but. Please stay focused on whatever the reason you came for because if not you'll be stuck there four years or like me. It's easy to stay because they WILL schedule you and you WILL like some things about it. Location is usually easy to get to because there's no shortage of Kroger stores. Also, vacation or PTO is not the only means of getting off work (besides you obvious off days) so that's also cool. It's a lot sometimes and overall not worth it for LONG TERM. Get what you need out of it and move on."
good,Before you commit do yourself a favor. Go into a food 4 less and talk to employees. Do your due diligence and vet the union and management team. It's not what it seems. They state flexible schedule but are the complete opposite.
good,"I'm sure there are more opportunities now than there were five plus years ago. I liked working here. Only sometimes you were left by yourself because of a scheduling issue and that could make things a little hectic. However, today, it doesn't see that way."
good,"I was excited about a Unionized job with benefits, however I struggled to get enough hours. Definitely not a livable job. I had to work two other jobs to make ends meet. Customers are horribly rude. There are nice people, but they're few and far between. I was hired quickly due to my experience but forgotten about just as quickly. Once I was trained for the position they wanted me in that was about it. No talk of me moving up or working towards something more. I'm in the process of trying to find another job as this one isn't sustainable."
good,"Make your own decision on this company, but my experience was I was told one thing when hired, tho once time came that I needed help as they promised I went from the best employee ever to the worst in a matter of minutes. I ended up quitting at the same moment they decided to for me."
good,You have to be careful because the word PROMOTION is loosely used.  Just because they say you're getting a promotion does not mean you are getting compensated like a PROMOTION.  When you do get compensated for a PROMOTION you will not get the pay they tell you they will lead you on with an hourly pay rate and at the last minute tell you that you will be getting substantially less.  Its a great place to start and then move on.
good,The company was a fast moving job. You aren’t really allowed to take weekends off. The pay is only good if you reach management position. You don’t receive credit when it’s dude
good,"It's impossible to describe a typical day since each one is vastly different. You can count on Sunday being the heaviest day of the week, but in general, the store is pretty full of people. I learned things about cashiering and food safety that I wasn't fully aware of before. I felt that the management was all over the place, and different managers had different ideas about how to manage (but didn't quite communicate anything to other people. The workplace culture was okay. People were pretty nice, but I also felt very uncomfortable around more than one person for their remarks about me or things that pertain to me. The hardest part of the job was dealing with a supervisor who didn't really know how the job worked, so she would constantly implement rules that were detrimental to the efficiency of our work. New goals were set regularly before we had reached the previous goal. It felt pointless and progress felt impossible and arbitrary.  The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with nice customers."
good,They really need to lay off the strict rule following. Can’t ever let you breathe. I was sent outside most of the time and never really actually bagged as much as I would have liked.
good,Management doesn't not care about you sometimes you do other people's jobs for them cause they are to lazy the union only cares about Kroger's so wouldn't help
good,Kroger I feel is best fit for someone who is in high school and doesn't need to work many hours and doesn't really have that many bills to pay. to me it was to slow paced.
good,As it was my first job I did not know what to expect but I learned about how it is to work in the real world. It being a minimum wage job I was not expecting much and knew that it was not going to be a place of hard work and overachieving employees.
good,if you want to work 10-12 hours 5 days a week and you don't mind babysitting adults while trying to complete your own job tasks then Kroger is the place for you
good,Going downhill quickly. Was great 8 years ago but benefits continue to be cut and job positions are being cut even more now with the coast to coast terminations and eliminations of positions.
good,"Corporate reacts instead of being proactive, far from being a leader in the industry. No longer long term job security. Millions paid out in bonuses to top 10 executives while fighting raises for employees at bargaining table followed by firing 1500 middle management employees."
good,"Kroger could be one of the nation's top companies...but the way the Delta region treats its employees is absolutely deplorable. The job offers no real tangible security and the minimum starting wages are just one step ABOVE slave wages. They offer great benefits  discounts, but lay employees barely make enough money to enjoy these perks without having to go to Kroger Financial for loans....so basically we WORK in order to REPAY the company on each and every check. Managers and Assistant Managers are shifted from store to store like chess pawns, with no consideration to their work/life balance . Associates ARE NOT afforded the tools they need (from corporate nor store managers) in order to become successful in their careers at Kroger, so associates are threatened (with SIRs, CAs, suspensions,& terminations) not to work overtime but on a daily basis in every store in the Delta region , but we are short-handed because of an EXTREMELY high turnover rate. That in turn upsets customers, irks associates & managers alike, and creates a gloomy and highly stress filled environment. Oftentimes, associates develop CHRONIC health conditions when working for Kroger Delta division. It's a sad situation and it's only getting worse. The only decent perk recently was a pay increase across the Delta division...but it was NOT the money expected after a long negotiation between corporate & the local UFCW union board."
good,"The only thing good with Kroger is that you’re able to work with your schedule and the people you work with are great. Other than that, it’s not really much."
good,"I loved working at Kroger but management was poor and if management didn't like you, it was hard to advance in your career. Management also held me back from many opportunities to advance  my career due to the fact some of the store managers didn't like me due to the fact I had been sick often and was on FMLA .an.had to call"
good,"The people I worked with were very dramatic and were always starting some kind of argument. One manager was very cruel and two were hardly ever there. There was one good manager in that store, but he was always busy. Working overnight was much better because you really just kept to yourself at night. There weren't a lot of people working with you at night. Then the morning people would come in and they were always so cheery. Middle of the day cashiers were all gossips and were constantly arguing about something."
good,Not the worst job but it had its downsides. Management wasn’t great and people weren’t scheduled correctly at times. Only worked part time so not sure about full time positions
good,"Everyone is overworked and underpaid. The management is disorganized, and employee morale is low. The job turnover rate is very high and pay raises do not encourage employees to be more productive."
good,"Received order, pick it out, bagged them and delivered to customer when arrived. On feet all day, wasn't able to sit unless on break. Enjoyed customer service."
good,The atmosphere is very corporate and even with union you will sometimes be treated like absolute trash. The current store is nearly falling apart and full of dirt and grime. There are health and safety hazards everywhere. Under the new contract it does not matter if you cannot stay longer than your shift if they want to mandate you they will and you will end up missing anything you had scheduled after your shift.
good,"Kroger is your place to work if you fall in the following categories: you're 14/15, you want to work so you have a little bit of spending money, and you are in high school. Don't get me wrong that Kroger is a great place to work. But I wouldn't want to spend the rest of my life there."
good,While working at Kroger almost all employees were unprofessional rude and had no care for whether you got unjustified punishments because of their actions. The managers were alright but the front end was filled with some of the worst people you can ever meet.
good,"Long story short, the management was rude and took to bullying people. The customers were mostly alright, but could get intense. They lied to me in the job description and didn't care that I had a bad back."
good,It was a job that is only good for a couple of months. Management does not work with schedule changes and they will change the schedule at the last minute.
good,"Stretch management (Employees cover several departments, for the purpose of increasing CTO). Little to no support on holidays for Floral Dept. - although, support was promised. The bank inside grocery store was robbed at gunpoint, the day after Christmas."
good,"When I worked there as a bakery clerk, I was alone every day and since I wasn't 18, I couldn't use some of the machines. If I needed to find a manager it was nearly impossible and overall it was just not the best experience."
good,Within this workplace I have increase my customer service skills as well as communication with upper level management. Ive been exposed to different types and forms of cultural diversity. As well as learning new job skills and maintaining a stable and balanced work schedule.
good,No guarantee of hours or advancement..best job for students or someone who needs a side job but don't expect to have financial stability or full time pay or benefits
good,"Very stressful racist they dont give you the opportunity to grow. My store still think it's 1950🤷🤷🤦. I love the employee discounts. They hire alot of people for part time they have favoritism, the union is not worth it, the work with the store."
good,"Every day we'd spend more time cleaning than selling, which was expected. We'd rotate the cleaning stand duties to offer free jewelry cleaning services."
good,They have changed the culture at Mariano's and the HR department shows no signs of improving. It was a genuinely fun at one point but the work load is getting worse and there is little to no work life balance.
good,I enjoyed working with people. The management at this establishment was not good. Some incidents occurred that led to my resignation. I felt as if was a good experience overall to get my work career started.
good,"stocking, working with customers, selling seafood and different meats."
good,"They dont give enough hours, the don't give good raises. the cut hours even though they need people. Everyone is leaving because their treated unfair."
good,hardly room for advancement and rate of pay is very low. Mother and Father both worked for Kroger for a combined 20 years and said that it took them a long time before being able to advance in the company and shortly quit after graduating college.
good,"At my time a Kroger, I enjoyed the work I did, I enjoyed the hours I worked, the people I worked with. Management changed every couple of months leading to worse and worse managers, eventually till we got stuck with a manager who did nothing and constantly freaked out about nothing being done."
good,"Working for this Kroger company has been an interesting journey. Management seems to be insufficiently trained in many areas, more especially so where it matters. Very low morale:("
good,"I worked hard for 10yrs there. My manager sucked, I not only was cashier but I also managed the front end with breaks, always did my job, asst mgr job and got No recognition!!"
good,"Benefits start after 1 year or  you can work 12 straight weeks totaling 40 hours each week but don’t quote me on that.  Everyone is hired in as part time.   Pay is terrible!!!"
good,I have worked retail for a lot of years with over 25 years of managing experience.  There is no room for advancement at Kroger and their seniority program is a joke. The management team knows nothing about scheduling and are unfair to part time workers.  I  love my job but I'm looking to leave soon. I love my customers even the mean ones but the staff needs customer service training. cutom
good,"Poor management at time I had to quit.  "
good,"Kroger was very fast paced. The salary was low , and you meet new people everyday. If you can deal with people very well then this is the place for you to thrive."
good,This was not a job that anyone should keep for long but they did teach me a lot about customer service. this job was part of a union so that where most of the low pay and deductions come into play.
good,I had a great experience at Kroger and made a fair amount of money. The job is pretty stressful and tiring though and you don’t be get paid much for it.
good,"I'm still here,  yet like I said,  over a year ago I was offered a job and felt good working for the company.   Until I was introduced to lead manager who is a total pain.   Not only is this person rude,  condescending but they are total control monster.  I don't mind working multiple positions in the store so as long as my weekly hours increase, however,  my lead manager will not have any of it.   Unfortunate, considering I'm one of their best workers when some of other associates who typically gets 40hrs a week are lazy or they have been with the company so long they get away with stuff.   So yes if you are in school trying to get a weekly check, go for it!  If you have fallen on hard times or need additional employment, go for it!   However the management is typically awful, no stability in terms of longevity with co-managers and they will work you like a slave and never be truly sacrificed at your work.  Just caution to the wind."
good,"I had wonderful coworkers, they were friendly and welcoming and were the best part of my experience working there. The management were unprofessional and unapproachable."
good,The store has wonderful employees and customers. Kroger has a union workforce. They offer health insurance and paid vacations after a year. Kroger also offers some medical leave.
good,"Pay was great as a young person with no family, hours are really bad for managers (65+ hours per week).  The benefits for an individual aren't bad, but considering you don't see your family much it isn't worth the trade off for me."
good,"If you like a stressful day with hardly any positive backing on the good job that you did or any complements on the hard work that you put in trying to keep an unorganized team organized, then this is the place for you!!"
good,Wouldn't recommend working here. Unless u just need part time and no benefits at all. And want to watch managers play favorites especially at the Derby KS location.
good,Working as a Grocery Clerk was a collegiate job and I would recommend to truly euthastic individuals who has a true passion in engaging with consumers. The revenue may come easier to those that way.
good,"To much stress not enough pay they do not  contribute to you 401k, your expected to work every weekend, always adding more to you work load and changing your schedule,"
good,"Working at Kroger had it's pros and cons. It's good for someone in high school looking for their first job to start making money. But as you get older, time to get out."
good,"The Kroger Store,i worked at is productive but not a friendly place all the "
good,The company is working on their employee retention. Kroger is trying to allow employees more resources to have a healthy balance between work life and private life.
good,"A typical workday consisted of about 100 emails a day, helping anyone of 300 associates, running daily, monthly and quarterly reports and handling the whole hiring process for the store I worked in.  It was a busy and stressful day but it went fast and I loved my  job,"
good,Kroger expects you to put in a lot of hours. There are too many people in charge. Constantly getting micro managed by multiple people. Too many people telling you different ways to do things.
good,"I ran the register, counted out medication and filled prescriptions for the pharmacist to check and sign off on. Did inventory also. Also called insurance when it would not go through for some reason and we had to troubleshoot it."
good,"An average day at Kroger, is always pulling in and out carts and helping customers with their groceries. Their aren't really busy days unless on the holidays where we usually gets the most tips around that time."
good,they don't schedule you hours only 10 a week you have to try to pick some up or be available all the time for when they call you when somebody doesn't show up which is very inconvenient but if you don't go in you don't get your hours you don't get your money good pay good hours Good Times to work I'll go to the people that have been there for 10-plus years
good,"Poor management had caused for a stressful work environment. However, the work was not difficult. As a part-time employee it was not too bad but full-time employees seem to be overworked."
good,I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone that has major commitments outside of work. I worked here while in high school and management was horrible. A lot of my coworkers were negative. Bad environment.
good,"The workers that I worked with were very friendly, fun and professional all together. It is a very fast pace place to work at and it can be tiring, but the environment there was mostly very good and kept a good attitude."
good,"The job hours are not very consistent, and the new front end manager is not too great. the employees are great for the most part, but anyone in a higher position only cares about the self and no one else. you could tell them that you need a specific day off and they would say ""no problem"" and then you are scedualed for that day and be counted as a no call no show. its just all mushed together, and you never know what you are going to walk in to."
good,"The managers at my particular store were absolutely horrible which made for working there uncomfortable, the scheduling was so screwed up, I don’t like the online schedule simply because the manager at my store went in and changed it when ever she felt like it."
good,Friendly nice people and nice environment to work in but managers and lazy and don't do there fair share of the work and it's a shame.  I liked the other employees
good,"I started with Kroger because of their customer centric focus and was rewarded with a company that actually believed that customers were the foundation for the business. After 3 years, and 5 changes in corporate values and processes, the company has seemingly lost its focus (do we please the customer, the shareholder, the CEO or react to the competition?)"
good,At the time I was working there i did not like the manager. Then I had a 2 year old and was pregnant with my second child. When my son was sick i called out and it seemed to have been a bigger issue than it was.
good,"Let me make this clear, Kroger is not a good place to go to for a career or even a livable wage. You will be making minimum wage with little in the way of advancement. The low bar for entry as well as flexible hours make it a great first job or second job for extra cash. Often the low bar of entry does mean that you can end up with bad coworkers so if you're someone who actual does their job properly you will likely be picking up their slack."
good,"The culture is based on feed the human spirit."
good,"cleaning, replenishing product, learning to make arrangements, arrange displays, watering, creative license, balloon arrangements, customer service, etc."
good,The managers were honestly a joke. They never knew what they were doing. Majority of the days were slow except sundays. You get a discount but only on Kroger brands and the discount is 10%
good,Working at Kroger is an okay job to start off the pay isn't great but its weekly. The customers can be a pain at times but most of the time they just want to have a conversation. The hardest part about working at Kroger was dealing with my co-workers and managers.
good,"I'm still here,  yet like I said,  over a year ago I was offered a job and felt good working for the company.   Until I was introduced to lead manager who is a total pain.   Not only is this person rude,  condescending but they are total control monster.  I don't mind working multiple positions in the store so as long as my weekly hours increase, however,  my lead manager will not have any of it.   Unfortunate, considering I'm one of their best workers when some of other associates who typically gets 40hrs a week are lazy or they have been with the company so long they get away with stuff.   So yes if you are in school trying to get a weekly check, go for it!  If you have fallen on hard times or need additional employment, go for it!   However the management is typically awful, no stability in terms of longevity with co-managers and they will work you like a slave and never be truly sacrificed at your work.  Just caution to the wind."
good,"The managers don’t care enough, and the atmosphere is just to do the job no matter what, I’m conditions that aren’t favorable, i wouldn’t recommend working here"
good,I wouldn’t recommend this job for older people this is more for young kids in school or who need a summer job or part time job . Fast paced sometimes or only when the store has sales going on . The pay should be more for the work they want you to do
good,"However, I have built a great relationship with my customer. Taking time out to see how things have been going for them. If something was incomplete finding ways to fix the issue."
good,training could have been better. the pay could have been better. helped be a little bit more social. i did not like the fact that the manager did not want me working another job. the equipment for the check lines could be more up to date to make things easier for employees.
good,"Lot of work, no money. Honestly if you need a job quick they  will give you one. There isn’t many positions and will take years to make a decent pay. J"
good,"I wasn't comfortable talking with strangers before I started in click-list and after my first week I became a lot more comfortable with. Everyday I had to talk to a new customer I had never met before, telling them what they ordered and were able to buy and the things we just didn't have. The entire Kroger store is like this and it is a great place for friendly people to work besides the low pay of course."
good,"The work itself wasn’t hard, but there are certain people in management that did not care about their employees. I had a manager in my department who did the absolute minimum work he could do, and sometimes didn’t even show up to work, or leave within an hour of starting his shift. I would have to pick up his side of the job and mine, which made the easy work i had to do almost impossible to finish; the upper management did absoluletely nothing about the situation no matter how many times we complained about it."
good,"I worked as a cashier and they wanted you to scan at a certain number. Well, that is not the case because lines are always backed up because there wasn't an efficient enough of baggers. So if we didn't scan at the number they wanted us to they would get onto the cashiers. There would be times where I would get a break late because of how short staffed were at times. Other than management not being the best the people that you work with can make the difference."
good,"baggers don't get pay raises even though they do the most physical work. pushing carts is difficult in really cold, really hot, and rainy weather. front end managers were really great, but the head front end manager is awful and doesn't know how to balance things well, and he scheduled people outside of their set availability times even though it's against Kroger policy. A lot of the front ends staff is older and very cranky about the physical aspects of the job. but you do get a lot of bonuses as well as cake for a variety of reasons, and if you're anything other than a bagger (pay is $8.50/hour), you get a 50 cent raise every 6 months."
good,This job is good short term but would not suggest it for the long term. The scheduling is very inconsistent and so are the hours. Its good to make some side money.
good,"Start of day 3am walk the store for vendor holes/print summery for vendors to fill. Scan emails. Scan out damages/reclamation, open door for deliveries. rec. deliveries process coinciding paperwork. Keep backroom and dock in workable order."
good,I didnt like it. It was okay at first until they switched management and they could've given us longer breaks and paid us a little more I cant get an apartment or a car with 8.50 an hour
good,"Overall Kroger was a nice place to work but due to the low pay I was receiving , I couldn’t live off that .. it was not for me i needed at least a double digit pay and the mangers wasn’t very nice"
good,"Lots of back and forth from the sales floor to the cooler, constant replenishment. Cleaning, stocking, inventory management, and backroom organization are all typical responsibilities."
good,"Management can make your day.  I had a great manager when I first started.  He was very supportive. When he transferred stores things changed but not for the better.  Typical day was bringing in carts from the lot, bagging groceries, sweeping the store, helping customers locate items and other duties as assigned.  Other management was not supportive and I felt bullied by middle management up until I left the position with no where to turn."
good,"The store is not particularly bad to work at, but unfortunately I have troubles speaking to management... as they don’t always seem to care for their associates. The hours are different every week, it can differ from you having 35+ hours one week and 20 hours to choose from the next week. "
good,"The pay is relatively low for the amount of work, but the hours are rather flexible. It would be a great job for someone who just needs part time work or is in school in general or just a second small job."
good,The managers at my store were very lazy and it took forever to get anything done or a question answered. This might be different at other stores but was this way at mine.
good,"There are many other retail chains that provide better pay, management, and work environments. The managers want to be there less than the part time high school kids."
good,"The work never really stops. Once you have finished mastering one job department it's time to learn another so you can complete your shift properly on days when you have no help. The scheduling is only fare to those who have management positions, and you will will work multiple departments alone."
good,"Working in the deli, you are not trained properly! Many flies come to the deli and look for food. The slicers are not cleaned or sharpened often. The workers barely even change their gloves."
good,"I started working here almost a year after getting out of college, I was content with the job until I learned what my coworkers were making, I was immediately given a more supervisory role over the group and was being paid their minimum amount.  I took my concerns to my managers and nothing had been done about it for the entire 6 months I had been with them even when a promotion had come up the management had not given the interviews promised and promoted someone else on a whim.  They didn't work with any of the employees at all and only lead to further rifts between us and them.  I was the last person in the original 12 that had left the company because I had been optimistic about their response."
good,I’ve had a rough time leaning new skills because there is little to NO training.  Too busy and supervisor never has time to teach.  Low job satisfaction due to lack of organization in management
good,"A typical day , was very busy . I learned how to be a cashier. Management was ok. I met great people. I can't really think about anything that was hard."
good,"Short staffed on some nights. Managers are ok. Hardest part is being the only bagger some nights. Some days its good, some days its not good. I learned to not take things to the heart"
good,"Management chooses favorites to give hours to."
good,I think it's all politics to be honest. I got looked over for a lot of promotions . It's not what you kno but who you kno. I was with the company for a long time in the same position and always applied for other positions to learn other departments but always got looked over. The straw that broke the camels back is when management promoted a bagger off the front end to a lead management position and I've been with the company for twenty years and never was asked to be in a leadership role. Yes I have the knowledge and experience to do the job. That was the last straw for me. DISCRIMINATION THAT'S HOW I FELT.
good,"i left because of my safety being threatened & also because of poor/crooked management. other than that, it was a pretty ok place to work. i wouldn’t recommend unless i know the person really needed a job."
good,"Worked at Kroger (part-time) for some years now as a Student. The best thing about Kroger is their ability to work around your schedule and home life. A typical day as a Cashier/Customer Service Employee was assisting customers with their transactions, cleaning the workstation, cooperating with other employees, and assisting with customers' requests. "
good,A large portion of the employees are more focused on socializing with coworkers and customers than preforming assigned tasks. A great deal of gossip occurs on a daily basis.
good,"Depends on the location that you are at. The first Kroger store I worked at was fun and easy and quick pased. The second one i relocated to was just awful, everyone was rude and I was sexually harrassed constantly. I was given less hours than most people even though I had been there longer. Never again."
good,Starting out i loved my job. The atmosphere and friendliness of the employees was what i looked forward to everyday. I loved the regular customers who became family. What Kroger lacks is decent management who care about their employees. I believe that a manager should be a strong leader that helps push their employees to reach their full potential not someone who is always mixed into associate drama and is never pleasant to be around.
good,"I liked being a cashier because I could meet new faces and could be the end of the day smile to those who get to go home after grocery shopping and after a long day they could have had. I liked scanning items, was rather quick too. Time went by quick during shifts."
good,"Management was required to work very hard and cover multiple people's jobs. As people were lost through natural attrition, they were not replaced and no additional compensation was given."
good,"Feed the human spirit. "
good,"Clock in and check the bathrooms and trash cans round the store and front."
good,"Good for a first job, co-workers were friendly."
good,I worked for this company for almost 4 years. I started off making 9.50 and at the end of my employment had only gone up to $10.25. Not very good pay.
good,Every person is different and sometimes this is a good thing.  At store level most of the associates are amazing.  The leadership is a scattered and can be very cruel and confusing.  People are promoted not on merit and work ethic.  It’s complicated and exhausting.
good,"Working at Kroger is a good choice for someone looking for part-time work from an employer that will work with your schedule. While in college, it was very helpful to have a job that would work around my class times."
good,"Bagging clerks are treated terribly. Blazing sun and no water in the summer, plus freezing conditions in the winter with no company provided weather protection. Janitorial work was mandatory. All for minimum wage means it wasn't worth it."
good,"Employees sometimes would think they were managers when all they were was a customer serves representative and that can be frustrating, a lot of the employees were lazy so you would have to pick up there slack, and that could be frustrating at times but other than that it is an okay place to work at."
good,If given something to do you were fine for a while because you weren't bored and had busy work...other then that...you had to do everything yourself or literately nothing for hours.
good,"I worked my way through college here and it was a fine part-time position. Non-merit based pay, often poor upper management. "
good,"Very good people and great relationship. "
good,It use to be a great company to work for. But they have gotten away from a good work life balance. I’ve worked for them for 30 years and it has gotten progressively worse over the last 10 to 15 years.
good,"When I did work there, the manager threatened to fire me my second day because I wasn't sure what I should be doing. The day prior, I was trained to just do stuff in the back. I actually was working on the front end and I had no clue what was going on. This was years ago though, so he probably got fired or left. A lot of people complained about him."
good,The turn around rate is ridiculously high. It seems as though they are weeding out and letting go of all of their great managers and bringing in new management that only cares about the profit and not the people.
good,working for kroger for over 9 years was ok the team was good but the hours and the chances for growth were low i felt like i learend a lot about money management and customer service
good,scheduling is so unorganized always short staffed. rush hour is typically 4-7 so its always slammed. not enough baggers work throughout the day for lot to be clear and have begging assistance inside. we don't get a raise
good,"I was hired on as a manager for the fuel center, worked for a year without receiving  the two raises i was suppose to received. I loved my customers and my job, i just could go above and beyond the call of duty and not received my raises."
good,"This place was good for a few months, but then the management never responded to your asked time off for weeks to months, never answered calls, never have first warning"
good,Company is trying to make a change. What is needed is retrain store manager. To treat employees fairly . Making sure that there is Consequences to bullying in the workplace antagonizing Behavior
good,I joined Kroger as a part-time job with the promise of management and full-time advancement. After over a year and a half and many broken promises I decided to move on. Great job for teenagers. Bad job for any kind of career without being there 10+ years. And even then you don't make much.
good,"The working itself wasn't very bad, but the low pay, high hours, and unreasonable management is what caused me to leave. The store didn't seem to care about how happy we were, and only ran the store properly before an inspection."
good,"Front end manager is difficult to work with unless you are on of her ""favs"". Better communication to all levels."
good,"Give you 8 hours worth of work to do in 4 hours, then complain when you don't do anything ""extra"" beyond it. Good employees are treated terribly.  I basically run my department in the evening, and have major almost full time responsibilities as a part-timer.  No way to get a raise than through the union, which sucks.  For 6+ hours no matter how many hours more you work you, only get a 30 minute lunch break. One time I worked 12 hours with only a 30 minute lunch break it was terrible"
good,"Kroger is a stressful workplace managers sometimes being unprofessional, supervisor whines about everything, no holidays off, and the store is just a mess and over crowded"
good,Kroger has a lot of work to do in work life balance and good salaries to keep their employees.  There has been a lot of employees leaving in the last couple of years due to these reasons
good,"very dull, the only people who do anything are the openers and closers if your one or the other you have to work more than everyone else. the hardest part is the bizzie work they have you do for no reason and how harsh  management"
good,it was often where they would have the wrong work schedule up and you would think you had the weekend off but then you would find out you missed work and it wasnt your fault.
good,Great workplace for 15 of my 18 years..Company started rapid change that became chaotic..some of this can be related to overall industry changes that Kroger did not have a good plan for... Good Distribution..Good compensation in my area..Company serves many demographics with one master plan
good,At the location I worked at they had this manager that was no Frendly . She was very rude one of the employees cared for her . She made your job very uncomfortable.
good,"I worked at Kroger pharmacy for 5 months. My daily work was assisting pharmacists in filling prescriptions, Helping patients in person or on the phone by delivering a great quality patient care and excellent customer service, Counting and pouring pharmaceutical drugs, verifying medicine is correct, and checking for possible interactions."
good,"outdated technology,  a lot of learning opportunities,  uneven work spread,  very limited growth, very high stress environment,  great team,  good overall values."
good,"Hopefully Kroger is working on doing a better job in taking care of their employees."
good,On a regular day I would clock in get on a register. If I saw a customer that looked lost I would ask if they needed assistance. After assisting I would ring customers up and bag the groceries the way they wanted either in paper or plastic. When my day was finished I would clock out
good,krogers is a great place for students with crazy schedules and need flexability due to school. A lot of part time positions and room for advancement .
good,"Ever since recent leadership came in to our location, the company has considered their associates replaceable instead of valuable. This mentality is a challenge to work for daily."
good,"management did not really know how to manage and customers sucked, co-workers made it fun. They hardly paid you a livable wage or gave you enough hours to live"
good,"Horrible pay, unstable hours, and terrible upper management. Other than this, a great place to work. Loved picking and taking out the orders, which gave me some good customer service experience."
good,It could be better. No set schedules. Some people aren’t the best at the store I work at. Not the best pay could be better. Especially if people are trying to live off of it.
good,"about what you would expect from a retail position. lots of work, high demands and limited time. performance is expected to be 110% at all times. the pay is on time and fair for the duties and experience required."
good,"It was an ok  place to work, I met a lot of nice customers, some of them became really good friends. Enjoyed seeing them. I had good days and bad days, but you would get that any were, you work."
good,The managers above you are always nice and polite it’s just that the company and district manager is poor. I’ve got no hours because they cut our hours severely and sometimes management isn’t amazing
good,"The job requires standing on your feet, on cement, all day.  A lot of physical work,  lifting and stretching. There are not weekends or holidays off, if you get a lead position.  A lot of job burnout."
good,"For a beginner job it is ok, you cannot complain learning to budget paycheck and such in high school. But post high school this isn't a job you want to make a career out of."
good,"You can’t request weekends off if you haven’t been there for years, not even one day of the weekend. You have to work Saturday, and either morning or night Sunday (to accommodate church)."
good,good place to work unless you are good at your job. I tried to advance for quite a while. They kept hiring from outside the stores. I loved my coworkers though. Never a dull moment.
good,its a grocery store no limits on food choices for lunch. The company will drain the best employee. Boxers don't get beat up this much. when they do at least the money comps for the abuse.
good,"Kroger is a good place to work as a part time job. I do not recommend Kroger as a full time position. "
good,Unless you are able to work unlimited hours and unknown days you are not considered a valuable asset to the company.  Senior workers are considered less than valuable and are treated as less than valuable although they show up more than younger employees. Seniors have more health problems than younger people but are more reliable and should be shown their consideration.  Older citizens show on time more and stay at their jobs as required as needed.
good,"Unloading trucks and putting away product."
good,"Management can be hit and miss. You can have an excellent manager who is very helpful or you can have a manager who is the total opposite."
good,I did not like it cause i felt like  i was underpaid for what i was doing. the only good part in my opinion was that you got paid every week instead of every 2 weeks.
good,"I have worked retail for a long time so I understand your going to have bad managers from time to time. But Kroger is the only place ive worked where management doesn't know a thing about what they are doing. Not only are the incompetent, but they are rotated so quickly that there is no way to ever get accustomed to them. They also don't get held accountable for anything, which is typical. On top of that they break all sorts of rules and labor laws, but since I don't work for a union store theres not much I can do about it."
good,"The goals of this company are seemingly just out of reach and then you jump to reach it and they up the expectation without improving the circumstance. I loved working with the customers, but the fast pace can make connecting with people difficult. The hardest part for me, as a single mom was working an erratic schedule. Being scheduled for as little as 12 hours a week in the winter is also difficult."
good,Kroger was not the best working place for me. The pay was too low and the management was poor. I had to drive a hour to get to the job and to pay me $7 an hour was not good enough for me to be slaving for them.
good,"I personally loved my job in terms of what I was doing, however my primary supervisor was out to get me from day one and higher management and even corporate did nothing. "
good,"Started here as my first job thinking it was okay, but compared to other jobs it isn't great. The salary is the absolute minimum (which for a big company it should be able to afford more)."
good,It has a lot of management trainings to create a positive envelope for its employees. I see a lot of belittling  employees  not lifting them up. My biggest thing is respecting what your employees bring to the job.
good,"The work was difficult because working in a pharmacy there is a lot to learn and remember. It seems the pharmacy is always short staffed so there are a lot of 10+ hour days and it can become chaotic. The pay was pretty good for the job at hand and being paid weekly is nice. The customers can be difficult to work with, but the majority of management there help out as much as they can."
good,It is all good to work ther they take real good care of there employees bbut whne it comes to working it is verry stressful and not a lot of room for advancments in your feild
good,"I worked at a store where it was always super busy and crowded every day. It got really stressful since there are a lot of angry customers and always demanded something that could not really be done. The people I worked with were nice, although management wise, I was told that the scheduling was flexible but it was actually fixed and the manager who did the scheduling did not lower my hours even though I've asked her already and I was already taking so many college classes while working there."
good,"After working for Kroger for two years I wouldn't recommend it to anybody. While there I was very unhappy, felt like a number, nobody enjoyed working there however it was a paycheck at the end of the day."
good,I probably wouldn’t work here as a full time job. But it’s a good job for a temporary worker. A lot of the time it was busy so your days went by fast.
good,I worked as a Pharmacy Technician at Kroger for 3 years.  I enjoyed my time there and I learned a whole lot.  The people I worked with are great but that experience is varied from store to store.  Upper management does not support the work that we do however and often makes things more difficult to do our jobs and serve patients well.
good,Micromanagers will ruin your life if you let them. dont do anything to draw attention to yourself and you will fly under the radar as the typical kroger employee. slow and dumb.
good,"They don't pay well for the work they require, they don't really take the best care of their employees, and the company itself has a union that really feels like a joke."
good,"Kroger is a good place to work, the employees are like family, and you get paid each week. You get pay raises about every six months, and you start out at a decent rate."
good,I worked part-time. I bagged groceries and also cleaned bathroom and the floors. I like most of the people I worked with. Most people were nice. I would go back if I needed a part-time job again.
good,"Low pay, managers unfit for position, misdirection, can be easily injured, bad time off policy, strict sick policy, overworking, bad management, stressful environment"
good,"It's a great job for those that like being on the phone.   You need patience abs great customer service .  The job deals with customers that shipasy Kroger and sister stores that purchase items with checks,  cards that have issues with payments,  resolve issues with giftcards."
good,"Decent place to work but you get no benefits for 15 months. Compared to other retail pharmacies, it is less stressful and they do not have as many customer calls and added stuff for the techs to make."
good,Great benefits.  Poor treatment of employees by management.  Main focus of the company is the checkout area.  Other departments suffer because there is no equal support.  The perishable departments are expected to complete all tasks whether the employees are in there specific departments or not.  Meat/Seafood and Deli/Bakery do not have this particular problem because of contract restrictions.   The hardest part of this job is to be happy and serve customers because of the workload.  The most enjoyable part of the job is some of the customers and employees to interact with.
good,"I gained a lot of skills during my years at Kroger. Through poor management and good management, I was given the experience to distinguish between the two."
good,"It is so hard to advance! They only give you raises that are 15 cents every six months. I started at 8/hr and ended up with 8.45/hr, it would have been 8.60/hr if I had stayed longer. My reviews(which were arbitrary) were based on gossip because part timers never got to work day shift. Customers would complain and say they were going to Publix and literally everyone had the attitude of, ""good, i don't care"""
good,"The main manager I had to work with was extremely rude to people, not just the workers but also some customers. Became unbearable, could not handle it anymore."
good,E-Commerce is a hard working position.  As long as you have good people working with you the job is not that difficult.  If the store is stocked properly the job is not difficult.
good,"Decent work environment, okay management, quiet nights, nice coworkers, discount is not good, and okay training. Hardest part is working by yourself and a lot of lifting."
good,"management wants a fast and friendly checkout experience and at time that can be hard because of the number of items that customers are buying, It can be a bit stressful when management just sees your numbers and not the actual work you put in to make sure customers are leaving with a smile."
good,"Great first job to gain experience, typical day required loads of customer service. The co-workers are extremely friendly. The most enjoyable part was helping people have a pleasant shopping trip."
good,"They don't pay very well, definitely can not make a living out of it. There are your busy days and your slow days. Don't get me wrong its kinda fun till management gets up your butt"
good,"stable place to work"
good,"It was a fast paced job, had to make time on the orders or management would let you know. Very long hours, treated more like a number. Constantly moving."
good,The management is terrible at communication and has a really bad attitude whenever there is an issue presented to them. The environment is too aggressive and not very welcoming at all.
good,Working for the Kroger Pharmacy is not good for you if you have a personal life. They do not care about your personal issues and they change the rules every week. The leadership is very poor and do not fall for what they are selling you in the beginning because it is an act to get you to work for them even if it’s temporary. They’re always understaffed and don’t treat everyone equally.
good,Very demanding employer-Tries too hard to compete with other stores-Requires everything to be'perfect'despite not having resources to accomplish this.
good,I wouldn't work at Kroger again but I would definitely like to get back into retail. I feel I am being very productive with my time especially if I'm putting groceries up is if I'm in receiving.
good,"a typical work day come in find out if im cutting, meat sales floor, or smoked meat. break down the truck according to what i was doing that day. if i was cutter have full serve case up by 9am and cutting tool done also by 9am. if im sales floor start breaking down the meat truck and refilling the sales floor as i go. if im smoked meat i would break down the truck do lows holes and then write order, i would also do the red meat order if i was the only manager on duty"
good,Never receive a raise during the time working there.  Not consistent with working hours/days.  Management was not consistent with all employees and concerns were not addressed in a timely manner.
good,Would love to go further in the company. But it's very discouraging there cuz mini do not get to. I love working with the public. And enjoy most of my time there.
good,working at this company was the worst i have ever work for all from the cutler to the the job security.this is a good job for the high school boy or girl.  hands down not a job for you.
good,"I would sometimes get home at midnight and have to be back at 7am, It was a long drive from home. My home/work life balance was out of touch. By the time I had a day off I was so tired that I needed rest, rather than doing the things me and my family enjoy."
good,Kroger can be very demanding  and stressful at times but i handled it OK. You go home every day smelling like meat & cheese which is why every couple of days you need to wash the bottoms of your shoes or it may attract bugs.
good,I was a rehire for the company. I really liked my customers and coworkers. Its a great atmosphere when everything was running as it was supposed to for the day. The hardest part was the disorganization of the schedule and always being on call basically. The lack of communication. But your coworkers make it a bearable day.
good,"the job i have with kroger right now is okay i hate the management and the pay really sucks, i get paid $8 an hour and your work your butt off for such low pay."
good,"i worked there long ago and since, things have changed. the gm, mona was great, she helped get me to the bakery and i absolutely loved my job. i loved what i did and if i didnt have to move i probably never left. but the over all management is lacking"
good,Requires patience and people skills. Have to be able to lift weight and move things regularly. Hours can vary greatly and full time is rare. Personally only had 8 hours on a check one week and 32 on the next.
good,"I only got it because I needed a first job to understand the job market. It is okay for a teenager, which I was, who needed some pocket change. Did not enjoy my time too much but it was not too bad."
good,"After 18 years, I realized I would never advance to a higher career position and I desired more. It is difficult to raise a family with the schedule of a retail pharmacist esp. when you may be the only pharmacist on staff at the time."
good,A number of people constantly do not get paid for the hours they work. Krogers still owes me 40 hours. Due to the fact the managers would not follow through with adding it to the next pay period while laying off the hours they owed each week until it turned into 2 months.Hours that add up to 40 hours that they have still yet to pay me for. I worked too many hours for free there.
good,"Too much expected from employees. Not enough help. Good coworker relationships. Management seems bipolar, but they try to help us the best they can. Everyone is overworked and overwhelmed."
good,"No work/life balance. Nearly impossible to get days off, and management is terrible. Only consolation is you get paid fairly decent for the work that’s expected of you."
good,"I had to leave the Kroner company, because of the low payment per hour I was receiving. Then I moved on to Walmart and have been working there for almost two years now."
good,It’s a nice job that isn’t very stressful . Everyone shares the same interests and their isn’t a lot of drama . There are a lot of team activities that take place at smiths .
good,"This was my first job, It was pretty decent at first. But the longer I was their the more I regretted working with Kroger. The customers are great, but the management was down right bad. The other employees were okay, some of them pretty nice while others you just wanted to stay away from."
good,Kroger has great benefits but not great managers they hourly pay didnt equal up to the work they was providing an its very so often u was approve for a raise
good,"Good for people who are in school, but the pay isn't great at all. You get 7.25 an hour and that doesn't help with bills. The management wasn't great either. They don't seem to care about you much and think they're above you."
good,Fast paced and trying to get your job done while dealing with customers.  Learned self control and patience due to this.  Real laid back considering all of the part timers I worked with.
good,nice job easy task friendly staff management sometimes wasn't there for night people but other than that it was a decent job they worked with my school schedule
good,"This job I worked during the holidays, and everything was extremely fast paced. Bagging groceries, Pushing carts, cleaning bathrooms. It was extremely rewarding to be able to do so many things and be a valuable asset to the company."
good,"Great basic/start job for a high school graduate. Not for a person with experience. No advancement opportunities unless you're willing to accept company policies (some, no-sense)."
good,"While at times it is fast-paced and stressful, there are times where it is slow and relaxed. For my position (courtesy clerk), we did not receive raises, and advancing to a different position was very difficult. And the hours are very inconsistent."
good,"Started out as cashier. Love my customer, did not like the long standing and the 15 minute break after four hours. very flexible with hours. Understanding staff when personal situations came in conflict. Totally enjoy working in the fuel center."
good,Pay and benefits are good along with other perks. The job itself is entirely too stressful when it shouldn’t be. Micromanagement from upper management and constant added tasks to already busy work days make for a hard work/life balance.
good,"Highly comepetitive, poor work life balance, and hard to succeed. i could go on and on. I worked for them for 12 years and never received any loyalty from the company in turn."
good,It has been a great many years since I have worked in this business so its hard for me to give input. I do remember I worked here when I was still in high school and it was stressful for me.
good,"You are expected to work full time hours if required, but they keep you as a part-time employee. You must join a union to get any type of benefits. I found that the union was not a good representative for me when I needed them. I was taken off the schedule and not allowed to  return for 6 months, although the union did prove they had no right to take me off the schedule it took too long for me to survive without a job."
good,"The worst part of this particular job is the hours. I typically work 1st, 2nd, and 3rd shift all in the same week and I requested not to, but that's the role of a full-time employee. Fast-paced and plenty of work to be done. Management is pretty terrible at times. They move store managers around a lot so there isn't much consistency on rules and enforcement. Department managers don't have any say in write ups or disciplinary actions so employees tend to not follow standards and harass each other. Moral is often very low among full-time employees and a lot of people don't feel appreciated. All of this varies depending on what department and what store."
good,"working at Kroger wasn't bad, but I was about to be a senior and high school so I didn't want to have the added stress. Kroger also wasn't very flexible with the fact that I was in school. They wanted me to work all the time."
good,A typical day is very stressful when your trying to meet a deadline. It's fun if you like what your doing. Your constantly busy. I really don't know what else to say because for me I can't handle the store manager degrading me and making me feel like I'm nothing.
good,A typical day is practically the same over and over. You get 30 minute  lunches only when you work 8 hours. The schedule is always different. you don't always get the days that you want off and you can't change your availability with out a hassle
good,A typical day at work was dealing with customers and keeping the front-end cleaned. I learned how to bag groceries properly and the proper way to talk to customers. Management was poor and you never went to them with a problem because they would make it worse.The hardest part of the job was cleaning the bathrooms.
good,"Kroger is Kroger. If you are looking for an in between job or starting out job it's pretty okay but never stay in for the long haul-- at least not at this Kroger. If you find a nice store, Kroger and the Union will set you up for the rest of your life but this store was awful. Terrible schedules, understaffed with crazy demands, and keeps terrible workers around meaning good workers have to do their job plus the other people's job."
good,"Job was very boring, just running reports and reviewing"
good,"Some of the Managers are overbearing and at times micromanage. A typical day there can be stressful, especially around the holidays. The most enjoyable part of being employed at Kroger is the co-workers."
good,I was fighting cancer and was forced to quit.  Not all the managers were bad but they shuffle them around so much that there were never a normal time there at all.
good,"Kroger was very demanding fast paced , management quick to complain instead of helping. HARD  work on your feet all day. CUSTOMER are spoiled. Enjoy the free Friday download."
good,Management was difficult to work with. The other workers had a tendency for being unprofessional. This job is extremely stressful& has too much drama.
good,"set up for Deli dept. was very impressive and work friendly, however, the hoses for washing floors were not always working and when they repaired that area we no longer had hot water for cleaning dishes and utensils.. which meant you could not sterilize things, making  part of the job very unpleasant."
good,"Working at Kroger was nice, management was super nice to everyone and always willing to help with whatever they could. Although I didn't get very many hours, because I was still in high school, I still enjoyed working there."
good,"Helping customers check out with the items that they are purchasing, stocking the registers with tape and bags, cleaning the registers, placing misplaced items back in their places."
good,Sometimes it was quick paced other times it was slow the customers were very nice never had a problem. The pay was not enough for a mother with three kids.
good,I felt like I could be getting paid way more at any other store doing the same job. Some days were bad because the managers wouldn't do their job. One day I got sick on the way to work (throwing up out the window of my car). My manager wrote me up for calling out so close to my shift.
good,I felt that the job experience i had wasn’t satisfying . My pay wasn’t adequate my hours varied nothing was steady . Overall i just felt like Kroger wasn’t for me
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to connect with customers. You really get to build a friendship with certain people. Working with certain people could be fun too since you will most likely make friends.
good,"No advancement available, no raise available, part time only.  It was a nice place to work but the pay was absolutely terrible for pharmacy and you could only be part time no option to being full time available so you couldn't get insurance or take maternity leave."
good,"Hours were very inconsistent, most of the time I was able to work 10 hours a week because they would not give me more hours. Pay was below minimum wage at $7.10, management was not very friendly, did not have proper training either."
good,Most times was a good place to work. Too many employees coming and going...no one seemed to want to stay.The ppl are nice but alot wanted to do nothing but cause drama. More interested in the going and coming of some than doing the actual work needed to be done.
good,"I am a people person and really like my job at Kroger, But in a retail sitting there's always nights and weekends required and with working two jobs, working 6 days and nights is just becoming to much for me."
good,Working at Krogers has is ups and downs . They give you enough hours but the pay is not equal . They will give you 40 hours everyweek but make you still be considered part time which is $8.25/hr
good,"I just recently quit with Kroger after almost 4 loyal years. Started out as a great job then new management came in and ran it in the ground! I worked over almost every day for the my last year and NEVER got a thank you, looks good, you worked hard today...NOTHING! Always found something to criticize instead. Good job for a kid in high school trying to earn their gas money but you can't make a living there anymore. I worked 40+ hours a week and still was never offered ""full time."" They'll never get a recommendation from me."
good,"Turnover is exceptionally high for managers and co-managers for a good reason. The work is ridiculous, the hours are long, and customers can be terrible. The customers though are the least of your concern. It's management that will get to you."
good,Might be good to start your employment history here but not a career. Management is poor. Pay is mediocre at best. You will not be appreciated. Stressful environment with no chance for relief.
good,"Typical day is a store walk format, reviewing the needs of the departments and the customers. That's what you're told to do daily, give direction and follow up. However, the truth is that your night crew won't show up, you're people are underpaid and not well trained (though most are truly awesome people who just need more help) you'll never have more help than you need, you'll always be under the gun. Follow up with the business units is brutal, the hours are terrible, there is always a plane with someone that you'll never meet coming to your area. Your days off will be cancelled, no weekends, almost all nights, even mid shifts are late in to the evening, as in you'll be home around 9 or ten. Overall, it's a decent job, but like most retail the hours are brutal, you'll be understaffed and the reality versus what corporate thinks is happening is one a different level. Promotions are about who sees you and when they see you. You must be willing to relocate to advance your career."
good,"Worked for the company for many years, and the company is a union so you cap out on your salary with no options to move up. Management has favorites and you will know if you are one of them."
good,While working with this company you learn the necessary skills to advance to another level in preparation for whatever career you plan to have in the near future. This company needs serious reform when it comes to how they treat their employees.
good,"Its a okay job but"
good,I always worked hard everyday every hour but i never recieved any recognition for my hard work. Which made me and all the other teen courtesy clercks feel like we weren't being treated fairly like the cashiers which is why we all ended up quiting.
good,"Busy, fast pace. Need to work everyone, management isn't always great. Hardest part abut it is not getting stressed out. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to have a break when your super busy."
good,"Kroger is a great place to work if you are a teenager in high school or retired. It will not pay your bills in full, you will hardly if ever get a pay raise, and the management staff are almost always unable to agree on subjects and work together. The managers also let customers belittle, talk down to, and even yell and curse at you for something as simple as their coupon being expired. They don't seem to care about their employees well-being, just how their numbers look on paper."
good,I made a lot of memories and friends here. I wouldn't go back to a position like this after I've already been there but it's good inf you're in High School.
good,"Constantly busy in miserable weather conditions. Not enough hours to survive and not much appreciation for the work involved. Hard to keep a manager in this department as well as good employees who are willing to stay or perform required work duties.  On the other hand, benefits were okay as well as the profit sharing, etc."
good,"Good for a fist job"
good,Very stressful and you miss quite a few family functions. The hours are terrible and you are micro managed at the store level. your entire day is planned for you before you ever get there.
good,"Its a good company, the days are very stressful because they are short of help, I have been there so long and I am ready for something new but working there has taught me so much."
good,"I only worked this job part time. I worked weekends mainly. I worked with a bunch of kids so thats why i left. The managers was hardy ever there, front end management was bad. I really like working at kroger but i just couldnt take the kids playing while im working."
good,"Very stressful from upper management. Lots of unneeded stress for such little pay. High expectations for such little pay. Loved my manager, not the higher management (i.e., Regional, VP, etc)."
good,I worked third shift. It was a very interesting job. Not a lot of Managers were around on my shift. The customers were interesting because night time customers were unique.
good,As a deli clerk it's important to meet your coustomer's request at a even pace.  Around holidays is the most intense pacE you need to move fast at the sametime remaine safe in the kitchen.
good,"Many checklist that are required from upper management, that take away from the real work that needs to be done.  They are very strong for customer service, but don't let you concentrate on that."
good,Always started behind as soon as you walk in because of management not following closing guidelines. Management was terrible and they really knew how to make great employees walk away.
good,I loved working with the customers and learning good sales techniques from the other employees however even though we did take turns with who would sale to what customers coming in sometimes the other employees would get upset if you did much better than they did we all worked together customers were our only priority
good,I was hired for a position and because the location no longer had a photo lab I got paid far less than other managers in my position.  I was forced to work on the remodel as well.
good,"It's a great place to work, but the management and supervisors are constantly changes, no consistent rules... most of the time I just kept to myself cause I was too scared to get in trouble."
good,There isnt really anything extrodinary about working at dillons it is failry stock as far as options go but they hire alot of people great first time job or something to get by. little chance for advancment and very inconsistant work schedule is troubling for long term employees though.
good,"Overall, you can get better work. A typical day at my store is busy, with only one 15 minute break for a six hour span. The management doesn't care about the employees. I know many people that have noticed that they weren't payed for a shift or two. You only find out once you are paid, and at that point it's already too late. The best part of the job would be if you made friends at the job. I worked there for a year, and I regret not looking elsewhere. I've heard even most grocery stores have better opportunities than Kroger."
good,"typical day is busy, and i learned out to call for price checks, bag a certain way,  Management is no good, everyone dont know anything when asked a simple question, they change the managers alot ."
good,I haven't worked there in about 8 years maybe more but I didn't like it when I started. made me push carts in the snow and everything. but you can easily move up in the company if you put in the effort
good,"If you don't mind constant schedule changes without notice and have no life. Coworkers are usually awesome, management is super good at giving you the run around and not solving your problems. The customers are usually great."
good,"The company does not do well with the initial development, planning and executing of new programs. Limited diversity when it comes to  management and upper level management, many women which is great but cultural diversity at those levels is terrible. Company is always attempting to be innovative but always seems to be late with transitions and does not lead the way. Work life balance is nonexistent and in this competitive retail market that aspect is in continual decline."
good,"I learned how to bag the groceries after they were checked out and return left over items back to the shelf. I also gathered up the grocery carts and returned them back to the store. At first it was a pretty good place to work but there was a lot of drama and they did not work very well with my school schedule my senior year. If you are not in school, then I would say it's a good place to work."
good,"I think Kroger's is an okay place to work. At my store, I have been able to do a variety of things which is great. A thank you every so often would be nice. I would like to be able to advance within the company and even though the announcement overhead always states ""Career opportunities are available"" I have yet to see it."
good,"I liked working in Kroger bakery and deli, but its a very hard job getting up at 4am to go to work and working hard then getting ""coached"" for working too many hours, when theres no way to do it all in 8 hours."
good,"Working for Fry's was a good experience in that I really got to enhance my skills in customer service, cashiering, communication, and more. But the environment is very toxic with a lot of gossip, and as a cashier I didn't get a lot of breaks. They expected me to wait it out and didn't care if I needed to eat, use the restroom or just take a moment. I do miss the bonus checks and guaranteed lots of hours, but for me it wasn't worth not having a life and not getting to use the bathroom or eat food. They're not flexible about schedules either. They promise advancement but do not always give it (favoritism?). Lots of empty promises."
good,Working at Kroger in the Meat Department was a good experience for me. It helped introduce me into a working environment. It is definitely a good job to start out doing while you are young.
good,"Fred Meyer is a typical retail job, with all the usual (and unusual) pitfalls that come with the territory. The union takes good care of associates, but the management does not."
good,my first job I was in the 10th grade and love to go to work responsibility were ringing up customers items and bagging the item for them  good start off.
good,a typical day at work was like a good moving paste day mostly no drama and everyone was in a pretty good mood everyone did there job most of the time.
good,"I don't know if they are all like this but the few that I worked at and had friends work at weren't great places to work. You couldn't get benefits unless you worked full time and they almost never made anyone full time. Someone told me it took them 6 years to be full time. The managers don't communicate and they've been replacing good managers with strict don't care about the employees managers, everything is whats best for the store, nevermind you're working a lot of employees 50 hrs or more, when they are supposed to be part time and none of the benefits."
good,this job is what it is. mainly labor and you will be just a number if you work in a place this huge especially at the ground level. great for a kid but not an adult with the new contracts that employees need to sign.
good,I worked for Kroger for about 4 years and didnt mind working there for those 4 years.It was frustrating for me  to work because there was always on me wanting me to work faster than i should.Working the frozen aisle was verry  hard for me because i didnt have time to  finish  on time.
good,Kroger provides the opportunity for younger teenagers or college students to work and have an income because they work very well around school schedules.
good,The company over all has good intentions. There is  opportunity to learn and grow. Management is a coin toss there are a few  good ones mixed with the bad. As a new employee it is almost impossible to make a living (not alot of hours offered and starting at minimum wage) Another down side is wage cap for hourly employees they only way to by pass this is to advance with the company which leaves you with little to no work/home life balance.
good,"Worked as a hot foods clerk. It was a lot of work because they were usually under staffed. Unfortunately saw a lot of work put on some employees, while others did not have to do the same workload. Co-workers great to work with. Can not advance in the company or get a raise unless you do computer training and move up to the next level as full time."
good,In the end my managers were very micromanaging. The constant changing of managers creates constant power changes and constant changing policies which causes a decrease in morale and willingness to improve.
good,"Very demanding job. Sometimes stressful due to the extreme workload. Work life balance is a struggle, but good pay and great advancement opportunities."
good,"Team oriented , everyone always eager to assist you and answer any questions needed. very fast paced especially during holidays . management was always kind"
good,"The pros at working at kroger is some of the employees,the simple discounts ,and the experience.There are too many cons to list but the start of it is uncaring managers ,low pay , and stressful environment."
good,Started out as a really enjoyable job with lots of new things to learn since it was my first employment opportunity. But over the years the management slowly declined into something that I was unable to stand.
good,The store is okay all the of the vegetables and fruits be nicely presented and everything looks very fresh and everything is very neat in the store. I love working at Kroger's because it was basically dealing with people and food and i love greeting others and helping them if they need it. I also love baking cookie and slicing meat and cheese for them.
good,"There are multiple different departments in Kroger: Front End (cashiers/baggers), Produce, Floral, Deli/Bakery, Meat/Seafood, Dairy, etc."
good,"working with kroger as a first job isn't a bad deal it just is not  something you'd want to make a career of  with current contracts being as they are."
good,this job was unbelievable . not enough work hours not enough pay. it is a good company but they'll have to pay more for all the work they want and there were far to many teenagers working there the adults couldn't get their hours in
good,"work experience overall was not the best, always expected more and more from the employees with no motivational factors such as more pay or overtime, job culture and atmosphere was overall poor, most people hated being on the job"
good,I like working at Kroger. Good people to work with. God the most part there is a good team atmosphere. Although hard to advance in the company.  Work a lot of weekends so it's not about your family
good,"A typical day at Kroger as a courtesy clerk involves tedious work. The employee has to maintain the cleanliness of the store while greeting and assisting customers, bagging groceries, and restocking items. The managers are very professional and strict. Meanwhile the supervisors are not as professional as need be. The store is always busy. It requires a lot of stamina and determination."
good,"for the associate position i was assigned "
good,Pic n save is a nice place to work ....but i want more hours and benefits ....cannot make a living at this place need something more to go with it.i love the customers and my fellow associates .they are all very sweet
good,"Working as a cashier in Kroger is very stressing when you first begin. There is a ton of training, and the hours are terrible. It's sort of a 'you work when we need you even if you aren't scheduled to work that day and if you cant work that day you're in trouble' type of thing. "
good,Good place to work if interested in accounting positions. Basically that's it. Management team consisted of young managers with no management experience or people skills
good,If you want a side job that pays every week with flexible hours; this is the job. They pay the bare minimum. You get discounts on items that is sold in store.
good,Kroger says one thing but wants you to do something else. Not a fun or exciting work environment. No one in the company(Dallas division seems to know what is going on from day to day
good,Not very much room for advancement but I love the store they carry great things and most people are super friendly and nice to each other. Management does their best.
good,"Well your a cashier at a grocery store so what do you expect. The management does work with you when you need them to though as long as you tell them in advance, good job for highs schoolers or in between job. Its just my opinion."
good,My two managers were awesome guys. They made the day fun with the joking. Though they were still serious and wanted the job done correctly. I enjoyed working with them.
good,Kroger had its pros and cons.  The pros was that it taught you how to interact with others and to learn good customer service for future jobs. They also provided a lot of work hours. The cons of this job was that the management was quite unorganized.
good,"My time at Krogers was moderately pleasant, yet hellish thanks to the poorly trained, and bureaucratic management. They will punish you just take make a point to their superiors and to make themselves look better to their peers."
good,"The hardest part of the job is working in the front end areas there isn't a team. Examples we have to wait for the others worker to come back from their break which is twenty minutes instead fifteen minutes. "
good,"I love the people I work with, but the pay is left to be desired. Along with the benefits. You must work there for a minimum of 18 months before receiving any heath coverage for yourself, let alone your family. Also, if you transfer departments, be sure to know in advance if you will be keeping your current pay, increasing or decrease."
good,"A typical work day: running morning reports, Time and Attendance, payroll, recruiting, processing new hires, scheduling new hire training, interviews, following up on recruits to schedule for onboarding, job changes. The most enjoyable part is working with the employees."
good,"This is a great first time job however, the hours are retail so you work almost every weekend. They don't pay you well at all. I work there for 5 years and made a dollar more an hour than what I started at."
good,You have to be careful they are a ok company benefits are ok pay should be more for such a large company the management can also learn to work better the employees should never feel out of place
good,"Working at Kroger was a great learning experience for me. I learned how to handle customers, handle money, have patience with customers who had a lot of groceries or was getting their wic. The management wasn't all that great during my time with Kroger. Overall the work environment was tolerable. I don't think there was anything hard about that job but the most enjoyable thing was getting paid every week and working with an amazing crew."
good,"A typical day at work would be coming in, clocking in and dread coming to work. The management was terrible. The work days were long and terrible and the coworkers were very rude and disrespectful."
good,"Overall it's a fun environment to work in, you can learn a lot just about the company itself.  Morning shifts are more demanding than the night shift so you have to come with your A game to get multiple things set at a certain time in the store. Night shift can get busy but it's usually more relaxed than mornings."
good,I enjoyed my position with Kroger (although underpaid) until management changed most recently. There are managers that are great and others not so much... (You'll have that anywhere). Some issues have been swept under the rug and others disregarded completely.
good,fast at the beginning very slow towards the end of my shift and that is if i had hours to work the is long stretches where i haven been scheduled  at all
good,"The job is hectic and isn't easy to perform, large loads of orders you have to pick and the nights are long. The job will destroy your personal time/family life."
good,"Easy and convenient enough for a school student, but that's about all that makes this job acceptable. Immediate managers complain when time is needed for school and there wasn't really anyone to replace me. Most of the other employees are terrible to work with."
good,Kroger was a subpar company to work for. I spent all of my time cleaning up my coworkers messes before I could even start my daily list of things that I had to get done.
good,"Plenty of hrs. available, so much so that you have no life outside of work. They over work you and don't care about your personal life. Almost all ways make holidays mandatory and weekends a lot. Most of the people that work there are cool but some are terrible. They put restrictions on when you can use your personal days and vacation time (around the holidays). Good job security though and they pay better than they used to."
good,Over whelmed work place did not get off shift on time because to much work flow. Plus the lack of help and a lot of equipment failed or did not work..
good,"Benefits:"
good,A typical day at work starts off unloading the trucks for stocking and begin working on stock. I've learned how to stock shelves professionally and time management. Culture isn't a problem which a great thing. The hardest part is trying to stock half the store before my shift ends. There's not really anything I personally enjoy about Kroger.
good,"The store I worked in was steadily busy but manageable. The company seemed to always be updating the system with new features to help us do our jobs more efficiently. I rarely saw the district manager or upper management in general. Compared to other pharmacies I have worked in, this one was fairly relaxed while maintaining a focus on accuracy. My pharmacy manager was passive in dealing with issues between co-workers which sometimes created tension in the pharmacy. They pay wasn't great but it wasn't a bad place to work. Your experience with the company will likely depend heavily on which store you work in."
good,"I was hired into the meat department and was taught the basics such as, serving customers, and what area our department covered. I was never given any real proper training. I was also expected to clean everyones mess after they used dishes and threw paper and gloves on the floor. The best part is some of them even felt I was lazy and of course the pay."
good,Management is shifty and hours compounded constantly. Only good thing is benefits. Can't juggle much with the job hours unless you barely work.
good,"Overall this is a place you go for a first job, but somehow you get stuck and can't work your way out. But it says a lot when the customers' bad attitudes are the highlight of the day"
good,"My typical day working in the deli, i was usually a closer which meant the first half of my shift was customer service and the second half was mainly cleaning. Handling customers requests in a timely manor, occasionally cooking the chicken for the day which included following a tight schedule to put everything out when needed, checking food temperatures, and cleaning up the fryers and ovens."
good,Good job for a college student. Manager worked around classes. Management was good and always kept environment/ atmosphere clean. Manager trained associates everything needed for the job. Had its days of being slow and busy.
good,"I liked my job, but didn't like my location. The people were always rude and my store was so unorganized. I believe its getting ready to close down in the next two years because its not very successful."
good,This job comes with a lot of heavy lifting and standing. If you do not mind standing 10 hours or more on concrete floors and working short staffed go for it.
good,"Everyday at work I either had to cut and wrap cheese to put out on the island that cheese shop had or I cut sandwich meats for customers. "
good,"Pay is pathetic. I asked to move to a dep where most of my experience is in,to get a higher pay because they pay you by experience, the mngr first told me he doesnt have any openings but then hired 2 new people for that dept. "
good,"Would never work here again, management was awful and the job itself was horrendous for minimum wage. Pretty much just an entry job for high schoolers."
good,Workforce culture endured high turnover ration on both salaried and hourly levels. Typical day consist of monitoring employee output during off-shift operation.  Learn processes of producing ice cream and soda.
good,"I loved working for Krogers when I first started. In my eyes once they got rid of the managers that was there after I started and brought in the new ones, they didn't care about the employees. They was more concerned for themselves and trying to get rid of people. There is people that have been there 10+ years and I leaving or transferring to different stores because of the managers there now. The union is also a joke, we pay so much a pay check and once something happens the union rep doesn't want to help. I was there for over a year and the union rep told me ""there was nothing he can do and it was all up to the managment"". So whats the point of having a union."
good,"once you reach seniority your department manager mostly will give you the minimum hours you need, or days off. they do play favorites though so it depends who your managers are and how they treat you to begin with. and your store manager can change that without even talking to you."
good,not an bad place to work for just no major advancements. not an hard job. they create an excellent environment to work in.
good,"Almost impossible to advance if you do not have store experience"
good,I was a supervisor and I hated the long hours with little pay. I would be a better job if they paid more or didn't treat their employees like children instead of adults
good,My job had me working till 11pm on school days and when i try to change it i couldnt. I love to come to work but in my life i just cant sometimes
good,My experience at Kroger was horrible. The managers didn't care for the employers very much and there was always a problem. The managers talk to employers any kind of way and wasn't very understanding.
good,"I cashier for Krogers, I learn how to do the old computer, they where okay besides one of them,I like working with my co workers they where very nice, there was nothing hard about my job, working with one of my front in manager"
good,Great place to work at if you need to get by. Not a lot of money live off of but enough to get by. It is nice to interact with the customers to enlighten your day.
good,"Everyone works together as a friendly team. Putting out fresh produce, hot food. All kind of seafood, fresh cut meet. "
good,"cashed out a lot of people had fun meeting different people, lots of different hours never the same shift, coworkers were good to work with, customer were great."
good,"the best thing I learned is time management. How to schedule your allotted time when cooking. what needs to get done first, last."
good,That was probably the worst job I ever worked. It was hard enough that I was young and had no experience but when they made me push carts in 104° weather I almost died.
good,"A typical day involves working with daily, weekly, and yearly reports. Significant interaction with the public. Opportunities to make change and innovate are very limited."
good,This Company is union and does not pay very well. I do not suggest the Pekin Kroger to anyone trying to feed a family. It was not all bad I had an amazing front end manager as well as amazing co-workers.
good,"blue collar job, which pays really well  but not much room for advancement (UNION JOBS). They want me to write more but I am going to go ahead and decline that offer."
good,My review of Kroger is this is a nice job to have if you are just getting into the workforce. Great if you want to get customer service experience.
good,I think Kroger is a great for a first job. I wouldn't try to start a career with the company because i personally think that they don't pay enough for all the things that the employees put up with.
good,"There are a lot of problems with this company, however it can be a good place to start out at. Pay is not the greatest and most of the workers are high school aged kids who do not always care about getting their job done."
good,"The work itself is not too hard, it is more mentally stressful than physical. The people there are great once you've worked with them for a while."
good,"fast paced work environment, stress due to demanding customers. Not much opportunity to advance unless you pester management or store supervisors. Management is the best at the direct manager level; the store management could use a lot of work. My co-workers ranged from very helpful and nice to people who were just out for themselves and would step on anyone to serve themselves. The hardest part of my job was not getting the recognition I deserved for all of my hard work, especially around major holidays that were important to the floral department. Yet the most enjoyable part of my job was the people I worked with and sometimes the customers."
good,"It's Kroger. It can occasionally be a good place to work. Management at this store could be worked on. Co-workers are fun and easy to work with, but management makes work not very enjoyable."
good,"work life balance is zero to non, always on the go. expected to do way above the limit with little or no help to get you to that expected goal"
good,"good place if your in highschool and dont have anything to pay for . some of the management is fine while others pick favorites,"
good,"Kroger is a decent place to work. If you love working with people, then this is an ok job. The one good thing is that it is a union job."
good,I'm not too happy on how they treat people.  I'm not happy how they do their disciplinary actions when u approach them with a complaint. Some people act like the place is a joke witch in some departments they do..
good,"Everyone in my hometown has come to know Mariano's and most people would agree that it's a nice store, the food is fresh, the employees are wonderful and everything blends together to create a magnificent shopping experience. However, many employees would say that the management staff isn't exactly great at leading a nearly 500 strong work force. Most people had scheduling disputes or there was almost always someone complaining about the then store director. Overall, great place to shop, not the greatest place to work."
good,Its an easy place to work and they usually work with your schedule. The only problem is trying to get hours and the pay is not as competitive as other positions in the same store.
good,Management makes sure people always looking their shoulders.  Not a friendly environment to work in.  Mgmt suspects everyone of pilfering.
good,"it was an okay place to work, but should pay more then what they do. Bids for a work schedule is done every 6 months which you could be working nights or days. you rarely got two days off in a row and everyone shared trucks. there were no assigned trucks"
good,"I would meet a lot of people, ring people out, give out money orders, perform cash transfers and bill pays. i would have two 15 minute breaks- no lunch and usually stand for the rest of the time. Working fuel is different. I sit down most of the time and it is pretty slow on customers since most people are paying at the pump now"
good,"Work in the store is stressful, management is bias and rude to employees. The Fuel Station was much more freeing allowing me to do my job as efficiently as possible without someone looking over my shoulder criticizing me rather than help our customers. The only down side to the fuel station was claustrophobia."
good,I like working in the Starbucks kiosk but the store as a whole was pretty unpleasant. The hours were crazy for a student and the pay wasnt enough for all that we had to do. Plus the managers were subpar to say the least.
good,"A typical day at Kroger was me get carts, bagging grocery, and clean up. It was my first job so I learn to just work hard and come to work on time do what management ask. I didn't really like management. The co-worker worked hard and helped when needed. The hardest part of the job was get the carts. The store was so busy I would be out there by myself get all the carts. I mostly enjoyed the co-workers and the customer, it was a good learning experience."
good,"On a typical day of work I would go in and put my gear on and say hi to everyone. I would work either in the deli or bakery that day and my manager would let me know where she wanted me to work. My co-workers were nice and helpful, the only hard part of the job was lifting super heavy boxes. The most enjoyable part was decorating the cakes and cupcakes on the days I  got to work in the bakery."
good,"Management was uncoordinated and often gave conflicting instructions on what to do and how to do it."
good,"Typically I come in and assess how the promotion tables, other tables and the wet wall where all the produce that needs to be under temp control are doing and go from there unless I come in early in the morning and I have to cull rotate the wet wall. They drill into how important it is to cull and rotate so I follow it religiously while filling up the tables that are in need. There's always something to do like down stacking pallets that come in on the truck and sweeping cleaning the floor. Not a hard to job by any means, has the usual workers that take there sweet time working and going and hiding. Talking to the customers is the funnest part of thew job."
good,"A lot of people have trouble getting enough hours or pay. Management wouldn't give higher pay to higher ranking jobs. Other than that, it's a really nice place to work."
good,"Ralph's was a little chaotic. I've never worked grocery before, or after that."
good,"Kroger is one of the more decent grocery stores to be employed with. It is very busy, but it is not as busy as a wal-mart or some of the more popular retail stores. In my time there I have seen some employees move up to manager positions, but it is something that you have to really work hard for and mention to them. They probably won't offer it to you without you mentioning it. Management is good in some stores but not in all. It really depends on your location. The deli requires a lot of work, and many people shy away from it. It can be overwhelming at times, but that depends on management. In general research the store's management team, because they are a direct reflection on your experience working at that particular store."
good,"Working for Kroger has taught me a lot of things, but I was not getting paid enough for the amount of work required, leveling up to positions with pay raises take way to long to acquire."
good,"This jobs suits those who are in their elderly years or who are in high school."
good,"processing high volume of invoices"
good,"I loved working at Kroger at first, I looked forward to my shifts there. I loved the people I was working with and I loved that I worked in the coffee shop. But after working there I began to realize its all about the drama and getting in with the supervisors. I never played into the drama and that is why they never seemed to like me. One time I missed work and the supervisor said if I missed one more day they would fire me. Empty threats and drama is all they are there if your there for more than six months."
good,i felt like they cont every mistake and made the smallest of thing a big issues and management didn't care if i ask for help couldn't stand it
good,"Is a Union without union benefits, low pay and generally low hours or high hours with little help. Hard to receive full time, but will sometimes be a part-timer with full time hours so they can save on pay and benefits."
good,"Management does not back you, or help you. they depend solely on YOU to do the majority of the work when you're shorthanded.... for example.."
good,"I have worked for the company for over 13 years, starting as a stock person. There is not much room for advancement. They are not family friendly. I have three children and they still schedule me for late night shifts despite my seniority."
good,"Kroger is a good job for students. You'll have plenty of time to yourself and the job itself is very easy. The employee discount is good as well. The bad part is management. The management at Kroger is quite literally the worst I have ever had. They are obnoxious, unprofessional, racist, lazy, and snobbish."
good,good place to work for people who just needs pocket money but not for someone who wants to save up. they give out only part time hours to new employees
good,"Opening pharmacy, greeting customers, answering customer questions, and phone calls, taking new prescription hard copies and inputting these in the pharmacy computer, filling (counting prescriptions) "
good,Working for Picksave's environment was very friendly. I liked working with the co-workers and customers. However Picknsave did not provide any advancement opportunities or benefits.
good,Love the customer always come in to talk to you and always remember your name. Even on when you have a rough day the customer always make it better. I had a couple manager I love working and was will to work with you too.
good,"Previewed Engineering prints and prepared them for the shop."
good,"Have worked at Kroger for 3 years. it has been a good place to work, interested in making more. Advancing not always possible."
good,Would stand in a freezer for about 8 or 9 hours with two 15 minute breaks. Not a fun place to work. People in management were friendly at first. But then weren't friendly when I started working there.
good,"Often more times than not, you will do a good job and not be praised. Many of the management crews don't work well together."
good,Loading and unloading department products.  Provide customer service with product knowledge.  The hardest part of the job was getting all tasks done within a shift.  The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with customers.
good,"great caring coworkers at my job, most of the customers are friendly and some are not but thats everywhere. Management isnt that good atleast my opinion, I tried transfering departments and stores and they dont help with your wishes. Theres nothing really hard about the job but it is stressful if were short staffed on the scheduale. Like being the only closer and trying to get everything done by the end of your shift. I enjoy being with my coworkers and the customers and knowing i am doing my best and getting my work done."
good,"Kroger Green Hills is a very upscale grocery store in Green Hills, a flourishing area in Nashville, Tennessee. Over all the store is well kept and managed. Green Hills has the best meat department in Nashville."
good,"A typical day at work was in the nicest way, complete chaos. The Management at my store was completely clueless about everything, they didn't know how to operate any of the registers, self checkout, front desk or even the gas station. The people I worked with always had an attitude and would cuss at each other in front of customers and never think anything of it. By far one of the worst jobs I've ever had. The only good part was being able to make some of the customers smile after they've had a rough experience with other employees."
good,It was a good place to work. They offer advancement within the company. The had a great management team. Great work environment.
good,"Very demanding place beyond limits. Nothing was ever enough, and instead of focusing on positives, corporate always made sure to point out only negatives."
good,"My typical day at work is normally easy, but stressful, which is the hardest part of my job. There are a lot of demands put on you and a very little amount of time to complete tasks in order to keep everyone happy. I've learned a lot of patience and how to keep my cool in tough situations by working for Kroger. The management is normally pretty understanding, but in my year of being with the company there has been 6 different managers. My co-workers are some of my best friends and it's fun to work with people I enjoy, that's probably the most enjoyable part of working for Turkey Hill."
good,"This ia a good job as part-time only. The day goes by fast due to all the customers. This job is fast paced and you are required to play many roles,"
good,its a wonderful store as far as the employee go and the enviroment of the store but thge management was very unorganized alot of employees not working to potential and no repremant for any of it
good,"Good first job. Hard work for a simple cashier job. Supervisors are very strict. Money handling is very important. Some customers are rude, but management handles them well. They try to resolve any issues you report."
good,"There is never a day that goes by at ruler that you are ever appreciated. The more you do the more you are expected to do. A bigger turn around and never enough employees to do the job. The safety of the job is bad when it comes to good work techniques. Many employees have injured they're backs and then you are not useful to them any more. They make you feel bad when you ask for you're breaks. The cashiers are overworked and sometimes you have no help. This is bad the first  of the month. They never schedule enough workers and managers are scolded by big managers if they schedule too many employees. Sometimes only one cashier and one person to condition store at night. If someone calls in they won't schedule another employee. We have too many shift managers, one manager and 1 asst. manager. I know of 2 that actually does they're job. Everyone wants to be a boss! Sometimes it's embarrassing to say I work there. Low hours and bad attitudes most of the time but a few very nice people to work with. No one stays long.  I've been there almost a year and I really don't know how much longer I'll be there. I've seen 3 managers since I've been working there."
good,"Kroger was in okay place to work, i was a front end supervisor, Management was no willing to work with you to make thing better. The cashiers that i was over where great to work with."
good,typical day clock in then bag groceries or stock and clean. I didn't learn much other then eggs don't go on bottom. co-worker looked bored or distracted. fun part was the customers.
good,"A typical day at the salad bar is almost always busy. There is rarely a moment when there is nothing to do. You have to be able to manage your time well and also move at a pretty fast pace while being cautious. Management, depending on who you are dealing with, is okay. The hardest part of the day is when it' the busiest hours of the day, 3pm-7pm. The most enjoyable part of the job is cutting up fruit."
good,"I prepared sandwiches and other foods. I weighed meats, cheeses, salads and put labels of weight and price on packages."
good,"A typical day at Kroger is me showing up five minutes early to clock in and relieve a fellow coworker, I greet each customer with a smile and scan their groceries in a quick but efficient manner. I learned how to interact with the general public and how to problem solve when I was faced with more than a couple tasks at once. Management was not friendly whatsoever, despite how hard I worked for them they constantly badgered me and I felt very unappreciated. My coworkers were the complete opposite, I made many friends there, and keep in touch with most of them still today. The hardest part of the job was dealing with management, as I stated before I worked very hard for them and never fully felt appreciated. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people in my surrounding area."
good,it was a good job overall. The managers are ok they don't actually check on you the are like the work of mouth type.Hardest part of the job is cleaning and working handling customers at the same time.
good,"I was promoted quickly to a management position. Once there, however, there was constant explaining and playing the blame game. Nobody could own up to their mistakes and would deflect it onto coworkers. Management was terrible and gave goals with little resources to accomplish them in unrealistic situations. I was written up for dumb reasons and even had to go to the union to resolve some issues(the union rope-in happened to be a plus in my situation). Promotions can happen fast, but it is partly due to playing a game and being at the right store with the right people. I was transferred after being promoted and hit a brick wall because I didn't see eye to eye with the store manager (he was a goon). It's basically cronyism with exceptions. Met the CEO. Nice person who genuinely cares. Unfortunately that doesn't always translate down the line to the lower, non corporate, areas."
good,"Could not get hours, needed full-time work. Seniority based so you have to work there for years before they will give you full-time hours."
good,"Daily life at Kroger is always challenging. Always a new challenge and nothing is ever the same late deliveries, call offs and normal customer wants and needs."
good,I am not particularly happy with the way I was treated.  I am really being pushed out of a job.
good,"Has terrible management skills"
good,You work like a slave to get paid minimum wage and treated poorly
good,Decent starting job. Not easy to move up in the ranks. A lot of favoritism and petty gossip.
good,"Very repetitive, fast paced, never-ending work. As an assistant store manager you are basically a baby-sitter. Your job is to go around to all the departments and listen to them complain about why their job sucks that day, or how it is someone else's fault that it does. Very little actual work is done, you might bag some groceries with a fake smile, you might push some carts inside, you might just sit and pick apart subordinates work all day long."
good,Management is overall ok but when it comes to information being spread it is only spread to certain departments. The most enjoyable part of the job is the awesome customers that I deal with every day. The hardest part of this job is dealing with rude coworkers and horrible assistant managers. I have learned that you have to be open minded about everyone and everything that you come in contact with. A normal day for a deli clerk is to put your hair net on and help the first available customer as well as doing a long list of different jobs added in with waiting the counter and doing usual cleaning. This job is also horrible due to you are not certified a break even when you work 8 hours and are wore out.
good,Just like any other retail store you're going to have your ups and downs.  Some days I would have a great time and at others not so much.  Management was not very helpful more than half the time and not very swift in helping to solve problems.  The best part of this job is the people you work with and as you get  to know them you begin to work like a family.
good,Fast paced....hard work...Company promises to promote within the company and takes a long time to get promoted...have to fight to get through to management to get promoted up in the company
good,I bagged groceries and cleaned store pretty much and it was rough around holidays because I am not comfortable with large crowds.
good,"We could barely talk to one another, they would feel like we were taking away from the customers, not good enough customer service. Even when it wasn't any customers around, they would say its always something to do."
good,"-worked as a bagger , cashier and worked in the floral department"
good,Again another mass merchandiser with limited professional growth. Management support to pharmacy diltued.
good,Waiting on customers was the funnest part of this job being a people watcher definately made it and interesting place to work.
good,"Started as a bagger promoted to a cashier in less than a year , some managers have attitudes but don't let that get to you"
good,"Love the employees I work with. Current management is poor.  No back up for my position which makes it difficult to take time off for personal events, illness, etc.  Difficult situations with employees are ignored and never dealt with."
good,"My experience with Kroger was a mixture of benefits and detractors.  On the one hand, it provided an endless and satisfying presentation of challenges to overcome.  As soon as my employers discovered my ability to both learn new tasks and switch between tasks with efficiency, I was consistently required to do so.  In a typical day I would need to work in multiple departments, including a wide variety of skills.  In one day I might be required to make floral arrangements, run register, provide customer service, and run a sales floor department.  I was able to learn new things on almost a daily basis in this manner.  This part of the job provided immense enjoyment."
good,Beginners job is what I would recommend this as. It is difficult working when you are shorthanded with staff and you are still expected to perform the same as if you had a full staff.
good,"My schedule was different from day to day, even though they knew I had to stick to one schedule. I learned how to interact and chat to people coming through my line and to be more friendlier. The management was mediocre, but, treated their employees better than convergys does. I got along with about half my coworkers, the others I never worked with or saw. Hardest part of my job was the difficult customers and most enjoyable was interacting with people."
good,"no family time dosnt seem like they care about employees anymore,"
good,"Kroger is a good place to shop - be sure to get those fuel points!  "
good,Work was exhausting due to the workload but not unbearable. Management was horrible.
good,terrible pay and benefits nothing good can be said about working there.
good,"cash out groceries, and other stuff for the house"
good,working with other employees and customer on resolving there problems. i learned that there is no problem that can not be handle fast and fair. the hardest part of the job had to be working with rude customers. Most enjoyable part of the job when you help someone out with a problem that they are having
good,"great people to work with and awesome job security, but no room for advancement. very hard to balance work and family"
good,It is a diverse company who focuses on accomplishing their goal through excellent customer service  and faster check-out.
good,Kroger tried to terminate because i work a 4 hour shift and stayed to work for 4 hour extra to get a full shift
good,"The hardest part of my job is not being able to make sure we satisfy each and every customer. Also not achieving the company goals on a daily basis. "
good,"Kroger doesn't pay it's employees nearly enough for how much they work. If you do not have an old contract with the company, full time positions are garbage for the amount of work done."
good,"this place was a Experience, wend i just arrive to the country i start working here, i was a heavy place to work but i meet very good people. after few months i was prepare to star looking for something really know to do and i left the company."
good,Pay is not worth the manual labor. This was not a nice to place to work. The best part of this job was being able to help and create loyal customers.
good,"A typical day at work went along the lines of going in, smiles on everyone's face, clocked in, and went straight to work. It had the times where it seemed so unorganized since it was so fast paced and too many people didn't seem to know what to do. "
good,The only thing that I like about Kroger is they work with your schedule.  Other than that I don't like the pay of the job how they make you do all these duties but all of it is just a waste.
good,"Management will work you as hard as they can for minimum wage and when its time for a raise say that you didnt qualify for the full raise. Do yourself a favor, and find a better job."
good,"If your looking to get started in the work force as a teenager, Kroger is the place for you."
good,hard work in miserable conditions basic manual labor with heavy machinery
good,"Tear down old fixtures, build new fixtures and merchandise product to planogram. Provide customer service during those processes."
good,I love the job when I was working there the only reason i stop working there beacause i was attending college.
good,depending on what store you go to all management is different most of the smaller stores are wonderful to work for but the bigger stores the management cant handle a lot of the pressure
good,The job that they made me do was above their expectations but i still did it. It sure was fun when there were people that you knew working with you.
good,"This is a good place to work if you need a job while going to school. If you are looking for full time work, however I would not recommend it. They give raises quite often so there is potential to make some really good money. Management is usually really understanding and will work around a school schedule if you are a student. It is pretty hard to secure full time work here."
good,I've learned customer relation skills and how to account for the daily revenue. The co-workers all get along and talking with them is most enjoyable. I say the hardest part is when it's busy but short of staff. Kroger has a que that they try to keep to make the customer happy. But the management is swift to jump in and help the associates.
good,Kroger is a good place to work. The company help me while I was in school.
good,"Cleaning butchering equipment, packaging products and keep stocking them throughout the department. Soaping/pressure washing the cold storage areas. "
good,"If you work hard you will advance, if you don't good luck. "
good,It was a job while in school.  I enjoyed the customers I met while there.
good,"On a typical day, I would manage the front end, helping customers find items that they were looking for, also directing them to the nessary check out lines, to ensure accurate flow of the front end.   I ensured that all associates recieved there break when needed.  Hardest part of the job, was not getting the needed help from management with some of the problem assocates that I was having.  Co-workers for the most part, were okay.  I was young when I took this position, some of the older associates, or ones that had been there longer than me, I had troubles with when it came to giving direction.  Working with the customers was the most enjoyable part of the job. "
good,"Each supervisor would constantly change the task for an employee. And when one task didn't get completed(because you were doing the task the another supervisor), they would get very upset and wouldn't listen to you when you tried to explain. "
good,"The store where I was located did not really allow those with the lowest position to advance within the company. Also, they did not exactly follow union rules, but overall, Kroger is a wonderful company."
good,This company has too many managers and supervisors.  Very hard to get anything done because of constant interuptions for meetings and training.
good,Strenuous work picking orders and stacking pallets all day. Will take its toll on your back and mind. Better be ready to work lots of overtime continuously due to managements lack of staffing.
good,"Clock in then find out what you had to do then start working, i learned how to have more patience with the customers and learn how to work in a stressful environment"
good,"di al duties as asssigned, maintenance clean trim weeds, stock , log do manager paperwork.... in the end there is no security."
good,"Never a set schedule, so sometimes it's busy and sometimes it's not. I've learned customers are always right and that you've got to work hard to get what you want in life. Management, depending on which one you're referring too, treat their employees like dirt. My co-workers are awesome. I get along great with them and they're for the most part, hard workers. The hardest part of my job is not knowing from week to week what my schedule is. The most enjoyable is working the my co-workers and the customers who come in all the time that look forward to seeing me. :)"
good,good place to work
good,"Typical Day at work clocking in, and going straight to work. Stocking shelves and always trying to help and make customers happy."
good,I learned how to function in a team type job. Some days were busy and others were not.
good,"The managers ability at each store are varied. I have had managers that don't care about anything, to mangers that micro manage the very place you stand. I love my co-workers and with them, have been able to keep sane in this no-where job. In five years, I have worked with over 20+ managers, and the number of coworkers is probably in the 90's to low 100's. The turn over is so great because the training for everyone is dismal. The supervisors are expected to do so much, yet paid the same as cashiers. Managers do not back up employees when faced with a customer complaint, and will, in front of the customer, make the supervisor into the ""bad guy"" for following Kroger policy and procedures. On the store level this company has very few options for career growth"
good,Not a great company to work for when u have only young kids getting promote that has not been with the company for a period of time .
good,Kroger is a great company with bad managers. Most ( Not all) of the managers I have worked with do not treat they employees that work there like humans. They are treated more like robots with very low pay.
good,"Typical day at work was breaking down deli merchandiser, cleaning dishes, putting deli merchandiser back together, Cook food to put in sandwich case and deli merchandiser, Take care of customers, Run register, run reports at end of day and count draw down. The hardest part of the job was cleaning up after others when it should have been done. The easiest part is dealing with the customers."
good,"Although they do hire a wide diversity of employees, the compnaies wages are below standard. They often call you in on your days off and do not show appreciation for your time."
good,"A typical day at Wendys is fast paced but never challenging. Working fast and with people is my thing so I felt right at home. Management did prove to be an issue, with one person telling me one thing and something else from the next. My co-workers were friendly and very nice, no complaints at all. The hardest part of the job was dealing with management. The best part again were my co-workers."
good,"First i was a bagger then, i was promoted to cashier. So i learned the register, cleaned, assisted customers, price checks, uscan. Management id rather not say. dealing with iritate customers and the most enjoyable part was going home."
good,"A typical day at ralphs was pretty simple. We clocked in, turned on our computers, and made sure everything was running properly. I learned all bout different codes for different things and food in the computer. My management was really quiet, so you never truly knew how they felt about a situation or anything for that matter."
good,The job is alright nothing special not enough pay. Co-workers were fake and some were just anti-social.
good,•i like working and a typical day at work is one that you would only do sweep and pick up trash along with getting cards for the store and making sure that the stall of carts stayis full of carts. and making sure that the bath rooms get done.
good,"my time here was okay, i had a hard learning the basics and the sometimes the customers were pretty rude, the employees too"
good,"A typical day here would be constantly standing, bending, kneeling, and picking up items, having to ask for a break and sometimes not geting one. My co-workers were ok to work with but the management team was horrible."
good,There was not any work/life balance at all. Extremely long days.
good,"There are wonderful benefits at this company but there isnt much room for advancement. The hardest part of the job was that there were so many different views on how things should be run (ex. The manager of the store wanted things one way, the deli coordinator wanted things another way, and the district manager wanted them yet another way...), it was very confusing. There was not a very good work/life balance, which they claim is one of the best things about the company. I was working 7 days a week most weeks with limited time to spend with my family. I wanted to go to school so I could move up with the company but they never allowed me time to do so. I had some great co-workers there though. I made lots of life-long friends!"
good,"Kroger is a premier grocery company that leads its field. As an employer they reward hard work and dedication. They have been classified as the number One company to work for in Indianapolis, Indiana for the past two years. Their compensation and bonus plans are limited only by your own performance."
good,"Once you start they will load you with hours..every week that you are there you will get less and less hours because they are ""over budget"" managment is awful here and you cannot go to them for any kind of support."
good,"My overall experience at Kroger stores were good sometimes and also not to good sometimes. I was the only minority working in my department, so it sort of felt just awkward. Although I loved the people I worked with I just believe they could have made it more diverse."
good,"duties not always outlined"
good,Co workers were inviting. Lots of cross training if desired. Not impressed with raise amounts. Loved the customer's. Love helping people. Fast paced and very physical work in the department I was in.
good,"I’ve enjoyed working for Kroger since Retiring 4 years ago. However, I’m finding working nights, weekends and holidays becoming increasingly difficult."
good,Backbreaking work.. my dairy lead was unnecessarily rude and made work life unbearable. Pay was well for someone in Highschool and would recommend working front end.
good,"Average beginner job, management lacks control and motivation. Raises are pathetic and hours range from whatever then managers want. Little benefits and no real reason to stay."
good,"Sometimes management says things that shouldnt be said when they are angry or get call ins. I've  been told before when I called in once, I was asked if I thought they needed me with the company. It not only hurt but I rarely call in. I only called in because I had 2nd degree sunburns and blisters all over my body I couldn't get clothes on."
good,I enjoy doing customer service and sometimes the job can be stressful. I feel if they paid more it would be a little better. The staff is cool too. It's a good job if you are in a transition
good,Currently employed. I have a hard time with the fact that you must use pto if you need any time off even if it is just a couple of hours or it must be made up within the same week. The management has been good so far. It is hard to adjust coming from a job where I am not sitting down all day. Good company to work for over all.
good,It is a corporation and at this point the values for which the company stands for are few but big. Communication down the ladder will never lack room for improvement.
good,"When I was working there I was in high school they had me in closing shift  from 5-11:30 not the best for people who had school in the morning. When i had asked to go in a school trip they told me I couldn't take the time off, I had to go above that manager to go to my school trip. They asked for deli department to help with Bakery, flower shop and produce department. They didn't pay much at the moment I do not know about now."
good,The days are too long and not enough work life balance.Just be prepared if working here to put in a lot of hours. Not much support to support work life balance.
good,Did not like working at Kroger. The management was horrible. Customers were great and polite. Little to no training by managers.... just bad..........
good,The job I have their is fairly nice keeps you busy and your always on the move the problem is how unorganized it is as for schedules and informing you on changes
good,"Kroger was a decent job that payed the bills and filled the need, but I had several issues with the overall work. Firstly, an unspoken rule within the plant was to arrive at 5:00 am (30 minutes early, off the clock, no pay) in order to work. You could be sent home early without notice. Secondly,  many of those given the task to teach newcomers were unable to proficiently speak English, leading to confusion and frustration for many new workers. Communication was always an issue."
good,It is a good job but they were not paying me enough and I had bills and a family to take care of. They also don’t understand that people has other stuff to do and schedule you on day the they know that you can’t work.
good,"A typical day at work, in produce, tends to start with cleaning up carts and product left by earlier shifts which can range from taking 30 minutes to upwards of 2 hours. Understaffing on weekend shifts can be common."
good,"I worked as a 3rd shift Kroger grocery stocker from 2015 to 2017. Although the job itself wasn't bad, I didn't enjoy working 3rd shift. I had tried numerous times to switch shifts or progress to other positions within the company. However, I was misinformed almost every time that those positions weren't available even though they were currently hiring for those spots. Management was bad at communicating with their employees as well as other managers."
good,"management was not trustworthy, was promised promotions and other higher level job adancements but was offered to others with less experience and time on the job"
good,"I won't say that I ever felt as though I was moving forward with my life while working there, but the job itself wasn't bad, and making people's day was fairly pleasant. Management can be a bit of a pain sometimes, but you can often find coworkers that you'll get along with."
good,Worked 7 days a week most weeks and still didn’t get a full 40:00 hrs a week. Manager was always nasty toward me and I didn’t like her treatment. Management didn’t take any steps to resolve the issue.
good,"This is not a well run store.  My department was Gen Merchandise, and there was so much backed up stocking and work ,you were never done.  My department head was not experienced, and was immature. He did not know how to run the department. His actions made several employees leave, including me. I didnt feel protected, or that I mattered."
good,Management retail sales are down to about nothing from past year. CEO going forward with layoffs and give self millions in bonuses . Ceo cares nothing for people who work for him . He will  run Kroger into the ground.
good,"I've never had a job where customer service was the main focus. I found I like this very much. As far as training, there isn't anything written down for navigating through the software. I was given training as new opportunites occurred, not before hand. The employees are not very welcoming."
good,"This job is okay, however, management doesn’t pay much attention to the important problems but more towards the little ones. Click List is understaffed for how busy it is. Employees aren’t treated fairly. Employees talk/ spread rumors like we’re still in highschool."
good,"I wish i could say i had an amazing experience but, i had so many issues with scheduling that in the past few months of supposed working there, i did not. i have worked very little when it was implied that i would work there every weekend at-least one day. When i did work i was bagging items, getting items for customers, pushing carts, and making a customers day better or brighter. I've learned many skills in being calm, collected, helpful, and kind. I have no understanding of the management and have no clue who does the scheduling. Everyone is super nice, caring, and helpful, but some people don't want to be bother or dont like small talk. I enjoy making so many cool and amazing friends that make working there a lot of fun."
good,As Courtesy Clerk I learned to value the importance of good listening skills and positive attitude and appearance at all time. I felt satisfied by the end of the day when one or two customer appreciates what I did. When I helped/assisted elderly people on their shopping bags or just common questions and concerns in general from customers and I am able to answer them or guide them to it.
good,"The people who work beside me as my coworkers are like a family and with every family comes its fair share of short comings. They were very friendly but lacked communication, discipline and teamwork. The store needs Improvements in every field but the main three are discipline, Teamwork and communication. I believe the store can become more efficient if they took charge and made the necessary changes needed to improve the companies employees."
good,"it was a pretty easy job low in labor but also not much room to move up and not challenging. its great for a summer job or a temporary job. But with my need to constantly grow, it was not a good fit for me"
good,I worked with a manager who accused me of stealing.. turns out she misplaced some returns..that issue was never resolved. they cut hours every other week at most I got about 16hr once I changed departments I felt better about moving away from the front end.. management was not friendly and they didn’t want to train anybody they just pushed new employees on old ones and say “train each other”
good,"I was one woman coupled with a much older woman put into Floral. Doesn't seem like a very physical job but it was a lot for just two people when the seasons came around (my co-worker was also a 70 year old woman expected to lift 50lb+ floral displays and planted pots, very unfair.) We would try and explain to management that we think we should hire in more people for the floral department, but that was if we could ever even get ahold of the managers and in my whole year there it was just us. "
good,I don’t like the direction the company is headed in. They keep giving you more to do for each shift without adding extra hours or help. I’ve had some great managers and some terrible managers. My last two store managers were terrible and it affects the entire store. Same can be said for the grocery managers. Employees on the older contracts get paid more to do the same exact job. They gave us bonuses and then took them away.
good,"This is a place to get your foot in the door.  Everything is centered around college recruiting however, so don't take a entry level job with the intention of moving up, as it probably won't happen.  Regretfully, the pay is low, and real lack of advancement."
good,Every night we decide what needs to be stocked as highest priority. After stocking we clean up the boxes and condition the aisle in preparation for the store opening. The culture is mostly relaxed but you're expected to be self dependent on getting your task done. It is enjoyable staying busy but the hardest part was the inconsistency in management scheduling.
good,"- Work an 8 hour shift with only one 15 minute break due to having to work so many departments"
good,"Kroger is a tough and stress place to work. While compensation and benefits are good, this is not the place to work if you want a flexible schedule and work life balance."
good,"I loved working with the public and for about 6 months I was continually learning, however after that I was stuck at what I was good at. I had one manager who encouraged me and tried to help me move up however the others I worked with didn't really show support for advancement."
good,"Flexibility  is good. However, flexibility  can be little or much. The isn't  great, but it's something if you have nothing. Not much place for advancement"
good,"Kroger offers many positions, the one I worked for gave me the position in Kroger Clicklist where when opening, open up the back room and get things ready for people coming in, other times running out onto the floor to personal shop for people."
good,"Kroger is a wonderful place to work if you plan on making your forever place of employment. But if it's a temp job while you are find something better for you then the company really doesn't care too much about you. They will not listen to your scheduling needs, you'll have to work every weekend, you'll never get time off approved almost, and they never give you opportunities for advancement."
good,"Kroger is full of fast-paced projects, staff, and customers. Customers come and go quickly. Displays for sales must be changed regularly. And staff are usually timed on their work."
good,"company is out of touch with workers; employees underpaid and overworked, stores understaffed, massive turnover, etc; new hires are promised $10/hr job and pay but instead are expected to do $15/hr worth of work at a $20/hr skill level with minimal training for $8/hr."
good,Kroger store in Lexington VA was dirty garbage set four feet from slicer in deli short staffed. Dates where not checked as frequently as they should do to lack of management/employees. Low pay rate. Lack of communication. Fast paced and must be multi Tasker. Need to know deli baking/ovens run a fryer cake decorating etc. Stocking
good,"It’s ok, not great not bad. It can get very tiring quickly depending on the job and how long you work. Management sometimes forgets tour breaks and lunch."
good,"Kroger use to be a good company to work for. Now cooperate is making it where it isn't so. Plus is Kroger is a union company. Kroger is a customer focused company. Depending on location, there is room for advancement."
good,"I would work 12 to 14 hours a day and make $120 to $150 a day. Not much else to say, bad pay almost no benefits, horrible hours, you don't actually get paid for the work you do."
good,Staying calm and be humble especially when people are ranting and raging. We must always remain positive and very respectful no matter what humbleness is the best way doing these jobs. Let’s have a good review on our company for the best.
good,"Mostly a great work environment, but management understands numbers not so much the people so that creates unrealistic expectations. But other than that it's a good place to work."
good,Is a really good place to work if your going to school. They dont do part time option unless you work as a temp and choose ur hours. Eh management : ( great people to work with.
good,"the managers constantly lost crew members and didnt try to keep anyone on the team, there was a constant problem of understaffing requiring everyone else to work overtime nearly every day of every week"
good,I loved being a floral assistant. Hours were flexible and the job was enjoyable. I was able to create floral arrangements for customers and care for different types of plants.
good,it wasn't the worst place to work. some days were stressful like any other job but they gave good hours and decent management. i would work there again.
good,"Kroger is a great company to work for as for the benefit packages when I started.  I have met a lot of people, customers and coworkers that have made a huge impact on my life, in which I am extremely thankful"
good,Not bad unless you are in a management position as you have no work life balance. Upper management lacks communication skills and have contradicting and unrealistic expectations.
good,I do not wish to comment on my experience there. I have been there for 5 years and it’s not a bad place to work. My time there is just spent and it’s my time to move on.
good,As a Salaried Manager do not expect a work/Home balance 60+ hours a week.   District and higher Management micro manage everything.  There is not enough time in the Day to Complete assigned task and run the store.
good,Only work with a few people that were there when I started. Most have quit to go elsewhere. Pay is low compared to other retail jobs. People don't respect retail workers.
good,"Pontiac Foods manufacturing plant..."
good,"•	Managed total operation of store including 80-100 employees at a time"
good,"I enjoyed working for kroger for 10 years they closed the doors after making employees confident that they weren't going to management only came around when things were bad, never to build us up and after the store closed the company made it seem like I quit on my job records when really they shut down and gave me severance"
good,Good job for someone who isn't the sole provider for their family. Hours are frequently cut with no explanation. If you are blessed to work with a good management team it's not so bad.
good,"Most employees are polite and helpful to customers,and fellow co-workers."
good,Kroger is an ok place to work for young generations or much older. They could do more with their employees to show their appreciation towards them but over all decent experience
good,A typical day at work is going in and waiting for the daily schedule to be made and then doing what the chart says hourly. Most of the time you don't go off the bar chart you just do whatever they say which most of the time is going outside and pulling in carts.
good,"Good Company to work for. No much of a life Balance, benefits are good.......Overall its a good company but has changed in the past 10 years and i ...."
good,"I was decently compensated, and busted tail to be the best at my role. Once I changed roles and started performing in my new position, I was transferred. My new director was happy to be in the middle of the pack, and anything I did to improve the store was reversed during my day off. I really liked the message of inclusivity but when the upper leadership from district up hardly reflects that  core value it becomes disheartening."
good,"Understaffed, little benefits, managers can be tiresome to deal with. Work culture can be overwhelming, often people who work there are older Asians who speak in native language. Racial tensions are often felt between co-workers and customers. Two ten minute breaks, one 30 minute lunch break."
good,When beginning to work for Mariano's it was good then the management went bad. It seemed like they wanted us to work harder for less money. It was almost impossible to get a raise or get more people to help our department.
good,"I dont feel that krogers is a good employer. There were times i didnt get a break or a lunch, after standing on my feet for eight hours. There were never enough cashiers, so overall it was very hectic."
good,"Management caters to their favorites and expects you to bend over backwards for them. They will also have you trained for different departments, but don't want to pay you."
good,"Hired for meat department, completed 60hts of mandatory classroom and computer training. Worked a couple of months in meat department, and was then forced to help bag at register and push carts in. When meat department was really struggling with only 2 employees. I was later terminated because I had an outside of work medical emergency, I returned with a doctor's note stating when I could return back to work. I was told that I was terminated for missing too many days of work without having a 2nd doctors note, I was unaware that I needed 2 doctors notes. Management failed to tell me of this, and the Union did nothing to help.. Shame on you Kroger"
good,"Kroger is a good place to work, i was a dairy clerk and besides for being cold everyday working in the cooler overall it was a good job. I got to help plenty of people everyday finding items and so on, i also made a lot of new friends, the only thing i did not like was the pay, most people were underpaid at kroger and the had a hard time keeping employees."
good,"I believe Kroger's policies have led to a very poor working environment.  Every day at work is a stressful one, and it is not necessary.  Kroger has very good benefits, but the pay is very noncompetitive when compared to other similar employers."
good,"Virginia Bunch was my manager and she was terrible. Verbally abusive, and poor leadership skills. The hours were inconsistent and I was treated like a slave. If you didnt have 100 things to do then you weren't doing enough. Other than that, good company. Lol"
good,Kroger is not a bad place to work at Kroger is just really unprofessional I wasn’t getting the attention and benefits I needed as a worker I was always getting pick on as a worker and getting in trouble for other people work very unprofessional
good,Kroger company is honestly a bad place to work they guilt you and make you feel what you do is not good enough. They hover and treat you like garbage.
good,There is very little time by Management to focus on achieving better results in a relaxed atmosphere to work with on schedules when closing store and getting back again starting from 9am with not enough rest. Customers have very high expectations and they are not computer literates in going through Kroger App plus ones with backing on E Coupons also pressure us with extra coupons to scan.
good,Kroger just simply needs a new system manager. Working their is ok at times but they are sneaky . They would never do their jobs the right way but have me do it .
good,"Would recommend for part work and/or if extra money needs to be made, but unless plans are to work in management being an associate for the company long-term is no good."
good,they give more hours to people that show up and work hard as opposed to people that call out weekly and hit the door as soon as shift is up.  therefore such as and so on... had to hit 150 characters for review to count
good,"This was my first job. I worked at the store in West Point until it shut down. Shutting a store down is difficult due to the large number of people. I felt like I would run all day long for 8+ hours. Before it shut down, I loved the job. I knew the regulars of the store, and I knew everyone I worked with. We had a nice relationship. That was not so when I transferred to Starkville. I felt like I was in charge of too much at once. I could work a full shift and not have gotten enough done. Management made me feel bad for not coming in after hours. Still, I made a lot of close friends with the other employees."
good,"I worked for Fry's for at least 2 years as a courtesy clerk and produce clerk. If you have patience then lower positions aren't that bad, as they are simple and straightforward. As a courtesy clerk all I had to do was bag groceries, push/pull carts, and assist customers, however keep in mind that you will have ""those days"" where certain customers will grind your gears. As a Produce Clerk, your primary job is simply to keep the department stocked with produce. It's repetitive but it can also be relaxing, however you'll be in serious trouble if you run out of stock with certain items, as the customers will let you know about it constantly."
good,i used to work there and management (one person in particular) gave me a hard time . it’s easy to make friends . the discounts on items are good too !
good,I can not speak for all locations but this is a place to start and not a place to stay. If you are looking to get your first job go ahead and apply here but after a year start looking elsewhere.
good,"The best things about working at Kroger are the employee discount (small, but something), holiday pay for four holidays a year, and the offer of benefits for p/t employees.  Other than these, it is your typical retail job with nothing special to offer."
good,Working at Kroger as a courtesy clerk was not too demanding nor stressful as it mainly concerns one helping customers throughout the shift one is working along with other tedious tasks
good,"I loved working at Kroger’s.  Made me actually enjoy working. The team I worked with, we work very well together to get our tasks complete everyday. Made me feel as though we were really knocking all others departments out the game."
good,It was ok but I personally had issues. The main reason I quit is they kept scheduling me when I had said in person and online I can’t work and they kept doing it then after a while I was getting in trouble because I kept saying I wasn’t able to come in until later or not at all on some days so I just quit. However I don’t know if everyone has that story so maybe it was just me.
good,"While working at the Kroger Co. It was my first job, and through here I learned the core values of customer service, proper people management, and financial management"
good,"the store had a rat problems and I would hear from customers that they found hair in their produce. Besides that my position was understaffed so I ended up doing a lot more cart pushing than bagging as a ""Bagger Position"" because anyone in the front can bag but only baggers can go out and push the carts from the parking lot inside. Low pay for the work I put in compared to others."
good,"I began with an open mind and quickly read between the lines. The department I worked in not as it appeared. I frequently was looked as the ""newbie"" as if I knew very little. If you had not been there for years than the well seasoned employees often treated the new employees with disrespect. The company has a great structure and other departments I'm sure were not this way however the environment in my particular department is up to par with the company's mission."
good,Working for Ralphs was definitely a lot of work and very low pay for the amount of work. Hours were constantly cut and more processes were implemented without giving more hours to do these said processes. I always stayed overtime and never had enough time to complete my job.
good,Morale is at an all time low. Store is understaffed.  I enjoy my job and the customers. Some employees are negative and rude. Management is decent. Pay is low. Hours are inconsistent.
good,"Manage time everyday for merchandising product, inventory, housekeeping and to assure in-stocks for the consumer."
good,"Interview process was fairly easy and simple, i got the job within a week. The work environment was a balance between fast and medium paced. The environment was pretty chill, and unless a customer had an issue with finding a product,customer complaints were resolved fairly quickly. "
good,"Let me start off by mentioning that THERE ARE NO RAISES AVAILABLE FOR COURTESY CLERKS. You are stuck at minimum wage until you are promoted."
good,Working there was just a part time job but enjoyed the working environment. Loved working with the local public and helping everyone who came into shop. Loved working there.
good,"Dont recommend kroger"
good,I had a ucler in my stomach and the magament didn't care and would be hesitant to let me go to the doctor also wouldn't let me leave if I had to for stomach related problems
good,"They are your common retail store, not much stress if you are a people person. As long as you can take getting talked down to its pretty easy to deal with."
good,Considering this was my first time real job I learned how to work in a fast-paced environment however there were a lot of times where I could not keep up with the demands of customers and my coworkers. It became very frustrating and stressful. In addition I never got enough hours to make it worth my while.
good,"Great place to start"
good,"Managers were constantly on my back about being quick even though I was working as fast as I physically could, to the point of where working there was just physically painful and too stressful to work there any longer. I enjoyed the first 2 weeks of it, and then it became extremely laborious. I had to lift very heavy items with 2 spinal rods infused in my back from surgery."
good,A typical day was busy since i worked on Saturdays and Sundays. I learned how to work a register. I like the management for the most part. The hardest part of the job was rude customers when you could not help them. The enjoyable part was seeing your regular customers come in to shop.
good,"The atmosphere of employees was very nice, however the work was not. I never received a proper sized uniform so I constantly felt uncomfortable and unprofessional wearing large clothes. Also half of the time I was never working in my own area that I was hired for because we were over-staffed or under-staffed."
good,That everyday is not the same .  That you don't trust to many of the people you work with. That you need to get to work at your scheduled time.  Management should be nicer to there employees since we are the backbone of the Company.  The most difficult thing is to much work and not enough people to do the jobs!
good,Kroger is very steady good part-time job always going to have hours and easy to get more hours in if you need to. Hard to transfer from department to department though. You meet great people
good,"Kroger was my first job and although I did not enjoy working there and was ultimately laid off due to my store closing, I do not regret it. Kroger has a lot of good experience to offer and I recommend this as a starting job."
good,"Great benefits , wouldn’t recommend for full time but it makes a really good part time job.they have lots of events Thur out the year. Mangers are ok in most of the stores I’ve been to"
good,When I worked here I constantly had customers screaming at me over coupons and policies that weren't things I could control. Management never stepped in and then I finally quit after I was sexually harassed to the point of tears and management told me to just ignore him. When I made a big deal about it they threatened to take away my previously agreed upon promotion. Terrible business.
good,I loved working at Kroger but the main front end supervisor treats everyone really really bad. when I brought it to the union attention nothing happen she started treating people with disabilities really bad and I wrote corporation three letters and she still treats them very very bad
good,"i liked the employees. a typical day at work, what you learned, management, workplace culture, the hardest part of the job, the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"Decent Pl;ace to work, if you have little to no significant bills to pay. Hours are flexible to fit your schedule.  Pay raises are minimal, and starting pay is minimum wage."
good,"I worked at a roundy's, actually 2 different locations. The first location was actually alright to work at, but the second was run by awful management that ultimately got the chop because they were running the place to the ground. Decent pay for a grocery store, hard working people, but it's hard to get anywhere here."
good,"The job seemed fun when going through training, yet upon start date you find out that you will be working alone. Also, the job was suppose to be working alongside or with a dietitian, extremely inaccurate. Many colleagues were not happy with the job due to it being extremely boring, little direction, and lack of direction."
good,"Easy interview process, job intensity depends on what you go into. DO NOT work as a ""courtesy clerk"" aka bagger, you will be asked to clean restrooms and do other facility maintenance.  Other jobs are significantly better in regard to work experience. Overall 5/10, if you're looking for an entry level job, then Kroger is a good place to work for 1-2 years."
good,"Very busy all the time, with little to no one working. No lanes were ever open, and no manager was ever seen on the floor. They needed to hire more front end associates."
good,"If you are just starting your first job, this is the place for you. They teach you as you go and coach you to do better and be better. It wasn't easy being thrown into it at first, BUT that is how you will learn. Can not be afraid to ask questions that will help you better and they are willing to help as long as you're willing to help yourself."
good,"management is GREAT.  Most jobs are part-time 20hrs"
good,"Worked the night freight crew for 9 years and still was not a fulltime employee. Managers have their favorites,and brings them from  other locations to fit managers needs. When the manger leaves about  1 to 2 years, they will take their favorites with them. Revolving door with management. Tip when you see something say something, but also remember you might get your hours cut for doing that. Kroger is a good place to start and could be a great job for a lifetime."
good,"Kroger was not very good thinking about the workers. They just started a new rule where we can’t have any water by us unless we have a doctors note. The managers are pretty nice overall, and pay is okay. They didn’t train us very well but learned from experience."
good,Enough said It's a go between job Don't get caught up and try and back this a career. This is ment to be a starting job so take it for what it is!!!!!!!!!
good,"I loved a lot of my coworkers, but the thing is that the amount of stress that you go through for the amount you get paid is not worth it. I worked like a construction worker for 8 dollars an hour. I would come home and occasionally get leg intense leg cramps. Management was also poor.Schedules seemed like they were a guessing game because I never knew what I was going to get that week. The store manager at the time was also extremely hard to work for. She was not a very compassionate person, if anything there were times where she was extremely rude to her own customers simply because of her position and the fact that she had the power to act in that manner. I did not like how many of the employees there were treated. I got to know a lot of them and most of the ones who have worked there for many years have stated that they are constantly undermined by their superiors."
good,"Fairly relaxed atmosphere, friendly coworkers. Busy enough to make time go by quickly. Inconsistent scheduling, and not much training for the job expected"
good,I was leaving due to a coming up move but they were starting to cut tech hours. Attendance issues were never addressed to problem employees. Free meals were given at certain times/events. Had bonuses but not sure how they were determined.
good,"If Kroger only paid its employees better, it could potentially be a great place to work for more than a year or two, though of course, it matters the store you work at as well - each has its own culture. The store I was at was decent, and coworkers even across departments were for the most part pleasant to deal with."
good,"People definitely had their favorites at Kroger. They would give the easier work to their favorite employees and the dirty work to others. For instance I was getting carts in the parking lot one night while a tall man followed me around, I went back inside and the man waited for me outside the door. I told them I was uncomfortable doing carts but still had to do them everyday after while some baggers got to help stock which wasn't their job. Someone was always getting on you for little things and it just got to be a stressful job."
good,Management is very rude and dishonest towards company core values. Management doesnt care about work life/ home balance. Employees are very rude when trying to train or learn new practices
good,"Other major retail pharmacies pay technicians more than Kroger, but are not nearly as efficient. Many expectations are put on Kroger pharmacies without taking the employee into consideration. Also, some of the busiest stores are still set in the 1980’s. Remodeling needs to happen for all Kroger stores."
good,A typical day at Kroger was slightly chaotic. There seemed to be a rotating management team for the last year that I was employed with the company. Lack of staff on the front end side of the store was cause for many customer complaints.
good,"The turn over in dept leaders is high, due to the constant changing of rules, standards, and terrible management. The corprate mentality is more, more more more, but you can't split yourself to do more more more in the time given that their computers say it should be done. "
good,I have worked for Kroger as a technician and all I ask is the pay to be fair. So far we are getting paid as much as a McDonalds employee does and that's after 7 years. That's really sad. That's why Im always looking for a second job! and why are new employees that get hired on start at a higher rate than me. They just started.
good,"The unit just became too toxic to continue working there. Leads, supervisors, and upper management enjoy brown nosing, and tend to disrespect the employees that actually do the work. Management fired some of the best employees, and the place turned into a nepotism mafia-like place."
good,"i am an employee with a minor learning disability.  the store I am employed through has a contract with a non profit organization for people with disabilities.   "
good,"Kroger used to be a company devoted to it's employees and promoting them. However, retail is changing and they are cutting jobs quickly. Going to more electronic based operating systems. Hours consistently get cut. If your store is partnered with a union you might as well walk away."
good,Had to work with a lot of supervisors who were lazy and didn't care about the company or the employees. Never held employees accountable for unwanted behavior. The bakery was poorly managed which in the end was one of the reasons it was shut down.
good,"Great Company, I shop at Kroger all the time after going through their management training program. Their quality assurance is over the top. The problem with the store manager position for me was the  Work Life Balance. Basically every weekend and holiday, long 10 plus hours on my feet all day was hard on the marriage. Had to find another line of work after a year."
good,"You must be a self-sufficient, team player to advance with the Company. Promotions are typically from within the Company. Follow their rules, be eager to take on more work and you will have a long career at Kroger."
good,There is no work-life balance as an assistant manager. The company does provide excellent training classes and opportunities for advancement. Kroger also provides a competitive salary and benefits.
good,Not good balance between work and family. Especially for a single parent. Pay doesn’t compensate hours. Medical benefits are good. Promote within. Flexible hours for pt employees
good,"The job was fine at first"
good,Worked there for sometime get to meet different people and the re-did their Standards for management finally. But since a year or so ago they have improved vastly to the point it is very nice place to work at.
good,It is very hard to maintain your life when they shift your schedule from day to night they tonight it's inconvenient they're not considerate with it at all
good,"This is a place that can be tolerable, but pays far less than Walmart while doing far more work. Management has no problem with sticking one person with deli on a Sunday."
good,Comfortable but doesn’t pay you much . Clean well managed just not enough pay .u stayed at 7.45 for 3 years . Pretty decent job tho for someone that’s in school
good,Good job to make 300 a week. Hours are never the same.  If you aren't besties with management there is no advancement. I was way more qualified a pretty much promised promotion but the main managers buddy got it instead.
good,I wouldn't recommended it to others. It was hard work and  a lot of overtime. The pay was good but it destroys you physically and mentally. I am glad I made it out alive.
good,Kroger does not train you properly. The Salary is not good. Have to pay high deductible. A lot of drama. They don't help you advance in your career or take the time to really invest in the Assistant Managers. If they want them to be successful than they need to definitely train them once they are in the store after there training.
good,"On a typical work day, the work pace fluctuated based upon time of day and customer activity."
good,"The benefits are great,but the last few years the management has been very poor. I had a surgery had to stay out longer than first predicted and was punished when I returned to work by having my position taken away from me and given to another employee."
good,"Had to work alone 90% of the time, and being isolated from the store really alienated me from my coworkers in there. I felt like management resented us in the fuel center. Customers could also be very rude."
good,I can definitely do better. It has great employees but it lacks organization. They can also do better with pay and activate benefits immediately on hire.
good,"Kroger has good benefits that kick in after a year of working for the company. But thats really it amount of work you do for the pay is uneven. For me personally I work in the deli for almost two years now ,and I have been pulled out of my department to help others. Such as the online pick up and the front end meaning cashier. They have even made me go and get carts because the cart attendants were on registers or bagging. I really don't mind helping the other departments but my department is 200 hours understaff. I am a hard worker but I only make $8.50 the pay doesn't cover the work."
good,i was loyal to this company to begin with. but then after the years i just felt overworked and like i didn't have the adequate tools to succeed. quickly gets old and very low pay.
good,My youngest brother passed away and I was on the payroll past the ending of the bonus quarter and since I was not there when the checks came they kept it.
good,"Some days fun to work,some days not so fun depends on the managements appearance but still manage to pulled throughout those days and make everyone working the same shift with me happy. I learn a lot working for Kroger company,I enjoyed it myself."
good,"Count all money in cash register and safe."
good,Working at Kroger's as cashier the pay was to low. Recently they just went to $10 hour. You only get a lunch if you work over 8hrs. You might get two 15 min. breaks depending. Benefits start a year after working for company or when the benefit period starts.
good,Kroger is a retail grocer who is competing in an ever changing marketplace with traditional and new competitors.  Change is the name of the game.  Sometimes the day day goes smoothly but more typically you have to adapt to what comes your way.
good,They will work you to death.  They are the largest grocery chain and paying its employees pennies compared to other grocery store chains. With the cost of living rising this is only for High School  students.
good,I worked with nights enjoyed it bc it was layed back not lot of mangement at that time. The hours were great and if you needed time off just had to let them know ahead of time
good,This was my first real job as I had just gotten a truck and needed to pay for it at the age of 17 while going to school. What I applied for isn't what i did all the time. I did nearly everything besides management at the time. This job is very laid back and some management is nicer then others. I left due to pay.
good,"A job for individuals just turning 16 and even though the pay is not worth it. After you factor in union dues for things like a break and right to appeal for your job, which most jobs offer anyways, you made less than minimum wage"
good,"Worked the night crew stocking grocery shelves. The night grocery manager was awesome. Hardest pat of the job was that the stocking crew was constantly understaffed, as were most of the departments in this particular store, so overtime was often mandatory. This causes burnout, exhaustion. Most enjoyable part of the job was just working with some really great people."
good,"Working for Kroger is great in the sense that you get to meet and engage with amazing people every day. The customer's are the best benefit for working for customers and I love every minute of it. There is honestly absolutely no job security, the company doesn't follow it's own value's and there are no consequences for many things but the general employee relationship below management is like family. The customers are held firmly at the top and that's about all that makes sense."
good,"Good Stable job. Not much room for advancement in the roles. Positions become eliminated often, so it does limit upward mobility. Company message and focal points change frequently. becomes hard to gain results. Management accountability is an opportunity. Work hours can be long."
good,"It's a place to work. During my time of employment, I went in with an open mind and knew hard work laid ahead of me. I'd do my job, oversee the tasks assigned and overall I didn't particularly enjoy it. There were some people, some Associates that I did like and do still miss."
good,"Not a great place to work, especially if you’re in school. It was fine when I worked in Drug GM, didn’t get a lot of hours, 20 at most, but it didn’t interfere with school, and life outside of work. I’m now, unhappily, a cashier. I’m not a people person, and liked working “behind the scenes.” Working 30-40 hours when I’m supposed to be part time because I go to college full time. They supposedly “cut” hours in Drug GM, and moved almost everyone to different positions. I asked my manager about this, and she said I would be going back to GM soon. Months pass and they hired NEW people. 16-17 year olds, who aren’t legally allowed to have a box cutter. Schedules used to be flexible, but aren’t anymore. I’m not a supervisor either, but sometimes have to act like it because they’re MIA."
good,"Most managers in Kroger stores are more concerned with keeping hours low and productivity high, since they are offered incentives such as bonuses for keeping total overtime beneath a set amount, they tend to make more cuts to hours than they do opportunities for overtime and prefer to avoid adding hours to schedules or shifts. On a typical day you maybe required to do multiple things in a short amount of time, all while having less overall time in a shift, especially if you work part time"
good,I been over looked for back up now 5 times in produce dept each time I wasn’t even considered n interview for the job eveyone there even mgmt tell you I’m the hardest working associate in our dept I work hard in produce everyday . Each time they hired some one as back up in produce either cause it was family of the dept head 2 brother In laws got the job 1 times now they brought someone out of  streets who never worked a day in kroger n gave them the back up n today find out they gave it someone who never worked a day in produce all their life he was a night crew grocery stocker n click list associate in the store. He doesn’t know anything about produce never been trained r anything before .
good,It was horrible the manager for my part was always on her phone or talking to others around her and when you needed her help she was hardly ever around to be found. I learned that its hard to do it on your own but at the same time i also learned you cant count on others for help.The working environment was dirty i had to clean because they wouldn't it was a mess they wasn't putting the customers first like they should have.the most enjoyable part was being able to feel important and to be able to interact with people and help them when needed and bringing in money.The days were all the same nothing would change.
good,"If you like stocking shelves and don't need a lot of hours or a good paying job to live by then I would recommend this. Its basically just helping customers, maintaining department freshness and cleanliness and having fun while doing it."
good,"Honestly if you're young and need a job it's fine. For anyone who has been around a little bit the hours are extreme. 60+ a week for any salaried position is to be expected and the salaries aren't that great. The only people who as actually make living wages are those who remain hourly. Benefits are alright but not great."
good,Need to hire a more diverse management team - to help improve communication within there diverse workforce - focus on hiring and promoting good talent
good,"A normal day would be fast pace depending of the what time of the day.  While working for a pharmacy I leaned new and faster processes to fill or aquire medicine prescriptions.  The management of the store was fully involved the employees and always capable of handling any work problems that arise.  Working at the pharmacy was difficult depend on the days or the time of day you were working.  The hardest and most enjoyable aspect of working in a pharmacy follow the same reasoning.  Customers would either be very rude and impatient or kind and courteous, which could either improve or worsen any workday."
good,"Decent work but to much for the pay. The management was terrible, tried to call in because my car broke down, they said I called in too early and needed to get a ride. Worked there for a year and had to change availability for school and they cut my hours down to 5-10 a week."
good,"I don’t love working there, but it’s okay to work there the only reason I stay are my actual coworkers and the customers they are the only reason I’m there I love my customers"
good,"Enjoyed working in the bakery department, customer service, introducing new products. Fun co workers and enjoyed the environment of the store."
good,"Good company, but schedule is crazy and always changing up the hours. Not enough employees so always short staffed and therefore, over worked. Management was poor and not well organized."
good,"This Cashier position, is one of the worst stores I have ever worked at. The Manager over training wasn't the best either. I basically listened to the information on the computer! It wasn't the best training nor was the woman who trained me the best either!"
good,"I would go and punch in then go upstairs to the front desk.There I would wait for one of the front desk managers to assign me to a register. I would then greet my customers, ring their groceries, and tell them to have a great day and to please come again."
good,No time to spend with your family.   A lot of bosses wanting a lot of things done with most of their thoughts conflicting with your other bosses.  Fun times.
good,I worked at the Clio/Pierson before they closed. The Customer Service Manager there refused to train me for a new position so I was stuck at the same position for the year I worked there.
good,As a cashier you cannot always get all the hours you want.  They have a hard time keeping baggers so many times part of your shift you are bagging as well as ringing up groceries.  Morale is low mostly but some supervisors are fun to work with so that does help get you through the day.
good,"There really wasn't a typical day at work, everyday was something different other then the operation of the given department. during my time there i learned that i am capable of managing a department though i did not get that far i know that i am capable of doing it if given the proper training and time to learn. the culture of the store was different depending on what department you worked for. my department for example (Deli) was always stressful do to lack of employees and/or skill. the hardest part of my job was being the only one on my shift that was both knowledgeable and willing to do the things needed for success."
good,My days here were fairly easy and didn't require much effort to finish tasks assigned. Management at least at my store is really good they tend to leave you alone and let you do your work. The hardest part of the job is the pay at $8 an hour it is difficult to live on.
good,"I enjoyed working as a cashier however I was forced to work full-time  even though i wanted to work part-time only. I enjoyed working in 3 different departments during my short term working there. Managers like to cross-train their employees in various departments. "
good,"Everyday was busy and all the staff complained about something, regardless of what it was. The management was rude and impolite and when asking for a break, they simply said that they were behind on breaks which meant some of my co-workers would leave 15 minutes early just because they never got their break on time."
good,"This company sets high, unreachable standards and does not supply the tools necessary to be successful."
good,"The Hours scheduled inconsistent from week to week."
good,"Just my experience from working in a few different markets, I think the culture is very different from location to location. At the time of my employment there, the culture for Store Managers was horrible. There wasn't any work life balance, you only get paid once a month, and continuous training and development was at a minimum. "
good,Working at Krogers was a stressful job due mainly to management. Most of the managers need manager training and to work on their people skills very rude. Pay is very low for the amount of work they expect you to do and to be done. Great pay if you are a high school student living at home with no bills or responsibilities
good,"Alright for a starter job. The pay was insufficient to live on. The deli was always under staffed. My management, and co-workers were great. There could be more communication. The store was always, always clean."
good,"Unless you really want to stay and move into management, Kroger doesn't offer much. It is kind of like a lot stop for high school and college students"
good,"Low pay and not enough hours. I learned about produce. A typical day was spent unloading produce, stocking and pricing produce, removing expired produce, helping customers."
good,Me personally i would not return to the workplace due to not getting enough hours to provide for my family. Other than not getting hours coworkers and managers are friendly and helpful
good,"Fun Environment with many different departments to work in. Lots of very different people in each location around the store, offering help for all ages."
good,"As a first job, it is still a low paying job when compared to other typical first jobs. When I worked here, it was Pick n Save, and not Kroger. The job itself can be very dirty when cleaning up."
good,"This job is a decent job when the weather is nice. However, the summer heat is unbearable when you have to do carts.  Cart shifts are 15 minutes and you are usually required to go out and do carts 6 or 7 times within your shift."
good,I make sure store personal can support the customers needs and company hardware and software via remote control and phone support.   I also assist management with making shift run fine.
good,I started working at the beginning of May to the present time. Throughout my 5 months it has been bearable due to the friendly co-workers and supervisors but management is poor. I work as a courtesy clerk but have had to fill in for the fuel center as well. On an occasion when I was sick and in danger of getting others sick they still made me come in; like my situation a co-worker I knew had pink eye and they still made her come in. Another reason for the bad review im giving is the scheduling; ive had days where I work till 12am; usually the only courtesy clerk after 10pm (clearing the parking lot of carts by myself) and they have me come in at 7am .
good,This is a decent company to work for but it is not a company that will provide you with enough to be able to provide for a family and etc. Most of the positions that the company has offer is for young adolescents who just need pocket change while they figure out your future or finish school.
good,"fun place to work. Offers flexible hours. I wish there were more room for advancement for workers who degrees. I have learned so much from working here, I really enjoy learning data entry."
good,"I came into this job with the expectation that it would turn into a full time position. I was averaging around 12-15 hours a week. It was a pretty big process getting hired on with all of the tests we had to take before starting the job. After leaving a prior job to come to kroger, I was let down."
good,I learned how to run an entire department by myself. I’d go to work at 4am and get the department ready before they opened for the day. Then I’d help maintain the department through the day. The last 2-3 hours of my shift is prep wet wall product for the night crew and the next morning.
good,"A typical day in my position at Kroger would see me arriving in the morning or afternoon and immediately going back outside to collect carts. After an hour of this, assuming my relief didn't have anything else to do, I would go back inside and either bag groceries for customers or clean the bathrooms. I might also be set to sweep the floor of the store with a dust mop, but this was less frequent than the other two tasks. I would get up to two 15-minute breaks and a 30-minute lunch, depending on how long my shift was. Other coworkers were typically friendly and accommodating, despite the occasional selfish attitudes you'll see with any large group of people. My position typically saw me interacting most with other front-end workers; cashiers, baggers, and the like. We also worked fairly closely with the floral department, which was only a couple yards away, and on particularly busy days they would act as cashiers as well. Management was pretty disorganized, but for the most part they were effective. However, store policy holds that employees cannot go on break of their own accord; this can cause problems if the person keeping track of breaks is caught up in some other task. The culture in the store managed to strike a balance between casual and professional; almost everyone worked hard and kept conversation to appropriate topics, with only the occasional slip-up. Minimal profanity, even then only in the break room. The most difficult part of the job was planning for anything outside of work. My schedule would vary wildly week-to-week and we would occasionally see changes only"
good,love the work just not enough pay ..............The union does not work for the people. this is a great store where i am now. they have a lot of managers that i think just take care to their people and no one else. it is not up with the competive spirit as I have know it before
good,Retail pharmacy business is changing. There are a lot of pharmacists in the company and little stores so that pharmacist can become staff there. If there are not stores you are most likely be a floater.
good,Its a decent job if you are looking for steady money while going to school and getting a degree but not somewhere I would want to have a career. The workplace culture is supposed to be like a team that functions as one unit but instead you just have a bunch of individual players
good,"Alot of responsibility with little pay.Union Store."
good,"Kroger was a good company that helped boost my career experience.  I was able to work in multiple departments and become accountable of various commodities."
good,"It seems like i work in a school house. I work with children, even adults act like children. I need a better work environment, with people who actually want to work. There are few people who actually work, and don't whine while they do it. You can't afford to live off of the pay, and they drastically cut hours refuse to give you more making it more unlikely for you to live off of it."
good,"nothing is consistent. This hopefully isn't every Kroger but mine had rude supervisors, messy workers, and environment. some decent days but they were blocked by days when 3 of you have to complete everything by 10 pm. constantly understaffed and not paid for all you do. I would be upset at the people who guided me but just tried to focus on the customer. the managers are great mainly some more preferred than others. never enough people to help complete everything. a plus is that you get paid."
good,If you are started out in a union its hard to get hours.  i got 10 hours one week.  Kroger is for young people needing a first job. The management at kroger was one the weakest teams I have ever work for.
good,"I really liked the people I worker with but there was no way to stand management. Management would always say they did not have a hand in the things that were obviously done by them. In the end you were blamed for everything even the things out of your control. it was more stressful than stocking shelves ever should have been, and everyone was hot and cold. When you consistently do the same work, the managers would find you great one month and terrible the next without you ever making a change. It was a good starter job and helped make ends meet especially when you attend university and still live at home."
good,I like the Kroger Company and have been shopping with them forever. The employees are great. Management not so much but they have since left company. But a good starting job for many young people.
good,"a typical day of work would be helping customer with their grocery needs, customers enjoy shopping at kroger stores, there is always free samples. yum"
good,They provide a good work environment . The benefits are better than most companies provide their employees. You get health and dental and vision insurance at a great rate. The give paid vacations and 3 personal days a year
good,"Like I said horrible job. The training was atrocious, months after being their I still didn't know how to fix the bottle machine. The pay was  too low for the back breaking work I was doing. AGAIN, Like I said this job was horrible"
good,Lots of new people and little time gotta be fast and efficient no WATER bottle personally my least favorite rule. You are always talking and helping customers!
good,"You'll get what you'd normally expect from a grocery store job. The tasks are simple and easy to learn, and from my experience in the Fry's deli, it was decently managed. The only issue is hours, you have to work for a year before you're guaranteed 20 hours a week, and even if you're hired as a full time employee the guarantee is still only 20 hours. If you don't have that guarantee, you can expect to get as little as 4 hours a week in the summer, which makes it impossible to afford the cost of living."
good,"I would have to say that the employees attitudes are the biggest perk of the job. You can make many connections, but the pay does not reflect all that you do."
good,"Kroger is very much all about their customer. Their employees however, not so much. As a cake decorator, weekends were especially busy. One weekend in particular, we received over 30 orders, most of which were being picked up the next day. I was one of two decorators, and the other had left for the day and would be off the following day, leaving nearly all of the cakes in need of pre-icing. With only two of us as decorators, an amount of orders this large would have been impossible to complete by any of the customer's pick-up time. Knowing how important it is for a customer to receive their order without delay, I chose to stay behind and finish preparing all of the cakes to be decorated the next morning, a decision for which I was reprimanded. Kroger did not see that I had the customer's want at heart, but I am sure they very much appreciated over 30 satisfied customers and not over 30 upset customers with late cakes. "
good,"This was an alright job in highschool, I wouldn’t recommend for a full time adult trying to make a living however. Most front end employees were younger and it was reflected upon front end"
good,The job wasn’t that bad. You were supposed to get at least 18 hours a week i got Less than that it was not enough money to live off of at all i would not recommend working there
good,The bowling parties and special appreciation events they have for their employees are nice. That was the highlight of working there. They try to show appreciation for their employees although sometimes they fall short.
good,While working for Kroger in many departments I always felt like I was behind due to the super competitive and stressful environment. Management is never appreciative of your work and will never tell you thanks
good,Kroger is a good place for a new worker to start at or if you're just trying to make a little extra money. All positions are good and all get the same amount of work.
good,Pays well depending on which union contract you're under.  Overtime isn't allowed unless corporate is coming.  Advancement is based on seniority and not who is the most qualified.
good,"checked out customers, bagged orders, counted registers, ran self checkout, put back stock away, counted safe, western union, money orders and lottery"
good,Nice job to work at depending on management meaning if the management is poor at the time so will the work environment. It’s hard to be able to do your job when several other things have to be done and employees will have to make quick decisions that management should be making. Work hours are flexible but that depends on your schedule and how your management schedules you according to available hours per department
good,"Kroger is a typical minimum wage, low barrier to entry, starter job. It usually involves physical labor, has no hope of advancement, and minimal pay increase over the years. Their Starbucks in particular pays less than a real Starbucks for similarly frantic work pace."
good,Kroger is a good place to start for a first job or someone who is intending on working part time while in school. I would not recommend it for a long term job due to difficulties moving up in the company and difficulties earning a living wage even when in a full time position.
good,"Kroger is great for a first job. Mainly middle-high schoolers paying their own phone bills or insurance. But if you have a car note, children, rent, credit card bills, etc... Kroger would still be a great second job. But as a primary job for an adult with real bills, it wont cut it! Not on its own..."
good,I worked in the corporate office.  I was a great place to work for years until management changes and it became a stressful situations. Needed to make a change.
good,I got the opportunity to be a cashier. It was fun and rewarding. But the management lacked in many areas. I loved talking to customers. And helping them find specific items.
good,"Management not so nice, and underpaid for work expected. But this is a excellent job for a high school student or a first job. workplace is safe, and no heave labor."
good,"I was in high school when I started and I have moved up in the company as the same as when I was literally growing up with them. Well of course you start small by pushing carts and then going to the register but if you show the potential in wanting to do more to learn about Kroger, the management will somewhat see that and may just give you opportunities to take. The pay is too small though."
good,The management could use some more work. Their is always scheduling issues and people are steady calling out. The atmosphere can be a bit hectic at times but overall it isn't the worst job
good,The work is great and fun and exicting and I love to learn new things and further my education but my boss has made it very hard to enjoy my work and doing at what I enjoy
good,"The management was very poor, they did not care about their employees. I was injured on the job and they did not care about doctors requests or medications I had to take."
good,I liked the people I worked with and the hours were the only huge downfall. I got good money and it paid for what I needed to pay for. I enjoyed most parts of the job.
good,Good part-time job for anyone. Average business for a grocery store. Opportunities in promoted and raises and growing with the company including management.
good,"Fast paced work heavily based on time. Great teamwork, and great opportunities to be trained in other departments for more hours. I found the mood of the store employees in this store is heavily based on HR."
good,I honestly did not enjoy working at kroger. The pay was terrible not even minimum wage. Was not a good first job experience. I would not recommend working there.
good,"Kroger is a very highly cultured place to work, but management choices are poor. The managers above myself were very self centered or had favoritism of employees which is not a good trait in that business."
good,Kroger is a good company if you work your way up in the company and put in the time. If you are new and have a college degree probably not worth your time. The work life balance is bad and management is constantly changing your schedule to better themselves in not  working late nights.
good,"People get away with too much, while others take the extra responsibility on from those who cannot do their job. Love the managers but some of the workers get away with a lot because they are a favorite."
good,"in the beginning it was enjoyable, but after a couple months and other people leaving it left gaps in scheduling and became hard to keep track, overall a poor experience."
good,"Pay is not the greatest here, 3 weeks paid vacation is definitely a perk, co workers are always cheap help since they don’t want to pay them with a good base pay."
good,"My typical day involved cleaning the bathrooms and putting carts back in the store."
good,After 5 years 3 of which have been in management I've learned the company has great goals but for management these can be unrealistic. I enjoyed my time working nights and some of the people there but I don't see it as a place that recognizes hard work and dedication.
good,They don't seem to care if you're sick or injured. They want you to work no matter what. When you have 15 min breaks they get down on me thinking I'm taking to long. But I'm not.
good,"I found Krogers to be unprofessional."
good,My overall experience with Kroger was a good one.  The only downside was the rude customers but I was able to maintain my friendly attitude and get on with my job after providing them with exceptional customer service.
good,I’m looking to continue to advance my career and I believe that can only happen if I look outside the company.   The company is going through significant changes internally to keep up with the change in customer demands and that’s leading to the changing or elimination of certain jobs in the future.
good,This is a great place for a teen to get their first job. It is very easy to learn and be successful everyday. I does get slow and somtimes routine but overall it is a good place to start.
good,"Too many managers, job is always on your feet, and they take so much out for union fees even though there is no reason you should be in the union. They work with your school schedule but they end up giving you little to no hours or way too many and mess with your schedule and you have to talk to one of the twelve managers above you to get it sorted out. They try to guilt trip you into taking other shifts even when you can't."
good,"Not the job you would expect in my opinion you can pick a better job then  the managers don't really acknowledge your work complain about the smallest detail, customers show more appreciation than the job itself."
good,The environment and people are enjoyable to be around. There is little to no help from management during the work days. I always came into work on time and never complained about any issue.
good,The job was pretty straight forward. Stock the shelves as much as you can before your shift is up. Help customers look for any items they need.  But the amount of physical labor and work you do is not compensated properly.  Also minimum wage of 8 dollars an hour when I work was not enough to meet cost of living.
good,Kroger's great job for kids starting out with a great first time job is an opportunity for advancement if you stay long enough all around the people are decent
good,"I hated the pay the managers and the benifits. About the only thing i liked there was my customers, but then again that just means they carry good food and have nice customers, as an employer they suck."
good,"Poor leadership. Soon as I joined my department, the manager wasn’t training me, he had other employees training me. Also got their employees working like dogs in small amounts of time. They rush you to get many tasks done. But they hate overtime. Your small pay is not worth breaking your back at this job. Go to H-E-B or somewhere better."
good,"The job itself wasn't bad, over time I developed nerve damage in my legs from this job, however, and the customers and management were often rude to the employees."
good,"poor management, lack of concern of the employees. Not paid good enough. Training poorly and didn't know how to show the employees the right procedure to fix broken equipment."
good,Sometimes we are asked to do tasks in which increase our workload to a level that is hard to maintain for no additional pay raise. The employees there are good but management does not feel the need to pay people more than $9 per hour.
good,"-management needs to learn to appreciate the employees they have"
good,"The pay is bad but then again they employ a lot of high school students so. You don't qualify for any benefits unless you work at least 25 hours per week. If you drop below that, your benefits get dropped. They do have nice benefits though for the employees that stay and work so many years and become full time."
good,"Pretty average all around.  Work life balance is fine, and pay is just ok.  Nothing horrible and nothing great.  Advancement is really not an option though."
good,Poor lower level management with upper level management being completely oblivious to all the problems at the bottom of the pecking order. They consistently screw up the schedules for everyone and will occasionally screw up your paychecks.
good,"There is clearly an element of favoritism among management. Keep your head down, and do your work well, you should be fine. Challenge the status quo, and you will find yourself being moved to a position that will eventually set you up the be laid off."
good,"In my opinion the company is generally trying to make it the family away from family."
good,"Store is always packed from Thursday-Sunday so these days go by fast, on these days it can get very stressful due to only having one person out pulling carts in and then the inside being low on baggers. The managers were very cool as well one of the floor supervisors. Only real advantage of being a courtesy clerk was that the schedule is VERY flexible. Disadvantages is the pay as well that advancement opportunities and pay raise's are few."
good,It was ok. It’s a good starting job not meant for full time. It helped me learn to be more social among others. I do recommend it for someone who is looking for a job while in school.
good,"I have been with this company for nearly 18 years, with approximately half of that time adequately staffed. I am running from the minute I step foot into the pharmacy. I have learned much in my 18 years, including what makes a good manager and what makes a poor one. Some days, I enjoy what I do, and I am good at it; but in this past year, sadly that is not the case. My current manager is so afraid of confrontation or change (I can only assume) that he refuses to see problems that are glaringly apparent; which include coworkers that so obviously do not know what they are doing (despite their six year tenure), that our work load is constantly increased. It is an understatement to say that I am tired of doing my job and also my coworkers. The most difficult aspect of my job is not only the former complaint, but the fact that, despite being part-time (for health reasons), I am consistently called upon to work beyond my scheduled shift. Also, I am the employee schedule writer and the trend has been observed that additional staff was needed as of April 2017. It is now March 2018 with no help in sight. Part of this problem is the inability to offer adequate salary to beginning employees. Personally I recently noted, that pharmacy starting salary is less than McDonald's. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the repeat customers."
good,"I have worked for dillons several times. it is a great part time job for extra money.  the schedules are not great, but they usually give you the amount of hrs that you are wanting"
good,"Management was slow to make deadlines putting more pressure on the department heads on a daily basis, otherwise very nice place to work and always busy."
good,"My fellow employees were great to work with. Management treated staff as servants and like they didn't matter. They would cut my hours each week that I worked for them, even though they would always ask me to stay past my shift time."
good,"As baggers, we had to go out on the lot to retrieve carts. Usually that was fine, but when it was extremely cold or pouring down rain it was absolutely horrible. None of the managers were too concerned about it; they didn't care because it didn't apply to them. "
good,"I am employed with Fred Meyer solely for reference purpose. I have no problem with Fred Meyer corporate, but I think that the larger Kroger company needs an overhaul."
good,"The people here are great, but the management kind of ruins it. They make it seem like they care about you but it's really only what is convenient for them. If you need certain days of the week off for other obligations (ie. school) then they decide to only put you to work 1-3 days out of the week even though you're available 5-6 days out of the week."
good,"It is a typical cashiering job, most low level employees are in high school and move on pretty quickly. Work is not difficult and you get a small discount."
good,"A typical day was dealing with associates and issues they had.  I learned a lot of software applications, which I love to learn anything related to computers. I loved doing payroll and recruiting.  I really didn't find anything hard about the job."
good,They have too many employees that don't like their job. It shows in how they deal with new employees their attitudes are pretty bad. They stress speedy check out and customer service. If I'm more concerned about speed then my friendliness level goes down. A few of the floor runners don't know how to communicate well. They will tell you how to do something then just walk off not making sure you understood...
good,They expect to much out of one person and when u ask for help there is none. Kroger as a company doesn't pay enough money to there employees. They never give raises to keep employees they would rather have have them quit instead of paying them more to stay.
good,"working at kroger was okay, the only complaint I have would be that they didn't really care for their courtesy clerks; baggers, cart collectors, and store cleaners. They made me stay outside in the middle of winter during a STORM to collect carts. Carts are more important to them than their employees safety. :)"
good,"Working for the store as a whole isn't too bad.  However, it is very clear that there is favoritism and unfair treatment.  There are also incidents where outside events take a toll on how you are treated by management even if the event was not work related."
good,Management was terrible. I worked there for 6 years and the last year and a half of employment with that company was terrible. Management doesn't care about their employees and then they wonder why their turnover rate is so high and morale is so low.
good,Ralph's company has great benefits but it takes forever to get ahold of someone to get them and union dues are mandatory to pay. They must be paid at a union office. Nothing is online. Managers are disorganised and sales are number one priority over the care of employees.
good,The company overall is great they have very good benefits and comfortable scheduling. the big issue is no real advancement and horrible pay rates with little opportunity to increase your pay rate per year. the other issue is pay rates tended to be different for different jobs which caused issues with keeping employees to certain departments.
good,"Working at Kroger, I learned quickly that it may not be as good as it seems. I did not enjoy my experience with Kroger. The management was terrible, and the union did not protect your job like they agreed upon"
good,"A fast pace, knowledgeable in what you are selling. Good co-workers to help you if needed. Co-workers from different department are helpful. Management was not good so people was not on the same page about everything. Work around your schedule either school or another job."
good,"Management only worries about themselves don't appreciate employees. Very unorganized, an unprofessional, to much favoritism. I did not like working there really because of all those reason but had no choice I needed income to be able to support me and my family"
good,"I enjoyed working there the employees were great, I worked there for 3 years. I worked in the front, as a meat and service deli clerk. I liked working there was a good job."
good,"Kroger is a poor environment to work in due to the effects of the Union. If you're willing to get involved at a very low pay rate at the earliest age possible, and stay with the company as a career, you can cap out at around 15.00/hr,"
good,"It was nice to have a position where I was working 6-2pm for 40 hrs a week, it was nice, until someone from 3rd shift came to 1st shift that had ""seniority"" over me, so I lost my position that I loved and was left with ""mystery"" schedules each week. I did enjoy the people that I worked with, but managers expect too much with little staff. Too much stress and little pay for the hard work i'd do and not appreciated for it."
good,a day in the deli is never the same all depends who you work with and the customers you help for the day. it is a job that can vary and be consistant all at the same time. it is a position to work as a team and independently  this why i like this enviornment.
good,Its ok but pay sucks. Not enough pay to deal with what associates go tjrough daily.employees should be paid alot more and treated more fairly no matter if is their firstday or their fifth year.
good,Terrible pay at times good hours kind of flexible it depends on the store overtime depends on the store you work at good 401k plan only certain stores get bouns check
good,as hard as they try to be professional they dont always manage to stay that way with their employees. while mostly friendly working here does sometimes make it hard to stay that way
good,It was a good work place but it wasn't good for me working full time hours and not getting a raise at all. That was really stressful because it didn't pay enough to provide for my family.
good,Great co-workers.  The work load is heavier than the time required.  Lots of pressure.  Work load for 2 people had to be preformed by one  person.  Not much support from management.
good,I felt that I was not getting paid what I should have for all that I did. They have strict schedules that I could not change. It was not a good experience for me when I wasn’t there
good,I have nothing to review. They don’t pay well. They rarely will offer you a full time position. It seems all they want to offer are part time positions.
good,The management where I worked was awful and they would put us in hours that we would specifically say to not put us in. The pay was average but for the amount of work that we had to do it was slightly unfair
good,"It was Alot of work dealing with the co-workers but over all it was fun."
good,"Kroger is a solid place to work- with several employment opportunities. The deli is one small area of work, Krogers offers several positions from part time to full time, over night to day work. Whether you want to stock the shelves overnight or interact with the customer's shopping during the day, Kroger has a place for you."
good,"There are departments within Marketplace stores in particular that get the short end of the stick. They only matter when sales numbers are under scrutiny. These overlooked departments have minimal theft prevention, the employees get pulled away from the area and used elsewhere frequently - such as for front end, ClickList, or whatever area is behind at the time - rather than hours being given to the employees of those departments. Or more help hired. And the management team dares not do anything about that in fear of losing their bonuses if they stay under a certain number of hours."
good,Kroger has a very vast knowledge of on the job training. They are the most innovative company in the market. Learning an training at your fingertips. I was in charge of overall daily operations and HR. Each managing partner would switch operational rolls every 6 months for experience and on the job training. My experience with Kroger management training was a catalyst for my success in the work force.
good,"The people at Kroger are nice for the most part.I did feel like I had a family. However, the job itself was stressful or overwhelming as a cashier. It is a good job if it is your first job or just need something to hold you over."
good,I enjoyed years at Kroger but then the company started treating its employees worse every year.  The store manager was very condescending to most of the employees. The customers in the area were wonderful to assist.
good,"Overall not a horrible company, but there have been some changes that have been made that does not really help the employee. Many long time employees are frustrated and wanting out. This is a very long-standing company, and although the time may be tough, the company always bounces back."
good,"I had a decent time working at Kroger in Loganville. It was a great first job for me, and my coworkers kept to themselves. The most enjoyable part about working their was break time."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Kroger as I met a lot of great people and learned a lot of skills, but it sometimes felt if you weren't Kroger ""material"" or didn't know the right people it could kind of end up being a dead-end job. I watched so many people basically stay in the same position my entire time at the store and though I moved up over the years, I never felt I truly had a job suited for a college graduate---at least in terms of how much money I was making. "
good,I've worked for Kroger for about 4 years but at different years.  It's an OK place to work but the hours they give you are not enough and they work off of union base so seniority always comes first
good,The pay was lousy for the amount of work you had to do and management did a poor job making sure breaks and lunches were given on time. The the rest of the staff was good to be around.
good,I was supposed to get a raise after 1 month but they would get mad when I mentioned it. They also refused to give me more hours when I told them I needed them.
good,It is retail go in knowing no work/home life. Training is minimal so if you have some retail experience you will be fine. Currently turn over is very high.
good,"Typical work day and/or week was always changing, sometime not in a good way.  There is many training failures in new systems, causing problems in the switch over.  Management was slow to response to direct questions."
good,Typical day at work was going to your department on time making sure everything looks good before stocking and then while you're stocking making sure that product that is expired is removed and scanned out. Making sure you are talking to every costumer and being friendly.
good,"A typical day is coming in to see who was working, who called in, and trying to avoid the newest workplace drama between coworkers."
good,"Depending on what time of day you come in will most likely determine what kind of day you'll have. Anytime before 3, you will be doing what's called picking, gathering the groceries. Starting around 3:30, you'll deliver the orders out to the cars, if all the orders are finished being picked."
good,Kroger would be a great job for a person who has no family and is looking for a decent paying job. Having a family and working the swing shifts makes it hard.
good,"I started working at Kroger while I was still in high school. I moved throughout the store and worked in several departments during my time at the company. I learned how to provide strong customer service during my time at Kroger. Management did their jobs fairly well, but always seemed to do the bare minimum. The workplace culture was good. People were friendly and tried to make you feel like part of a team. The hardest part of the job was preparing the store for increased sales during holidays, and not having sufficient help during those times. The most enjoyable part of the job was having the ability to work independently, the level of independence you were given depended mostly on the department you worked in."
good,"any job is simple in the store, if you just put some effort into whatever you are doing it is pretty easy. For the most part just be somewhat professional and do what you gotta do it'll be easy."
good,"okay first job didn't work for my scheduled. decent pay nothing to special, if you want to work certain hours you really have to push and push or you will just work randomly."
good,"It was a good first time job. I learned a lot about customer service and the service industry. I don't think I'll ever want to work in a grocery store again, but a good experience!"
good,"It started out as a great place to get your feet wet with corporate culture and I really enjoyed one of my first managers for a good nine months. Then they brought in a new manager and he turned over the entire management staff one by one and right after I left, he was fired for corruption."
good,"In managerial positions, there's a lot of stress to juggle ordering, stocking and customer service, all within just 40 hours and no expected overtime. The majority of managers, even corporate, just don't seem to understand how much labor goes into a department."
good,If you are to work with kroger don't be a courtesy clerk/bagger . You will have the most hours but the worst pay . Get out as fast as you can . If you can apply to a higher position.
good,"Comparatively, as a retail business, Kroger is one of the better to work for. That being said, still avoid it if you can. The managers rarely know their job, no one really cared at my store."
good,The customers at topicaly friendly as well as most employees. Management is terrible messing up constantly on schedules. Benefits could be better only 10 discount on Kroger products.
good,The standard is too impossible to achieve with the tools we are given. We are constantly put in no win situations and asked why we did not achieve the standard. I felt like a failure everyday.
good,"Its a very fast paced job. Because it is a part time position you are not offered very good benefits, or any paid time off. Although management will try to be flexible around your schedule."
good,Management does a poor job of protecting their employees. Kroger is very aware of the issues going on within the company but tends to ignore the obvious.
good,At the Kroger fuel center you will usually have 3 long shifts to choose from. The busiest shift if usually the mid shift and it can get very fast paced. You will learn about the safety regulations of managing a gas station. You're usually by yourself so there is not really anyone looking over your shoulder the entire time.
good,"Most managers act like they care but do not. People keep quitting. I have 10+ years experience from my prior job, my cap is 13.50 with contract rates. Employees have potential to make 11.00 to start. Benefits are good. I have been at multiple stores. You are often expected to do multiple departments or peoples jobs.They are always hiring and that is because the only start part-time (30-15 hrs), often do not work with your schedule for school or a second job(s) and do not pay very well. Original Kroger employees with my time make 16ish. There is employee of the month at some stores with a small reward, pot luck Christmas and a reworked employee reward system. You used to get recognized with shirts, aprons and Kroger gift cards by customer comments and compliments. Now, it is based off of stickers you earn to enter into a raffle. While there are fuel point and freebie perks loaded goodies to your card occasionally, unless you need the benefits (after 1 year), I do not recommend this company. They keep doing friendly departmental  competitions across districts with promised rewards that often do not show. Goals for departments to meet with added paperwork becomes unrealistic. Most enjoyable part of the job is working with some of my coworkers. They are union."
good,It's retail.The one I worked at had a lot of people who worked there for years and years so it was hard to get in without knowing someone. The one I worked for was in a racist area.
good,Kroger provides great management experience. Also great experience on how to run a business.  Operations food safety shrink over buy ordering technologies and HR
good,"Unless you can tolerate rude management , this Kroger ins't for you. The customers can be difficult at times but , it is very tolerable. The only problem I have with this Kroger is the Management and the hours."
good,"Great core values! If you are friendly and believe in putting the customer first, you should apply. benefits/discounts offered to employees. Never a dull moment."
good,"worked behind the cash register assisting customers with all technoligcal and questions along to do with the store.  AS well as stocking shelves, taking inventory, dumping trashes/ cardboard and other department duties as well."
good,"kroger was a great job to start at but if you wanted to make it your career thats where kroger lacked. It was super challenging to move up due to the fact that pronotions were based on who you knew and who liked you, not by what you knew and your work ethic."
good,I pay scale tops out at 18.50 which is lower then the starting pay at several other places. With the cost of living increasing in Portland it is better for me to start at a new job where I can advance and make a better wage
good,"I was promoted fairly quickly up the ranks. However the pay they were offering to run the nutrition department was only $8.75. I didn't think the pay a duties matched up fairly. However, Kroger is a fun place to work for your first job. I wouldn't make a career out of it though."
good,"Doing a great job is not enough...the manager alone, didn't take well to me and so black-listed me so as to thwart future attempts to be hired. Sad. I could have offered long-term loyalty, dedication and a positive attitude...all of the managers of all of the other departments got along famously with me! The staff all threw me a party when I had to leave even though I was just a temp and for only 6 months!! And because of my manager of my department, I never worked there again...I interviewed 5 different times for positions since then but they were all still taking words from my ex-manager. I would have been there for DECADES!..."
good,Would not give enough hours out. Hours always varied. Little pay and little amount for raises. Discounts were given on Kroger Brand items. Employees were nice. Management needed replaced. He had since been fired.
good,Vary fast going. No real job security. Upper management doesn't listen to anyone other than customers and other management on any issues. The only enjoyment was the regular customers.
good,"This job was very stressful for me, and I'm not likely to apply there again. My managers were not particularly friendly, and I just couldn't handle the amount of work that was given to me. Others may find it to be suitable job."
good,Management had NO respect for employees. Treated employees more like slaves than humans. They yelled at employees infront of customers. Only acknowledge the bad didnt congratulate for anything good
good,"Typical day, I walk in and go do the paperwork that needs to be done. After that I walk with a scanner to scan holes and other Balance on Hand (BOH). Then when the walk and paperwork done, I walk back into a mess of a backroom and try to organize it while working the product that came in to the shelf to keep the shelves full. I'll do that for the rest of my time and that can take me anywhere from 8 to 13 hours depending on how much product there is."
good,"Its a job, show up, punch in and punch out. They treat their pharmacy techs like minions. Management is a joke. The company doesn't care about their employees"
good,"This company was okay but I just felt like for the work that I was doing I could have been paid at least a dollar more. I cleaned restrooms, sometimes stocked, bagged groceries, retrieved carts, helped customers to their cars, did go-backs, cleaned spills, and the list goes on."
good,The only time it gets overwhelming is when its short staff and alot of customers to check out but the workers tries their best to give the customers the best quality service at a fast pace if possible.
good,"Management is not directly involved in day to day operations of support staff, so a genuine insight as to work product and environment is lacking.  Exceptions to policy is made when it benefits those held in favor."
good,Just a normal work environment with good people friendly and welcoming . break rooms were basic with chairs and tables older couches and the fridge wasnt cleaned out as much as it should have been but that wasnt my job so its whatever
good,"If you are in school or out of school, then this would be the place to work for. However, the chances of getting experience pay depends on which store you work at."
good,it was nice working there until everyone starts being messy and trying to get all in your business. I would have liked working there better if all the so called adults acted like adults. it was like highschool all over again.
good,Job was ok.. I like doing cakes and things like that but magnamenf was poor and pay was poor .. discount was good .. people was good there also fun place
good,"bad management, union wasn't fair, pay was low, don't advance very quickly at  all. I did over night stock, deli/bakery and produce. if I was given a fair chance and training it would have been a decent place to work. I liked that they paid weekly. I did not like the graveyard shift."
good,It's disturbing that the management changes so often. It throws all the order out in a heartbeat. It doesn't help when leadership changes too much too fast.
good,"your college education does not mean anything to Krogers. 2, 15 minute breaks. You have to work hours to earn a 10 cent raise. This does not pay enough for the hard demanding load that the associate carries. I would not recommend this company to anyone. This is why they have such high turnover."
good,"I didn't work at Dillon's along time. They weren't giving me enough hours to afford my rent payments. While I was working there the people treated me good. I worked nightshift, stocking items."
good,"Nice first job , not a good long term job. A typical day at work may consist of greeting customers and completing tasks. The associates work as a team"
good,A typical day of work consisted of working at a broken register. I learned how to work customer service in a fast paced stressful work environment. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers.
good,The stores are not given enough hours to get all the work done that is needed and when the district managers come in all they do is beat us down and threaten our jobs.
good,"I got promoted to assistant manager pretty quickly, which was exciting at the time, the excitement stopped when they wouldn't raise my pay. And they never did, I've talked to them about it but they just threw excuses at me. They overworked me, called me to0 often on my days off. They also call me to come in earlier. Made me work every holiday. The only plus to this company was the co-workers and the sick-pay."
good,i did not like my experience at Kroger. management was poor and co workers did not get along. we were always short staff causing stress that management did not care about
good,"Each store is different. You clean the store, make food, clean the parking lot, run the register, stock cigarettes, and handle the lottery / scratch off counter."
good,"It was a small town Kroger. All of the managers only let people they knew move up in the chain. Other than that, it was a nice job. I love the fast paced job of being a cashier there."
good,"Not a fun place to work, had to do more and more of the store managements duties, had to be on your feet the entire shift (no seating available for my position whatsoever, not even a stool), only sitting was on a break or lunch, more and more paperwork expected, raises only once a year, mandatory union company"
good,Any position below executive is very stressful. Overworked is an understatement. It is unfortunate to leave work everyday disliking what you do. Coworkers seem to try to win approval of management instead of performing the duties of the job.
good,"Main stocker of the dry grocery department, every now and then I'd have to help out the front checkout and the other departments when swamped and lacking the employees in that department."
good,Not very competitive pay but also not hard work. Worked there for over 3 years and many changes occurred. More bad nes than good. Its unfortunate because i actually really enjoyed my job to begin with.
good,Decent place to work if you are looking for a job that will work around your life schedule but are willing to receive minimal pay.  Easy with no job experience required.
good,Kroger is a good company to work for. Just not a career not many raises nor benefits. The work place was nice n coworkers were friendly. I like that it was union at Ralph's
good,A typical work day at Kroger is kinda laid back but not. I learned a new level of customer service from Kroger. There is no set type of customer. You are dealing with customers directly. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the politics of a grocery chain. The most enjoyable part was getting to different people over time.
good,"Working at Kroger is very challenging and stressful sometimes. Work is oftentimes done in a fast paced manner. I couldn't rely on it because it had a very flexible schedule making it hard to work 40 hours a week. However, it was a fun place to work at."
good,"Work experience there was okay but management in general needed to be better plus many of the employees don't seem to like the company much, it pays fair and honestly if you just need a job and are okay with putting up with drama and the occasional rude manager then have at it. They have a nice break room on the upside so there's that at least. Most of my co-workers were really relaxed and helpful to new people and so were a couple managers but there are bad managers everywhere I suppose. The hardest part of the job is normally boredom, you wouldn't believe how much one person can get done in two hours, most days was just facing stuff and helping people find products."
good,"worked hard for a grocery store job. "
good,"I love what I do with customers, but all of the hours have sent me looking for another opportunity. Overall the company works to give normal full-time and part-time associates great benefits, but as a manager we are taken advantage of."
good,"No matter how hard you work, it'll never be what they want. I work hard everyday and i still get told i am doing it wrong. The customers are rude, the employees are rude, I just do not get why anyone wants to work here."
good,"At Kingsoopers you do get at least 2 options in medical insurance."
good,"easy place to work, management isn't the best but its easy. Good place to work during high school or for a first job. Usually pretty busy because it is a grocery store, need good customer service skills."
good,"My typical work day is the same every day, I go in and start cleaning up the meat shop. I take out the boxes, the trash, and the pallets. it gets pretty boring. I like to mix it up."
good,Working at a Kroger store is good as far as the environment goes and the work itself. The immediate supervisors and managers seem to know what they are doing. The biggest issue is the pay and the hours. The pay is low compared to other retailers in the area. They also only hire part-time employees and no full-time unless at the manager level. This makes it hard to keep employees because they see the job as a temporary stay until something else comes along. They have issues attracting new employees because most people want a full-time job rather than part-time.
good,I worked for 2 years and got out asap. It was very hard to get promoted and they let things slide on the people they like better. Not fair. I like shopping there but work there is no way.
good,"Horrible management teams, a lot of scheduling conflicts. A lot of two faced managers on the teams, a lot of lazy managers that only care about themselves. Ten minute breaks only if they remember to give one to you which is rare. The only reason youll hear about someone working there for so long is because of the benefits."
good,"typical corporate retail. face paced which I liked. if management likes you, you can go far if they don't they wont let you go any farther even if tou are a hard worker."
good,"it was sometimes boring. i learned to work a cash register and run customer service, also how to pull tags , scan, and make the tags. the manager was okay he didn't help as much when we had rushes but other then that he did his job. it was't a hard part everything was simply it was just a little stressful when you are the only one that really know what you are doing and others do not. the most enjoyable  part was interacting with different people and seeing different cultures come in and out also when you participate in the job activities."
good,Assist customers at service deli counter and service their grocery needs. Management was really bad and by no way looked out for the employees best interest. Hardest part of the job was getting management to notice hard work and receive a promotion. Most enjoyable part of the job was my coworkers.
good,It is a usual job with not too many advantages or disadvantages. Work hours and pay aren't great but management was very accommodating.  The work is boring but its a job.
good,"Working in a grocery store has its own unique challenges."
good,"Every day you are required to be ready to work fast, accurately, and without mistakes.  Being human that is not the reality.  Expectations are very high.  The pay may be higher than other companies, but the stress level as a technician is too demanding.  Staff tend to group into clicks, certain staff will bully others.  Management will not support the staff.  If a complaint comes from a patient, the management will take the side of the patient regardless of the interaction.  The work load is more than the company is willing to compensate for staff.  We can not keep up.  Raises are minimal at best.  There is no recognition for a job well done.  I can't say there is a most enjoyable part of this job.  I do not recommend this for anyone who thinks they will have a chance to be promoted or given a raise to compensate for the cost of living."
good,"On A typical day you deal with hundreds of customer, some more rude than others. It can be very stressful at times. Management was okay at their jobs but they didn't really seem to work with single parents or work with you on hours if you needed more money. The hardest part about working at Payless/Kroger was having to work so hard for little pay. They always seemed to mess up my hours, even though when I clocked out at the end of the week it would tell me how ,any hours I had. When I would go and pick up my check at least 5-8 hours was ALWAYS missing. The only thing I enjoyed about working for this company was there great friendships I made with some of the other employees. I honestly wouldn't recommend working here unless it was a last resort, or if it was just a temporary job."
good,They always hiring. No job growth unless you're asked. You must always perform customer service to customers and they always right. You never get bored  on the bored and always something need to job.
good,"As a Cashier/Fuel Clerk, I exercised and improved my interpersonal skills, working under pressure, time management, cultural awareness and initiative."
good,"The job is consistent work throughout everyday and isn't too difficult, however there is a massive communication gap between stores and the corporate offices.  It is so egregious that most, if not all, other employees contemplate if the higher level management are purposely trying to make it a bad workplace."
good,"solid place to work getting better overall."
good,"Krogers has been my first job and I hate it and love it at the same time. The employees are usually great and easy days go good, but management is not the best, not to mention the crazy customers that come in and blame you for their everyday problems.."
good,I felt like when I was working at kroger that I didn't have a life of my own. I would be so tired after getting home that I wasn't able to bathe myself because I was so tired. I also had supervisors that made me cry. I would loathe getting up in the morning because I was still so tired. I didn't have time for myself.
good,"Pros"
good,"Overall, the job isnt terrible. Just depends what department and how your attitude is. Some management is great and some are just not meant to be in the position or have arrogant attitudes. The pay is not good, benefits are great once you get full time. Atmosphere differs from store to store, but usually good. I miss it some days and some days I'm glad I got out."
good,Typical retail job.  Lots of turnover.  Constant questionable changes to work procedures.  Mismanaged at times.  Its a job.  It got me through school.
good,"Poor management from the jump. HIGH TURNOVER RATE IN DELI DEPARTMENT. My responsibility was to cook and maintain ALL hot foods in the deli department. On my first shift I find myself standing behind a glass heated counter with no instructions on what to do. My manager who was suppose to be training me did not work that day and the only help I received was from an employee in the bakery department. Enough said right? Ironically, a week later I was being trained as lead cook. NOT because I earned it, but because no one else stayed long enough for management to be able to do their own job. They were constantly ""training"" new employees."
good,good company but needs to better structure the pay scale. you have outer departments helping the front end and never giving help back to outer departments. no one seems to know how to schedule or order.
good,"Worked there for almost three years, pay was horrible. Most not trained efficiently. You have to learn on your own or you will be lost. I was able to learn what I needed, but you have to have the drive otherwise they will not teach you."
good,"It sucks ,and the management in the CCK department weren't very friendly. The courtesy clerks do not like team work and can be very rude. When I would speak with one of the supervisors they wouldn't even turn around to look at me and acknowledge me while I was talking to them."
good,They force you to work on your scheduled days off. If you dont its an automatic write up. They treat the new guys bad. They make the new guys stay and let the old timers go home.
good,"This jobs Kroger offer are for school student , you don't get a lot of hour anywhere from 18-30. This schedule don't never be set it's  also all over and spreaded it out make it difficult to have a second job"
good,Not  enough balance for family and work. Not enough pay. Union job.. overall the people can be amazing but management isn't personable.. the job security is basically the best thing about it
good,"Loved my job so much, it was difficult to deal with upper management and the ever so quickly changing routines but I sincerely loved my job and the customers I served. Great starter job and can advance quickly if you want it and show you want it."
good,Each day is very regimented and structured towards growth of sales. Not the most employee friendly workplace but opportunity to climb the small ladder to a slightly better pay is always available.
good,"I have worked for two Kroger stores so far, and at both, there was little or no chance for any advancement, and pay/benefits seemed to be underwhelming at best."
good,"It is a hard place to work at. At times it is very stressful dealing with the customers that become angry with you. The management does not stand up for their employees. "
good,"Salary positions are long days and nights to include holidays."
good,employees are nice management suck the hours suck and the pay suck was on 4 hour shifts making 8.65 wasn't even worth my time then there were young kids playing around and I had to take up the work slack but nothing was ever done when they started getting more hours than me I left not family time either taking days off was hard
good,"had training with little chance of moving up "
good,Either shopping or attending to the customers that pick up their groceries. Some days not much time for breaks or to eat. Always moving. Learning their computer system and answering the phones when customers arrive.  Loading totes on to the pallys to take the groceries out.
good,"Overall, if you're looking for something that will make you money, Kroger is not the place to go. Pays just above minimum, with little room for advancement. I also, in just over two years working there, outlasted every other coworker and manager, as they are all either quitting or getting transferred. If money was not a problem however, it is not a bad place to work. Always guaranteed a break, work in a store surrounded by food, and you get to know your coworkers fairly well."
good,This place is an ok place to work depending on what mood the management is that day. They can be very mean and the work life balance is very poor since they will give you tons of hours but just enough that they do not have to give their employees full benefits.
good,Management was terrible and never helped with the job that needed to be done and they were inexperienced. Some good benefits such as discounts on vehicles and computer systems.
good,"I block the shelves I also stock on occasions if I'm needed. I also stock the bread, I can operate a fork lift . I am experienced on a cash register along with customer service"
good,"Easily becomes stressful. The managers don't care, they only appear when something is really wrong. Hardest part of the job was customers............................................................."
good,"This company tries to pretend it cares about its customers and its employees, it doesn't."
good,I made alot of friends working there but there was a heavy workload and not enough pay. It was hard to get approved time off because there wasn't enough help.
good,"a typical day consist of moody workers and rude hungry customers and managers who dont know how to manage things. ive learned how to cook foods i never tried, weigh food, make managment decisions. they're nice, but they also can be lazy and focus on stuff thats not all important at the time. overall the only thing i like about the job is weekly pay and time off when wanted."
good,"Mangement sucks, Unorganized. I hate working there . Flexible hours but they work people way too much for little. There benefits are not good and they will take 8.00 dollars out of every paycheck if you join the union."
good,"On a typical work day the mangers were usually in a poor mood. It made coming to work depressing and not worth it. They also did not like it when college students couldn't come to work due to tests, exams, or college activities that they would not let us off for."
good,company pays well but you have to pay union dues which takes away the majority of your paycheck and management sucks. Don't expect slow pace work. Always be ready to answer questions for both customers employees and
good,Employees are over worked and under paid management is lazy. Schedules are never the same but most of the management understands if you need work life balance.
good,"Very unorganized ,and management is unwilling to improve such an environment that allows costumers to steal and employees to refuse doing their work. The hourly pay is not enough for all the work they have me do along with the work they have me do that I'm not supposed to  do , there really is no enjoyment  in this job  no chance for advancement either."
good,"many things are talked about like work life balance, but are always set aside to achieve executive metrics. It is good honest work for those that have a good work ethic."
good,Everyday at work was a rush but fun. I learned how to bake sweet goods and have good customer service decorate cakes. The hardest part was when it got busy and some time I was by myself. The good parts that i got to met amazing customers and and learn great things
good,The store was basically run by the local high schools graduating class. The hire like the place is a revolving door. I watched plenty of kids get pushed to the front end from every department and given the heaviest hours until they quit.
good,"Busy culture, very great atmosphere for team members. Management has minimal training. Great opportunity for advancement. Union based company. A lot changing soon"
good,"It was an overall okay experience, but when it came time to transferring your papers to a different store, they used every excuse they could think of to deny your rights of transferring to a new store even if you were moving."
good,good place to make money if you can handle the work pace but the management did show favoritism and if they didn't care for the worker they can make there life miserable at work.
good,"Kroger is a good company to work for. Generally flexible hours but the pay is awful and it's really hard to get an official full time position. I work 40 hours every week besides one 38-39 hour week once every 3 months to keep me from triggering a full time opening within my store. Pay also isn't great, I make 8.50 per hour to do supervising, customer service, cashiering and bookkeeping."
good,"While my Kroger experience may not speak for everyone, I felt overwhelmed during my two summers at Kroger. Each day was dependent on how many people would show up and what time you started and ended. My particular Kroger wasn't great since my department usually seemed to be understaffed, especially on Sundays. The I did enjoy talking to my co-workers however, they were the reason that I went back for a second summer and I overall, I feel like this was a reasonable first job experience."
good,The work place is nice with people being willing to train. The best part was being able to take classes to step up to the next level of pharmacy technician. With low pay wages its hard to keep any employees. They do not work really well when it comes to school or other personal reasons. A typical day of work would just be a pharmacist and technician since there were not enough people to cover shifts.
good,"productive, comfortable, and organized work place to be in. A typical day to work in requires stocking, helping customers, and working fast and as effecient as possible."
good,Fine I wouldnt recommed to anyone. You dont get to do what you are hired to do. I hate this place. Management SUCKS!! DO NOT WORK HERE. GO WORK At WALMART!
good,"Job is for a young kid. No one respects their elders! Payrate is not good. However, they tolerate alot from employees. The customers are awesome and can be a bit spoiled at times."
good,"Workplace is fun and carefree but mostly due to the coworkers."
good,"At that stage in my life was the right environment for growing my mindset in the retail world. At the young age of 19 gained valuable experience in management of goals, and working with people of similar to older age."
good,"Working for Kroger in Frankenmuth has its good sides and bad sides. Fellow employees and manager are a great group of people. "
good,"I work at the fuel station. They require you to be 5 different people all in one, minimum wage job. You have to be an accountant, costumer service, janitor, cashier and stocker all while taking care of costumers. Breaks are barely a thing. The only reason I get a lunch is because it would be illegal if I didn't take one. I'm also supposed to get a 15 minute break but that never happens. There honestly should be two people at the cramped little hut. One on the register and the other accounting and cleaning, and helping troubled customers at the pumps when he's not counting. Would make the place 10x more efficient and make the costumers a lot happier with faster services."
good,"Great associates to work with best part of job was customers who became"
good,"Most of the employees do their job and are good people. However, the few that do not do their part as an employee makes it difficult on others because they will have a larger workload."
good,"over all great company to work for. You have to have the right district adviser to excel in this company. grate support from regional adviser. amazing managers, great associates."
good,You are required to do a lot of physical stuff. Pushing carts all day can be very tiring on the body. If you love interacting with customers this could be the job for you. Many benefits for working at Kroger.
good,A typical day at work for me includes beng moved from job to job because there are call offs or scheduling issues. Which in turn makes it hard for me to do the job I get paid for. I'm only part time because I can't get in to train for full time. My hours are always getting cut and I can't live off of what I make because of it. The best part about working there though are my coworkers.
good,I accomplished nothing. was never even given a chance. no one cares. no one matters. they focus on what has little notice or affect and disregard what should have some sort of meaning.
good,"Being a cirtacy clerk means you do all the jobs no one else wants to do. The managers treat there checkers like there own children and expect us to do everything in our power to make there job as easy as possible( not what my job description emplied). We only get 10 minute breaks depending on how many hours you work that day ( 4 hours one break, 7 hours 2 break) around there."
good,I worked there for over a year. only job ive had where you had to wait a full year until benefits. demanded so much with little rewards. turn over rate for the store was way too much because of the atmosphere.
good,I love working in the pharmacy. I have only been there for several months now but it could possibly become  in the near future career opportunity.
good,"The demands of working at a Kroger store can vary, but often lead to a skewed balance in a worker's life. Pay and benefits can be competitive with other retailers. Promotion opportunities can become stagnant after a while, particularly after earning a quick bump to a Front-End Supervisor position where the opportunities tend to stop entirely. The fast-paced environment can allow outgoing people to thrive on the challenge; however, those who are more soft-spoken can (and often will) be overwhelmed by the everyday requirements of the job. Despite that, the company offers several departments within each store, many of which can benefit from new learners and experienced workers alike, so choosing a new department will often refresh an employee's drive. Many skills can be earned through Kroger, including those that translate very well into office environments or even leadership roles. Overall, the company is a good starting point for those new to the workforce, but beware of toxic work relationships. I personally recommend an employment lasting about four years in different departments in order to gain the necessary experience for more rewarding companies."
good,it is my first job during high school and has served its purpose in being a job. time for something more adventurous. would like to not work 3rd shift anymore.
good,"I can not begin to fully express my gratitude over the camaraderie I have with my co-workers. All these years with them, the ups and downs, have all been made better just with their presence."
good,Kroger was okay for a first job but definitely not something I would consider a career choice. I liked nothing about other than the small paycheck I received. I was lied to by management and never had the opportunity to move up like I deserved.
good,"I've known allot of people that have worked there for years and are content and happy with what they do."
good,Fun place to work to make extra money or as a part time job. Management seems to change often which makes things difficult.
good,"I started off being payed $8.25 an hour. Although I applied for the bagger position, they gave me a cashier position because girls are seen as ""more desirable"" as cashiers, making customers more willing to continue coming to the store. My managers were not well liked, and the customer service representatives were ineffective."
good,"Although, everyone at Kroger was agreeable to work with, the management in my department was not the best at scheduling. Many times we were short-handed and at times, I was schedule to work a position I had no training in or previous experiences that proved I should not work a certain position. For example, the first day I worked the frying station, I was not trained and was left at the station by myself, while we were shorthanded, and something in the oils or seasonings gave me an allergic reaction on my forearms. A few days after this experience, we were shorthanded yet again, and I was asked to work the frying station again, by myself with no training and possible allergies to something within the workplace."
good,"Stocking shelves, Assisting Guests, Doing returns and doing clean ups. Learned Labeling and how to tell things apart. Co-workers very distant and noncomunicative"
good,Kroger was not a job I looked forward to going to. I didn't learn anything working here. Management really didn't care about you and seemed to act like nobody but other managers and supervisors knew how to do their job. Oh and I started out getting payed $7.25 and got a 5 cent raise after a year and being promoted to dairy clerk.
good,I like the people and personalities of the workers and managers. Customer satisfaction is very important and working environment is good. Typical days at work is very busy and on going. The hardest part is trying to always keep the customers happy because if we don't have an item it kind of ruins their day because they specifically came to our store for that product.
good,"Kroger does not like to pay their employee alot, most of the facility equipment are never working and would rather harm you instead of making your job experience better. "
good,"I worked in the Deli department, and it was a big mess most of the time. Training was sub par and we were almost always understaffed. Management didn't really seem to care if we were understaffed or not, and didn't listen much to the employees complaints about the department. However, it was a job and I did get close to a couple of my coworkers."
good,"The job itself was easy, which was stocking shelves and moving pallets in the back room. Some of the older employees were always grumpy and rude. One of the managers was extremely rude. I was also working with some great people as well, which made my experience a little better."
good,Working with the Kroger company seemed great in the beginning but after 2 years I felt stuck. I was wanting to move up with the company but they never gave me the opportunity to do so.
good,"For starters this was my first actual job. The atmosphere was outdated with paper peeling off the wall, but the staff keep the workplace busy. My job was to clean the bakery,deli, and sometimes  I would have to take the place of another when they couldn't come in on a certain day. The management though in my view was unstable but overall did their best to keep everyone on track."
good,"depends on your location. Very fun place to work, wage or based on experience. Attendance is important union and union reps in each store to help clerks with issues."
good,"The job is very demanding, there are a lot of tenure people who work with the company who are oppose to change. No work life balance at all"
good,The job was great i loved doing labor work. Loading and unloading packages is lretty easy if you love labor work. Keeps me busy and moving so i domt have to be in one place the whole time.
good,"I don't really think it's a good place to work just the people over there and the environment is just uncomfortable . People are always worrying about your personal life they are worried about the wrong things at times . Some don't even know how to talk to people in a good manner. I use to love working there , it was my first job and then it got to the point were I hated being there ."
good,"As a deli clerk I would provide customer service, slice meat and cheese, and clean. I learned how to work around a food industry. Management was fair. My co-workers were a team and worked well together. The hardest part of my job was constantly being understaffed and having to many orders than a single person could handle. The best part of the day was at the end of the day when I could see that I had done a great job at providing service and maintaining the deli."
good,A typical work day with Krogers is fast and customer friendly and fast. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and seeing the customer smile everyday or even extending a hug if needed.
good,This is a tough company to move into a management roll unless you are hired from outside the company. The pay is lower than a lot of companies and there is a strong divide between hourly and salaried employees and the way each are treated.
good,Working here was decent. It was a great experience that I gained from the job. The only thing that the company could work is finding patient supervisors.
good,A typical day was going to work clocking in and proceeding to do several tasks provided by management. I learned a lot about customer service. Management was constantly changing and always productive. My co-workers each had their own individual jobs that they accomplished at productive pace.The hardest part was the stress. The most enjoyable parts of the of the job was the different tasks to keep you busy.
good,"Good place for a first job, very flexible with hours and school. Very friendly people to work with. Discounts on all Kroger brand products and extra discount during holidays"
good,"When i first started with Kroger it was a fun experience being that it was my first job. As time went along i realized this store has alot of problems that it needs to fix within itself. As far as the pay, it is terrible. We dont even recieve minimum wage. It's a great store but it needs to improve on certain areas."
good,"Management was not the best, however all the younger employees were great to work with.  The older ones who have been there for years and years brought a bit more drama and complaining to the day.  Most days, especially in the summer, it is always busy and there is always more to do than what you have time for.  However, once school starts it slows down just a little bit."
good,Kroger is a corporate climate and sometimes the decisions that they make are not the greatest. They do not take care of their employees like i believe that they should.
good,most customers were cool occasionally you get the rude ones and you better hope they didnt have coupons either. some supers are cool others not so much. management does not care about the front end. its your fellow coworkers that make the day worth it though.
good,I use to like to work for Kroger but now its become unbareable to work at. Not enough hours for the employees. Customers act like they work there. always demanding the unbelievable things.
good,"Kroger was probably the easiest job I hae ever worked. They typically would schedule more people than you really needed to get the days tasks done, so there was a lot of down time. The pay was really low and the only reason I stayed with Kroger as long as I did was because the people were nice."
good,Work was easy but management did not work with workers to move up in their ranks or work with students and their school schedules.
good,"I learned computer skills, interpersonal communication skills, management styles and how to cope with a lot of stress and multi task. i taught a lot of well educated people and also some not so educated, all the while remaining a team player."
good,"Great co-workers that helped me deal with extreme difficulties, they became my best friends and felt almost like family. A lot of customers were friendly and a smile was normally contagious. Management is fear based and not incentive based, positions are filled based on who is the favorite and not who is the most capable, empty holidays are pressed to try to attempt to keep PR alive but it always falls desperately short and always flusters and doesn't make up for the rude customers and unsupportive managers. The lack of understanding brought forward by the higher ups can only be competed with by robots."
good,"Pay doesnt start out well, and you now have to wait for benefits. .. but if you can wait the benefits it outweighs the pay. Flexibility is ok...management can be good or bad depending on person"
good,"Pros- I have some customers that love coming in my line, some i see every week always make my day."
good,Employed as overnight baker.  Did my job well and was getting more work to do - but at other stores.  My schedule was frequently messed up.  The employees were fantastic though and I really miss working with them.
good,"At the time I had worked for them back in 2012, they had pretty bad management. I know that since I left in 2013 they got rid of the bad managers and I heard it improved since. Pay wages I heard still aren't the best though."
good,"Not much possibility for advancement withing the position, but the position was very flexible, the co-workers were nice, the job was not physically taxing."
good,"It was a very unorganized place, could not tell who the managers were. Lots of different bosses telling you different things."
good,"At Kroger's there is always something to do, either it's cleaning, taking care of a customer, or bringing in carts from outside."
good,enjoyable first job but no room for advancement great initial employer but i feel like i stayed too long to be happy
good,"didn't know what to expect as a sophomore/junior in high school,"
good,Employees are not treated right. Our union employees don't get what they should. There is an employee I work with that has been here for 8 years and makes 9.05hr. The employees are great
good,"Never ending days with pushing carts and having to clean bathrooms. You are at the bottom of the food chain and don't get benefits, commission, tips or a high salary."
good,"i like to work there but they have different  schedule every week and i don't like that"
good,"This job required standing long hours a day. Providing great customer service is a must. Coworkers were very nice, made the job go by smoothly."
good,A typical work day is unfortunately picking up the pieces behind someone else.  I have learned not everyone has a strong work ethic.  Management tends to do what is personally best for them versus what is best for business and store morale.  Some of my co-workers are the best you could ask for while others seem to do just enough to get by and collect a paycheck.  The hardest part of my job is not receiving the recognition of your hard work day in and day out.  The most enjoyable part of the job is self satisfaction knowing you did your best despite what work obstacles you walked into that given day.
good,"can be a good atmosphere depending on the store, same for management. crazy hours including weekends and holidays, can be a good company to work for as long as you don't mind the hours"
good,It was an interesting environment. I got along well with my coworkers and we had fun while working. Management wasn't that good. They treated lower level employees like they weren't really worth anything.
good,"Working for Kroger gave me an opportunity to learn about food and health awareness. I received calls from customers daily who had questions and concerns about food ingredients, allergens, recall products, etc. I enjoyed working with my team, we all got along very well. Co-workers became like a family."
good,"While I enjoyed my time at Kroger, I felt that I was burnt out from the physical labor, lack of employees and overnight shifts, which is why I am now seeking a new job."
good,It was nice seeing new people and regular customers daily. But dealing with some management was horrible. The head manager transferred or fired the few managers what actually cared about the employees. Low pay of course. Not a long enough lunch. And you get blamed for things other people did.
good,A Typical day at Kroger was very busy. Sometimes I would have to cover 2-3 departments in one day because lack of staff. I learned that I can multitask. My co workers where not social. The hardest part of the job was trying to cover everyone shift. The most enjoyable part was the friendly customers.
good,"Bad hours, not a lot of benfits till you work there for a year. Nice to get payed every week.But union fees are out of this world"
good,"schedule was graveyard, not my favorite. coworkers were good people.  Management was positive and helpful.  Night at work consisted of stocking, merchandising, and ordering product."
good,"a typical day at work was okay. Work on Sundays were very busy and often ran out of plastic, paper bags , and the lobby with the carts was always empty. I learned too work hard with a community. management was poor because lunch and breaks were not giving on the right time. some co-workers were very friendly and some just gossiped their whole shift. my manager was being stingy with the hours. the hardest part of my jobs was pushing carts for an hour straight because it got tiring. the most enjoyable part of my job was bagging groceries and talking to the customers."
good,"Pretty good for retail. The hours are OK. The benefits are OK, Like a lot of retail, the turnover is high. Management is stable and the care about the job you do."
good,Work can be tiring and slow or really fast and busy. I love who I work with for the most part and management is alright but they do have favoritism. I learned where a lot of items in the store are so I can help directing a customer to what they need. Enjoyable time being busy so time flies.
good,While working there I had a manger that drink while on her break. She was an alcoholic. Working with my coworkers was like a day in high school all over again.
good,"Working at Kroger is a typical high school job. The hours were physically demanding for low wages. However, it facilitated for later jobs in terms of physical longevity."
good,"This is an interesting company to work for, after you have had little to no training they throw you into the job and expect that you do the job like you have been there for 10+ years.  I will say that the most enjoyable part of the job is working with the customers that come through... without the attitudes of calm and patience that they have I would have left there a lot longer ago."
good,"Most people start off bagging groceries, and work their way up. Lots of turnover. It makes for a great first job, but there isn't a lot of learning or advancement opportunities for a vast majority of the employees."
good,"Every day was pretty nice and enjoyable, though sometimes could be overwhelming for too many expectations. I was expected to do many jobs, as which I did. However I was taken advantage of for my hard work, and the Union used its wage standards against me to get more work out of a hard-working employee for little money in return to barely support myself. I was expected to work 4 jobs, bagging, produce, nonfoods, and floral. My hours were slashed in half from a department cut. Honestly just a very disappointing experience for the most part."
good,I worked there for 2years and it was rough. I started working there fresh out of high school. I was thankful for the job it helped me pay for school but the working conditions could get tiring. Not everyone puts for the same amount of work effort so those who do put forth effort become tired faster. Supervisors and those in higher positions tend to complain about any amount of  physical labor that they may have to do because of a lack of them scheduling enough employees. Once you're put on schedule it's hard to get off for anything even emergencies. Favoritism may sometimes be shown towards workers who make them selves available at any time to come in. A lot of women with attitudes can be a problem. If you're not liked by one of your supervisors be careful because they may do anything to get you fired. To be honest best thing is to come In do your work and stay to yourself as much as possible. I never worked in the deli. But everyone who has worked in the deli with the exception of the older ones who never left hated it. They never got their discount working conditions were rough. Probably the most physical labor in the store next to stocking and meat department.
good,"Working at one of the busiest Kroger Marketplaces in its respective district, the work would consistently seem unending and at times, chaotic. As for the employees, they are a group of fabulous people who work way too hard and make way too little. I started here at age 15 as a courtesy clerk - pretty much the bottom of the food chain - and was in the next year made a supervisor with much more responsibilities. The aspects of this position made me aware that i was respected by all my fellow co-workers, i used this positivity as motivation and turned a group of employees into well connected colony of people. It made me realize that hard work is what it takes to be a leader, and the fact that i had achieved that status gave me a sense of pride.  Kroger was my first official job and a tremendous learning experience. Until i found out what all my friends were making at their jobs with much less of a work load. Kroger does not do well in the recognition and promoting of it's employees. You typically wont get much more than what you started with in terms of wages."
good,very fast paced had to use the bathroom in between customers and not able to have a break.I enjoyed my co-workers and getting to meet new people. i think the hardest part of my Job was dealing with aggressive customers
good,"The pay isn't good for the work load. Not a lot of benefits unless you are full time.I enjoy my co-workers, but management doesn't seem to converse with each other a lot of times.The training isn't the most extensive."
good,"Work in the produce department can vary drastically from day to day. Sometimes, you may find yourself standing in place for 8 hours cutting fruit. You might be stocking the produce displays, or putting away a delivery. Occasionally there may be close to nothing going on, but most of the time you'll be running between produce, floral, and the cash registers, because the front end never schedules enough workers."
good,"Working at Kroger's wasn't at all bad. Sometimes it felt unfair because the managers would often ask me to bring in the carts consecutively instead of taking turns with the other courtesy clerks. At one time during my working there they called me in because there was a courtesy clerk that called in sick. When I arrived I was thanked for showing up and I felt that I was doing a great service. About 10 minutes later the clerk which was ""sick"" arrived. After asking what was the deal he said that he was going to show just a little late. I then asked to go home but the managers said that the other clerk went home. Sad and dejected I returned to my post only to see later that the ""sick"" clerk was still there. Over all the work experience there was moderate but that incident really disillusioned me."
good,"Stock shelves, bag groceries, ring groceries up, refund customers, western union, money orders, front end supervisor keep flow of customers moving through. Learned how to do numerous things western union. money orders, U-scan, fuel station, and inventory."
good,"I have been with the company for four years split between two tenures. I find that Kroger is more concerned with money than people, more concerned with trendy ideas than sustainable business plans, and more concerned with happiness of the CEO and president than with the happiness of customers and associates."
good,"the management could be way btr, i was fired on my 45th day of my 45 day prbationary period due to being late ONE day, and still working a couple hours later to make up for it, which was approved by my department management. funny how i was ""released"" on my final probationary day 10 mins before my shift ended. They mad eme work yesterday on thanksgiving 12-8pm and i got no family time with my kids. a lot of the customers have great reviews about me in dairy. i always wear the fingerless gloves to help so i didint mess up my hands. Got shining stars and everything, worked hard and did what i was supposed to and more. I dont think this was right and im goin to someone about this, i know this was a bullcrap decision made by the highest management because i can reapply if id like to, LOL as if id work for that guy again, he lost a good worker and customers are gonna let him know when they dont see me workin there anymore. i was givin only a wanring for being late once because they want me there, but high end management is terrible, they dont tell you anything rly, train you right, and only do things convenient for them. its heck with you and all for them. deli manager is awesome, asst manager, and a couple others, but the ""high-end"" managers will take no blame whatsoever, they are always right even if given evidence of being wrong, and make extremely poor decisions. They also let some of these other employees get away with quite a lot. I think the decision against me was extremely unfair for the amount of work, being called in and everything i did not only for my department, but"
good,not enough communication between managers and what needs to be done or what they would like done is not clear...some stores play favorites on what needs to happen within the company...expecting more time at work than with family is to much..pay is very low for the amount of time put in
good,"Let me first say that Kroger is a stingy company. Their pharmacy technicians make the lowest wages compared to all other retail pharmacies. I've been there two years and barely scrape 9 dollars hourly, while the CVS down the road from us STARTS at $12...This obvious discrepancy in pay makes me unloyal to my employer. If my wages were increased by even just a dollar, I would be much more appreciative of my job. I am currently applying for jobs elsewhere."
good,"Fred Meyer Jewelers, as with most companies has gone through significant change over the past several years. I will remain professional and leave it at that,"
good,"A lot of the co-workers, are friendly and get along pretty well with each other. But I swear in each department there was some type of drama or someone complaining about someone else. It just seems like there isn't enough help to get the job done. I had no personal or job related issues with management or the people above me but then again I never really had much interaction with management, but I can't speak for my co-workers. I've enjoyed my time at Kroger's, but I feel it's time to move on."
good,you always have a bad apple in the bucket. The pharmacist help you to learn what needs to be done the right way if you need help .
good,"Good place to work."
good,just depends on who you know and where you go.  can be great can be horrible.  hope is your best choice.  hopefully it will get better one day
good,My typical day at work is quite only due to fact i work night. I've learned how the business operate's and learned the history of kroger. theres really nothing hard about my job simple task with easy instuction. The most fun part about my job is pleasing a customer.
good,a typical day at work is bagging the items and pushing the carts in to me there isnt a hard part the most enjoyable part is leaving
good,i worked here for a year and two months and the entire time was a battle. i suffer from depression and anxiety and they'd constantly stick me on a short register which was over all the worst spot to put someone with my mental disorders because it requires a lot of tolerance to the point where i'd become overly exhausted rather quickly. worked in the bakery department for a while but that was short lived because of a situation with an assistant manager of the department that was handled VERY poorly and i was the one who was sent to a different department when i was the victim.
good,Went in at mid-night and stocked shelves and cleaned up work area.  Also used floor jack.  Fellow employees were nice and fun to work with.
good,crew was ok. Union leader a very nice guy. Night supervisor was very abusive to many of the night crew. Don't know how management was. I was never there during the day hours
good,"the pay could be better. you get discounts on food that is Kroger brand only. the hardest part was working with people that have been there a while and try to get the new people to do all the work. short staffed or not, you are still required to complete hours in the time given. sometimes they may be lenient. even though you cook the food, you dont get special discounts. you dont even get to eat free but you get free samples so dont go to work hungry. the customers are the best part of the job."
good,"It was an okay place to work, the only thing which made it bearable, really, was the nice people I worked with and the customers. The company itself has much work to do to get to a place where they are treating their employees better. They won't fire the ones who don't work, and do nothing to reward those who work very hard for them."
good,"The only job where I worked the third shift, I enjoyed stocking of products in an efficient manner, also served customers to find what they need."
good,"Don't really have must to say. The job was good, but management could have used some more training.  The company as a whole was a good company but their pay was way too low for the job that I was doing."
good,"Needs improvement on management, store organization. Breaks and lunches are to short. Management needs to invest more in co-worker unity and production."
good,I despise working here the managers never thank you for going above and beyond and getting a day off that you actually request is like pulling teeth
good,"My work was specifically in the Gateway location deli, can't speak for all stores. It was a poorly maintained work environment with negligent management, equipment issues and maintenance requests went ignored for as long as possible, with lazy and short term fixes when they did happen. Deli was understaffed with the lowest pay rate of all departments. The company in general showed very poor handling of racial/cultural inclusion, with many of their attempts being embarrassingly offensive."
good,"My typical day at work would be really based on customer service as far as me dealing with customers and helping them with anything they needed help with at the workplace. I learned to be patient with  customers, help them as much as you can, put their needs first, and to always smile and be kind. My coworkers were kind and fun to be around very bubbly and helpful, my hardest part of my job would be multitasking in three different departments at one time. last but not least the most enjoyable part of my job was being with my coworkers and helping customers."
good,"You get a union job. . so there are basic benefits. .the job it's self is basic. .the challenge is getting a living wage. .meanwhile dealing with a lot of mental stress from managers to customers. Which is to be expected. .but when the management and union don't support or help. .it really takes a toll on you wanting to even be there. Like any place its about falling into a click. .and now they even have exported their own hiring to a company I hear. Shows how much they value employees . .with a union that apparently is slowly letting them strip positions, hours, pay, and benefits with no more fight as unions have been known for. .not a place to stay, a place to keep afloat which with hours cut and jobs being taken. .even that is not dependable."
good,"Kroger co, is a good employer. Many opportunities of professional development, continues training program for all levels of management...poor life balance"
good,"My coworkers were decent people. I even made friends with a few of my coworkers before I moved to New York City. I would have enjoyed my time there if not for a multitude of things that made my job less-than-enjoyable and more stressful than it needed to be."
good,"Typical day at work is very fast paced, I urge you to know the store and what it's about before applying. I learned more about grocery retail and stocking. Management is not great at Kroger's as you move up there is more communication, as a new guy there is downward communication that is mainly given to you by your other co-workers who train you. No hard part, but no enjoyable parts either."
good,"At the location i worked at my day started out with me clocking in, locating the manager or team leader in charge at that time of day, and try to find out which register to sign in on or if i should let someone out for break/lunch. They taught me how to operate their self-check station. Working with my co-workers and running self-check was the most enjoyable part of my job. They had too many managers though. Sometimes there would be 2 or 3 managers on a shift for the front end alone. The hardest parts was the schedule being changed 2 or 3 times a week, confusing people about what their hours were, plus they had this system called Q-Vision. It kept track of how many registers were open,compared to how many were needed open, which is hard to keep track of during the busiest hours."
good,"Very busy. That it requires a lot of hard work to keep a store running. keeping it clean, keeping equipment operating. And just hiring employees."
good,Learned how to move in a fast-pace environment when dealing with customers. Enjoyed meeting new people and talking to the customers while bagging their groceries. Hardest part of the job would be me leaving to go to college. I made long-lasting friendships and customers. Management made sure that every employee was successful in their job title.
good,When I worked with kroger I thought it was going to be fun. Turns out I was wrong. The hours were great but the pay was not. I gotten close to many of my coworkers. I still keep in contact with most. It was like a second family but better.
good,"I never worked as a manager . I worked at night, until the early morning. I was the lot attendant, and worked inside the store to look for any suspicious activities. I hardly ever seen any co-workers. The hardest part of my job was walking around the building at night after the store closed enforcing the municipal code against overnight camping in the parking lot. The most enjoyable part of my job. I did not work in Fridays , Saturday's and Sundays"
good,"A typical day work would consist of stocking shelves with needed products, engaging with customers, ordering products as needed, and receiving/unloading the food truck. "
good,"Working at Kroger helped me manage my time better and build my communication skills. I greeted customers and bagged their groceries. I collected and organized shopping carts, maintained bathrooms, and swept the store. I liked all of my managers and co-workers. Everyone was pretty nice. The most enjoyable part of my job was bagging groceries for customers. I got to meet and have conversations with a lot of different people. The hardest part of my job was going outside in any and every type of weather to push shopping carts into the store."
good,"The work here was fine, but the people were absolutely atrocious. I have not ever worked in a worse work environment than this. The employees (and managers) run rampant and don't get a lot done during their shifts. Making this a miserable place to work for anyone who tries to be productive. "
good,"It's a great place to work, They just don't give enough hours, they show favoritism, but the other that the work place is healthy, and very calm."
good,Kroger is ok to work for if you're in high school as the pay is not the best. Some of the employees aren't very professional
good,"I worked for KROGER CO in their Arizona division,which is Frys Food Stores, as well as their Colorado division, KING SOOPERS. pay in colorado was much better than AZ but managment in colorado was not good at all . The hours were ok but at times the crew was not"
good,"In a typical day, I would determine my Freezer manpower needs for the day, assign jobs to employees, supervise selection and loading of trucks. I checked and entered all receiving bills. I supervised a great group of employees. Administered discipline and checked time sheets. I also checked other Departments to see if they needed help sent to them. The hardest part were the long hours, sometimes 12 to 15 hours per day. the best part of the job was knowing my employees respected me."
good,"They didnt really care for their employees"
good,Work life balance is almost not present.... I have learned about the retail industry. I have been in management and as an associate. Most associates interact well with each other.
good,"You go in, you pick a standing jack, and you get to work. It's a giant warehouse full of goods. You're given orders to fill for the store and you fill them as quick and efficiently as you can. This job was a great learning experience for me on how to operate an electric triple-jack and how to build pallets. They have a system that tells management exactly how efficient you are based on how many picks an hour are completed. The people I worked with were helpful. They understood it was a lot to learn and was always able to give advice. The hardest part of the job was being able to keep up with the set quota. At about 300 cases per hour, in order to keep up with that, working as fast as possible was a must. What was most enjoyable about this job was the pay! Yea they worked you hard, but they'll pay you good for it."
good,"It was nice to have a job but because lots of teenagers work there there was lots of drama. My managers were very rude to me all the time! My manager called my station one day because he wanted to tell me I needed to talk to the customers and not my baggers but what he did not know was I had two girls as customers and my bagger was a girl as well, everyone knows girls can talk, all four of us were in a conversation but i was the only one in trouble. It was just not my place."
good,"* going over payroll, running the front end, customer service, writing a schedule"
good,I enjoyed working at kroger but I didn't like some of the strict policies and management.
good,This job sucks and everything in it. I believe that I could have been promoted but they hated my persistency and commitment.
good,"It's no job that I would settle into as a career, but it definitely was a fair company as well as decent working environment."
good,very fast paced work place. Had to meet the quota and production benchmarks. Long days and some short days.
good,"I would assist customers at the gas pumps, maintain the cash register, most management were very understanding and helpful, my coworkers were very friendly and we got along all the time. The hardest part of the job was judging between deciding when to retrieve trash and take it out or sit around and wait for another customer. The most enjoyable part of the job was the downtime that allowed me to do extremely simple tasks."
good,"This was an okay job for part time.Worked out with my school schedule, Management wasn't that great bot, it was an okay part time job."
good,ok job no major issues my parents made me quit for a better paying job.
good,"I worked between three stores. The first one I was bullied and the managers never took action to stop it nor would they move me to a new department. I was titled the ""Boar's Head Sub Champion"", I had lots of responsibilities, which I enjoyed, I got to train new people, so I felt important, but I was bullied and dreaded work. The second store, I was bullied yet again, and the managers never took care of it, once again I was the Boars Head Sub Champion with the same responsibilities. The last store had very poor management, didn't seem to care for their employees, gave us few hours, but worked us like mules."
good,It is a good company to start at. There are opportunities to learn a lot of the basics of business operation. It is easy to outgrow this company though.
good,I had a good time at Kroger except for all the drama that was going around.
good,"A typical day at work consists of readying our products for the store floor by stocking the shelves, cutting, or baking some the products. The bulk of this must be done by a certain time (Ready by Time). Usually my shift is to come in and bake/pack/stock cookies for the first half of my shift. After that comes time to do all the prep work for our night baker (Doing the Breakout). This is done by first scanning a computer assisted production sheet (CAP). This is typically a department manager duty. However, the employees at our store are trained to scan their own sheet into the system. Next, all the product must be laid out on the proper surfaces depending on what is to be done with that particular item or subset of items. Finally, after the completion of breakout the department must be properly cleaned to meet the requirements put in place by health regulations."
good,had fun learning new stuff enjoyed most of the days working there
good,"The Kroger company is very focused on customer service, and has high expectations from all its employees to do their best. The pharmacy is a busy, high level of stress environment and requires staff to think quickly and work with speed and accuracy."
good,"little training"
good,I had to work early hours like 5 am. to 9 am. which made it difficult for me since I also had school to get to the same day. I learned how to work with pressure and I always seek for improvement. The management seemed a little disorganized but the overall experience was adequate. The night staff made my job difficult by over stocking the shelves so I can't moving anything around because they didn't want to take the extras to the back of the store. The most enjoyable part of my experience was some of the staff were fun to talk to and made the time go much faster.
good,The hours were okay at best and the management did not care much about their employees.
good,"A typical work day for me was arriving at around 10:30 p.m. and stocking shelves at night.  I learned to complete my unloading of the truck to stock in record time. Was able to work up in the company.  Learned that hard work does pay off.  Some of the co-workers were really nice.  Then there were some that were mean.  The hardest part was working mostly alone with not much association with others and working at the dark of night when my body says it is time to be asleep all the while knowing that I was at the cap pay for my position.  Also, it was hard not working in my true area of interest which is physical therapy aide. The most enjoyable part was the joy derived from the accomplishments of organization I did in my aisles and the growth opportunities although they were not in my true area of interest."
good,"Was an okay job, learned a lot of stuff I never knew. Had to quit because of school."
good,"There will typically be more workers than customers early in the morning which can make the days seem slow and long. I learned that really the only thing customers look for is to be attentive and caring about them. Managers can be tough and coworkers can be less hard-working, but it is worth it is you are a people person and love taking care of people. The hardest part of the job is having someone who is rude and thankless as a customer. The most enjoyable part is when the customer is so thankful because they had a bad day or it made their day better."
good,"Worked in the Deli, was always busy so the days went fast. Seen lots of different people, left this job because of a relocation."
good,It was fun until management changed like someone changing their pants. We  got into a groove and then it was changed and we had to start all over again. management is down our throats about everything. Never wants to help but is the first to take time out of what you are doing to tell you what you are doing wrong. There is never any real good feed back. It's always negative. Customers don't come first anymore and that upsets the workers who just want to help them.
good,"I really liked the fact that Kroger is union. However nights were hard, after asking to be moved back to days because 3rd shift was taking it's toll on my health I was told ""no"" because no one else wanted to do 3rds. I enjoyed most of my co-workers. The hardest part was angry customers at night and managers who wouldn't do their jobs."
good,"I was responsible for completing store purchases, and satisfying the customers business need."
good,"Total safe, balances, Pickups from associates"
good,management is rude and hours are great at first then they cut them to nothing
good,"A typical day at Pick 'N Save consists of, in my case, either being on a register, running the front end, or being at service desk.  For the most part the job is all about the customer and trying to get them in and out as quick as possible. I've learned how to run a register, manage time, handle large sums of money, problem solve, and work in a fast pace environment.  It's hard to say if management is good or bad mostly because managers get transferred to different stores in a blink of an eye, and you really never know who your going to get next.  So unfortunately, it's hard to really develop a good relationship with a manager anymore.  As far as my co-workers go, either they take there job too seriously or they don't at all.  Some nice people, but also some that you really just need to avoid to keep a sane mind.  The hardest part of my job I would say would have to be how often the store changes.  With all sorts of new promotions, and managers, by the time you get used to one there gone and there's a new one.  The most enjoyable part of my job would have to be some of the people I've meet along the way."
good,i stocked frozen and dairy products. it wasnt hard. i dont learn anything. i was just a regular job
good,"Good place to start working but management needs work. Co workers are really good friendly. Stocking is just stocking , inventory is pretty basic. Other then that its okay job to start."
good,"Constant moving around very fast paced, there was days when it was slow and you had to look for ways to keep busy. Customer service all day from the moment you clocked in to the minute you clock out."
good,"Unless you can get full time which is only ever becoming rarer these days, then I hope you can work two jobs or have a spouse who can also work. It is all just hiring multiple people with only 20 or so hours a week as opposed to one or two full timers. "
good,"I enjoyed my time with the company. It had its ups and downs, but all in all, it was good for me."
good,"Very busy and chaotic work environment, but it teaches you how to prioritize and maintain yourself in a variety of stressful situations."
good,Calling dr for refills filling scripts on computer and vials. Stocked medications. Passed and completed pharmacy program with a certificate.  Boss helped when busy and shorthand. I learned how to mix different medicines such as antibiotics. Hardest was when pharmacy was very busy and customers wanting their scripts first. Overall I learned a lot on this job.
good,"The days went by very fast really enjoyed my days. The management was verry horrible; they wee disorganized, rude and unprofessional. my coworkers were about the same."
good,Working for Kroger was an extremely hard job although i did learn management skills and how to deal with people of all personality types.
good,"Mostly customer care and Cashier related work."
good,A typical day at Kroger is busy an productive. You learn how to multi-task an manage a positive attitude when the pressure is on. The management is not the best but they get the job done. Co-workers are awesome. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the pay. The Most enjoyable part about the job is meeting nice customers an making new friends.
good,Work would be okay overall. But there seemed to be no caring for employees and people seemed to be there just to get a paycheck. Good place for a first job or high school student needing a part time job.
good,"Stable union job where if your a hard working individual you will find it to have little rewards and no room for pay or career advancement. The only thing positive I can possibly say is that the union is good at keeping people employed, by that I mean you'll be working with a lot of lazy people who know they cant be fired for almost any reason. Hardworking individuals usually seek other employment due to frustration at working hard to compensate for the ones who don't and see no sort of praise or reward for doing so."
good,"1. A typical day at work would consist of stocking shleves, 	packing customer purchases in bags or cartons and transported packages to customers’ vehicles and answering customers’ questions about merchandise on merchandise selection. "
good,I would come in I had to cut fruit to make fresh fruit trays.then I would break down any produce off of palets. and then stock food out on the floor and help customers. I learned how to work under pressure.
good,restock inventory shift over soon as job down. Not all management are good workers co-worker were high school kids that joked around more then work which made it hard to get job done. the best part of the job was leaving
good,Although I can adapt to any work place environment I did not enjoy this job particularly as it was not a field where I could use my talents and abilities.  This company was highly unionized so advancement/raises were never as a result of achievement but purely based on seniority.  I believe this impedes business and reduces ones motivation to succeed.
good,"good company to work for."
good,"managers and assistant controllers should be reviewed, some of them do not take their time to do the best of work, but use their position to intimidate associates."
good,"A typical day at Fred Meyer Starbucks consisted of constant cleaning tasks, and providing outstanding customer service to meet Starbucks' highest standards. Opening and closing entailed a lengthy list of items to be handled within a very strict time limit, such as preparing pastries and espresso machines, dishes, sweeping and mopping, checking dates on all food and beverage items to ensure freshness, and disposing of outdated inventory in the correct manner."
good,"When I worked here most of the employees were nice, but there were a few that were not welcoming. In fact I lost my job due to one of them setting me up. There is a lot of talk behind peoples backs and it just wasn't a place I wanted to work for."
good,Pay is not the best and managers can be arrogant and disrespectful sometimes.
good,"A typical day consisted of ringing customers orders efficiently and helping with any customer needs. "
good,Worked my way up from front end as bagger to produce manager within a short period of time. Worked with employees to manage and take pride in work.
good,Got to learn how to bake when I worked in the bakery. Deli was interesting.
good,"clocking in at 4pm , counting registar and lottery. I learned how to manage a lottery machine, while multi-tasking, helping customers and stocking store.Management was easy going, few co-workers made working at kwik shop fun and enjoyable. The worst thing about working at kwik shop was the limited hours.Customers made working at the store more of an enjoyable place to work"
good,Just your typical grocery store. Its a decent place for a first job but that is it. Not many friendly people worked there while I was there. Management wasn't that great either.
good,"The management never recognize anyone for doing a good job.Work for this company for three years and transfered to this store and never experienced upper management this way.Now the Kroger I work for before was excellent wished I never left.That being said this one store dosent set the standard fro the whole company.My job wasn hard at all.I was the cook and enjoyed what I did.Only cause I always give my all in what ever it is that I'm doing.This was definetly a learning experience that no matter what you do some people just dont care about ""regular employees"" you have to be wearing a suit in tie to get any recognition or even a smile."
good,"Every day at Kroger is different, most likely the same challenges but with different personalities. You have to be able to communicate with different types of personalities (not always positive ones) maintain the friendly smile as you deescalate the situation or complaint at hand. "
good,I learned a lot of different things working in the deli at a young age. Things that I still remember and use today. An overall good experience.
good,"Enjoyed working with the union workers and most of the management.  However, the Manager was a totally prejudice person. "
good,"Development of Managerial Skills."
good,"Help the customers, run self checkout, ring up customers groceries at the cash register, and keep work area clean.  I learned that people are different on every job ,and if you do your job and do it well you will have no problems with co-workers or managers.  "
good,"My technical job is a cashier but They keep pushing more responsibilities on me but no raise. I'm supposed to discipline my coworkers, give out breaks, run USCAN, and work guest care. Management does nothing to help out on the front end.  they come up with new rules by the week depending on their mood. They also don't connect with their employees. Most employees are intimidated by them. They never schedule enough people but complain about lines etc. Management pretty much pushes their duties on other people on the floor. Everyone should assist when we need it especially if they care about numbers and ratings. Customers who know management personally and complain automatically gets free gift cards. This store just needs all new management. But at least the customers and coworkers are the best part."
good,customer service and serve deli items. cleaning of meat slicing machines and pressure cookers
good,This was a good company to work for when i first started. The hours were good but the pay was not. I stayed with this company for 6 years hoping i could advance and make a career out of it. A typical day for me was to be ready to cashier or help behind customer service. I made personal relationships with customers. My co workers were nice and outgoing. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to interact and build relationships with my customers.  
good,It was a good experience I would like it for a first time job in that it showed consequences.. Have to keep your nose clean though cause they are quick to fire someone. 
good,"While working at kwik shop I loved the people I worked with. I loved working with the public. However, the particular store I was at there was no room to grow within the company. I would have like to eventually move up into management at some point,"
good,"A typical day at work consist of filling the meat bunkers and filling in the temp logs. After doing so, its making sure our customers are well taking care of, from giving them direction of other product or to the restroom, as long as their happy I'm happy. Some managers in the store would help with the department or anything asked of them. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the customers making sure their okay and the most enjoyable part is talking to the customers that just brings a smile to my face."
good,I worked here in high school and it was a great place to start out but I wouldn't recommend it for a career. There's not much room to move up and the hours are not favorable. 
good,"its a job to get you through high school."
good,"A lot of work to accomplish in a short amount of time, usuallly doing eveything by yourself, there is almost no teamwork at Kroger. "
good,"Manage 100-200 assocaites and department heads on daily sales, shrink, labor, and customer service. The best part of the job is the associates and the customers, they are ever changing and keeping me light on my toes. I research sales trends, control inventories with RF Handheld and computer mainframes, along with shrink control. In this position in management, I learned to listen more, and be more detailed oriented."
good,"Poor management, customers don't get their money worth because of lack of work do to managers.  Departments that need extra help and managers wont give it and that causes less product to be worked causing the customer to have to go somewhere else or have to do without.  Poor compensation. I learned that the customer deserves the best if their going to spend their hard earned money. Hardest part was dealing with managers who were never on the same page.  Most enjoyable part was getting to help people."
good,i had this job i high just to have money in my pocket. didnt really enjoy
good,"Slicing, weighing and pricing the meat, making the salads and sandwiches. Taking Temperature of the salad bars. Worked the evening so I did packing and cleaning of machines an the deli area."
good,the Kroger company has been very good to me for now. i just wish they had better raises and pay benefits.
good,"A typical day of work involved customer service interaction with patients receiving and efficiently giving them their prescription to them quickly, medical billing, drug counting and filling, and phone calls to fix billing and information to doctor's offices and insurance companies."
good,"It is an enjoyable place to work at. Dealing with customers, helping them and talking to them. Nice coworkers, and good pay. What I enjoy most is the customers, they know me on first name bases and I love hearing their stories. There is nothing hard about this job. Management seems to not exist here. I barely see them, and when i do they usually blow me off."
good,Daily usage of forklift & plied jack equipment
good,Communication is not a strong suit at the Kroger store I work at. . The Kroger Co. itself is a good company. The most enjoyable part of the job is waiting on regular customers. The hardest part of the job is dealing with unhappy customers.
good,Probably the best chain the world has ever seen.
good,"In the grocery business you get accustomed to running all day. There is a lot to do from stocking shelves to cleaning restrooms. I enjoyed the two store managers I worked with. I didn't see my district managers as much as I thought I would. I learned a lot through the implementation of a program the company called ""key retailing"". In an effort to standardize all stores. The implementation of this program was the most difficult part of my job. A lot of resistance from those the added duties fell to. I enjoyed working in each area and being able to help in all departments."
good,"typical workplace. normal people, lots of high schext and talk and read magaool teens, who tzines, when they should be working..."
good,"is a good place to work. the atmosphere in the store was not so good, some of the the managers were friendly and helpful, and the others were so full of themselves. the job itself wasn't that hard to learn and learned my jobs quickly."
good,"very busy , fun , interacting with the public , enjoyable . People always working together , helping each other . fun to go to work . It was interesting learning how to cook different things for the public and seeing how they liked it. It was nice the have the same people come back time and time again just to see you."
good,"Working for Krogers really depends alot on the management of the store. You have your dictators, or you have your managers who believe in democracy, or as Krogers like to say Red Leadership or Green Leadership."
good,bascialy a good place for kids to work while in school. low hours and you dont work that many days so you can still enjoy time off.
good,"Dont get me wrong it was a good job, but the people you work with are rude, and can be really mean. The people I worked with were self absorbed and liked to get others into trouble. The manager himself stole from the company. It just all over was a bad situation."
good,"The store I worked for was ran by people he weren't prepared to step up from a small store and run one of the largest Krogers in America. But the company was amazing. Higher up management would make sure we had everything we needed and visit quite often, even when I was in smaller stores. Helped with my inventory, scheduling and ordering if I was ever slammed and running on a tight schedule."
good,"I had a lot of fun working at Kroger. My usual day at work was getting to my machine to help customers check out, and talk to them while they were checking out. I learned how to differentiate between a customer that just wants to go home and not talk to anyone, and the others that were just as happy doing the weekly shopping. My management was average, i didn't really see them much except for payday. I believe the thing i had the hardest time with was learning all the codes for produce, but after two or three weeks i was able to learn them. And of course what i enjoyed most was talking with all the different types of customers while they told me how they're day went and hear some of their short stories."
good,"Long hours, limited appreciation, training is provided, union-environment"
good,Ran the cash register.served the customer. Restocked the shelves.
good,"Alot of management. Line startup, pm the equitment, answer floor calls and special electrical projects."
good,"The managers and front end leads confuse the workers and make it hard for them to do their job. They don't treat us fairly. Besides the shady characters that worked there, the actual company was pretty good. You get paid every week, and you get pay raises frequently. That would have to be the best part of the job."
good,physical demanding work under payed unloading trucks and stocking shelves the entire time
good,The 18-week training course to become a Co-Manager was very in-depth and worthwhile. The hardest part of my job is the variable schedule and hours. There is no work-life balance. Working with the associates and customers is truly delightful.
good,"Ordering meat, cutting and stocking meat, servicing customers."
good,A typical day at work is hectic. Customers complaining about things that I have no cotrol over. Management was switched often and some new comers did not have knowledge of certain systems which delayed some activity. The most enjoyable part of the day was getting a happy customer.
good,I feel like the management there is lazy and they make poorly decisions and I've only work there for six month and I feel like I could do a way better job.
good,"I did the same work every day, my job was taken over by a computer and I did not post for another position with the company."
good,A okay place to work if you need money right now. It is hard to advance in the company unless you plan on staying there for years.
good,Every day finding work to do was not diffcult
good,i have been working at food4less going on four years and it so hard to move up once you became a casher the hours you have to work. i close all move every weekend and if i call for the weekend off they will give the weekend and the day im off thought out the week so i dont requst any days offf no more because i wont have no hours.
good,"Not a bad first job, minimum wage and the work was simple. I quit after finding another job"
good,Everyday it is my job to handle the problems of the customers and co-workers so that the store can run smoothly and customers can get their groceries and whatever help they need.
good,The work day is normally easy. If you going to work in the front end its better to be a courtesy clerk more then a cashier.
good,"My environment at Kroger was usually filled with multiple interactions with other associates. I would personally consider them to be like a close knit family to me. The management was unfair for the balance of my employment. If an issue were to ever develop, management would not help solve the problem leaving the associate to create a solution. Problem solving was a must in my line of work. This is what I would ultimately learned at Kroger."
good,"When i arrived at work I was required to walk the store for out of place, empty, and/ dirty merchandise while the employee i was relieving counted their drawer down. Then while on shift i kept store customer ready, applied immaculate customer service, and completed my shift duties. While working there i enhanced my customer service skills. The hardest part of my work day was being griped out for the previous shifts unfulfilled duties. The management is the reason why i quit, she would not follow company policy and the employees would get into trouble for what she didnt do she would blame on us."
good,"Typical day was to log into pharmacy registers and proceed to wait on customers. If no customers there I would put away completed prescriptions alphabetically. I learned that the actual job was more complicated than I realized. I do give credit to the certified technicians and all the different aspects of job that they have learned. It is difficult to do your daily job, and to be responsible for a new trainee. New trainees should be given full time hours for the 90 day training period due to the wealth of information needed to learn. Also I recommend that the trainee be placed with one trainer that has been previously trained for this specific job. It might assist with retaining that employee without continuous turnover."
good,Very busy. Stocking shelves and working around customers made it a very long day.
good,I did not have much trouble working for kroger due to the face that the company and the manger their made sure that they took their time to properly train you on their polices and procedure. In General I would said it was a decent work place due to the fact the most of the people were nice except for one and expected you to work together with them.
good,slice and meat for customers
good,"I worked for Kroger for 4 years and there were very good days and some of the worst days. Co-workers were either late, didn't show up, or at work and doing nothing; and management was ok with this. The only people they ever fired were the people who did their job. Speaking of management, if you need help with an order or a customer wants to speak to them or one of the departments is behind there is no point asking for their help because they don't really care and they will play stupid, only time they care is if it messes with their bonuses."
good,I like working here but you do not advance in this place. employees are friendly but management isnt they micromanage. they intimadate employees. you can not communicate with them with out the making you feel like a worthless speck.
good,This company truly embraces diversity and respects all cultures. Inclusion is the norm.  The culture is one of reaching out to others and uplifting others.
good,Fast paced work environment you get 2 breaks and a lunch for full time employees you get great health benefits and you earn more vacation time the longer you are there. Union protected job
good,"During my three years part-time at Kroger I worked in the Dairy and Grocery departments, occasionally helping with bagging up front. Overall my experience was not good nor bad. While my co-workers, management and customers were mostly kind to me, I felt as if I was expected of more than was realistic. For example. I was expected to handle a bread truck delivery and grocery truck delivery, when I was never taught how to."
good,They have good benefits but they treat people badly and don’t give you the respect you deserve. And they also talk about you behind your back. I would not recommend it to anybody.
good,Okay place to work. Management is not helpful. Pay is often good depends on your experience. Work hours are semi flexible and it's hard to have a day off
good,"Management was really poor at the store I worked at. I mean management on a general level from the head office, not the store's management exactly. It was not a horrible place to work but it was difficult due to shortages, inadequate equipment, and some customers did not make it any easier."
good,"The fuel center is a perfect part time job, but becomes a difficult full time job as the hours are early/late and the lack of assistance can lead to burn out."
good,"It’s an ok place to work, you can move up quickly and they are flexible with work schedules. However, it can be extremely stressful depending on the day."
good,"Unfortunately, with prescription insurances keeping more and more of the money for themselves, the pharmacy department is now no longer as profitable as it once was.  Pharmacy used to be given extra hours to allow for great customer engagement.  Pharmacy managers used to worry about not being able to use all the hours they were given.  Now most pharmacies have hardly any overlap between pharmacists."
good,Management doesn’t really know what’s going on at Kroger’s at all from my experience. Are manager was horrible any time I asked him something he always would go to the department managers to help me.
good,"Poor communitcation, unprofessional, favortism and poor hourly pay. No room to advance. You are neglected. The most enjoyable part of the job is interaction with customers."
good,Good job for people who are just starting out...... but definitely not something that should be permanent. They are willing to work with your hours and u get good pay for a first time job
good,It was fine for a high school job. It was also fine for a college job. I would not recommend staying there for multiple years. It becomes very depressing
good,"Worked in management"
good,"Kroger used to be a great place to work for,it was like family at one point we all helped eachother and had fun. You were given opportunities for advancement and full time hours/benefits, the pay has always been terrible especially for the work they expect of you. Now the pay is still terrible, you wont achieve full time and get overlooked for advancement. I do not recommend for long term."
good,In retail there will always be others that are unhappy with service. You must be able to stay calm and be able to help that person with the problems they have.
good,"Depending on how old you are and how long you’re looking to be employed with the company, Kroger can be a good job. However I’ve been with the company for a long time and have seen a management staff that  purely cares more about appeasing corporate than listening to their actual employees. Union can be helpful, however there are times where they seem to care more about the business than the people they represent"
good,I enjoyed it for the most of the time but management would easily forget about you. They would sometimes try and corrwct their wrongs but would shift most of their blame towards yourself
good,It’s tough some days but if you’re mentally prepared you’ll be okay. It’s not a bad job to get started but you can always find better opportunities once you’ve been introduced into the work field
good,The average work day was depending on hours. On normal days the store would have lines going out the doors. There were barely any courtesy clerks. There were certain workers who new the job needed to be done but simply didnt do the job.
good,They advertise these days stating the starting pay is $10 per hour. But be warned that you will only receive 10-12 hours per week. Most stores have too many store managers and none of them are on the same page when it comes to what comes first in each department.
good,Most of the employees do not come to work. So that mean you have to work hard to do their work and yours. The supervisors are one sided. But the insurance benefit is good. And the holiday pay is good. The over time is great. Since the people do not come in their is plenty of overtime.
good,"I did not like working at Kroger. They scheduled me at times I couldn’t work and some customers I dealt with were rude or unpleasant. The hours were long, and they barely gave breaks."
good,"A generally casual and comfortable working environment, it gives new to retail good and valuable experience in the field and corporate can be a pain as they often are but overall it is a good environment."
good,"Kroger is a a good place to work, the money isn’t all that great. But the people are awesome, we always look out for each other and help each other in any was we can."
good,Average grocery store with multiple departments and managers for each. Customer focused and service based. Providing all grocery needs to customers. The pay wasn't very good but low skill jobs.
good,"Store owner was not a us citizens"
good,I worked at kroger before I had left for the military. I can honestly say yes the store i worked at had thier ups and downs. You get under paid feeling especially if you are working in various departments .
good,"There is no typical day, or night at work. There are always things that come up that need urgent attention. The only thing that may be considered typical, are the repetitive tests and tasks done daily. You are on your feet, and on the move for 10 hours, with two 10 minute breaks, and a half hour lunch. Some people work for hours without help, or break relief. Other than that, the pay is good and if you can keep up your health, you may have a chance to have a good retirement."
good,They really didn't offer a very easy way to advance in their company.  They had management changed and barely any training.   I was very disappointed.
good,"My Manager In The Bakery Wasn't Very Helpful, The Main Boss Of The Store Doesn't Do Very Well Telling His Employers They Do Their Job Well. As Well As Giving Them Confidence To Do Their Job Better."
good,"I’ve had no issues with anyone or any issues regarding me but I do think that things do to change indefinitely especially on how things are ran.The work isn’t really hard at all but If we would have less people quitting the experience at Kroger would differ from how I think of it now and it starts with the people running everything.But overall I’ve picked up many skill for example, customer Service skills and also being a asset to a team."
good,I  have held many positions at Kroger in various states. There are plenty of opportunities for learning and growth within the company. It's a great place to work.
good,Stressful! Sometimes wearing several hats at once with no additional pay. Store Manager did not back up Assistant managers in their roles. There is no work life balance at all.
good,I only liked one manager there and she worked in the cheese shop. other than that the employees over stepped boundaries and managers looked over all harassment complaints made towards two people bc they liked their work ethic. so I quit along with others. wasn't worth it
good,"A typical day at work was talking with people, coworkers and customers alike, and having fun while doing the job. It was a medium-stress job with lots to do. They gave fair breaks, albeit sometimes very behind in giving them. The employees were all nice to each other and it was easy to make friends. The management is horrible though, they treat you very unfairly and unkindly and put the stress of 2-4 people on one person, and departments were constantly understaffed. The hardest part of the job was pushing carts through the freezing cold, on ice, in the snow, or in the intense heat under the sun."
good,I've been with Kroger since i was legally able to work & was extremely happy for a long time but there has been a steady decline in employee moral & in my opinion its partly due to sloppy management & an environment that is on a downward spiral.
good,There are days that can be slow and there are days that are very busy. The management can be understanding at time. The work culture is very good to people that are of a different cultures and genders.
good,This was a great place to start and earn money however there were constant turnovers and the quality of employees  that were hired in the deli made it hard to do my job. Management was tight knitted and cliquish.
good,"Repetitive daily tasks, regular customers, busy. Learned how to price and package items for sale. Sliced meat and cheese. Ran a register. When associates got along it was an ok enviorment."
good,"Krogers has a good environment to work in, my job there was always different,  somedays was hard, and some was easy, i work at 2 different krogers, one of was better then the other, the people are awesome"
good,Its stressful and low staffed. Busy and not that many breaks for it to make it through. But the employees are funny and nice to hang out with periods.
good,"This is not an easy job. You will have to work hard and perform a lot of tasks within your shift. The work is physically demanding, especially stocking. There is usually a good team work environment, but be prepared to get work done on your own."
good,"The store has great deals and huge savings and varieties on a lot of named brand items. However, customers are impatient and on occasion rude for no reason. But, need more cashiers and meat and deli employee's"
good,"The day starts with me clocking in, and making my way to the back stock to grab my smock. I have learned many things while working at kroger, how to stock shelves properly, and how to be responsible in the workplace. The hardest part of the job was closing down by myself every night, my all time favorite part of the job though was learning the different meats and fish that you can cook .and gow tonfook them"
good,"I love my job here at Kroger. I love my customers, my managers are very understanding and willing to work with you. The pay isn’t the best but it’s a great way to network, i’ve met so many good people here and some I know I’ll have in my life for a long time. The company as a whole sucks but this individual store is pretty great. HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH CUSTOMERS. If I got paid more i would stay for a long time!"
good,Formens and coworkers are easy to get along with. The work days fluctuate drastically and training on jobs and equipment can be spotty and disorganized.
good,Overall good place to work while trying to find something more permanent. Associates are pretty friendly. Pay was not the best and could’ve been better for the work having to get done by certain times.
good,It was all you can expect from a min. wage job. Got along with everyone in my department. The management were not very reasonable at times. But was able to get a lot of hours at decent times of the day.
good,While Kroger has the right mottos and ideals it is hard to deliver when they have understaffed departments with unrealistic expectations in customer service exellence.
good,Decent but no work/life balance.  The hardest part of the job is working various hours - late then turning around and going back in early the next morning.
good,"Kroger’s has become a company solely focused on greed , not focused on family or work/life time anymore. After firing 100+ store managers in one city alone you can’t help but think what kind of company Kroger’s is turning into"
good,"Cashier."
good,After working for the company for 7 years I would get full time hours for a while and then as soon as I got too close to being able to get full time my hours would be drastically cut so that I couldn't receive full time. Because I was only a part time worker the only benefit I was entitled to was the employee discount. When I attempted to advance in position I was told I was not well rounded enough even though I had worked most areas of the store by that time.
good,It very busy all the time the only time it is slow is when its time to close. The hardest part was trying to keep the line down and not have them so long.
good,"A typical work day would be standing at the register ringing up customers"
good,Had a family member that was over me that treated me like dirt so it was hard to work with him not to mention some rude people that sometimes didn't want to work on a nightly basis
good,"A typical day working at Kroger depends on your job position and the time of day "
good,The employees themselves are the only reason to work there. The pay in the deli and bakery were just above minimum even with experience pay included. I would've stayed if I could've earned a living wage for the area.
good,Being a pharmacist at Kroger is probably like most retail chain environments.  It is very busy and they have been moving more towards a skeleton crew to cut costs.  They have also cut hours for pharmacist and the pay is one of the lowest of chain pharmacies.
good,"I enjoyed my time at this location. The people were mostly pleasant but some of the choices made by management was questionable. Such as: inconsistent schedules, disrespectful managers, fellow employees not putting any effort whatsoever into their jobs meaning I had to work twice as hard to pick up their slack. But the majority of the workers were understanding and made it clear how much they appreciated my efforts."
good,Depending on your hours you worked depicted what kind of time you are gonna have working. If it’s when people normally go shopping it’s fast paced and very stressful for the simple fact of the rush hour when you have to many customers and not enough registers
good,"A typical day at work is just busy but not so busy."
good,I grew within the company. I started off as a bagger and stayed after college because they offered me a competitive salary and it was a great place to work... Over time the took away help but expected more so you had to stay long hours or work an extra day to keep caught up. I had great pride in my job so I stayed and worked 60 plus hours a week. I performed well and it was noted on my annual reviews.
good,It's a simple and easy job but boring and depending on what kind of management you get at the store it can be stressful. I'd say the best part is the people you meet there.
good,Upper management needs to let the managers manage the store and staff. To many new policy changes just causes the staff to become confused and unsatisfied with their working environment.
good,Will I really enjoyed my job and costumers. When the store was sold it all changed from good to bad. I don't want to list the issues because they were not present working with Kroger only when it changed owners. I gave it about a year before I called current cooperation to do poor management and not resolving the issues.
good,Nice work place fast pace good environment.fun.picking boxes of food for different stores.pay well.10 hour shifts.fast pace .driving power lift with pallet to the dock so food can get out to the stores .kind of cold inside the warehouse.must be careful be safe .it was exciting being a part of something that deal with food.food is very important .it's something that the world need .it's great to be a part of that.gotta alot of experience.
good,"The stores are kept together and nice-looking generally. But its because they make the managers work 70 million hours a week to get it done. They don't like overtime so they destroy their salaried managers with tasks. "
good,"Our department makes the company a ton of money each week, but our hard work is not appreciated.  They tell you that you'll get paid $11/hr and receive an employee discount to shop for online customers, but what they don't tell you is that you'll be timed; if an item that you need is not on the shelf you aren't just expected to search on the sales floor, you may also have to go check the pallets in the back of the store or (even worse) you may have to enter the walk-in cooler or walk-in freezer and dig through boxes to find the item yourself; you are expected to achieve an unrealistic accuracy percentage and if you don't meet it management will raise the goal to an even more unrealistic number, you have to pick up totes that are heavy (sometimes customers order 6 gallons of milk and all 6 end up in one tote!), you aren't trusted to make a suitable substitution, you must ask for permission before selecting a substitution for an out of stock item, and while you try your hardest to finish shopping in a timely manner you're also expected to assist every customer who asks you for assistance in the store, with your supervisor in your ear giving you a count down of how much time you have to get your order staged before the order is considered late or fussing at everyone because one person has bagged their groceries incorrectly.  Only apply if you are desperate for money."
good,"Night time stocker of shelves. Learned how Kroger works internally."
good,"Management is promotion of firends and nothing about promotion is skills based. When you decide to go, they'll show you the door and try to slam your foot in it."
good,The Management and the Union need to work on communication with employees. This is their weakest point of working here. The staff is friendly the workplace culture is good and the customers are great.
good,"Good part time job for high school or recent graduates, but other than that there isn’t much room for growth at the company and the compensation is not the greatest."
good,"It is a good place to grow. Experience is a must.Must work well with people. Need to have a retail background, to be good at the job.Be willing to stay extra hours to complete assigned tasked,"
good,The Argyle St. Kroger was a great place to work at until new management came in. Now to place looks like a shell of what it used to be. Nothing is ever done about harassment they will say they talked to them but it starts right back up a day later. Some of the employees are great to talk and will offer some help if able. Others won't and besides you will see some new ones soon since the turn over rate is insane. We lose so many people in a few week due to the cut hours and poor training because we cannot keep anyone. I would suggest not working at night and not work in the grocery department.
good,"Worked at Kroger for years. It wasn't bad at first but they constantly change expectations on you, they like to cut hours and expect you to do the work of several people. Management gets shuffled around every couple of years. Sometimes you have a good one and the job is fine but sometimes you don't and it's miserable."
good,Poor management makes the job overly stressfull. Many employees get away with not completing their tasks making the job of working employees more difficult.
good,"Fast paced with high expectations from management, at times too high to reach as management lack knowledge of what was possible, with minimal pay compensation.  Co-workers where pleasant to work with and management was relatively friendly, however they generally lacked the awareness to offer or provide assistance when needed."
good,People quitting like crazy the employees was nice management was bad. Customers where the same most of the time friendly. If you like serving customers and chatting this is a good job for you!!
good,The hardest part about working at krogers was pushing baskets because there will be alot of cart in each section on the parking lot and you have to put all of them in before you get off but thats work for you
good,"Kroger can be a really fun place to work. With the rapid change of the industry, online shopping has created a more frantic work environment. Managers are expected to meet unrealistic goals by upper management. I wish Kroger culture wouldn't be so chaotic and return to a more customer relationship centered business rather than profits over people."
good,"Kroger in Washington State = awesome! Kroger in Nevada = completleydecent different! Pluses: Decent pay (depending on your union contract), health benefits and paid time off (if you qualify). Minus: stressful, no set schedule - you may be scheduled to work until midnight then come in at 6am next day, split days off, lack of communication between members of staff, etc. "
good,for the most part everyone was friendly. however their did tend to be dram and a lacking of consistency in what we can or cant do between supervises and managers.
good,"One of the only places around that hires teenagers consistently.  It is a good eye-opening job to see what the workforce is like. Hours and schedules are likely to be inconsistent. You are highly pressured to join the Union, which takes a large amount of your pay that is already low. Advancement is possible, but there are little benefits in advancement."
good,"a good place to relax when on break, the break room. also the management was actually awful, they were all on different pages and each said something different"
good,"This job was not for me, and I stuck it out longer than I should have. It's not to bad if your a people person but a lot will be expected out of you even if your just part time. I was part time working full time hours, so I really didn't care for it."
good,Unfortunately it's a good old boy net work if you are not part of it you are not made to feel included. Hiring outside help with zero experience in the grocery industry which leads to confusion for the new hire and makes it difficult for existing teams to be cohesive.
good,Kroger is a fast paced high expectation company. Recently there has been a high level of micro management and push for results. Upper management is under a lot of pressure to achieve very high standards and that pressure does trickle down.
good,"The main reason I didn't like this job, is because the manager at the time basically picked on me for being slow because I was a big guy. I couldn't keep up with the fit, skinny guys so he was upset about that.  But, I did make a couple friends from that place, and I'd definitely work there again."
good,Management is usually good but supervisors are questionable. Managers make sure you're busy but the pay doesn't compensate for the tasks and environment you work in.
good,"Okay job. It's a pay check. Not else really to say. It was cool to have a union. That's about the only thing I like. Department managers spent more time talking down to employees and flirting, than they did actually training and working."
good,OK for a part time job but if you are interested in a career it depends.I have worked in several areas of the store and there is a great deal of difference in the different areas.My schedule also has always been varied.If you have small children it would be difficult.Whether a manager or Deli worker everything is subject to change.
good,"Long days mostly. Customers are 50/50 on being nice to you, otherwise not too bad. I do a lot of walking as for my job is the personal shopper. Our customers are usually very understanding on items that had to be substituted on their orders.  Management is really depending on the day. They are usually pretty good and helpful when needed, other times they couldn't care less. Everything over all is pretty basic retail, good and bad times, customers. The hardest part of the job is I guess you can say is the instock in the store isn't very good. Such as when sales for the week and the quantity isn't where it should be. Then you get some upset customers because they miss out on the sale item. We try our best to make up for it but not everyone is happy with that. The most enjoyable part of the job is the coworkers I get to work with.  Some are not worth the pay but the others are some the best people you can have the pleasure of working with."
good,It was not a good job for me being a cashier my legs got very tired standing in one place for too long and the breaks were very very shot no matter how many hours you worked
good,Pretty good place to work. They worked around my classes when I was in school. The turnover rate is high. It’s hard to get to full time in this place.
good,"I’ve worked here going on 7 years, my first job, and I’ve had an alright experience working here. The benefits are great, the opportunity to grow is good, working for customer service is t great. But that’s the job. And it pays fair. I have restrictions now and they won’t allow me to move forward because of said restrictions, like not being able to work nights because of my kids. It definitely isn’t right for them to deny me a promotion because of my family, but it is what it is. I"
good,Good job and fun to be at. Only downside is the union. Rarely get a raise and not a place to make a career unless going into management. Was one of my favorite jobs but I didnt get much raise the 3 years I was there
good,"On a regular day it was cool, we all did our part in working together. I learned great customer service skills and what it is like to help people."
good,I loved this job you made friends easy and they tried to make sure you had a great time while being productive. If there was an issue they did their best to resolve it and you get guaranteed raises.
good,"In the 6 years of working for this company I have moved my way up from a courtesy clerk to an e-commerce associate. This company will run you crazy but it is still a fun place to work if you let it be. Great for people needing a first job, not the easiest to move up into management unless you know someone."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is dealing with customers and the people i work with. It has its trying times with current management and current new policies in place.
good,"It's a fine place to work if you don't NEED hours or a living wage.  I've talked to management about increasing my hours per week above 20, but instead they cut me down to 8.  Store manager is very demanding, but the assistant managers are very helpful"
good,"The courtesy clerk position is one that has a lot of responsibilities, bagger, janitor, cart collector, and anything else that the managers decide that they want you to do.I didn't feel like the pay was good enough considering that working anywhere else would get you a better hourly wage."
good,Management needs to know how networking works and not belittle people that work hard to work with new Network Platforms. Management needs better communications with personnel.
good,As a cashier I was able to form relationships with customers. I worked several departments here and enjoyed learning and progressing with this company.
good,"Kroger has too strict of a dress code, they want TOP NOTCH customer service for MINIMUM WAGE pay. The managers were not good at employee relations, and did not treat all employees equally."
good,"The Clicklist manager is gender discriminative. There is an ample amount of unfair treatment to males in the workplace. The department now prides itself on “numbers” rather than customer satisfaction, and the customers do not receive quality service because of the need to have faster picking times and the manager’s demeaning oversight. Most of the time, when anything goes wrong, it is always blamed on the young men in the department, and if there aren’t any, then any young worker. Also, the manager picks and chooses who gets a flexible schedule, usually their favorites, who happen to be only girls. There is no accountability for the manager, as they report everything to the store manager as they see it, there is only a vertical form of leadership, and the workers suffer from it."
good,"Working overnight there was teamwork and accountability.There were times we had to work over because of someone sick but there was teamwork and a sense of accomplishment.When I switched to days it was like night and day some management held accountability,But there were some there just for the paycheck."
good,If your looking for job security look elsewhere...the pay could be better. Decent if in between jobs. Great benefit package if you work over 24 hours a week. Managers change consistently. Favoritism at an all time high..tread with caution.
good,The starting pay is good. The union helps employees. You get to learn all the different departments as a clerk. The people are friendly and the manager help out.
good,"The food service industry, especially regarding supermarkets, is in my opinion an unhealthy and damaging work environment for me. There's very little balance between my responsibilities as a cook and my responsibility to the customers. Oftentimes I get behind on my cooking because of customers. We're routinely understaffed and expected to complete unreasonable tasks. Communication between levels of management is frequently botched. "
good,A decent company depending on your location. Very good insurance opportunities after a year of working there and employee discount on products. One of the better retail/grocery companies I've worked for.
good,I would only recommend working here if it is your first job. I worked at Dillon's for over 3 years and only made around $8.90 and worked hard. They underpay because usually teenagers don't have much experience. Also the discount you receive is 10% off of Kroger branded items only.
good,I worked for them on and off here in Louisiana.  It was a good place to earn a steady paycheck and get experience as stable adult.  Other than that it was just a job I did to get by.
good,Worked at this job in my teenage years only you earn some money to have in my pocket. Was still being supported by my parents but wanted my own little income.
good,Management wouldn’t let us breathe in the pharmacy and let the pharmacist do their jobs. They have doctorates and management would often try to tell them how to do their jobs
good,"The mangers on floor treated people like trash worker and customer. The upper floor mangment was much nicer and handled things well."
good,It's an okay first job. Part time positions pay nearly minimum wage. They will work you like a dog. The Managers are constantly pushing you to do more in just the 8 hours and hardly allow overtime to get the job done. I would not suggest to any friend to work there because it's not a good environment a good amount of the time. I see new hires sometimes and I want to tell them to run while they have the opportunity. They are constantly hiring because people get fed up with the company and management that they are losing people on a regular basis.
good,"I have been with Kroger for 5 years, and in those 5 years i have  learned a lot. it is the management and higher ups that makes the job difficult. Going above and beyond doesn't help your chances at moving up within Kroger. It is all about seniority and how long you have been there. The pay raise system is 25 cents every 6 months. You simply cannot make a living off 11.45 an hour."
good,Kroger was the first company to give me a foot in the door having foreign but no US experience. I learnt the computer systems and kept up to date with new medications.
good,"I enjoyed working here while i was still in high school. This is definitely not a job for a person that has to pay rent on their own and many other bills. Very little pay, ridiculous actually."
good,"Kroger is great for salaried store management when it comes to job security, salary and benefits BUT those are the only positives about the job as a manager.  Job is stressful, the work you do is unappreciated, promotions are based on who you know and what upper management likes you instead of hard work and merit.  Executives job is to make your life more difficult, criticize and terrorize the stores instead of going into a store to coach train and appreciate the people that are on the front lines working hard for the company every day.  Kroger has gotten away from basic principles such as selling groceries and delivering great customer service and has become a circus.  As a manager you will have to manage a store well understaffed everyday but yet deliver perfection.  There is nothing realistic about what the company expects anymore."
good,Each Kroger store is different but the one i work at i wouldn't recommend to anyone.  Management is all for themselves.  They only promote within their circle.  The pay isn't great. You have to love what you do.
good,"always running never had time"
good,"Management was never consistent with communication and wouldn't know how to place people with the right skill sets. You are expected to do the work of three people by yourself, with lack of appreciation and assisntance."
good,"It's an enjoyable company but too short staffed, almost dangerously so. Had a hard time balancing work and life due to severe budget cuts and extra overtime."
good,"Enjoyed my time, learned a lot, Meet a lot of people. Gained better communication skills, Gained better customer service, Gained better management skills."
good,"Constant customer inflow. the only thing keeping you sane is the rare break in customers. You are dealing with people who want to bend the store rules everyday and you either have to let it slide or call over the manager, which slows everything down massively and makes you feel like you have added burden to everyone's day"
good,"They bloat the staff with a numerous amount of people, hoping to keep hours low. This forces everyone's hours down and creates an environment of cutthroats looking to take any free hours or hours people give up with no culture of hard work being met, just trying to add more days in."
good,Good benefits. Company could work on communicating more clearly. Plans that corporate send down are executed loosely at store level. Your typical retail job.
good,Not the best option but the it works well if you go to school or you don't have too many Bill's to pay other than that you'll struggle with the check specially with kids.
good,It's a good place to work but carrier wise I don't know. Been working in this company for over 6 years but my pay is still low. you can only get raise every 6 months and they only appreciate all the hard work you did for them.
good,"They do not work well in terms of flexibility of their staff and they treat employees as if they're replaceable. Management is also rude, other than that, the store is sometimes fun to work there."
good,In my time working at Kroger I was for the most part happy. It was when a new owner took over is when my hours dropped and I began to get treated unfairly .
good,"Working at Kroger can be fun but the demands of the job can be very tough"
good,There is horrible management at all Kroger i am told this one was no different even though it was new. There was high school supervisors who were only there because the first manager played favorites. The First manager didn't like me do much she demoted to a courtesy clerk for one mistake on tags. One of my supervisors confessed how much she would talk about she didn't like me. The hardest part was managers bring me to tears and not caring whether i was hurt or sick they wanted me to do my job anyway. I did enjoy my other coworkers there that weren't in management titles. There was supervisor who was amazing worked two jobs had a degree and was paid the most they could pay him but the poor guy deserved high positions
good,"This was my first job experience and almost everything that could go wrong with it did. Poor staffing for the late shift, bad employee turnaround, employee gossip culture, poor management from all levels and on top of having to learn my job as it went through the months. I had 2 deli managers from the time I was hired to the time I left. I had 2 assistant managers thus making for three in total at any given time, but all of them worked the morning shift. Often there would times that I would be the only one staffed for an entire shift or for at least a couple hours until closing. The position had so many people be hired for various reasons. Poor training and job switching basically meant that every couple months I was learning something new about my role that I was not covered for. It may have been this specific store but I do not want to work for the deli again"
good,"treated everyone fair, work with you when having personal problems, not good with hours for part-time people, good with moving up in the company, its a fair job"
good,3/5 it was just a very average environment.A job that us mean't for high school students that are still attending school and trying to make a little extra money
good,With corporate companies upping their min pay. Kroger refusing to jump ship and pay you as little as they can but expect you to work harder. Eventually all they can hire now are high schoolers so it’s pretty frustrating to work when a lot of them just don’t really seem to care.
good,"required alot of work in a fast-paced environment but definitely not worth all the headache for such little pay. fellow employees are very friendly but some can be very lazy and dont pick up their own slack. older employees have seniority and have better benefits and pay; hard working/newer employees get the job done 5x faster but dont receive the same pay, so basically working for cheap/free labor."
good,Kroger was a decent first job for me as i was in highschool when i started but was frustrating at times because they didnt really recognize highschoolers as people worth investing training in or offered any benefits or insentives.
good,The customers complain about everything. They don't know how to read sale signs. They always feel like you should be happy at work but don't realize that you are also human and have bad days also.
good,Typical Day included many customers   and management being stressed out.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers and helping people in need daily of what they were looking for or wanted to purchase.  The hardest part about the job was dealing with many negative people with attitudes who complained about not getting enough money daily.
good,"I enjoyed the customers. The employee's lacked genuine customer relations skills."
good,"When I was first hired at Kroger, it was fairly easy going. The first few months were good, and it helped me out a lot in being flexible. The hardest part about working there was the position you'd be given. If you were given a position such as janitorial, you'd be forced to clean out the bathrooms, that sometimes, can be worse than your generic movie style gas station. If you were hired into a cart hop position, you'd be having to stand outside in two or three layers of clothing, whether there were snow, rain, shine or 95-degree weather. You'd be allowed to purchase a drink every so often if you kept the lot cleared, but you were not allowed to wait in-store for a few minutes for if you felt too hot."
good,"When I worked for kroger "
good,To get on full time you have to wait. They go from who was there first to who gets moved to a full time job. I done work in every area on Kroger on 4th st in Owensboro Kentucky
good,I dont recommend any one to apply here.. I only work here for the insurance.. I'm currently looking for a higher paying job..  it's only good for kids who need a quick part time job
good,"Working as a cashier was stressful and confining but I stayed because most of the staff made me feel welcome. I left the company after I was physically assaulted by two separate customers on two separate occasions, at one point resulting in a broken finger, and was written-up and suspended for my ""unacceptable behavior"" AKA; complaining to  management, refusing the customer(s) involved, service, and asking for workers compensation for the injuries received in the incident."
good,"The management here like to tell you what you want to hear, a lot of lies go around to all of the employees. Changes to your schedule happen often and no pay raise."
good,"Management was intimidated by my intelligence and natural leadership potential. I was given management responsibility without management compensation. I went above and beyond for my customers (including coming in at 6:00am on CHRISTMAS EVE to fill huge orders that needed to be done and picked up at open) and never received incentive for the extra mile I willingly gave. When I qualified for a raise they upped the starting pay to more than what my raise was so I was, at that time, making the same as my coworkers who started that week AND my coworkers who had been there for two and a half years. Absolute insanity and unfair."
good,management is not fair and rude and don't pay enough to put up with people customer come in rude. not an enjoyable place to really work. only good for gas money and food. working at kroger can barely pay bills.
good,"The people depend on the experience. Make good connections and genuineness, you're experience eill be grand. For me it had ups & downs. Not every day is a good day, and not every day do coworkers get along. That's normal. Though I am concerned about the work to break ratio for adults. I work about eight hours and get two fifteen minute breaks when I'm on my feet the entire shift. If I want a full half hour, I have to get an ok from my supervisor to combine my two fifteen minute breaks or I get a half hour lunch and must stay for another 30 minutes in exchange. I barely have enough time to eat on my breaks and it's affecting my health. That being said, this place isn't for everyone."
good,"the management i had to deal with was racist"
good,"as a stocker in the dairy department we had under age shifted  mangers , sometime they only had two people for the entire  shifted when you need at least 3-4 in what was basally one of there super stores. they messed with your schedule all the time and made you go in on days you were meant to be off"
good,"Kroger offers exceptional benefits to part time associates more than any other department store chain around. Upon one year with the company, they offer benefits including: two weeks paid vacation time, personal leave, sick days, heath insurance (medical, dental, and vision), retirement plans, tuition reimbursement, and many more."
good,Management is inconsistent. Kroger has gone down hill in the past 4yrs. Hiring marsh workers who have let their own stores gone down hill and bringing them into kroger just to do the same. Not only that but it takes away from the workers already with the kroger company to advance in the company. Kroger management is to work 45 plus hours a week and many times end up working more than that plus months without days off.
good,"Management is poor. The majority of employees are treated with little respect. "
good,"Not amazing, not terrible. Just a job like any other. Management had its ups and downs, good co-workers and bad co-workers exist. I was able to work there while going to school and they worked around my schedule because I am a good worker."
good,"With the addition of the Nashville division the company has become more stressful and less work life balance. The company has gone down hill under the current division leadership. Management turnover is very high. Currently new managers have to sign a contract to stay with company for a specified period of time, otherwise they have to repay a prorated training cost. Further, the training for new managers is not preparing new managers for the job. There are some very good leaders but not enough to improve the current culture."
good,"I absolutely love working in the bakery."
good,I worked at Kroger Clicklist as my first job where I received short shifts but worked 6 days a week and made little money for about 2 years and I didn't receive any pay raises. Management does not care about employees situations or personal time. Not a good place to work for a long time but okay for temporary work.
good,"Kroger had difficulties with management when I started working. They switched mangers three times and I only worked there for 3 months. The first manager was the best manager and then he was sent to a different Kroger and the two who took his place were not up to the task, which I assume is why the Kroger here closed."
good,"A typical day at my store consists of many different aspects including: customer service, working loads, ordering product, scanning out damaged, unloading trucks, filling backstock, and a lot more. It is a highly stressful environment. Managers aren't very supportive and don't schedule enough help especially for how busy my location is."
good,in my time at this store i have had my hours cut time and again. I have begged and pleaded to get more hours. Sometimes i got more but it felt like i had to pull teeth to get more but i do love working with my Coworkers.
good,Managers got mad at everything i did i would do what was asked and they got mad then i wouldnt and they got mad. My work house were all of the place and i never got more than 16 hours a week.
good,Kroger is very inconsistent with scheduling people to work and always accusing people of stealing just horrible management never enough employees on the clock lines get backed up it’s just horrible
good,I loved working there but I felt like i could never move up in the company and the fact that I felt like i had to miss holidays and weekends with my family made me leave
good,"Working at Kroger is a great job for a teen in high school just getting their first job. But past staying there a year or two, it doesn't offer much to an employee. Advancement from within is non-existent, pay raises are slow to come (if they do), and management is a real hit-or-miss scenario. It instills decent work ethic in young ones though."
good,Kroger was a good place to work when I was a teenager. I learned a lot. Like work ethic and the importance of knowing how to work well with others and how to talk to people.
good,"Work can be wildly different from shift to shift as the store traffic varies throughout the week and even within the same shift, as the rushes come in waves and can be hard to accommodate, particularly as you will find that you are left understaffed for a rush."
good,It was a good place to start out when iwent to college but the manager I had liked to choose favorites and even though I was a good worker I always got the raw end of everything and he made innapropriate jokes all the time towards me and It was a very stressful time especially for a college student which made me end up quiting. Especially when the main managers did nothing to resolve the conflict.
good,"Kroger only focuses on the bottom line, but doesn't see how their changes are affecting what they are trying to accomplish."
good,Frys is a stable job and treats their employees fair and under pays managers . I have worked here 13 years and im ready for a change in the company.  I have been to all the stores in tucson.
good,"It was okay and some days were fun to work there. I did not care for some of the people in the management area."
good,"Working trucks, filling milk, working back stock, scanning out damages. Making sure that there is no out of dates. Doing markdowns. "
good,"at the store i worked at we were under staffed and and overly managed in both the morning and night. There are just simply not enough people working there, but those who are still at that store are great co-workers"
good,the same review as the other one. just friendly customers fast paste customers were friendly. did have some drama but not to much u can handle. management was no good
good,"Nice clean environment friendly fast pace keeps you busy "
good,"Kroger isn't really a terrible place to work, but I worked in the Deli. They had too many employees for the number of hours they were giving out. I applied to be full time and had 15 hours almost every week."
good,"Great first job, helps to build a work ethic and teamwork.  Ability to build customer service skills.  A bright person will find working here challenging"
good,"Asked for full time job, but hired me on as part time. Then had me work Full time hours only letting me get one day off per week. Four managers at the store and all did nothing to help others when needed. they are lazy and stand around telling others what to do, most of the time they are in the warehouse or loading docks on their phones. The fellow employees that worked there did the bare minimum except for a few who actually did their job, but had to work more cause others slack."
good,"A typical day at work is being understaffed and overworked, and dealing with many rude customers. But the regulars are the ones that make all the stress and pain worth it"
good,"There was nothing really special about working for Kroger, it was just a basic job during high school that paid decently. The managers were hit or miss and some people lacked core skills that brought down the overall team but it wasn’t too bad"
good,Kroger is a good place to start. But in my position I got 3 raises and that only put me at 7.50 an hour. The store I worked in didn’t follow many safty rules or union rules but as long as the work got done they were happy.
good,"It's a mixed paced workplace, with friendly employees but the management isn't the best. The hours are absolutely horrid unless you work a management position."
good,"Krogers had good management but if you aren't a fast paced person I wouldn't recommend working there. Overall Krogers is a great place to work, though."
good,Communication is key with any job or service you do. This job would like to know the locations of there employee almost all of the time. Greet and stay in a good place with everyone especially the older people working there.
good,"I have learned quite a bit about the grocery business, but I will admit that most of the knowledge has been self taught. Although Kroger has a training program in place for new hires, once you advance within the company you are on your own. A lot of management is hired from outside of the company with little to no knowledge of grocery retail. This provides a difficult environment to succeed within the business. In my current role, I work about 60+ hours a week. Though I have great benefits, this leaves me little to no time with my family. That is the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people I work with. I have created lasting friendships working for Kroger."
good,Kroger can't keep employees. The majority of management don't appreciate the staff and when they finally find a good worker they over work them to the point that the person wants to quit.
good,"Start by getting direction from manager for daily task. Help customers, stock shelves, keep displays in order. While team members are normally friendly, they often have bad life habits that should be avoided, which makes choosing friends difficult."
good,"I enjoyed the work because it was friendly and fast-paced, and I got to work with customers. Unfortunately, a lot of the managers would keep hiring people in and giving the people they already had fewer hours. The pay was very low and I think everyone should be paid more there."
good,"I make ok money but some people who have been there longer and work hard too make signifintly less and i dont think thats fair. I also think you should be given raises based on job performance, which you are not"
good,If you just get out of high school I looking for a temporary job or part-time work Kroger's Fred Meyer is a decent place but if you're looking for work to keep a roof over your head it's going to be challenging.
good,"I started at Kroger in 2008 as a temporary solution, but when I was offered full time immediately and promoted quickly (initially), I stayed on, mostly for the benefits, but partially out of loyalty. As I learned more about the company, I first realized that my situation was hardly typical, and like most corporations, Kroger does not want its employees to become full time; I was just lucky. After years of listening to corporate propaganda and hearing how poor the company was (despite record profits during this period), I finally recognized the true hypocrisy of this company. I worked there nearly 5 years, and during that time, labor hours were reduced by more than 50%, wages remained nearly stagnant, and workers were taxed more and more each day. Add to that an erratic schedule of switching between first, second, and sometimes third shifts, and it just wasn't worth it. Still, the health insurance was cheap and pretty good."
good,store closed suddenly while on my first vacation . and management would add more and more tasks to my job  ! plus the 4 restrooms i had to clean  and empty trash cans when night did not .
good,it was a ok place the manager there was very perverted and hated on the younger guys because he felt the women might of been attracted to them but besides the horrible management it was a OK job.
good,"Kroger is a good place to start a career, You can move up or even relocate if you chose. There are management opportunities available if you desire them."
good,Like working for this company. If you need hours you can get them. Learned alot about scanning also. Great people to work with. The management was good.
good,"It’s a great first job, but like all first jobs... they’re gonna suck. Pay was decent at the time, but once the cost of living for myself went up.. so did the need for more money"
good,Not the funest place to work. Some employees are not friendly. Could have better training and cross training. Worked at other companies  that offer more room for advancement
good,"The only thing the higher managers care about is getting what they want, they don't care how hard it is for the employees to get things done. They will blatantly disrespect you and not give a darn. We are supposed to be given hours by seniority but if they don't like you they'll give you one day a week after being at 45 hours a week for months."
good,"I found Fry's to be a decent job if you were over 18 but because I was under that age at the time, I was not eligible for effective benefits. The management was extremely unorganized and they didn't care about the well being of their employees unless it benefited them $$$ 😡"
good,"Good job no work life balance."
good,"The managers are rarely up front during rushes to help out staff, making the job very stressful. Pay raises and promotions are rare and hard to get. Overall it was not a good experience working there."
good,Management doesn't no how to treat a employee like a person or give you acomplament.   There only worried about there products of the store. They don't care about their employees. They just treat you like your a number or a slave.
good,"Working at Kroger was fun and kept me on my feet, which I enjoy for the most part. Only thing was, management was not the best. I got verbally assulted by my boss and was not allowed time off for my mental health issues that was affecting my personal life."
good,"Working at Kroger's provided me with an opportunity to meet and socialize with people from all walks of life, daily. It was truly a great experience and the cashiers really helped each other. Management, however, could've been much more than what it was."
good,While some managers were amazing towards the end of my time there they replaced the really decent managers with those who were not as good. They played a lot of favorites and it became more about who you knew than how well of a job you did.
good,An okay place to work of your looking for fast past and on your feet constantly. The management is lacking customer service but they also don’t have a lot of good customer skills.
good,Not a whole lot of physical training on the job (you will spend many hours watching videos not pertinent to your job). Company just wants a list of things done every shift and does not take account the time it takes to actually interact with guests and provide them with a positive experience
good,"A Kroger store isn't a real bad place to work, but some stores have management that will over-work certain departments without second thought. If you have good managers and co-workers, with sufficient hours supplied, then it can be a positive experience, otherwise it is just terrible."
good,"I worked as a Starbucks barista in a kiosk inside a Kroger store. I liked my specific job a lot, but I hated the management of the Kroger store. The store manager would come along and tell us how to do our jobs, despite the fact that she had no actual training under Starbucks itself, and she does not take harassment claims made by employees seriously. Friendlier management would be a vast improvement."
good,"It is stressful to work there as, if your at the bottom you get hardly any hours, yet they say we need help.. if they dont like you, you can see it pretty quickly as you'll see hours drop and people under you getting more hours or being asked to stay longer."
good,I enjoyed my job there and even tried to get it back which sadly did not happen. My coworkers were nice but the higher-ups were problematic. It was ok
good,"Kroger is a good place to work hard as a manager.  Follow policies and a person can move up.  Hours can be extreme, but good customer service and attention to detail will always be an asset."
good,"Kroger is a place where at least half of the store has worked for Kroger for most of their adult lives.  That gives an amazing sense of community between the workers.  The management by and far is supportive and Herculean in their efforts.  This is due to most of the assistant, co- and store managers having worked their way up through the ranks.  Of the stores I have worked for, I found the management here to be the most uniformly competent and prepared for the day. That being said, pay was very poor when I worked here.  Hours were also quite variable, with union rules on making employees full time at 12 weeks of full time hours making 1 in 13 weeks a 15 hour anomaly. All hours are assigned by seniority, so the half of the store that has been working at Kroger since they had a tape rental store will receive priority in both hours and shifts over all others. Understand that the job is open shop, with union membership available, but not mandatory.  At orientation the Union representative will give a presentation about the benefits of the union, but these are largely either universal to all employees or exaggerations."
good,"The work is hard but can deal with it ,management is the main problem.not all management are rude,tell lies and not take responsibility for their mistakes,treat employees bad by talking down to them or try to break them down. They need to be sent to a class on management and how to boost employees.some come in with a bad attitude and you have a bad day all day.this is just my opinion in the area I work."
good,"It wasn't an awful company to work for, just the pay was not even close to what you could make at other places, They expected employees to accomplish an excessive amount of work without any extra compensation. Often short staffed."
good,"i am so tired of working here. everytime i close i end up just wanting to pull my hair out i get so stressed out. would only recommend as a temporary job, if youre in dire need of a job and cant find one anywhere else."
good,"A typical day at work stores or travel"
good,"It was a good job, I loved it but I would like something with more benefits. Every day was different, some days were slow and others were chaotic. I learned a lot from how to cash people out to what ingredients are in the food. I wasn't very fond of management because they didn't listen to you when you told them you needed a day off for a doctors appointment."
good,"Working with Kroger was a great opportunity to have as a first job! They have friendly staff! I would recommend Kroger as a great first job but it does not pay nearly enough to live on. I got hired as a part time job, but I’m looking to get more hours to save for college. I had a great experience beginning with, but management has been going down hill."
good,This place was fast paced place to work. I liked the co-workers that I worked with. Management turnover happens a lot. The pay was not good at all and there really isn't any opprotunities for company advancement.
good,"My typical day at work would be very fast paced The hardest part of my job would be balancing between work, school and home life . Overall I enjoy  my work place"
good,"In the department I’m in I feel as though we’re not appreciated for our hard work. The pay is horrible and it’s a lot of physical work, and on top of that in the summer we are not provided A/C."
good,"The job was close to home and convenient. The company works hard to make sure the position you work is suitable to your abilities. I floated to many different departments regularly gaining experience in many positions. Pay is fixed for all entry positions, but there was a guaranteed 50 cent raise every 6 months."
good,"Too much favoritism on males beings, that  can go party, golf, etc,. while females are excluding from even any type of job promotions."
good,"Work day is interesting and entertaining"
good,"I liked being a cashier because I am very sociable and love the quick pace during busy hours. However, there were no benefits and my schedule was always different. One week I would get 40 hours and the next I would get 24 hours. I could barely afford my car payment."
good,"I liked what i did for Kroger and the company as a whole, the thing i did not like about it was how the atmosphere would widely change from store to store."
good,"This is a diverse working environment, some days it is slow and other days it can be pretty fast paced. The most enjoyable part of the job is the interaction with the customers. You have the opportunity to meet different people everyday, and form bonds with the regular customers."
good,"The pay was not good. Manger would make the schedule and change it on her own without telling you. The company is not bad just that one experience at that certain Kroger, and it's closed down."
good,"At my location, pharmacy technicians were paid the same rate as cashiers (minimum wage) and only offered one dollar more per hour for those with certification. It doesn't matter what your availability is, you will probably end up working random shifts that vary week to week. No room for growth."
good,Good place to work for kids starting out in the work force and have no work experience. Would recommend you going in with a set work schedule in mind so they don't take advantage of you.
good,"As a Deli Clerk for Kroger's, I came to that place knowing that they needed workers because they recently lost a lot of workers region wide. They did the proper paper work. I did my training. When I got to my job location, everything was new to me so I stayed quiet as I tried to learn my job through the person i was shadowing. Once I got a feel for the job, I started to get more hours, as it became an everyday thing where people calling in sick or didn't feel like going to work and calling me to see if I could cover for them, I had to go. When your boss asks you that if you could come in that day on your day off because he doesn't feel like working on that particular day just so that he can relax, then that shows how lazy he is. Whenever I brought up an issue that I found out before I even clock into work, he would try to blame me for it. Whenever I made a mistake and before I made that mistake and asked him that information so that I wouldn't make a mistake and then tell his boss that I still did it wrong. I had to go."
good,"Overall Kroger's has taken a very dynamic turn improving their stores and setting them to be market places (one stop shops like wal-mart), with that it leaves pros and cons. Pro customer service is increased and item availability has greatly increased, Con it has made work life hectic and stretched thin,. As my matter of opinion the idea was great     the fallow through was left lacking. Also your starting pay is based on your position, and if you get moved your pay can increase or decrease,"
good,"Coworkers and supervisors, as well as customers, were generally kind, helpful and friendly towards each other and cooperative. However, management was rude and often ignored requests or suggestions. Certain managers were very unprofessional and talked about workers to their coworkers and ignored those who needed help. I give this job a 6/10. Take it with a grain of salt."
good,The store manager would not hold people accountable for their duties.  The store was a wreck.  All the burden was placed upon those who were hard working
good,"I mostly bagged groceries and pushed carts "
good,Okay for a temporary job. Currently understaffed but management does jump in to help out which is a welcome change and much appreciated at times. Due to understaffing it can be stressful especially during the busy times in the deli.
good,"The pay is far from competitive, whenever they post job offers they have a general idea of who they are gonna hire before it's even posted, expect to be called in on your days off frequent, can take 10+ years just to become full time."
good,"A typical day at work most likely include cleaning out the meat cutting room and do all the dishes the 1st shift/meat cutters left behind. rotate and maintain product displays, as for management, it lacked strong leadership. Most enjoyable part was meeting and getting to meet so many nice customers."
good,"- a typical day at work including answering questions and stocking shelves"
good,Its an okay place with lots of benefits and alright pay. But if you have bad management your whole experience will be awful. I suggest if you work here to be really open to new experience and even more open with your availability.
good,"ok job, temporary. Working as a cashier. Atypical day consists of ringing up customers groceries and taking payments. We are times as to how fast and effective we are at our jobs."
good,It is a very stressful condition during the winter and summer time for being outside and also when it is raining outside to get carts. During rush hour you have to at least have a most carts in to be safe of not having to stop everything and go outside to get carts.
good,"Fry's was inflexible when it came to hours and behavior. There's a lot of pressure even for lowly baggers. The culture was nice, as elderly customers cared a lot and were talkative."
good,"it is very difficult to advance in the company due to lack of communication and training. the most enjoyable part of this job was meeting new people. a typical day at work was fast paced and difficult to meet standards everyone wanted their employees at. the workplace culture was very excellent, very easy going."
good,"I started in the liquor store and should have NEVER left my position. I learned a ton though. I picked up the u-scan and cashiering without proper training, I was quick to learn. I worked in quite a few different departments because I was flexible at what I would accept to do and some days I needed to work. It was hard to leave my position but I could not continue working for such little pay since I have 2 associate degrees and I had an opportunity to work in a field that would make almost 3X more money per hour. I really did like doing what I did there but again too little pay and I needed time with my children as a single mom."
good,"Working at kroger is fine. i mean it was just a job for me, just a thing to do to get a little cash here and there while i did other things. the job was fine, I like who i worked with. I don't know what more I can put."
good,"It's a good place to work if you don't have a second job and are willing to work whatever hours. Also, the pay is on the lower side so it's better for teens in highschool who have no bills to pay."
good,"Not everyone does what they need to do. Some get away with stuff. Everything gets confusing. Management does what they need to do. Working good. People get away with being on the phone, and I get yelled at for being on the phone."
good,"great for a temp job or a starter job but not much more. salary is low and no benefits, you do get discounts on groceries. always busy and sometimes late hours."
good,"Great position if you are a single, career-minded person. Would not recommend for those with families or those who do not live locally around their families. Gained a lot of business management/human resources knowledge, but position not conducive to life needs. Major lack of work/life balance - days begin at 10 hrs,(usually longer), not enough turn around time between shifts to be productive on the job, and inability to schedule own vacation time/personal days."
good,I have been with Kroger company for over 25 years and I'm looking for a position with less physical labor. I am looking for a office position or computer related job.
good,Working with Kroger in arkansas was more stressful.  They didn't work with my schedule for my kids. Hours were inconsistent and weren't willing to work with my life
good,"The job itself was easy. When it came to anything to do with management doing anything it was hard. I was denied whats called a ""closer to home"" transfer (when you have to drive 20+miles to your store they will transfer you to one that is closer to where you live). I was told the reason was because we were understaffed when we were not."
good,Start $8.50 and scale every 6 months. regular clerk role is easy job as long as you know what you are doing. Might be intimidating at first but easier as time goes.
good,Working here is okay I don’t mind it but the management here sucks and that’s the reason I believe people are leaving this store and going somewhere else
good,"I worked for Kroger (Fry's Food and Drug) for 28 months. In that time I was able to make many friends among my fellow co-workers. I pushed carts, interacted with the customers, bagged groceries and even did returns. I learned how to bag groceries efficiently and how to locate items in the store. The store could go from being incredibly busy to very slow in a matter of minutes. Every day was different. I would say that the hardest part of my job as a Courtesy Clerk was putting items back on the shelf. I had to know not only what isle the item went on, but also where in the isle. Some items were easier to find than others. The most enjoyable part of my job was the interactions I had with my co-workers. I was always able to have a good laugh at work. Management, however, was a different story. Many of the assistant department managers I worked under treated the Courtesy Clerks as someone would treat mud on their shoe. My intelligence was insulted many times."
good,"people i worked with were cool and nice, everyone was always busy so didn't get too much help and learned a lot by myself. it was fast paced and could barely finish work on time if i took short brakes."
good,"They underpaid me by 3 dollars an hour at least. The other employees were wonderful. As well as, the workplace was a well-kept environment. The best part was how laid back the job was. The hardest part of the job is the weirdos you might have to deal with it is a service job."
good,"I enjoyed what I did at Kroger but not exactly doing it for Kroger. The ""big dogs"" of Kroger have a quantity over quality policy, where at times it seems they aren't really concerned with how their products look presentation wise, but just that there's no ""holes"" on the sales floor. Employees are treated as less than compared to customers with the ""customer 1st"" motto, which without customers we wouldn't have jobs, but there comes a point where the customers know and take advantage of situations. For example, in working in the bakery I had more than one customer go to customer service after receiving their cake and finding ways to complain and get money off or the whole thing for free, after they just told me how pleased they were."
good,"Kroger was fast-paced, but the customers and other coworkers made it fun. We also had a lot of free time when we were not busy, so you were not continuously doing things."
good,Fast paced stressful environment. Over worked for little pay. Job is designed for a teenager. Wouldn’t recommend for over aged adults that have bills and responsibilities.
good,for a first job kroger would be good but to make fixed hours and money it wasn't the best most workers are friendly and nice mangers are cool and understanding majority of the time.
good,typical day as a courtesy clerk is very busy and stressful but also may be slow and calm depending on the time's you work. The hardest part of the job is doing almost every job in the store including carts on a hot sunny day. What you will get from that is experience and social experience with other jobs and people.
good,"the work at Kroger is not hard, but it is a stressful environment.   There is almost always a corporate or division walk through being prepared for, and as a result the Department leads and managers are constantly pushing  the clerks and stockers to ""catch up"" on things that are only done the week before these walk throughs, because the same leads and managers do not prioritize them."
good,Manager font care customers are very picky everyone always unhappy job sucks  I would like new career  it very boring place to work at and there always drama
good,"There are different requirements for different departments but every departments main goal was...the customers. The customer is always right, and if you believe that then this is the perfect job for you. There are uniforms to wear so it looks more professional. Not a bad place to work, they are very fair with scheduling and if you are in school they work around your school schedule."
good,"I came in at nights, unloaded a truck, and started putting things on the shelf. There is really not much more to it than that. The only exciting part was conversations with my coworkers that were not unpleasant to be around."
good,"long hours"
good,"It's a fun place to work when you get to know the people there, however it is very fast paced and the pay does not often reflect the amount of work that you do. Your pay only rises yearly and it's hard to receive things you ask for from management such as a new shirt, vest, or name tag because they seem to always be busy. I myself still have not received my 10 percent off discount in my card for working here and it took them a year to finally fix my name tag since the day I started."
good,"good place to work overall. i personally fea due to the merger that Roundys Home office will be phased out in a matter of a year or 2. you can see it around the office and seems to me tons of ppl are ""jumping ship"" before the ""storm""."
good,"Overall mediocre, people are not recognized for their hard work. They ask and ask of you and aren’t genuine or thankful for your help in overtime or covering shifts. Pay is fine and takes a long time to get raises by hours.  Pay raise ladder is wack."
good,the most enjoyable part of the job is most of the coworkers. A typical day would be fast pace with an exceptional amount of hard labor and solving customer issues.
good,Management was the only problem there. They hire kids and put them in positions and they don’t know what they are doing! Even some of the older ones In management have no skills on dealing with their employees!
good,"Throughout my time at Kroger, many of my coworkers share the sentiment that if they didn't have to be here, they would quit and work somewhere else. I find this indicative of a poorly managed store as well as a lack of incentive to want to stay. It may differ from store to store, but where I work, there is a steady stream of high school students who will fill in the gaps for anyone that quits. With a steady stream of fresh workers, the managers have no problem treating workers how they please because they know they are replaceable."
good,I was not adequately compensated for the amount and difficulty of work and was not scheduled regularly.  The manager was very strict and didn't allow any downtime.
good,On my feet 99.9 percent of the day got no breaks constantly walking the store. My department “manager” was never there always on vacation and didn’t ever give her supervisor a vacation.
good,"When I started this night baking job, I was sent to a different store than I would be working at to learn how their night baker does things. I was there for one night, and then I was taken to the correct store, and I was made to learn 8 to 10 hours of work in one week and then put into it blindly by myself and the job ended up taking me almost 11 hours every night because its a two person job. Also I was under baking my bakes and no one would tell me, so they ended up firing me on the day of the end of my probation period after I worked very hard for 12 hours that night. All around 4/10. Four is because they paid more than minimum wage."
good,Kroger wouldn’t be a bad job if they pay more. getting paid min wage and dealing with so much drama and customers deserves much more. the union takes more out of your paycheck so doesn’t matter how many hours you get.
good,"8 hours on your feet"
good,fast paced work environment that keeps you busy from start to finish of your shift; not a great place if you are looking for perks by working there but definitely a great place if you are looking for part time work for extra cash
good,Hard work but fun to cook the seafood and meat. Cleaning the kitchen at the end of the night shift can be brutal. Sometimes it was unsafe to walk around the kitchen without non slick shoes.
good,Work here if you want health benefits because they are one of the few companies left in the US that has a worker's union.  Do not work here if you want to be anything other than a drone that has benefits or upper management.
good,I have nothing good or bad to say about Kroger. I enjoyed some of my coworkers and enjoyed the relationships I built with my customers over the many years at Frys.
good,"I love the company but like everything else, its not perfect. Management at my personal store has changed many times. The deli is a demanding job. Its an easy job but fast paced and sometimes labor intensive (i.e. raw chicken boxes weigh 50 lbs and you are required to sometimes get them off a pallet and stack in cooler according to date)"
good,"When I walk into work, the assisting mangers and other cashiers are happy to see me because of how much I help them.  I work sometimes at the desk, assisting cashiers with other customers, and bagging when it's possible to do so(which is often).  I feel that I do the job of 3 people and get paid minimum wage.  The environment is nice to work in when we have help but when we are understaffed, store management still expects perfection.  The hardest part of the job is keeping up with changes.  Rules on how things are handled change from person to person and no one knows whose information is current.  While I do enjoy working with my fellow employees and helping the customer the best way I know how, store management seems to only see me as a machine."
good,"Good for a first job, but wouldn't recommend turning this into a career. They work with you when you need days off, as long as you request them in time."
good,Kroger is great if you need benefits like health care now. For temporary workers it isnt so great. Seniority is a big deal here. If you are at kroger a long time you get rewarded. It is also really hard to get fired since you belong to a union.
good,"Great company that takes care of you benefit/ pay wise, but the room for growth and improvement takes entirely too long. Other than that, it was somewhere to start and I really learned a lot."
good,Terminated without warning or explanation. Managers gave vets special treatment. Co workers would tell my managers false information and I was scolded without being given a chance to explain my side of the story. I felt targeted by co workers.
good,"Slow paced and easy work, good for a first job but not for anyone looking to make a lot of money. Great for those who enjoy working in costomer service."
good,"Typical overnight stocking job. Easy but bad pay. Good medical benefits though. Take this job if you are desperate or going to college. If you show hard work and drive to management you may be able to move into the Management Training Program. Also, the Kroger warehouse in Memphis pays much better."
good,"I liked my job well enough. It was fairly easy and once I was trained, I could work independently with no problem. Sometimes there were outrageous customers, but that's to be expected anywhere. Most employees in the store were great! But my manager and her assistant were not. It seemed like they wanted t place blame on anyone if something wasn't done, even if that person had nothing to do with that task. They were also not very helpful with questions."
good,"More of a social hour than a job. Always stressful, no matter how hard you work at least one customer is never happy. ...............................>"
good,"This is a very stressful environment. there is no work life balance. however if you do not have a family, this position would be fantastic for you. You will work every weekend, although here and there they give you a bone."
good,"The only thing that I felt was unfair about this job is that if you are under 18 you only get paid 7.25. Other than that it was pretty cool, I wouldn’t try to make a career out of it"
good,"It is an interesting place to work for a short amount of time, I couldn't imagine being there for more than a year or two. Nice people there but really terrible management that is constantly turned over"
good,Discipline loosely enforced and code of honor and integrity means nothing here although it was blatantly enforced during the time at the store orientation and hiring process.
good,"The typical day would be coming in to relieve or open the kiosk and prepare for a long shift, dealing with customers such as cashiering and handling of cash, fuel deliveries and cleaning of hazardous chemicals."
good,"Kroger is a great starting job, with lots of room for growth and advancement. However, the higher you go, the more is expected with less advancement in pay. I was expected to do the work of a manager with the pay of a lesser."
good,"The store managers come and go so fast it's hard to rate my experience there as I have seen over 15 store managers in my 3 years, some I got along with and I thought were great, and some just rubbed me the wrong way. In general for MOST departments in the store, it's not a bad place to work, and a pretty good place when there is a good manager over everything, but it hardly stays that way and will wear on a person fast."
good,I had this job primarily to pay for gas while I was going to school.  It did he job well and my manager was very supportive.  Overall a good first job.
good,"Kroger used to care about it's loyal employees, but it seems they are only interested in money. They keep adding on to our task list and decreasing our hours.. someone is going to make a huge mistake soon."
good,"Ordering, stocking, no help in my department, no coverage when I had a day off, co-workers stand around and talk? lack of work ethics. Getting other to do the job the correct way was the hardest part of the job."
good,"I loved my department and the manager, but not necessarily the higher ups. It was difficult to do my own work within my department when I was getting called back to unload the truck deliveries."
good,"Working in a retail pharmacy setting has rewards and challenges associated with the process daily.  I became a pharmacist to continue to help and serve patients with acute and chronic needs as I did as a pharmacy technician in the US Army.  The ever-changing face of retail pharmacy, as it continuously evolves, provides challenges that every pharmacist must adapt to."
good,"Great job while in college. Very flexible schedules, mainly on weekends. Kroger employees are very friendly and helpful. "
good,"Tedious work, co-workers can very from quiet and busy to very social and slow, management is ok lacking in a lot of area's  but make up fore it with positive attitudes."
good,"Working at Kroger is a very good learning experience, due to each day being unpredictable. I started off working as a bagger as well as being on basket duty. I eventually learned and worked my way up to customer service, then finally began stocking.It sounds easy, but everyone is somewhat in competition with each other which makes it a bit difficult. But I still enjoy working there because of  the bond you can have with co-workers as well as customers."
good,"most upper management don""t look out for your best interest. They never talk to you about your strengths or weaknesses. some coworkers were very territorial about there departments they lead"
good,I loved waking up to go to work and see my favorite coworkers and favorite customers. my second week of work I have at least 6 coworkers come up to me and tell me how good I was at my job and they said I was the one in a long time that's worked like that.
good,"Typical day on the job is, to make sure opening operations are running on timely manner. Customer needs are met accurately and rapidly. Schedule changes made consistently to meet needs of company."
good,"This is not the easiest job out there. There is some room for advancement, but it is not easy to advance in this job. You may be given more than can realistically be expected to be done in your shift. There is, also, a very inconsistent schedule."
good,"I have truly enjoyed the last 9 years I have worked at Kroger, but the company is become less patient-centered and more about the bottom line. They are changing and cutting positions and hours leading to employees having to seek other employment in order to make ends meet. It has always been one of the best pharmacies to work for, but now they keep adding required work, but expect you to do so with less hours, less help, less pay, etc. At this point, in just the last year, the job has become one I do not wish to come to each day because I know no matter what work gets done, it is never enough to satisfy GO."
good,"My experience was well worth working for Kroger, the management and fellow coworkers were great to work with, I enjoyed the preparation of the food for the day . and the people that I  came in contact with"
good,I worked at Kroger grocers for about a year and the people were nice. The job kept me fit as I was constantly pushing carts and entering and leaving the store. I found the pay was mediocre and they showed no incentive to give a pay raise for learning something new. If you absolutely can not find a job anywhere else or if you are retired I would suggest this job.
good,"I didn't like how the managers pulled the power and superior card all the time, also I was doing my job plus 3 other courtesy clerks job but getting yelled at when it,s not done or not done right."
good,Kroger is not a bad company to work for if you're blessed with a good manager and people who want to do their job. I had an amazing manager at the time and I really appreciated her flexibility in taking care of her employees.
good,You stay busy you stay on your feet you stay moving greet customers helping people you help people decide which meat and cheese to choose you let people sample
good,If you want to work here go for it. It’s more of a high school/ college type of ppl job. Pay is ok but you get little hours as well. I don’t have anything about this but some of the management sucks but overall it is a job.
good,"took them two weeks to email me to call them and after that i was asked to come in for a group interview. About 3 days later i was old to come in again for a final interview with the department manager and was hired right there. But I will say It's good job for someone who is in college or high school. Management is bad though. Schedule was ok but overall they do constantly mess with it. If you want this as a starter job to experience for another job then go for it. Other than that, good luck."
good,"Kroger, one of the big names in supermarket chains, may appear happy and chipper on the outside from a customer's perspective. However, if you're an employee, it's a different story. The work can be grueling and the pay you receive for it - hardly feels worth the effort. On the bright side, there are a good many friends you make and lessons you learn."
good,"You are never placed in the department you were hired for, barely schedule you, and the pay isn't worth the amount of work that needs to be done. The only good thing about the job are some of the employees you get to meet on the job."
good,Decent environment to work in. Worked well with coworkers; they were easy to get along with. Management was fair. Hardest part was the occasional unreasonable customer.
good,"The job would be a lot less stressful if it wasn't in such a hostile environment. There is always a constant concern for safety, and it makes the job harder than it should be."
good,"okay to work when going to school and working they work with scheduling but might have trouble with taking vacation off or any days off need manager to approve,"
good,"Started when they opened.loved my job in apparel. Would not go back under this magement.Best apparel member on staff. Kroger in Burleson is an amazing store to work at ,and shop."
good,"A typical day at work is pretty organized. I learned to keep a smile on my face no matter what comes through the door. Management was alright, very professional. The workplace culture was happy and calm. The hardest part about my job was training to do be a U-Scan watcher but I finally got the hang of it and loved doing that part of my job the most. What I enjoyed most was seeing customers come in everyday with different stories to tell."
good,"I felt that nearly every position there, including mine, did not have enough people or were allowed enough people to do all the things required as well as maintain customer satisfaction when your stressed out."
good,"When I first started working there as a deli clerk it was great. There is a lot of contradictions. For a starting job, it’s a great place to be just not in the deli. I don’t recommend the deli. Although I’ve met great people there. My coworkers were super friendly and very helpful and I’ve gotten a few friends from it. Now that I’ve been there for a while, I’ve seen some issues. There is terrible scheduling. They most likely will not work with the times that you are available. They’ll put you to work even when you aren’t. I’ve seen so many people come and go because of how bad they are being mistreated by customers and managers alike. I’ve been treated poorly as well as my other coworkers by customers and the managers will not back you up. You will always be wrong. We have policies we really don’t follow.  It seems as though no matter what you do, there will always be something for them to chew you out for."
good,"I was hired and promoted to a lead position within a month but was not trained with realistic explanations of what was really needed to perform necessary daily tasks. (i.e., I was shown how to do certain reports that had no relevance to my job and not shown how to do other reports that were expected)"
good,"Krogers is a good place to start your first job at. For me, it was fun and a little exciting until after a couple months you really get exhausted and really want to find somewhere else to work just so you can find something more beneficial to you."
good,"My time at krogers was good. Even though I didn't work there very long it was a good first job at age 17, getting my work experience for when I moved on to other jobs."
good,"This was my first job in high school, and it taught me the basics of what having a job is like."
good,"I was working at a Pick N Save when it was in the middle of switching from Roundy's to Kroger. The Kroger team was often unreachable for questions and concerns regarding the changeover, and even when you did get a hold of them, they often didn't have an answer. "
good,"It was a good first job, until management and other employees started picking on a individual employee. I should of stuck it out because all the bad ones are either fired or not allowed behind a register now."
good,"Kroger can be a great place for the right type of person. Those who enjoy relatively relaxed, customer service-oriented retail jobs can enjoy what Kroger provides."
good,When i worked for Kroger i wasn't happy being a courtesy clerk. I wanted to move up but management denied my request to do a different position. Kroger managers did not abide by my availability while i was in high school.
good,"bagging fro Kroger is a very repetitive and easy job, depending on the Kroger Store, they can work very well with your schedule or horribly with your schedule. Worst part about the job is they will promote the prettiest people, not the hardest working."
good,"Each time i come into work i'd have to constantly clean up the back dock, make space for what comes in the order that day while other tasks i have to complete for that day. i'm tired of my department being o under staffed, or people not pulling their weight"
good,"What can I say, it's retail. In some retail you are compensated for the work you have put in. Not here. Most others enjoy the culture here. I don't personally socialize. It is your typical day in day out retail work. Little changes."
good,"Kroger pays very well depending on what department you work in, but the work schedules are very inconsistent and they do not promote strong family ties and leisure time. Management is most often very abrasive, and there are very few managers who accommodate you for personal reasons. The benefits are very good, but overall Kroger is a very stressful company. Most of the employees are overworked and underappreciated."
good,"The meat department was poorly put together, not enough employees. But I loved all my coworkers. The only really issue that I had with the place was the management, they hardly came around to check up on you and if they did there was always something negative to be said. Not that I wanted just praise from management, but their expectations were too high."
good,"Kroger Companies try their best to try and make you feel like you will belong, but in the end, I was not able to stay there for very long, due to going to school in a different city, and not being able to transfer closer to my dorms. "
good,"I worked here in high school for a few years. You basically set your own hours depending on your availability.  I worked after school and on weekends."
good,their schedule is inconsistent and management is poor . the management are rude and nasty . if you work here don't be a cashier work in the other departments like deli or apparel.
good,"It's retail hours so schedule is not set, might have to work at 6 AM to 2 PM and next day 5 PM to 11:30 PM. "
good,"Poor management training and needs a positive attitude towards your employees "
good,"Management at this company really didn't seem to connect with employees on a personal level. Although the job was secure, there was no true work-life balance"
good,"I didn't work there long. I didn't like bagging groceries.  They said the job was full time, but I never received full time hours. Hours was not consistent."
good,I had a good time meeting new people but my manager and management are really petty. Very disrespectful but the money was great because you get paid weekly.
good,"It's become micromanaged. They expect 1 person to do the job of 3. It's almost impossible to get full time. Pay is horrible starting out. It doesn't matter how good everything is, it's never good enough."
good,Their under staff and need help. So for being under-stuff they set somewhat impossible goals leaving people discouraged.  its not the fact that they will fire you but that you feel like your not being of any help. Every once in awhile they would sugar code what they mean leaving you dumbfounded. The pay could be better and raises could come faster.
good,Kroger is a good job if you plan on retiring with a company.  They don't like anyone who has a disability though and will fire you for it. Watch out..
good,"this was my first job and was just a minimum wage position. Management was on a revolving schedule, so we had a new manager every month or 2. hours were all over the board, never knew what you would get, so planning life outside of work was hard."
good,The company is okay to work for but I feel they don't start people out as much as they should. But if you work another job or in school then that's a good way to get some personal things done.
good,"Very structured which leads to beauracracy and ineffeciency. "
good,"As a first job, it isn't that bad. But the type of experience I had as a bagger depended on the day and the staff I was under, as well as the location I was working at. Stressful rushes come in fits and starts and you often have long periods where management have to come up with tasks for you to do. It's not horrible, but I couldn't see making a career out of it."
good,When you are here you are on your feet in the same spot all day long. When yo start your a bagger who is constantly sent outside to grab carts no matter the weather. You deal with all types of customers so yo never know how the day is going to go. I would suggest working for a competitor company if you can.
good,Hiring manager was very unpleasant and unprofessional.  Hours were not scheduled right. It was very catty. Working for the company was not easy. At times I felt very uncomfortable.
good,"Working in the Bakery department was a decent experience, there wasn't as much stress involved as in the Deli or Cashier departments. The managers were very thorough, understanding and kind."
good,The place has fun coworkers that's about it. Pretty straight forward job stock or check. If you get your work done. Basically just find something else to run.
good,This job was boring and no fun at all. There are no promotional opportunities and the employers treat you as though you are very replaceable There's no empathy in the workplace at all.
good,This is the only job that I know of that will try to have you work every position in the store. I couldn’t even finish the work in my department half of the time because I had to go help out somewhere else in the store. I’ve practically done everything possible in Kroger and I was drastically under paid for the amount of work I was doing.
good,"My typical day here could be slow or it could be very busy. You have to come into work ready for both. If it gets too slow, they start to send people home, unless you really want to get hours."
good,"This job suits people who need something to fill their time. There is no opportunity for advancement and you are a number in the ranks of people. The management is there for you if you need them, but won't seek you out or care for more than the hours you spend working in the store. Management will work with your schedule, but rarely will find holidays and extreme weather days off."
good,Not t he  greatest place  to  work.   Good  for  high school kids  and house wives needing  extra money   and  be flexible  in hours. Pay  is  not  good  either unless  you are in upper management
good,"Management from the top down were great,and they actually hired pretty competent characters which is good. Unfortunately, they get really stingy with the hours, and they don't really pay well."
good,A whirlwind of activity.  Great place to learn but not so great for families and family time.  Constant mandatory OT to make up for or respond to sales.
good,Running a cash register for eight hours recieving only one break. Managment was strict for example not allowing cashiers to have water bottles at the register.
good,Overall nice place to work for. Work hours were there if you needed them. Employees were generally easy to get along with. Pay was okay and near competition rates
good,"I won't hold all Krogers accountable for the terrible experience I had working at the Lake City location. However, the people are lazy and disrespectful and as a former courtesy clerk I feel as though I was paid unfairly because we made .50 less than everyone else even though we truly did all of the work there."
good,Overall good. I feel that the company as a whole is built on a strong moral compass. I feel there is room for improvement in processes and am seeking elsewhere.
good,Did not like managment. I have nothing of value to impart about Kroger. Its a minimum wage job that only gives part time hours.If get the change to stay long enough to work up into a full time position the out look gets better.
good,"I work in the Grocery department, Dairy, Natural Foods and Frozen food as well as check in Vendors via the back dock. I do a store walk through every morning to see how the store looks from the previous day. "
good,"Training could use some work, other then that there isn't much to say about working as a cashier there. I wished they explained and practiced with newcomers how to handle government food vouchers. Something to point out though is that Kroger seems to be the only grocery store that has a strict scan 21 items in a minute policy compared to Food Lion or Harris Teeter."
good,A typical day is fast paced environment. I usually have to problem solve for a lot of problems. I hire and discipline associates as needed day to day.
good,"It's just another place to work. I worked there for 3 years unloading trucks, stocking shelves and dealing with the pro's and con's of the workload. The associates are friendly, the managers expect more than the workers can do in one shift."
good,"Poor Pay Poor Management"
good,"I was sexually harassed often. looked over for advancement because i was not thin enough or sleeping with bosses. When i spoke up about offenses,  i was harassed more."
good,Worked hard and I made a mistake that I shouldn't have but nothing I can do to change that. I admit my mistakes but this job is way to stressful to have for the pay.
good,"Management plays favorites, Management would rather have someone have every aspect of their uniform together than someone who works hard and diligently."
good,Co-workers and CSR's are not very friendly and they do not offer much help. The CSR's don't do a lot to help out there team they mainly stand to the side and allow everyone else to do the hard work while they pretend they have more important things to do off to the side like make conversation with other CSR's about unreverent topics when it comes to working.
good,"as a manager at papa murphy's pizza making dough from scratch taking orders for customers prepping veggies/toppings for pizza. hardest part of the job when business was slow, most enjoyable making fresh pizza daily for customers to take home and bake"
good,"If you are in a high-volume store, especially one in a major metropolitan area, you will succeed at Kroger as long as you stick it out and make it known that you are looking to advance. It especially helps if your manager is an advocate for you."
good,Fast paced and very disruptive work environment.  Management does nothing to make it a good place to work. Hard to keep good employees when you treat them badly. Most safety problems that need to be fixed get no attention from management.
good,"Great management,  understanding and helpful both personally and  professionally. It was great meeting new people as well as getting to know the regulars"
good,"I like working at Kroger, the people I work with are great. It's just I don't get paid enough to be doing 3 jobs and getting paid very little over minimum wage."
good,"You wear many hats within store 706. It has almost been a full year since I've started working and I have experiences working Grocery (days and midnights), Bakery, Floral, Dairy, HBC, the front end and even helping out with a store closing. I see this as experience to help me learn more about my store and the people who I work with"
good,It all depends upon your immediate supervisor. It can be an excellent place to work or it can be a grind. Some of the managers that I have encountered have been excellent. Others have been total slugs.
good,"No consistent sleep schedule. One day you open, the next day you close. It's what I hated most about this position. It's not a difficult job physically, but it is extremely stressful. Being ""promoted"" to a supervisor doesn't even get you a raise. It just gets you added responsibilities. You effectively become the scapegoat."
good,"The company is always short on help, with that we straggle to provide great customer service. Most managers they don't care about employees they concentrate on customers, sales and budget. I believe the company should care about employees as well to keep that harmony and positive atmosphere. A lot of employees feel not appreciated and that leads to lock of motivation to even come to work."
good,"You do not get very many hours and the pay sucks, but it is a lax place to work. You have a chance to switch positions and move around in titles, but no advancement in pay."
good,"Kroger always wanted to make the customer feel at home and they stressed that customers were always right. "
good,in this company i worked with everyone stayed because of the manager she was so nice then they got another one they kept leaving the company and we was so not uncomfortable
good,"I would describe a typical day at work, a laid back slow pace kind of day. On a day like that, I've learned how to professionally prepare the cakes, as well as writing on the cakes."
good,"When you first start, you need to check and double-check to make sure your schedule to correct, because if you are a student, it takes a while for the system to let the managers know, if it does at all. Difficult to move up in the company unless you know people."
good,Kroger was not anything to special.  It was a good couple years before the manger that was there when I left.  When I left there was less than 10 original employees.
good,"I usually worked daytime and closing shifts so on an average day i would either be working the front counter assisting customers or in the back using the fryer or ovens to prepare items for customer pick up and for the bakery floor. The atmosphere was split between being very rushed at times and extremely slow at other times. If i was closing, working with the other person on shift we would sanitize the equipment, store the items on the olive bar, take out the trash, and sweep and mop to make sure the area would be clean for the morning employees."
good,"I learned how to deal with different types of people, how to handle rude customer attitudes without loosing my cool, and also that just having a happy tone  in your voice and a smile can impact someone's day for the better."
good,"Part-time work gives employees more flexible hours.  After probationary period of employment, workers are able to request certain hours and provide which days they are willing or able to work.  Fast-paced environment, can be stressful during a busy day especially during holidays.  Management constantly changed, no consistency.  Raises were very few.  Started minimum wage, only received a 50 cent raise after 3 years of employment.  Full-time employees have seniority over part-time workers.  Customer service is a must for this job.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with very rude and/or angry customers.  The most enjoyable part of the job was when I had regular customers prefer me as their cashier and to have them tell me that they had no problem waiting in a long line just to see me."
good,"I loved being able to be creative with my work and my bakery crew was fantastic. The structure of this workplace, along with a certain management style made it not the right place for me."
good,"It was a nice place to work at first, people were nice, a fun work environment. Until they started messing with work hours. Managers are not the only ones who have to pay bills. What really pushed me to find another job."
good,"I work for The Little Clinic inside of Kroger. Kroger itself is amazing. I love everyone who works here. The staff, (the nurse practitioner and techs), are great. My job title as patient care technician meant that you would do everything from registering the patient - collecting insurance and personal information - getting patient vital signs - keeping track of inventory/ ordering - & mostly just providing excellent customer service to both the patients and Kroger shoppers. It is a nice, rewarding job. I have met a lot of nice people and some I now call family."
good,This place would be a better working environment if they hired more people that actually cared about their job. Instead they don't and you end up doing your job then someone else's.
good,I love my job. I am just disappointed in current management. Our manager is not fit to be a store manager. He has no respect for employees& is a bully
good,"Must be able to pull long hours on night shift..lot of heavy lifting, tugging.  To me that is the hardest part of the job.  Love my coworkers, we are close like family and help one another."
good,it's a pretty fair job with very good flexibility for hours. U get various promotional opportunities in the company. If your in school it gives scholarships and works around your schedule
good,N/A just avoid this store at all cost the overnight manager will throw you under the bus the 1st chance she/he will get its really sad. There is no on the job training they pretty much put you in a Aisle and tell you to start working weather you know how to stock or not thankfully for me I had a great Assistant manager to help me out the lead manager  doesn't do anything but complain at us
good,"While it is possible to advance in the company, it was rare to see people get far. Most people are under paid and over worked. Employees have very little influence on the operations, creating tension between management and employees."
good,Each day differs. Some days are fast paced while others are slow. You do not get paid enough for your time and management was always changing. They don't listen to employees as much as they should and switch you around too much.
good,Too much politics and back stabbing from fellow associates and no true help from the Union in saving people's careers. Management is lackluster and beaten into the same mold by corporate so there's no sign of humanity or individuality.
good,My manager is cool and I get along with my coworkers fine I just need a job where the company will takes into account the cost of living and make sure that their employees will be able to pay their bills without having to work three jobs
good,Night shift was a joke. I was not able to take my breaks due to being the only one on the front end. Stock would not be willing to help and I felt completely alone
good,"I do all pharmacy tech tasks, Data entry, filling prescriptions, product ordering,and cashier-waiting on customers,. I feel the workplace culture is a little laid back compared to Ohio."
good,At Kroger I learned how to give excellent customer service and the ability to multi- task better. the hardest part of this job is having to work late nights.
good,Being a Courtesy Clerk means you have various different jobs to do. It is the hardest job in the store with the least amount of hours and the least amount of pay.
good,Typical day is slow. Learned where a lot of products were located. Workplace culture was good. Hardest part was stocking. Most enjoyable part was working in the back in the receiving area.
good,Being a pharmacy technician at Krogers was a good learning experience for pharmacy school. The pharmacy manager was understanding to my situation as a student and worked around my schedule.
good,"Management was rude and unprofessional, however, coworkers were wonderful."
good,"Not a bad job if you're just starting off, but not a job you can make a living on. The current benefits are pretty good, but they can change everytime a new contract goes up."
good,"Overall the hours are reasonable but with little variety. I learned about management and organization of many online orders. Workplace culture was poor and not a very hard working environment. The hardest part of the job was the lack of break time, and the most enjoyable was the customer interaction."
good,"Many managers have their favorites and will do anything for them. If you are not a favorite, you will just be there to work. The favorites will get their days/vacation days off. The others have to beg and plead for their time off to be approved. And the district manager isn't helpful or friendly in any way."
good,Kroger was a great place to work. They had pretty good benefits. I just did not like the management. They would encourage you to do better and you do better and it never seemed to be good enough.
good,over all I would say that whether you like working here is very reliant on your manager. Most of my position involves preparing food and cleaning work and service stations. Not all coworkers have the same work ethic and you can be asked to pick up others slack. This can become extremely disheartening over time.
good,"very busy, and can tend to be quite hot when doing carts. Paired with the fact that a plethora of customers may tend to be quite hostile about seemingly minor misakes"
good,Kroger is a good company to work for if it is your first job and you don't mind making just barely over minimum wage. Coworkers and management are nice and lenient for the most part but they're easy on everybody because everyone who works there is either in high school or retired.
good,If you enjoy the public great job for you.  It is a lot of work for minimum wage. It's hard to stand for eight hours in one spot. Each department is ran differently. All of the managers answer to the store manager. the chain of command is clear.
good,"The job requires you to be flexible as possible and to be willing to work and to work as quickly as possible. All in all, it's a hard job and many times you are cleaning up trash left by customers."
good,This was my first job and I stuck around for 2 years. I left because a manager began to treat me poorly. I liked that I was able to learn to work over several different positions in the store.
good,A typical day at work is doing all the left over production that was not done from other emploees and managers. Store management don't see the problems and don't like when employees personal life shows up.
good,"If you want a work life balance.. Kroger isn't for you. You are expected to stay over almost everyday. It's frowned upon if you leave in time.  Expect to work long hours, nights, holidays and weekends."
good,THis work place offers good benefits and good offers for raises and increases in vacation time but the management and corporate culture is poor. Don't recommend their corporate methods in managing.
good,The job is very convenient for those who are in high school or college or a retiree looking to make a little extra pocket change. The pay isn't all that great so if you have the experience you better cash in on it.
good,"A good starting job, that's about it. You will learn all the basic of a job and something more if you want to learn. The works there is fun to talk with and to work with."
good,stressful on most occasions i have learned a lot management team is all over the place if your in a good store the culture is great bad store not so much hardest part is dealing with upper management the people you work with is the most enjoyable.
good,"If you have been there for 6 years or more it is an ok job, pay is pretty good & benefits are pretty good."
good,"Making sure proper cash handling procedures are in place.  Training newly hired associates about cash handling procedures and cashier techniques be as well as baggers.  Managing the total department including cashier's​, baggers, service desk, utility, and price changes."
good,"It's a good place to work, at least starting out. Soon though, you start running into trouble where things that are promised don't come out as they should, or the pay isn't quite enough for what you need. Still, it worked while I was with it."
good,It's a grocery store with a pharmacy in it.  Have fun dealing with people who are better than you because they don't work at a grocery store.  The union is a joke too that you have to join
good,"The pay was not too good. They schedule you heavily. The manager was good though. They had a diverse set of employees, as well. And the job was not too stressful as a deli clerk."
good,It was a great environment to enhance one's customer service skills and develop a respectable and tolerant attitude towards people. I learned the inside functions of retail business.
good,"when I worked there, the management was not great. They cared more about the profits that the workers needs compared to the normal standard of management."
good,Most of the people I worked with were good people who did their job. Management was a little iffy sometimes but my direct boss was good to work for and with.
good,The management is toxic and too much to bare. The job was easy but I felt that my talents and skills were not being used in a practical sense. I'm looking for something more.
good,"Typically the environment is extremely stressful with the amount of labor versus the laborers. Also the negativity that surrounds the space within is not one which I will recommend others to work at. Merely the cost does not outweigh the benefit , in all cases."
good,"It wasn't really bad working there it was really just the customers, talking to you any kind of way only because they known u can't say anything... but it was hard to keep your composure and you don't always get the credit you deserve when your doing a good job, the employees take advantage of you leave you hanging... it's kinda hard but you just got to remember nobody has your back but you"
good,"I enjoyed the job I did, but coworkers sometimes threw a wrench into the gears. Supervisors never took charge or took blame. If something went wrong it was because of someone under them end of story. pursuing advancement felt like an uphill battle as it was based on seniority, and rewarded people who suffered through the job rather than fulfilling it."
good,"I enjoy coming to work every day. Greeting customers and having the opportunity to make their life a little better, so grand. For them, every day our product needs to be the best. That means bringing out the new, taking care of the ones on the floor waiting for a home...sprucing them up so they look good...and sadly saying goodbye to those that did not find a home when they have passed their time. Every day I learn from our customers how to fulfill their expectations and from my direct management and co-workers also how to do so. The workplace culture is exceptional. Everyone is uplifting. We make like to love in our team effort ensuring customer is first. Unfortunately, ""management"" is lacking effort in my mind to support. I am not paid a living wage. Need to have other work which was defined when I was hired. Consistent issues there. That may be the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job...when a customer thanks me truly for what I have simply done to make their life a little better."
good,Overall Kroger's is a decent place to work for high schoolers and people needing good insurance. Management can be an issue at times co-workers are fun and easy to work with overall the hardest part of the job is establishing time management skills as you are pulled to do multiple things at once
good,"I started at the bottom of the food chain with Kroger. When I first began working for Kroger, I was a Courtesy Clerk. Therefore I pushed carts, bagged groceries, and did maintenance. I worked ther for a little over a year and moved to General Merchanise, doing stock and whatnot. Kroger isnt a bad place to work but management is not very good at communicating, and the pay is not going to support a family."
good,I networked with managers to maintain my store. The best part of the job was building relationships with coworkers that lasted even after my employment ended.
good,"an ok job if you just want to work a few hours out of your day, can be busy depending on the time and day. only 15-30 minute break. poor management, poor pay and recognition."
good,"The most enjoyable thing about this job was some of the people that I worked with and the different types of people that would meet. Meeting those different types of people helped to introduce me to the world and the different types of people that are out there. What a good day, long day stressful day and etc. looked like. Like every job that job has its ups and down but most of the time you'll always see someone to help the day go by."
good,"A typical day at wok i'd help customers out and enjoy making them smile. I enjoyed being around everyone and making customers highly satisfied. The hardest part of the job, well there wasn't one, I'm a very easy learner so I catch onto things very easily and don't let anything discourage me."
good,Food 4 less was a nice job due to my cashiering.  But I don't advice working for this company due to my experiences there. Very challenging place to be.
good,"If you are interested in retail this would be a great company to work with. For an artist, this is not the case. There is no growth or potential growth to help advance your career."
good,"I worked at this retail business for over 15 yrs. I liked this place until a national chain bought them out. Everything changed for the worse longer hrs, less pay, less chance of promotion and a lot of unhappy manager led to a lot of unhappy co-workers.At this place your just a number."
good,"There's not much to company culture. You show up and you do the work and don't make any mistakes. Basically, it's fast paced because of the amount o work you are to do and that's it. There isn't much else to this job. It's simple but tedious."
good,You get raises every year but there mostly five or ten cent increases. Got consistent work and they work with a school schedule. Have a revolving door of workers that quit within a week.
good,I enjoyed working for this company as loved interacting with people and providing great customer service. Lots of good conscientious employees plus company provides opportunities for growth. Schedules can be difficult if you are going to school or working another job. They have employee appreciation days and also give great discounts for purchases at Fred Meyer. Benefits are also good as well as insurance and retirement options.
good,has benefits for part time..instills work ethic...diverse culture..flexible schedule.. lots of oppertunity...good benefits.  .pension...hard work... unionized
good,"I shared my Culinary and Hospitality Management knowledge with Sanitation practices and quality customer service."
good,They do not adhere to protocol at some locations.Inadequate supplies to clean the prep areas is a common occurrence. Powdered gloves cause your hands to become dry which in turn enables your hands to be more susceptible to cuts.
good,"Kroger was a productive, fun workplace. When the time arose for donations to the children's hospitals, animal shelters, etc., there were competitions to earn gift cards if you were able to get the most donations for a certain amount of time. Management was helpful most of the time, but could get short with employees at times."
good,Where I worked I thought that it was a great place to get work experience. It was also a good place to work on your people skills and to work on acting professionally in a work place environment.
good,"Typical retail work place, likes to promote within.  Learned a lot during my employment there.  Has a diverse work force.  Has challenges that help be a better employee."
good,"There is a definite disconnect between what happens in the stores, and what upper management thinks happens. This provides unnecessary stress to everyone on the store level."
good,stocked grocery's and thats about it i ran around the store helping customers while being asked to do others job at the same time it was cool but not there management or other employees who are in charge of training.
good,It's retail so the hours are tough to handle. If you like to work long hours and meet tough deadlines it may be the place for you. It gets tough to handle with management constantly micromanaging every aspect of your job.
good,"We were understaffed almost the entire time I worked there. The management tried to help, but were mostly concerned with getting their numbers without providing us with critical hours needed to reach their goals."
good,You have to have some other goal in life in order to get by working for kroger. The managers do not work as a team and they are for themselves. the culture and work life is bland at best.. You will get paid minimum wage
good,"After 2 years you top out at $28 an hour. 8-11 hour days average. 6 day work weeks most of the year. Southern California distribution. Teamsters union full of thugs and crooks, but that's why we get payed what we do."
good,"It is an OK company to work for. Not a company I would recommend at all. You don't get raises unless you work in a specific department which you must be offered and very rarely do they do promotions. It is very fast paced which I prefer but working as a courtesy clerk, the pay is NOT worth the work you do."
good,"Fast paced and rarely slow. Lots of customer interaction and opportunities to improve. Management could be better, often cares little about the advancement of employees."
good,"You'll work almost to exclusion of everything else. If you want a full time job, you can get that there. They do have discounts, and that's pretty nice. Be expected to be asked in on your day off."
good,"The customers weren't the best, but overall it was a fun place especially for a first job. Management probably isn't the best, can be pretty strict and at times rude if you don't follow the rules to the exact extent."
good,"Starting was fun and eventful. Ended up becoming strained and impossible to finish work without having someone try to mess up your work. Management didn't bother trying to make things better. Any time a manager would try to help they would be switched to a different store. I enjoyed the co-workers that I was able to spend time with and get to know. Overall, I would join back up if they were able to work out all the problems and drama in the bakery."
good,"When you are in the management sector it can be stressful with no work life balance. Pay does not meet up to work load and expectation they have."
good,Everyone is usually very nice and respectful. I learned how to do multiple things at once and do jobs with a great sense of leadership and numbers. The hardest part is the no being able to make your goals and keep the customers happy. Management is slightly easy to work with and for.
good,"Retail Management"
good,"With the acquisition by the Kroger company, change is a constant in the Roundy's organization.The company has gone through great change in the past year and it hasn't been pleasant. Those that have helped build the organization with years of service, no longer matter. Company morale is at an all time low. Work force now consist of part time workers, people working two jobs, new to the work force workers  and those that don't have any options."
good,people are fun to work with. customers are great. store is very clean but disoriganized at times. not enough help. break room needs improvement. provide free snacks or lunches to employees
good,Easy and fast paced environment. Upper management doesn't treat employees good though. You are also underpaid and expected fo do more than what your job description says.
good,Mariano's was my first place of employment. The job was rigorous but I was able to do all tasks asked of me. The work environment was friendly and the management was very caring.
good,Kroger is not a terrible place to work for but the pay isn't good and the management is rude and mean I definitely wouldn't recommend working for Kroger because there benefits aren't worth the stress
good,Most members of management join the company as a store management. Store management is a difficult position to excell at for more than a couple of years without getting burned out. Store management pay isn't very exciting and you work 50 -60 hours a week including most weekends and at least a couple of nights a week. Competition is fierce to advance from store management to a division or corporate position. If you earn a promotion to the division office and your willing to relocate to work at the office then your work schedule and pay improve significantly. Pay and work schedule typically improve even more if you earn a promotion to the corporate office. Not true for all departments however as the corporate regulatory compliance group works 1 weekend a month and a couple nights each month.
good,"I liked the people. Didn't like that your pay grade starts over from the bottom if you transfer departments, which is what they pressure you to do as a sort of lateral ""promotion"" when you start making too much money for any given area. That, and they tend to promote the incompetent to get them out of people's hair, while hiring store management from outside. It's just not the corporate structure for me."
good,The job is okay. If you have bills and a family the pay isn't that good. This job is more for if you are retired or if you are young and starting out.
good,"The management is very unprofessional. If you can get passed that part it is an ok part time job to have. Very easy labor work as well as stocking shelves, sweeping, etc."
good,"Days were always very long.  With so many strict policies and procedures in a union environment, the management often had their hands tied.  The hardest part of the job was not being able to make many decisions on my own, but this was 30 years ago."
good,very hard to excel and management are very disrespectful .they lack communication skills and expe t to much for not enough pay and no health coverge also every body is part time doing full time work
good,"I worked here a long time ago. It was just a typical retail job. Stocked produce, kept the store clean and organized. Learned how to do price changes and stock shelves. Management was very good at recognizing you for your hard work."
good,"Very minimal workers , no acknowledgment, they dont care about you or your well being,  no benefits, guy told me to sell myself to try and get fulltime, move you around different  locations, no team players, badddd, under paid"
good,"I started off as a cashier and was moved up fast throughout the rankings. Work with a lot of high school students, which is majorly annoying because they never want to work. Management changed hands quite a bit while working here, which just confuses you since each manager has different expectations and wants things performed different ways."
good,"Started in logistics, pretty fun work. However, management is not very polite. Can be outright rude. Developed 4 years experience from overnight grocery, to liquor sales and cash handling."
good,The pay is the main reason a lot of people leave this company..A lot is expected of you with minimal compensation.Not much room for advancement.Customers were the best part of the job.
good,"Everyone stayed pretty busy. There is a lot of team work in some departments, and others is more independent work. Most of the people I worked with were nice, however some of the employees thought it was okay to act childish to one another. The managers were pretty nice. The hardest part of my job was when almost everyone quit and there was only two people doing the job i was doing. I enjoyed working with some of the people who worked there before they stopped having picnics and stuff."
good,"A typical workday for me including during the opening procedures of the store(lotto, cash tills, bookkeeping, etc). When the store opened I checked customers out with a friendly manner and made sure they found everything they were looking for. I learned how to do the bookwork in a matter of a few months of being there. I was being trained to be a shift manager, and also learned how to make the schedule. The workplace was a fun friendly environment filled with team members who cared about their jobs and their customers. The hardest part of the job was learning how to work with everyone's changing schedule requests whilst having an effective team on the sales floor during the busy times of the day. The most enjoyable part of the day was seeing the customers leave satisfied with our service."
good,Some expectations are unrealistic but management has job security. It is very difficult to terminate unproductive employees as Kroger has a union for hourly associates.
good,First job I ever worked in my youth but pretty typical of an easy-paced job for a young adult or senior. Not anything particularly astounding nor offensive of it.
good,The workplace is stressful because there isn't enough help to provide quality customer service to our customers because Kroger doesn't like to pay their workers good wages. I personally would not refer anyone I know to Kroger because you can go somewhere else and start off making more than what Kroger will offer you.
good,There's not much room to be promoted. The promotion system is rigged to reward time in job rather than the work you do. Management does pay attention to your needs as well as does not take care of issues on their own and tend to cause many issues before clock out.
good,"Shift schedules varied daily and off day varied weekly, with schedule posted on Wednesday afternoons. Difficult to schedule appointments and family time."
good,Poor management. Never had the tools we needed to get the job done. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers. Lots of heavy lifting and dealing with food. The hardest part of the job was making do without our materials.
good,"everyday was always a positive day just because seeing new faces is always a good thing. the co-workers i worked with were just phenomenal, i couldn't ask for better people to work with."
good,I did not feel like Kroger ever really appreciated or encouraged their employees in the day to day operation that goes on in their stores not just mine. It took too long to advance there and was all around an unpleasant experience.
good,Hours were very flexible but management was full of people who secured thier position and stopped caring about anyone under them. The union is a joke.
good,"The pay for the amount of work required is not comparable at store level.  However, the manager at the store level has no control due to a labor union contract that is negotiated at a corporate level."
good,"- Good hours"
good,I mostly had a good time working at krogers. During my employment however they transferred our management elsewhere and the people who came into the management positions we're not very good at it.
good,a typical day at work is helping customers putting items on the shelf and making sure that all of the tasks are taken care of
good,"A typical day at work for me included stocking shelves, keeping inventory of products, providing customer service, and maintaining store cleanliness."
good,"ok place to work, but not enough pay for the amount of money and things you had to do.  customers were pretty nice, and some of the staff.  overall the company is a good company."
good,"It is a great place to start out working. There is not much room for advancement, however I learned a lot about being an employee."
good,I enjoy the duties of my job and could live to have more consistent and secure management. A typical day for me is cutting up fruit and vegetables and there is little room for advancement.
good,"Often times we were understaffed due to people calling in our just under scheduling, we were also encouraged to send people home early at the end of the night. I learned how to run a cash register, process WIC and EBT orders, balance a till, do a pickup and loan to drawers, close the front end, and manage a break graph. The job was enjoyable minus the insufficient training."
good,Stay calm and collective when customers come to you with a problem. Most customers typically have a attitude when things aren't going their way so be patient and sweet
good,"Kroger can be a great first job for someone young. Unfortunately, these days, it is not a job worth keeping long-term. Wage increases are an issue. For example, when minimum wage goes up, the raises you got before no longer apply. (You worked there for two years, and now get $9/hour; minimum wage goes up to $9/hour, so you should get $9.50/hour now, but you don't.) The good parts about the job include being in a union, and having a generally easy workload. The hardest part of the job is honestly just dealing with customers and coworkers (sometimes - at other times, people can be pleasant.)"
good,it was a good experience it taught me a few things about living in society and how i need to work for things i need and want and made me a better person overall even though i wouldn't make a career out of it it helps people truly understand what they want to do for the rest of their lives
good,"-Was an okay first job."
good,"The work is consistent, the schedule is sometimes flippant but overall it is a good workplace. There are some concerns involving union members though, so be careful of that"
good,I didn't like Kroger when I was working there the pay was unfair and I was not getting any hours I don't know if this is for all Kroger but they should raise the prices
good,"It is a busy store almost every day.  Most customers are nicer and pleasant to deal with.  It is a past pace environment which is good, makes the day goes by faster."
good,I was a cashier. Didnt really like it. many people were snobby though I had some pretty great co workers. Standing on my feet in one spot for 8 hours wasnt the best. And breaks were always late. hardest part of the job was the customers. THere were a lot and they could be mean and snobby. you dont start out full time and I was there over a year and still didnt get it. They cut my hours to less than 10 hours a week by the time I quit. They dont pay you enough for what you have to go through
good,"a solid entry into management job, with room for advancement.  your experience will vary greatly based on your manager."
good,"Working at Kroger might have been some of my best times I've spent working, I got to meet people from all over and had the opportunity to interact with them."
good,Management: Work days are very long. A typical day is 12 hours or more depending on the store location. Co-workers (management) are team and goal oriented.  Employees are represented by a Union and therefore diffucult to make substantial changes without approval and written documentation (4-5 events).
good,Typical day of dealing with hostile customers and shoplifters.  I learned that customers get away with anything when related to the manager no matter if they have broken the company policy or not. Hardest part of the job was dealing with people that steal and get away with whatever they can; and to get your supervisor to notice you.  Best part of day was when you got to get off.
good,"All and all nice place to work, poor management, nice people, had fun, enjoyed working with my co-workers, even when we were understaffed, we pulled together and got the job done"
good,"I wasn't fond of the work environment but it did help me build character nd work ethic. Although I have learned lot from working at this establishment, I would not go back unless there was higher pay."
good,The people at Kroger's are very polite and most are personable.  I feel the training at Kroger's is very poor which allows for employees to be lazy and not care about the appearance and overall functions of the store. There is so much that can be done to make the Store better. It all starts at the top. There was very little support in the area that I worked but I always take pride in my job so I learned a lot on my own by reading all materials pertaining to the Fuel Center.  I felt I helped to make the Fuel Center run smoothly and my customers liked me a lot.
good,"This is a tough place to work due to the physical aspect however, when you get used to it it gets better. The chance for promotion was avaliable if hard work was put in."
good,Working at Kroger felt like you were working with a family. Working at Kroger does require hard work depending on what department you're working at.
good,My coworkers were always helpful. Whenever I needed help they were there. The most enjoyable part of the day was the middle of the day when it is most busy..
good,"I work as a cashier and take care of customers, great job!"
good,"Part-time job, no less than 18 hours per week, fast-paced environment, opportunities for advancement. Scheduling changes from week to week, pay is not that great, team environment."
good,This is a great entry level job for teenagers and college students. The hour are only part time and the pay rate low. Management is always too busy to train new employees.
good,A typical day at work was just work. Very little team work due to everyone doing what they can to just get the job done. The hardest part of the day was getting started. The best part of the long day was going home.
good,"While the company promotes a training program, the program leads down a path that isn't always of your choosing or skillset. It needs more focus on all possible advancement opportunities as well as position openings."
good,Kroger has a good atmosphere and employees you can count on. It gave me the experience I needed to decide which direction I wanted to go in my life.
good,I would rather not comment. Every job has its positive and negative points . I would say I can not complain. It was nice. Don't know what else I can say
good,Coworkers are very friendly and helpful and great when it come to teamwork. However the compensation is an issue for me. They are flexible with your schedule and talking to the customers is the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,typical work day is time goes by very fast and you are always on your feed and your co-workers are very nice. The only thing was there was always a new manger and everything would always change.
good,"I enjoyed working there ,especially because of my coworkers who kept my head up on stuff days and made the job fun ,I love to get paid every week but wanted more hours and the management  was decent but could have been a lot better and organized"
good,Kroger was a great experience. It was my first job. Thanks to Kroger I  have a lot of customer experience to offer in new job opportunities.
good,"Generally, the workers' attitude within the store is not so great. Coworkers get friendly with each other, but there is always some talk behind people's backs. The management wasn't a great thing either. Some managers slack off while others aren't able to be reasoned with. The leads of each department did great within their responsibilities."
good,The people I worked for was okay to work for and they cared for there employees. In the stores I think they need to put up glass around the employees and the register in case of being robbed.
good,The typical day consisted of loading and unloading crates of all sorts of items and restocking shelves. The days were fairly easy but sometimes things get hectic and you might have to step to do someones job.
good,"On a typical day at work at Kroger, I was required to stock shelves with new product, run backstock, maintain a safe working environment, condition shelves, count inventory, receive trucks, and help customers.  With these responsibilities, I gained valuable time management skills.  The management and staff conducted themselves in a professional manner.  The hardest part of the job was counting inventory, because everything in the area counted including backstock needed to be included.  I enjoyed the freedom in the workplace this job permitted."
good,But awful pay min wage for a pharm technician. Had to pay 50 to get certified plus paying in to union-- pay checks were less than 200. Dont give many hours starting out
good,"It's a great job I receive payment by cash,credit card, automatic debit card. And issue receipt to customer an assists customer by providing information and resolve their complaints."
good,Pay here doesn't compare to other similar jobs and management continues to pile more and more work on its employees because they cant keep any new hires. Management sets unrealistic expectations and if they aren't met you're admonished but never complimented when you succeed.
good,"They will not schedule you as requested even for medical appointments or school."
good,"It was great, but my kroger store needs to fix itself. The best manager at my store was Kevin. Hendricks was alright while the other guy was ok. Only reason why i stayed longer than a month was because of the people who i worked around who were amazing people."
good,"A well known company, but has become to detached from it's employees. They will work on your schedule with you, but fail to take in employees as individuals."
good,"A typical day at work as an attendant in clicklist includes: "
good,"Kroger was once a good job. I worked there for a year. The pay is not great, but then they force union dues our of you, even before you are off probation. And there is an initiation fee on top of that. By the time the union gets your dues, the pay is bad. It's like the part time people are subsidising the union for the full time workers. And I can not tell you how many people I have talked with where the union just sat in s meeting with an employee, and management and never opened their mouths to help them."
good,I'm grateful for having a job- that view greatly influences how I view the job which makes it hard to give a good unbiased opinion of to give a summary.  The management is decent but am having communication issues with the management currently. Also am having severe problems with my schedule as my hours are all over the place which cause quite a few problems for me- for many reasons one of which (which is very important to me...) is that it is hard for me to go see a counselor for Army/ deployment related problems.
good,Variable hours prevent from having personal life with family.  Minimum wage with no increase in pay after 4 years of employment.
good,"Great job for someone who can multitask, supervisor will work with your schedule. Sometimes the job gets hard because of staffing issues. They hire alot of 16-18 year olds who won't work. I personally love the job, but many quit because the starting pay is minimum wage."
good,"This job has made me learn about money management, be a multitask, and also to perform more my costumer service experience."
good,"I learned team building skills, management styles, computer skills and interpersonal communication skills. i managed many skilled people and also taught and supervised many who  were not educated or disciplined. Mostly my week was 6 days and 48 hours in duration and usually 8 to 10  hour weekend days. Continued education was always needed to keep up with state and federal laws and rules."
good,"- Depends on position"
good,Good company with training managers into leaders. Terrible turnover 212%!!%!??? Most committed to staying with the company are the managers and long term employees. A typical work day is babysitting all the departments to make sure they are doing what they supposed to do. The hardest part of the job are the people not being adaptable to change ( set behaviors).
good,Kroger is an okay place to work. The management team is a little hard on you but they have good intentions. The breaks and discounts are nice.
good,"I have learned alot about making the customer the most important part of my job. "
good,I worked small amount of hours. Posted and adjusted sale and price signs/tags. Learned how to use a scan gun and mobile printer to generate sale signs and tags. Coworkers interact well with me. Only one manager stresses out to deeply. I enjoyed being left to do my job with little supervision. Not much difficulty with my position.
good,"After clocking in I proceed to the supervisor before me and see if there is any information I need to know. After a brief exchange, I supervise the front end and do my best to ensure a quick and enjoyable checkout experience."
good,"The store manager needs to work on his people skills, He has rough fold quite a few employee's feathers. He needs to work on what he says to employees."
good,i started off as a cashier moved to customer service after a year of that i ended up in produce working in the morning on food displays and ordering .
good,"I was able to move up quickly. But, because it was a union, I only made minimum wage. I was working the customer service desk and the cash office and did not get a pay raise."
good,"my first job in the united states, learnt a lot about customer service from this job,  my managers were ok and helpful sometimes, my co- workers were friendly as well. didn't work too long at krogers because of the pay."
good,"My job was pretty easy, but I didnt like the hard labor I did. I felt like I should got paid more for the work I did. People I worked with was very nice people."
good,"they were rude to their workers, and you couldn't even get to know your boss because they never really communicate with you on a regular."
good,"kroger is defiantly a place for a first job, you'll learn a lot . I learned every department within 6 months . The best part is you learn how to work on a team ."
good,"while i have worked at kroger for over three years now, there have been many management changes we have been through about 5-8 co managers, and we are on our 4th store manger. they say they have schedule flexibility  but in reality they make it more difficult than it should be to balance work/ personal life, or even finding better opportunities for yourself. if i had known my life would be like it is now i definitely would have kept searching for a different first job."
good,"Almost anyone can work in a grocery store, and the general feeling no matter how hard we worked is that we were expendable. There was a very high staff turnover rate, and management changed almost like clock-work every 2 years. The deli probably works harder than any other department because of how physically challenging it was. "
good,"a typical day at work is loading and unloading product. Putting product on the shelf and helping customers find merchandise. I have learned how to interact with customers as well as the people i work with. "
good,"Worked well with high school and college students with their school schedules."
good,"The company offers one of the best benefits package I have ever seen.  It is caliber.  But the pay and bonuses to management lag behind.  Overall, the company is great to work for and brings great opportunities to learn and grow.  The advancement for those with High School diplomas or GED's and no further education is very good to those who apply themselves."
good,"I would restock shelves, help the customers, clean the cutting room, fill the service case, the hardest part was trying to keep everyone including the customers happy."
good,Work was mostly dull and tiresome. The staff was usually going through the motions and didn't seem particularly happy to be at work.
good,"The company values its reputation as a fair employer.  The size of the company is in part to due mergers and acquisitions of other supermarkets.  The seams that hold the corporate body together can be loose, the mid and upper middle management seem to be attracted and remain loyal for other reasons than high salaries or job conditions."
good,"The wages do start out slow, and believe it will stay that way. Do this job because you need a job that's it.The staff is by far not the best at all. You will have to have another job due to the low wages, and lack of hours."
good,Kroger had a really good job security but the management was not good. They didn't treat anyone nicely. Always yelled at everyone for no reason.
good,"I love working with the public and interacting with the customers."
good,"Is a nice place to start however it is not the better place to work if you have monetary needs. There is plenty of room to advance if you decide to throw the student life through the window and become a full time, and if you are lucky to have a good manager."
good,Kroger doesn't want to pay their employees i had to leave because of that some of the managers care more about the customers than employees but not all better than walmart Though The Pay Is Nothing.
good,"Kroger is a decent place of employment. Thanks to the union, you'll never lose your job there. As to the reason why I put ""Job Security/Advancement"" at a 1/5, is because advancement is nearly impossible. With the Union, all advancements are based on seniority. I've missed out on countless advancement opportunities purely because someone else had been working there longer than I. They will take someone from a different store if they have a single day on you."
good,"Unfortunately, the Kroger Co. experience consisted of a constantly rotating door of employees, with little incentive to stay. And while the support staff and supervisors were able to provide excellent assistance to the rest of the team, they were few and far between, leading to very limited support being available."
good,Good benefits and friendly customers and coworkers. I really enjoy seeing the regular customers. They always bring a smile to my face. i enjoy reading the comments that they post about myself and my coworkers on the surveys.
good,Job is primary good only for starting or student.  Not much room for advancement and you'll be repeating the same tasks on daily basis.
good,For the most part I liked the benefits an earnings received throughout my time employed by this company.  I will refer for those reasons alone.
good,Very flirtatious and inappropriate female managers. It was a very harassing social environment for me and my coworkers.
good,learned a lot fast paced. easy to work. didn't like no breaks. small box to work in. cold in the winter and hot in summer. breaks were not given when needed.
good,"I was hired under the  ""Hire Veterans"" initative and I must say that my veteran status was used for tax breaks and nothing more."
good,"It is a good place to work for a high school or college student that needs flexibility with hours during school then maximum hours during breaks. A typical day at work on day that a truck is received involves breaking down the truck and unloading products. After the truck is unloaded, the product is taken to the shelves to be stocked. If product does not fit on the shelf, it is scanned into backstock and put in the storage area. After the truck is completely put away, the shelves are conditioned, which involves moving product forward and straightening shelves to make them look nice. On a day that a truck is not scheduled, the backstock is moved to the floor. After this is completed, conditioning is done for the rest of the shift."
good,Very unhappy with my current position and the way i have been treated as far as being looked over. I learned time management and how to effectively get a job done while providing great customer service.
good,"This is not a difficult place to work as long as you have a head on your shoulders.  Non-management employees have had their work boiled down to the bare minimum, so every day is pretty well set out for you.  I didn't learn anything new here, as I've already worked in grocery and not much changes.  The management is all over the place, always doing too much and nothing all at once.  They are stressed and overworked, and it puts pressure on other employees to push themselves far past their daily work requirements and their pay grade.  "
good,"For the most part the work is steady. If you work in the afternoon/night and all of your tasks are completed, you will have trouble finding things to do."
good,"Prepare customers' orders, cooked and cleaned.  The management was ok and so were my coworkers.  The hardest part was getting ready for inspections of the department.  The most enjoyable was being able to cook.  (Previously reviewed)"
good,"I liked working there, but it wasn't often that i got enough hours, and when i worked there the management wasn't the best."
good,"I met my manager twice the entire time I worked there. I was often asked if I would like to cover for someone and then would end up with that job, making me feel used. I asked to move to certain department and would be told yes only to be put somewhere else and never get the department I ask for or was hired for. "
good,Management is not efficient at my store but the job isn't bad. I have worked at other stores and their management is much more efficient.
good,"Busy, fast paced environment.  Sometimes inconsistent management depending on the experience level of who was running the shift.  Not a difficult job if you have previous cashiering experience.  The ability to provide a genuine customer experience is necessary.  Some aspects of onboarding were confusing and you could tell there was a break in the communication system from hiring to training."
good,"Cashier and stock. customer care and relations, handling funds and transactions. Also responsible for security and janitorial services."
good,"Job security and advancement opportunities are minimal but they do exist - if you're determined and know the right people (network) then you can eventually move into management. However, most employees remain at the lower levels for their entire career, making minimum wage or close to it. I took this as a temporary job until I find something more professional since I recently earned my bachelor's degree. However, my working relationships with my coworkers and supervisors is better than I expected going into the job, and my boss does what he can to accommodate my schedule requests. That said, HR completely bungled the hiring process and it took almost two months for them to pay me with a paycheck instead of with cash as an advance. The hardest part of the job is probably the work pace in the mornings when the truck comes in and the physical demands associated with moving hundreds/thousands of pounds of product during your shift. Most customers at Kroger are polite and easy to deal with but you still get the occasional difficult one. The best part of working there is the sense of comradery between most coworkers and the brighter working environment (as compared to Walmart, etc.). Even part-timers get benefits after 6 months or so, but the pay isn't competitive with some other large grocery retail chains."
good,"There is a lot to like about working for Kroger, but more to not like.  The management there is nonexistent unless there's an issue, the pay is low and the hours are long, the customers can make your job even worse than it already is, and you receive little to no benefits, health or otherwise.  The plus side (or down side depending on how you look at it) is that it is union so you have to pay union dues but it is nearly impossible to be fired because of this.  Overall, a good job to gain some work experience during high school but it's just a stepping stone for bigger and better things."
good,The job is not that bad but the some of the management is always rude and the rest don't care but somehow most of the front in staff are actually pretty nice people.
good,"Hours for work was early, so had plenty of time in afternoon for taking care of personnel things after work. Management was a team player"
good,"I worked mid nights so I didn't have to deal with a lot of the public.  People were very nice,  Learn a lot,  Great place to start, But needs better management."
good,Employees are flooded with misinformation and a lack of guidance. More attention needs to be put on employee satisfaction.
good,"Management is not very friendly, most of the co workers are nice and a day at work here especially in the bakery is very stressful and it feels like you hardly ever get praise for good work and no matter how hard i work i can never seem to please the managers."
good,They treat their employees like we are nothing but below them and here to do nothing BUT serve them and do all of their duties. It's a lot of drama I didn't want to deal with. The amount of work they would leave for the workers at night was unacceptable. Terrible company to work for.
good,The breaks were short and there wasn't a lot of help most of the times. When lines were long and customers go impatient I really had to deal with myself. It was a lot of pressure on me as a part time associate.
good,"Waiting on Customers. Prepping frozen rolls to be baked. Cleaning and closing up the bakery."
good,A perfect job if you are not a great worker and have little self motivation. Union culture persists which cultivates an environment of bad and lazy employees. This company does little to nothing to compensate/motivate its best employees which in turn causes them to leave for better opportunities elsewhere.
good,"Its a great place for a youth to get started with customer service, stocking, money etc. For the most part, I enjoyed working here."
good,The employees were very nice as well as some of the management but other management were ridiculous. They always play favourites at this company to the point where I couldn't stand it anymore.
good,Great place to work for the salary. Unfortunately there were times where other employees didn't show up for work or even sometimes management but overall a decent place to work.
good,the supervisors and some coworkers made work very displeasing to come to. constant feeling of being belittled and talked down to
good,Kroger is an organization that has a ton of opportunities to advance for those willing to work hard and learn. It is retail so you should expect to work weekends and holidays.
good,"I only worked here due to lack of scheduling. They schedule based on who they need not what the store needs and i hate that."
good,constantly on the move either helping customers or management. their was never a dull moment when you had to have your department always looking perfect for upper management who would either occasionally walk by or monitor you on the security cameras
good,Not a good paying job.  Too much favortism.  No real communication between supervisors and management.   Pay is horrible.  Have to rely on supervisors to train for a level pay increase.
good,It's a great stepping stone to get some experience but I'm now looking for a company that I can grow with and make me a better employee.
good,"Its fine for a job during high school or college, but working full time really shows how often management is changed. Things are overlooked when you are liked by management. Training is very incomplete."
good,a typical day is ringing up rude customers that don't pay attention to anything. i definitely learned how to deal with angry individuals. management is not the best. there are constant schedule and pay issues not to mention the hours suck. my co workers are friendly but everyone cashiering does not have good training and there are hardly courtesy clerks up front. the hardest part of the job is trying to help multiple people at once not that multi-helping is hard.
good,"The customers and employees were very wonderful and easy to work with, but the down side was the amount of hours and pay every week. This job would be great for a young teen in high school, but not for a young adult who needs to pay rent and other bills."
good,"It is difficult to have job security, people get fired when management doesn't like them. Some people are shown favoritism. Some employees get stuck with part time hours while others get full time regardless of who is the harder worker."
good,"Loved meeting/working with the customers, especially during a holiday or homecoming. Hated that they would not work with me on my college schedule."
good,"I love working with the customers and my co workers, but I feel like I have so much responsibility with so little pay. I get over worked and under appreciated."
good,"When I worked there, the management wasn't the greatest. The hours for high school students working there not the greatest because some would have to work until 10:30 pm with school the next day. Management wasn't very cooperative with scheduling if there were other things you had going on- they would schedule you during those times. Over all not a great place to work. Maybe in other departments its fine, I just wouldn't recommend the front end."
good,the wasn't hard it was just a little bit unorganized. Not all managers are bad just one. Sometimes it was all fake to impress and I'm not a fake person so I really don't do well with fake people. I think the company needs some improvement.
good,"This is a great starting job. I felt that Kwik Shop didn't have a great advancement opportunity. I didn't enjoy the drama that came with this job, it made it difficult to work together as a team."
good,excellent for high school kids looking for there first job. nice to have customers come back to shop and always a friendly hello.
good,The work effort in the store is alright but the managment just needs a little bit more help. also the department manager.
good,"A typical day at work consists of running the cash register for extended periods, and occasional maintenance. You learn a lot about how a high foot-traffic business operates; how to keep customers happy by supplying their needs, and how to meet a customer's concerns with an appropriate response."
good,"A typical day at work wasn't as bad as se people made it out to be. I would clock into work and sign into a register and put on a smile and welcome customers into my lane with a warm welcome of ""how are you today"". One of the hardest parts about the job was dealing with supervisors who think they are the managers and will take their power over the cashiers and baggers to a new level and belittle us. Also the few customers that just want to give you a hard time and scream and yell and curse at you and all you can do is smile or walk away. the one i worked at wasn't the best store because of the management and the staff they had hired, young lazy people or people who just want to run their mouths and those people are mainly the people they put in charge."
good,"Made me very experienced in social contact & made me not shy anymore, was able to meet new friends and learn new techniques"
good,"I liked my co workers however the management and my supervisor were not so great. The management dragged their feet in response to requests and overall communication was bad. I did learn how to use a cash register and such, so the learning experience was good."
good,You have a good opportunity to build professional relationships with regular customers.  The hardest part of the job was having to do side work and wait on customers at the same time.  The store was always busy.  I enjoyed working with my co-workers.  Nice managers.
good,"Overall, this company is ""OK"". I believe that more autonomy could make even better. Kroger is a good stepping stone though."
good,"descent work environment,management was good ,not good pay a typical day a work would be stocking items ,answering customer questions,cleaning items"
good,"I love my customers, they are the only reason why we are there. My coworkers are very friendly and we all work together efficiently. My managers and supervisors help keep an up-beat attitude in the work area and respond quickly to help when it is needed. The hardest part of my job is keeping up when it gets busy and we are down on baggers and/or cashiers.  The most enjoyable part of my job is making my customers happy and watching them leave the store with a smile on their face. You can really tell who has been working there for a while, and who has been there under a year. The newer workers are positive and have a lot of energy while the older workers are tired and never stray from their normal routine. I've seen a lot of people get hired and then quit after a few months or even a few weeks. Some have been there for over a year but have just gotten tired of the same old stuff and just quit out of no where. I have not lost my enthusiasm yet and do not plan on it."
good,"I clock in at 11pm. for a while I might be petty steady but after about 1am every night it starts to get a little slow I have to clean registers which consists of wiping all registers down changing trash collecting coupons off of the registers and making sure all go-backs and unwanted merchandise is off of the registers. I start that about 2. while also making sure to watch the entire front end as I am he only person in the front of the store on 3rd. after that I put out boxes of grocery bags and any other supplies needed. register tape reusable bags pens. sticker labels. cleaning supplies, etc. then at 5 the accounting clerk comes in and I start getting steady again. then at 6:30 am I count my till down and wait for my relief at 7. I enjoy my work and my co workers and my customers but I just don't think that the promotions in our store are fair I have been a u scan cashier for almost 2 years and have seen no change in my status in the company"
good,Their is a contant change of management. Workers come and go all the time. I got to meet a lot of nice people over my 3 years working their.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers. They always taught me someting new or gave me words or wisdom. Whenever I would seem to work there was always short staff and everyone had to work twice as hard to pick up the slack. There was no advancement for me despite the fact that I was there for almost a year and recieved awards for my performance, I was not able to learn about new areas of the store and gain new skills. My co-workers were all very friendly and down to earth people. Everyone got along and we made a really good team."
good,"working 13 years for Fred Meyers I find that certain Store Directors arent always the best. My favorite store directors were around when Mr Meyers still had ownership. Its a shame they went up for sale. Other than that I got a long with all co-workers it was important to me that we had fun while working. I loved doing the in store PA's all day, they could always tell by sales whether I worked that day or not. Its simple connect with your customers/co-workers."
good,"Typical day includes mangaging the entire buisness operation including 150+ employees and eight different employees including deli/bakery, produce, meat/seafood, drug/gm, grocery, fuel and pharmacy."
good,"- Have to work hard "
good,"A typical work day includes interaction with hundreds of customers everyday and one on one interaction with managers. Working at Kroger, I've learned to branch out and increase my communication skills. Management is not very good, at least not at my store. Store tasks will sometimes be delayed or not completed. The co-workers are very nice and have good communication skills. The hardest part of the job is dealing with management not keeping up and going behind other employees and cleaning up after them. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people."
good,"- Developed client relationships and earned reputation for exceeding sales goals"
good,"The job was fine, nothing special. However the management and front floor leaders were not nice at all, other than that great place for a first job."
good,It was a nice environment. The managers and other staff members were really friendly. I learned many things at Kroger. Especially in the floral department it was a really good experience working there. The hardest part was trying to multitask with different customers answering their questions helping them find items and answering phone calls.
good,"The job was relatively easy.. I just didnt like working 3rd shift, I felt like it consumed my whole social life. My Co-workers were pretty cool, I liked all of them."
good,All jobs are part time unless you have been working there for like 15 years (not joking). A lot of the baggers tend to walk off so you are stuck bagging and ringing groceries while being timed. The pay is not that great and you have to wait almost a whole year before you can get any benefits. You also have to keep asking for your break or you  just might not get one until 10 minutes before your shift is over.
good,Offering excellent customer service and making sure customers needs are met. The hardest part is being unpaid and under staffed.
good,krogers is okay but alot of unhappy employees full of attitude. the enviorment isnt great nor is the management outstanding but its a job and i stay positive about it.
good,Front end staff are generally nice. Management has changed since my working their. Taught me alot about customer service and working with others.
good,"Work at Roundys was hard with long hours, but you were rewarded with above average compensation. The hardest part of the job was meeting customers demands."
good,It is perfect for someone who is in high school and has little to no bills to pay. It is very easy and your co-workers are typically good.
good,It was a good place to work. could've paid more. but it was overall ok.  I didn't like the fact that i couldn't transfer to columbus and so i had to quit.
good,Kroger was alright for a minimum wage job. There were disrespectful people in my department although there were some friendly employees in other departments. I learned how to deal with the diversity of people due to the mass amount of customers they get on a daily basis. The Kroger I worked at was the busiest Kroger in Michigan so it got pretty hectic at times. I would say dealing with the biggest rush of customers was the hardest part but my all-time favorite parts were all the times we would have food in the break-room or upstairs by the management office on special occasions. Kroger was an alright job and I would chose not to work there again.
good,Great place to go if you are young and in school or even if your just need some extra income! Although I would not recommend for an extended amount of time! Pay is only $7.25 an hour and only raise is every 6 months by $0.10 and isn't even guaranteed on time!
good,"you work a sun-sat shift, i learned how to run a u-scan and that was cool, some of the managerment or ok and pretty cool, i like all my co-worker"
good,I have learned a lot working for pick n save it has helped me with management tools needed for my future.  The knowledge I have gained will provide me with more skills in my future employment.
good,"The management was very uptight and the hours are not the best. They are very big on customer service which is a good thing, but not at the expense of the worker."
good,"Easy going, learned many skills bagging, cashier, and guest care. Management is nice and understanding, as well as the co-workers. The hardest part is standing for long periods of time."
good,"Poor management"
good,This was suppose to be a summer job. Ended up doing quiet well and advanced into management. I learned to work with many different people in a very competitive environment. Hardest part was leaving the job behind. Enjoyable was the experience.
good,I have worked at four other Kroger store with this one being the fifth. The company is good but I wish they cared more about their employees. There is not too much communication. I definately think they could do better.
good,"-fast-paced work environment"
good,"Alright company, worked there for 4 years and I was promoted once but they only offered me 15 hours a week so I went back to bagging where I was getting 40 hours a week"
good,"Its an alright place to work, some favoritism. Hardest part was getting carts when its SUPER cold!"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of assignments to different ""stations"" around the pharmacy which rotate every 2 hours. It was great being able to switch up tasks from customer service, data entry, and the filling station.  "
good,"learned alot from kroger and made lots of friends, employee wise and customer wise. managers are alittle shady though. they love to play favorites, say horrid comments about other employees, complain,and be completely unfair.dont matter how well you work or how many customer compliments you receive they always focus on the little things they can find that you are not doing right.however the general managers are always amazing and kind and extremely hardworking."
good,great place to work at customer was great and co workers.. the store manager was an awesome person would help with out you asking for help.. i like talking to the customer and hearing how they day went..
good,"Had a good run there. Made some friends. Co-workers definitely made the experience there. The job itself wasn't too bad. It could get hectic, but sometimes that was good. Bakery could get lonely if you worked nights. You were always by yourself then."
good,"Provide a high level of customer service and practice safe food handling procedures; prepare food, offer samples, and recommend products to customers; properly weigh, bag, price and cook deli and cafe merchandise, including specialty coffees for sale to customers; operate scales, slicers, wrapping and cooking equipment, including specialty coffee machines; maintain a clean and sanitized work area including the maintenance of tables, walls, floors, display cases, walk-in coolers/freezers, fryers and other cooking equipment."
good,My day starts of by getting my talk man programming my information into the talk man. Picking the required amount items requested by the stores order. I learned how to operate an stand up pallet jack and work under cold temps. My co-workers were hard to works with but nothing to hard to handle. The hardest part was working in the extreme cold but learning a new skill was enjoyable
good,"I had wonderful coworkers who were very welcoming and friendly and a joy to work with and made my job much more enjoyable. However the head of management often didn't schedule enough cashiers and my department was already understaffed yet we were the first department to be called up to help out the front end during a rush, causing my department to always be behind with no sympathy from management. So the hardest part of the job was trying to help keep the department from falling behind while also cooperating with management when they needed my coworkers and myself to assist the front end. If we had had even just one or two more people in my department I believe this would have made working there much less stressful. But I don't regret working here, it was a good experience showing me what retail workers go through, and taught me how handle stressful overly demanding positions. Especially because during my last couple weeks there my department was able to catch up and reorganize our back area with the help of a couple other employees despite also losing another member of our department."
good,"It is long hours and holidays.  If you don't have a family and don't care about work life balance its great.  You are store management all of the hourly employees are in the union.  You have to be able to build good relationships and know how to get results through people.  You are managing 150 to 200 people.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the relationships you build with customers, employees and communities."
good,"Clock in and work til your legs drop. It gave you enough work to make the day go by quick but it's dull and as a creative person, it sucks the life out of me."
good,I personally enjoy the store and its people. A typical work day is long but time flies by fast with the help of my coworkers and customers. I have learned that the customer is always right and make sure to satisfy the customer so that they are leaving with a smile.
good,I've been with Kroger for almost nine years I'm going to said is a good place to work but if your decided to get into management you'll get the experience that you need.
good,At my store is hard to go into different areas and to learn to work in different departments
good,I learned much about myself as well as the business.  Great customer service skills acquired here and management skills.
good,"Give up your nights, and weekends, fight for hours, 17 years with advancing all the way to the top hourly position, not worth it in the long run"
good,"I was sexually harassed here, filed a complaint, and instead of the harasser being reprimanded, I was targeted and then fired. I had to grieve the write-up and essentially proved it was a wrongful termination. Still, the harasser, did not get even a warning."
good,"It's a good company to work for, but extremely difficult to move up unless you're Superman. Because of the union it's hard to get rid of people who don't pull their weight unless they do something really stupid, so when you're in charge of a department and one of the employees doesn't work as hard as they need to for things to go right, then it makes things harder on the rest of the department, which in turn makes it increasingly difficult to get an advancement because it makes it look like you're not doing your job."
good,Very high expectations with very little labor hours given.  Expectations would keep growing but the help would stay the same.  Management would degrade and belittle employees.  The wages are high and benefits are pretty good.  Can be a fun place to work on certain days but overall company morale is low.  The company has a lot to work on as far as work/life balance and employee recongition.
good,"pros= co workers"
good,management and coworkers are all good. pay is not good and work life balance is not always great.
good,The managemant is not fair and does not see the co-worker point of view.
good,"cleaning, rotating products on shelves."
good,"This was my first job. I worked here for 4 years and even though there were some tough days, the management worked with my school schedule really well."
good,A typical day at work would be for me to come into work and assist customers with great care and superior customer service. I learn different things from different customers everyday about everyday life. Things are always changing in the customer service desk so I'm always learning something new. There are a few co-workers who are awesome to work with and some who are not so awesome. The hardest part of my job is trying to maintain great customer service when there is no help and customers are lining up and giving you attitude. The most enjoyable part of my job is making someone's day by just talking to them and making them feel good. Another enjoyable part of job is my awesome co-workers whom have become great friends and become like family.
good,"I enjoyed the people and co workers there but management treats you so bad as if they are too busy for the employees and the customers. I don't feel like employees should handle angry and upset customers, I feel like managers should take care of the customers that are upset."
good,"This was a busy call center position.  Fun place to work, kind people flexible hours. Nice place to work if you live in the area."
good,"-A typical day at work would consist of providing customer service to their full satisfaction, welcoming customers as I work in the parking lot, and working at various departments of the store."
good,"Its pretty much what you would guess. You check groceries for 8 hours a day. You don't get to sit down. Everything surrounds around ""numbers"": how fast you are, how many people you persuade to donate money and etc. Rather than it being based on what's best for that specific customer.  It's practically a big box company. Its a great first job. It works well if your a busy student. The pay is comical ( minimum wage), and raises are 10 cents."
good,Lots of days I didn't want to go to work simply because management talked to their employees like they were children.
good,Starting my shift I'm assisting customers with slicing the Deli meats and cheeses they want. During down time I clean until my day ends at work.
good,"Great co-worker/customer and clean environment, lack of security and greedy management."
good,"Greeted customers entering establishments."
good,"Attitude is everything. I was a meat cutter, and the management did not hire enough crew to get the job done they way they wanted it done. High, high turnover! The longer you stay the more trapped you can feel to get out. Do more with less...."
good,On a daily basis I would arrive and start work on bagging or cashiering. Depending on managements opinion of employee determined the work environment
good,This was a decent job. The pay was ok. I enjoyed most of my co-workers
good,"My typical workday is pretty crazy busy. I have learned pretty much everything there is to know about actually running the pharmacy, from the line to all the dispensing stations, as well as the reports and PC applications used on a daily basis. I recently trained the new night shift supervisors and the management unfortunately likes to play favorites with who should get promoted in our facility. The hardest part of my job is knowing that I put all my heart and soul into my job and my compensation doesn't match that.I love my job, my co-workers and the fact that we can listen to our headphones."
good,"On a regular day, I would bag groceries, fetch carts, clean restrooms, and do anything to help keep the store running. It was a good job to start with, but the pay was insufficient for long term."
good,This is not the right job for people who are ages 43+ years and up. There is no growth in this company and the communcation level is below average. This job is for people who are just entering the workforce who does not have experience.
good,"It is not the most terrible place to work. It is fairly straightforward, though stressful at times. I personally was moved around every shift at least once per week as well as doing truck, and although I pushed for it, there was little consideration for this. I gave my two weeks around the time I started to feel lucky if I got 4 hours of sleep in a night, since I didn't actually have a sleeping schedule. My recommendation, don't have free availability, set yourself in a single shift and there will not be any issue. Definatly a job for a people person."
good,"I enjoyed working for Kroger, the benefits weren't good but the atmosphere was fun"
good,"This was an easy place to get a job, if you are first starting out with little to know work experience. If you are looking for a career, I would look else where."
good,"Roundys is a good company to work for; however, there is a lot of drama that takes place out in the store. Thankfully I don't really deal with the drama in the pharmacy."
good,"This is a pretty stressful job, but the coworkers are great and the full-time benefits are good."
good,"I have worked at the Kroger store near my house since I entered college in 2008. I needed a job to have extra money for school. I started off working in the deli department but due to poor training the manager wanted me out and as a bagger within roughly one month into the job. I worked as a bagger and did other jobs such as a cashier and helping night stock throughout this time. I also tried to get moved into other postions, such as produce and dairy, but was moved out due to low hours and lack of training once again. Eventually I did get moved into the gas station which recently opened up and became the assistant lead over there. Store management ranged between being friendly and helpful to being aggravating and unpleasant. Co-workers were enjoyable for the most part. Some were great, others were awful. Nothing was really hard at this job just time consuming busy work, such as manual inventory counts and cleaning."
good,I mainly was a clerk at this pharmacy.  I waited on the drive-thru window and inside.  I didn't get much training on the computer and insurances.  Also it was minimum wages.
good,I enjoyed working for this company until management was changed and they chose to pick favorites and be condescending and impolite to others.
good,"Good health benefits, but depending what Kroger you work at, and what management your under, life can be good or horribly stressful. "
good,Really Easy Job Just Managers Usually Give You A Hard Time About Each And Everything
good,Creating beautiful floral arrangements for happy customers was very rewarding. Enjoyed watering and caring for potted plants.
good,"A fast and stady day, always something to do. learned how to use a FDA food safty. Co-workers are like family and fun to be around. The hardest part of the job is when the holidays come around. love the management."
good,"Clock in (Kronos)"
good,I interacted with customers all day. I learned how to provide great customer service. Management was not the best. co-workers were fun to work with but would get off task at times.
good,there are too many kids not knowing what they are doing and they get all of the easy work. the management was unprofessional and could not get a good day.
good,Kroger taught me that endurance and courtesy mean a great deal while working with the public.  Most people are reasonable interaction-wise and some are wonderfully pleasant.  The challenging customers really test a persons faith in God (smile).
good,"Currently and Administrative Assistant and assist with taking care of associates."
good,in this job you do a lot of maintaining clean. one hour sweeping and picking up perishables. Another hour pushing 500 carts for customers to get there groceries. and another taking calls running aisles. I don't mined the hard labor. in the mornings I would help out with perishables and help out clean the floor ripping card bored and lifting 50 pound pallets and stacking tem 6 ft. high. I also get to help out customers with there groceries. An average  day consists of triple  tasking all day. Especialy when some one dose n ot come in for there shift.
good,"I worked on the night shift (11pm - 7am), so I didn't experience much customer interaction.  It had some fun moments, but there were very few of them."
good,The place maybe a little hard at first with the scared of being fired for anything drilled in your head. but   as long as you stay productive its a good job to half part time wise.
good,"Love my coworkers,like the customers,like the weekly pay.Management plays favorites.Not good hours.Gives us breaks and lunches."
good,"I come walk and, talk with each Department to see how the morning is going and see if all associates are here or any call in. I go to the office read my mail check for conf. calls schedule. I go back downs stairs and walk the sales floor and see what  is conditions of the store . Get with Grocery Manager and we will walk each aisle and, look what was miss and fix it. after I have walk the store I go over the list of problems I have found and  get with that department on what was found. I go back in follow up. Front end is short of help so i' am checking. Expectation set the bar high & follow up and, tell your associates how you appreciate them. The hardest part is when you have a Co- Manager or a Store Manager that is not pulling there weight. Is when a associate tells you thank you for taking out the time to help me."
good,love coming to work to a clean respectable place of employment
good,"Feels like a job and not a career, you're not going to advance or become full-time unless you want are willing to stay part-time for 5+ years"
good,"I learned a lot of things, Accounting, Scheduling, working with the public in a very demanding job, multi-tasking. "
good,"Typically in the Home Department, you approach whatever manager is there at that time to find out what tasks they appropriated to you. You go to do those tasks and answer any customers calls or questions while you do."
good,"Kroger management did not care about their employees as much as I thought. If a cashier was not feeling well, the front-end manager wouldn't care."
good,"I would go in to work finish cleaning up and doing what the closer did not so I would have space to do my job, move product from refriderator to the proofer, pull the morning bread bake from freezer then put away any freight on freight day, bake off and top doughnuts for the day, then dao daily baking, prep doughs for next day, clean up.  We I worked other shifts I would stock product, assist customers, package products, clean as needed.  I learned how to adapt and work with many different personality types.  There really was no hard part of the job.  I would have to say the most enjoyable was working with my manager as we are similar non nonsense, get it done right  type of personalities.  We worked really well and efficiently together."
good,"The company on a whole is a good place to work.  The department I was in, use to give training, in different areas of the job.  But as time went on these were drop.  In the department I was in you needed training.  I believe there is still 2 course that you should take."
good,"I counted drugs and data input and did a lot of customer service. I learned a lot about insurance companies. Once the management got it's self under control it was great. I liked my co-workers and still often visit them and some outside of work as friends. The hardest part of the job was dealing with insurance companies. I loved the customers and miss many of them. I loved my co-workers, great group of people."
good,"sack and put away groceries. helped customers to car."
good,I loved the management here but the people who were put into supervisor positions were not ready for it and had no structure on a daily basis
good,Every job has their days but this had a lot of those days sometimes.
good,"I was called in when I had other things I needed to do (the manager knew that), I was told I was going to get a management position in my department, and they gave it to the guy that always came in drunk or hungover."
good,The shifts go by really slow.... You have to work with a team and your not do with your work unless everyone complete there task at hand.I learned people are at their own pace and you cant make move any faster no matter what..... Having to help the same person get done everyday with the simplest task over and over again..... The freedom 
good,"Working here might be good for a student living at home with no expenses, but for an independent individual trying to make their way in the world, Kroger is definitely not the ideal place to work. The hours are inconsistent to say the least. Some weeks I'll have 38-40, most I have 28-35. It generally takes at least 3 years to achieve full-time status if you aren't in management (something most companies offer right at the start), so up until then you have to essentially beg for more hours. Not only that, but when you do work, you're working in multiple other departments simultaneously because Kroger doesn't like spending the money to schedule adequate staffing. Working in produce doesn't really mean produce, it means produce plus dairy, nutrition, grocery, getting carts off of the lot, and bagging on the front end whenever they need it; and they still expect your work to be done after yanking you all over the store for your whole shift. I have literally had days where I've done nothing in my own scheduled department because I was too busy doing other peoples' jobs instead of my own at the management's request. Granted, the insurance is pretty good, but you need to work there for 9 months as part-time to even qualify. And they don't tell you when you qualify, so if you miss the deadline, you have to wait until the annual application period in October to get insured. Overall, I would only recommend working at Kroger as a last resort. They will hire just about anyone. And that isn't always a good thing either."
good,"The people are the reason you stay because you see them more than you see your own families.  Job security is guaranteed unless you are an absolute idiot - and sometimes even then. There are many people here whom have only ever known Kroger as their employer - and in this day and age there is something to be said for that.  However, the hours are long, the schedule provides absolutely no work/life balance, you are not supported as a supervisor and often times the union inmates run the asylum.  Pay is NOWHERE NEAR comparable to similar positions in other companies.  Your contributions do not matter as no one is held accountable to either perform or not perform.  Top and bottom acheivers are treated exactly the same.  Motivation is lacking and there doesn't seem to be any real concern as to why the supervisors get frustrated and leave.  Development is non-existent, and unless you ""know someone"" from ""back in the day,"" your odds of moving up are slim to none.  Leadership is lacking in diversity as well - so if you are anything other than a white male - good luck."
good," A typical day at work was to open you department and set up for the day. If you were not a cashier you had to prep and prepare your service department. "
good,"A typical day at Kroger consisted of, waiting on customers, counting and typing prescriptions, putting out shipment, and counting prescriptions "
good,"Great place to work, management was unfair at times. Hours were good and pay was reasonable. Customers were nice and friendly."
good,I was always bored they said it was a hard job but it wasn't. Once  I caught on i just would be having problems thinking of what i wanted or needed to do because i was always ahead.   It was easy money but i just didnt like it. I like to work and keep working.  If im getting paid to be there i feel i need to have stuff to do.  
good,The managment aren't understanding at all but the service is okay.
good,"paid weekly, met my husband there and many other friends, paid vacation and sick days. hard to get full time. "
good,"I enjoyed working for this company. Not as bad as most people let on to be. Only bad thing was my immediate management. Very rude not even friendly to customers. My co-workers, fantastic they truly make working there enjoyable. Hardest part of the job was balancing trying to get everything done with always having to pause to help customers. "
good,"A typical day at work includes creating arrangements for purchase as well create-to-order arrangements which are orders where a customer requires a certain look. The most enjoyable part of my job is the creativity and development aspect. I am constantly learning new techniques and the more modern ways of designing. I am in charge of the floral shop when the department manager is out on vacation or personal time off meaning I supervise, schedule and order product. All the associates treat each other as family and as a whole we are a very warm and inviting group. The hardest part of the job is the management. An effective work team requires feedback that consists of both positive and negative remarks and unfortunately the most in my job are negative. The morale of the store is way low but due to the closeness of the associates we try to make the best of everyday."
good,You have be good shape to work this job. It will be hard if you don't know what to do.
good,Not much opportunity to grow but great benefits with the union.
good,This job was a okay job until everyone realized I worked then they put all their work on me
good,ringing up groceries daily and making sure the customers sure happy
good,"I was second in charge of a 75,000 square foot grocery supermarket that averaged $25 million a year in sales. My job was to make sure other departments were properly staffed and stocked, store conditions were up to standard and employees took care of our customers. I daily dealt with profit and loss statements/budgets, checked bookwork daily and made sure every department head had the necessary tools/employes to effectively and efficiently maintain their departments. I trained employees on how to write orders, maintain proper levels of stock/inventory and on all store procedures/policies. I was active in the Human Resources role especially in hiring and issuing proper disciplinary actions when needed. I enjoyed my job especially interacting with customers and being able to grow and manage a store that achieved significant sales growth in my time there. Also being a strong community leader was an aspect i enjoyed. My co-workers were hard-working people varying in backgrounds and cultures that were instrumental in helping me do my job. They deserve better pay and benefits for the job they do. The hardest thing about my job was the constant labor cuts our parent company would make. ti was getting very difficult to be able to do the basic functions at store level while trying to maintain an unreasonable labor budget despite the 10% growth rate. I enjoyed the most the different hats i would be required to wear each day. I was trained to do every job and each day brought different duties and responsibilities."
good,"Generally as the cake decorator I filled my orders first then went on to fill the case and whatever else needed done in my area. and if i finished up all of my work would help out in other parts of the bakery.I would fill the sales floor, do mark downs,rotate stock,and put supplies away. Working in the bakery there was always things to do.Everyone worked together as a team so we could keep the bakery humming.Keeping up with everything was sometimes very hard,during graduation was the hardest time for me there were always to many cake orders. I enjoyed staying busy and helping out were I was needed.Management didn't really bother with the bakery very much, the manager of the store didn't like bothering us to much because there was always so much going on he did help out with displays when there were big sales."
good,"i love the company i work for but needs a good support system, great benefits, easy to move up into what you want with the company"
good,Working at Kroger for the most part was an enjoyable experience. I was able to grasp new concepts and learn new things everyday with my time spent working for the company. People I worked with were friendly and respectable. This job taught me how to work in a social environment and be as efficient as one could possibly be.
good,Its alright for a starting out job. Theres no room to move up in the company unless youve been there a long time.
good,Best part of my job was customer service and seeing return customers!
good,"Very hard work for little pay, had time limits to get work done. co-workers where friendly and we all had fun"
good,"Customer Service with a smile! I learned to apply and teach social skills while passing out samples to customers. I found upper Management direct and insightful, co-workers very compliant and detailed orientated. The hardest part of the job was accomplishing the work of two employee's in an eight hour day. The most enjoyable part of the job is the wonderful smell of the Bakery!"
good,Was good at first. Then management tricked me into a position I couldn't be promoted out of in the future for good merit.
good,I typical day was interessting in meeting new people. It would have been a better work experience if I wouldn't have got into trouble for someone elses doing
good,Well run grocery store chain that does give more respect to employees than some other similar sores.
good,"Normal Retail store, had fun working, didn't make enough."
good,"Good company to work while attending university. Work/Life balance is deplorable as it is mandated that employees be available to work nights, weekends, and holidays. Hard workers who are reliable are rewarded with less desirable shifts whereas the workers who are less reliable are scheduled the ones that are highly coveted so as to alleviate turnover."
good,"A typical day would be bagging people groceries, cart retrieval, and maintenance of the store. All of my co-workers were fun and easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job would be pushing all of the carts through the snow in the winter time, but other than that noting was really too hard."
good,"I bagged groceries and helped customers to their vehicles when needed, cleaned and retrieved shopping carts from the lot. Management was poor. Hardest part was retrieving shopping carts manually."
good,"loved them smells of fresh fruit and veggies. its an ok place to work union, but it takes a long time to make a good wage"
good,This job was great except the pay was very little compared to how exuasting and hard the job actually is.
good,"At first I loved my job. But then the customers started getting rude which made want to move to produce. Then when I got back to the produce, there was never any work to be done."
good,Not the best employement experience. But I am thankful to have experienced it.
good,"Not much opportunity for advancement, management worked you like a dog, management kept changing, they expect too much work for little pay when there are other jobs that offer better pay and less stressful work (so yes I did look and moved on). The benefits were great as far as health insurance, they were flexible with school, not much opportunity to take days off for holidays as seniority plays a big role, work force is unionized,"
good,Working the hand held and talking to different drivers and workers also athorizing checks and making recipets .
good,"A typical day at work, since i am the bakery closer, i would have to bake and slice bread, package, label, and stock items, decorate cakes, make garlic bread, and clean bakery."
good,"Ralphs is the so. cal division of the largest grocery chain in the world Kroger corp, if you started working for Ralphs before they were bought by this out of state giant your're paid at a higher pay rate than newer heirs. fortunate for me I saw one of the persons on the higher scale ,and i was in management ,so i was not subject to the effects of the payroll constraints that effected the hours of regular employees. That being said the last ten years there was a sea change in the corporation viewed Ralphs . Ralphs turned from the culture of our employees are our biggest asset to being the tent pole division of a larger entity that wanted California profit margins at mid west operational cost"
good,I had much problems with my training and being able to get help from upper management.
good,"My employment with Roundy's provided a very well-rounded experience. This includes areas of marketing campaigns (planning, promoting, maintaining, and analysis), financial analysis, customer relations, time management, and workflow management, andhigh dollar amount product purchasing to name a few."
good,a typical day at work -
good,customers made time past quickly but breaks were not consistant.
good,Its a very relaxed environment that allows you to work at your pace so you can focus on what needs to be done first. The people I work with are really cool. They don't stack to much work on me at once and overload me. They spread it out so everyone has to take some part in everything that goes on.
good,Its a very relaxed environment that allows you to work at your pace so you can focus on what needs to be done first. The people I work with are really cool. They don't stack to much work on me at once and overload me. They spread it out so everyone has to take some part in every project that comes up.
good,Some of the best co-workers I've had on o the job.
good,"Stocked shelves all night long. Employees were friendly and would help out if you needed it. Stocking consisted of opening product boxes, sorting, and shelving the items."
good,"I would clock in stock and clean the store, take care of customers, clean some more, At Kwik Shop I learned more about customer relations, I learned how to do the books and count the daily deposit, how to be an effective leader/manager, i learned effective hiring tactics how to spot good people to have on a team. I had a good store manager and for the most part decent co-workers. The hardest and most enjoyable part of the job were the customers,"
good,I was a bagger then a cashier. I liked the people i worked with.
good,I stocked the shelves with food in the store I do not remember much about the management it was more of an everyone do your job an go home type of deal.
good,"Typical day at work, was clocking in and receiving a route of 2 to 3 stores on a trailer to deliver. Hours in day can be roughly between 8 to 14 hours a day. The co-workers there act like brothers that have worked together for a long time, The hardest part of the job is the schedule. Its diffecult to have a life outside of work, becuse of the hours and overtime, working nights and weekends. Most enjoyable part of the job would be some of the routes you would get and the holiday bbq's."
good,"A typical day at a Kroger Fuel Center begins with opening the fuel center to take care of customers. We have to clean and keep up maintance on fuel drop tanks and fuel pumps as well as surrounding coolers and displays. We have to sweep, stock, and deal with a lot of money. Managament checks on us every so often and helps when needed. We only have five members in the fuel center but we all work well together and use multitasking and communication skills at all times."
good,"Coming up on a couple of months now--I work hard, got some credit for many years of experience but still does not add up to what other major chains pay in the area. Also very hard to get full-time, nearly impossible and benefits take about 10 months part time. So your paying for other peoples benefits and probably for the nice pensions the union types get."
good,"The work was not too hard, typing and filing paper work, maintaining equipment, dealing with the occasional disgruntled truck driver. The only reason i have to complain about it is the supervisors did not even supervise but were on a break the whole time they were there. I got paid a fair wage but for risking getting fired for making a management decision because no one could get a hold of a supervisor I quit."
good,the management there dosent really care about the employees the pay is awful and so are the hours
good,I cut meat and cheeses. I learned customer service. The management was nice. The hardest part of the job was switching out the blades to cut meat and cheese and prepping.
good,"A typical day was very fast-paced and I would be using/cleaning/filtering fryers, cleaning/using rotisserie, using/cleaning slicers (constantly because I was in the deli and we were always busy but always used excellent sanatation practices), and of course, waiting on customers. The hardest part of the job was the times we were busy (especially weekends) if we were short-handed. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to know my customers often times on a first name basis."
good,"On a daily basis, I experience high traffic nights.What I've learned is that, since I have never been at work at a large warehouse before, the hours may vary according to the daily workload. Everyday, you have to keep up with the pace of everyone and make sure you keep your productivity numbers up every week. Even though you have to work very hard, the benefits are pretty good, as far as health insurance and dental. Most of the employees here gel very well, as if it is a fraternity."
good,"not my ideal job, but it's a paycheck..I DO HOWEVER ENJOY MY COWORKERS VERY MUCH."
good,"Decent place to start working if you're young, but don't stay long."
good,"•a typical day at work: Team work with overseeing the front end (alongside floor supervisors). Occasional utility work (bathroom cleaning, attending to spills, removal of trash). General upkeep of the registers with the responsibility of keeping the area clean. U-Scan (self-chekout) overseeing. Customer service; responsible for customer satisfaction. Occasionally training new hires."
good,"I love working, I am a team worker. I enjoy working as a team, It makes the job a peaceful place. I am a people person, I get along well with my co-workers. I never really have bad days at work, I learned at a young age, what ever goes on outside of work, leave it outside. I wake up, every morning with a positive attitude, every day is a new day for me to learn somthing!!"
good,"My typical day working with Ralphs consisted of bagging groceries, stoking shelves and cigarettes, and greeting costumers. My management had responsibilities that they tended to. My co-workers were very easy to get along with as well as to work with. The hardest part of my job was to welcome guests with sincerity, when clearly they ignored me and were too busy to acknowledge me as well."
good,This is a typical customer service job that will boost your socialization skills. Sometimes there is too much work for too little pay. Ready to find a career and start making serious money.
good,"My day was normally pretty hectic. Towards the end of my stay with this company I was working twenty hour days because I didn't have more than one employee. I learned that I was able to work in a position of authority easily. The hardest part of the job was the employee turnover rate, and the inability to get the other stores to help with hourly coverage by employees."
good,"Stocked shelves,unloaded trucks,and worked cashier when needed."
good,Great for high school kids first time jobs. Teaches responsibility
good,If your in management you work 10 hour days usually night. Working 1-11 or 10-8 is not fun. There is no need for us to work 10 hour days when usually 3 managers overlap by adlest 5 hours. If you want a life....don't be a manager at Kroger.
good,"Convenient stores, especailly Kwik Shop is FOREVER busy. This was my first job EVER, and i enjoyed it. I learned how to count money, fill safe, and paper work, After about a year i was in training for an asst. mangr. My co-workers were lazy and didn't take their job seriously and its SO annoying to do your job and someone else's. Meetings never worked or got through to the people so my manager gave up... The enjoyable part of my job was interacting with my customers and my manager telling me she was impressed how i turned out for being so young."
good,"Always Busy, Good Co-Workers, Nice Break Room, GOOD Customer Service, Fast Easy Shopping."
good,A typical day at work would be me walking into a bunch of product to work. Then when I start to work it i get called upfront to help out. I do the best that I can to get to customers out as fast and happy as possible. When I finally get back to my department I pick up a box and get called again. This goes on all night until I am ready to go home.
good,"Working for the Kroger Company, I was placed in the Starbucks section, working as a barista. While I still firmly believe in ""once a barista, always a barista"", times were kind of rough. I learned that the organization needed a complete overhaul as every department had troubles that weren't being fixed."
good,Very hard with the repetive action of cashering. Asked for transfer and got none.
good,Busy retailer meeting customer needs daily. Fulfilling customer requests!
good,"Eastland Krogers In Nashville, TN changed store managers 3 times in 3 months. The reason I quit was due to a family death and the manager refused to let me have time off."
good,Typical day would include bagging and pushing carts. I learned greater skills in customer interaction. The management lacked skills though and often messed up on scheduling. The workplace culture was fair. The hardest part of the job was pushing carts. The most enjoyable part was interacting with customers.
good,"the pay wasn’t enough for the responsibilities placed on you. the managers up there weren’t really helpful. the work flexibility and location was a good place for me"
good,"The daily work was good. I learned a lot about how to help customers. Management was capable but when one manager has 4 more people managing him it becomes strenuous. The hardest part of the job was covering for other employees absence. The most enjoyable part of the job was my co workers and learning, as well as helping customers."
good,"Not that many benefits when you’re part-time. Sometimes understaffed, and you have to work extra hard doing jobs that aren’t yours. Because of understaffing, it will be harder for management to approve of requested days off."
good,This is a very fast pace and hectical job with a lot of stress. Time does go fast as you are always busy. To me the pay should be higher for what is required of the employees.
good,Had a good experience working there learned a lot and co-workeers were very nice and friendly and the time that I was there I gained some experience in working in retail
good,Kroger is still a work in progress. Needs an external audit done. It needs to change the pay and culture of abusive behavior throughout the company. Focus and spreading joy and love and the company will become better than Publix.
good,"It is incredibly hard to get full time at Kroger. A friend of mine who works there now has worked at Kroger for 10 years and just got full time. Also, moving up in the chain of command to supervisory positions or positions with much more responsibility comes with no pay raise."
good,"It's Kroger's, not really that amazing of a company to work for, more of a good place to get quality food however. The community is pretty bland and not very good communication."
good,"C.C. is the easiest position at Kroger, and the only significant issues I've had are unfriendly management at my location."
good,For anyone who has little or no retail work experience this is a good place to start. They offer long term employment and advancement opportunities. Flexible hours and Flexible scheduling.
good,"I started work at Kroger as soon as I turned 18. The work is pretty difficult for a near-minimum wage position. This is due in part to lots of disputes on the cost of items (the pricing department and prices in the system often don't match), as well as heavy lifting and rampant under-staffing. If you work here, expect to hear a call for assistance over the intercom every 15 minutes that goes unnoticed by the other departments. Ultimately, I left this job because the commute was too long."
good,"Certain people seem to get all the training they need, while others are left to figure it out on their own. The flexibility is very good and the benefits are very good."
good,"It was a nice place to work, but it was stressful, and it was hard to get up and go everyday. Also my manager would have me do things that I wasnt old enough to do at the time."
good,The Kroger family is one of love and respect. I personally believe that with the proper management it can reach new heights. The company has to improve in various aspects such as pay rate and hours given to employees.
good,"At my store they claim to encourage in-store promotion, but that's rarely the case. I don't feel like I have any hope for career advancement with this company."
good,"I loved working at Kroger , but management kept changing after the first year and there was no security . There were many managers that I liked and appreciated just as well as they did me ."
good,"Don't get paid nearly enough for the amount of stress you have to deal with and the management is extremely petty, better off working in any of the other multiple grocery stores."
good,Managers unfairly judge employees very little training no respect for those who care about work ethics Profanity in the workplace heard daily.........
good,"I feel this company doesn't care about there employees, and there pay is not far to the employees that have been there for years but the new staff start out making the same or more as older employees."
good,"When I was at Kroger I was a very hard worker, more so than others, but i felt that it was sometimes taken advantage of. Everyone was ok to work with but honestly it had its downfalls."
good,Previous company before Kroger was great. Did not seem like they could establish a good platform and consistency . Took away snack and soda machines. Micromanaged . Shortened breaks from 15 to 10 min..
good,"I woro outside with carts for most of the day while everyonce and awhile having to go inside and handle other tasks. It gets busy, and overwhelming sometimes but while keeping a strong mindset and remainimg calm everything gets sorted out."
good,"Like every job, Kroger has its faults but one positive thing I can say is that there is plenty opportunities for advancement in the company, but it doesn't always come with more compensation."
good,I was always able to put school first while working at Kroger. The management isn't very easy to get along with but they place great emphasis on customer service which is a high priority. They always gave me at least 16 hours a week.
good,"I worked at the cheese shop which had high expectations and strict rules for working and how food products were supposed to be packaged and labelled.  I originally made $8.45 which was above minimum wage with ""experience pay"" but when I left for school and came back they denied me experience pay and I got paid less.  I didn't have to work under pressure though and I was proficient at my job so it actually was not too stressful."
good,"Good place to start out and very flexible with my hours. You learn how to deal with good/bad customers, work efficiently and communicate with your fellow employees to make the experience more enjoyable for everyone."
good,Good for high school kids looking for extra money. Tried to make a carreer as a butcher. Didnt pan out. Things happen and i had other opportunities come afloat.
good,"A typical 10+ hour day for management starts as soon as you pull into the parking lot of the Kroger building to the time you leave it. Upon arriving into the parking lot, you're immediately observing and making notes on any opportunities to relay to your department managers to start working towards fixing. Management spends most of the time on the sales floor engaging with associates and customers to improve friendliness and sales volume. Depending on the management staff, you can have a good or poor workplace culture. One of the biggest reasons for having a great workplace culture is due to management ensuring associates are able to have a great work/life balance. Work/life balance isn't good for management. Whether you're understaffed or not, hardest part of the job is executing to upper management standards no matter what. I learned that, in spite of the company's cultural mishaps, the skills they give you will improve your professional skills for another organization. The most enjoyable part about the job is creating the personal and working relationships with the people that increase revenue for the stores."
good,"management didnt seem to care about my well being and didnt take care of me. I was so overwhelmed, i had panic attacks at work and had to quit. They had me doing management tasks without the title or pay."
good,Upper management cut department hours and expect more work to get done. A lot of good employees left because of the management and they get left with the slackers. They get to pay them less money so I guess it's acceptable.
good,Great opportunity but bad communication wen it comes to hours and bosses they need more meetings for each shift and provide more understanding to krogers brand
good,Working at Kroger is a good way to build up your work experience if you're right out of high school. It has many good opportunities and some benefits like employee discounts.
good,"I was in the bakery which is a constant hurry to get eveything done."
good,It's a good job to have if you've never had a job before. Things may have changed but when I was there I was young and in school and at the time the management didn't seem to care about my school responsibilities.
good,"Fun place to work,  Co workers help each other out a lot. Management is easy to work for and very understanding. Good location, On a bus line easy to get too."
good,its a grocery job what do you expect. this is something you should get if you are in high school and college. dont look to make a career in the retail business unless you want to be miserable. unless you like being miserable.
good,A decent first job. I would like to be making more but that also comes with the company and the position I have.  They are flexible with my school hours but are typically understaffed.
good,Great team work and Great management. Would highly recommend. Very understanding and helpful. Did store competitions for employees to win gift cards etc.
good,"the pay was fine for a retail place, but still not a great job. not a lot of overtime. no set schedule, and have to work weekends. but kind of laid back."
good,My experience at Kroger was Great in the beginning because we got benefits and the environment was positive and loving. Over time the work ethic deteriorated and I had to carry the load of the other slacker as well as losing benefits to new management. We used to get free water as it was hot and we were in the heat for 45 minutes to an hour at a time and  new management took that away  causingpeople to feel heat exhaustion
good,The pharmacy wants you to do so much but with little pay. The only raise you get is only a few cents. It wouldn’t be a bad job if you got paid a reasonable amount. Very friendly staff.
good,It was nice getting paid every week but manigment is very unprofessional and bias make it hard to work for this company would not recommend anyone I know working at this unless it's temporary
good,"Out of the clear blue the co. decided to trim cost by eliminating 100's of Mid level Management positions. Unfortunately I was part of this group. Wrong place, wrong time."
good,"Very busy throughout the day, maintaining a very profitable department. Always engaging with customers, order writing, maintaining shrink numbers, along with maintaining a weekly budget."
good,"this was my first job when i turned 17 so i was excited that a place actually hired me with no experience. i liked it for a while then it just got really repetitive for me personally. you just scan groceries and give it to the bagger. i'd say the hardest part was coupons because customers hated when you did anything wrong with their coupons and they would just get frustrated with you. most enjoyable part is of course coworkers. i made a lot of friends there since we were mostly all around the same age, teenagers with a summer job."
good,"As a Dept Manager, you rarely get positive feedback. Management has no problem telling you to work 6-7 days, but without overtime. Never get offered help from any member of management"
good,"The job itself is challenging but awesome."
good,Great job for beginners trying to just get into the work force. The process of getting hired on is kind of a pain. It took me many time of applying to finally get hired.
good,"At the end of the day, it's a grocery store that's payscale starts at minimum wage, and that only schedules part-time for most workers. The job will involve dealing with the public, as well as cleaning and stock management. I don't have enough experience in the field to know where Kroger stands compared to other grocery stores, but it seems fine enough as a first-time job."
good,It was ok  the management was good at the beginning but towards the end was horrible. It was a toxic work environment because of the employees. Corporate not caring about employees or changes
good,The benefits are good the adaptability of schedule is fine. Though when it comes to the work it isnt worth it. The pay doesn't work out for how one can live. At the store I was working we are 700 hours understaffed and no fixes came. Working alone became a usual thing
good,First job and it was fine but pay was not good. Raise would only be like 10 cent. Changed management every couple months and it seem to go down hill from there.
good,I felt annoyed because I always had to do everything in the store. The management was terrible since I was starting to play sports again they tend to always losing my paper practice schedule for my soccer season. They forced us to join the union.
good,"Management does not treat workers well, the associates are all very friendly, and we work incredibly hard every day as most days we are understaffed. Most customers are nice and easy to help, and most days are pretty easy if we can catch up with ourselves."
good,"Typical work day is walking through produce section looking for anything out of place, or bad fruit and vegetables. "
good,"Typical day would start at 6:30 in the morning and last until 6 or 7 in the evening."
good,"A typical day of work consisted of me coming in at 7 receiving and sorting the trucks followed buy stocking building and replenishing displays and ordering. I learned proper stocking skills, customer service skills and management skills. Management constantly changed some where great some where not so great. The work culture was great at some times then again not so great mainly depending on the management staff we where assigned. Best part bout my employment. Had to be interacting with everyone"
good,"While working at Kroger I had two different experiences. My first six months were amazing! The managers and my boss were the best. Once I got promoted to team leader, I had a new boss and our managers were being plucked and placed in other stores. No one was accountable for their actions and the moral plummeted. It made it very hard to come into work every day. I had no freedom, and a boss who did the bare minimum."
good,To many unnecessary rules and regulations. Just to put food out for people to buy. Treats their strongest workers unfairly in the end they end up leaving due to poor managment.
good,The only problem I had with Kroger is the management changed like every 2-4 months and I was away at college and when I’d come back they would all be different from what the previous managers said about rules and everything and my hours were cut every time there was a new manager
good,"Kroger could do more to help its employees. Mid management are stretched thin and over worked, promotion was based on who knows you or who you tailgate with."
good,my opinion of Kroger is that it is not what it used to be and I prefer not the work there anymore and that is why I am looking for a new job that pay better and has som type of decent benefits.
good,Company was excellent to work for but one switch management team store went down. If you're not assisted or manager Kroger where they don't care about their under Associates
good,A typical day at work includes doing your assignments and mingling with customers and assisting them in the most efficient way. I have learned time-management and leadership skills.
good,Great place to work if you are a student not if you are looking for a full time. They are very flexible with your schedule if u have another job or school
good,"At first the hours I was getting were great, but then I started going to school so they were really flexible with them. Then after school I wanted to work more hours and I just couldn’t get them. The company is ran very chaotically and honestly stressed me out. If you want something flexible then it’s great but if you want something to be like full time then it’s not for you."
good,"i do not care to review, love my job, management is fair. the most enjoyable part of the day is clocking out. 8 am.- 4 pm the hardest part of my jobs is during holidays"
good,"the hardest part of the job is that you feel like you have no help, and they don't pay you enough to be working as much hard. you feel like you need more hours and they won't give it to you."
good,Job always demands more with less people and hours. Improvement never ends. Nothing is ever good enough. Deli is a great place to be ignored and seen as a problem employee.
good,"A great company to work for but hours are not flexible "
good,"The environment while working has been wonderful, everyone is lovely to work with and everyone is very nice! BUT I have had issues with a  manager in my store, I feel targeted / outed- every shift by the same manager, for anyone that is applying, please be careful."
good,the management was decent and were flexible with your schedule. the work environment was very fast paced and can be extremely stressful and tiring but having great coworkers to pass the time was great. the hardest part of the job was the labor (pulling in carts).
good,"Punch in, work backstop buggies, break down truck pallets, work product to shelves, face aisles, punch out, go home."
good,"If the managers actually cared about their employees, and appreciated their hard workers, this would be a good place to work. As of now the work environment is pretty toxic."
good,Depending on who you are and how you get along or work with others can make or break it. In my about 4 years as a courtesy clerk I rarely saw anyone stay as one or they quit.  I love working there but it changes too much for me to safely say whether its a good place to be or not.
good,They are a great company to work for. Lots of ways to advance your careers through them.  Great ways to get into management programs. Have raises every 30 days or was that way when I started. Experince pay.
good,A grocery store is a busy environment. The work day goes by quickly and staying busy can be enjoyable. Corporate expectations are unrealistic and out of touch with the realities of a service industry. There is not enough staff scheduled at any given time to meet the needs of the store and it’s customers.
good,It is awesome to have benefits & a steady job. It is not awesome to get lied to. I personally have been lied to several times now. I still hunt for other career options but it is not any better anywhere else. So I stay with the devil I know.
good,"My time at Kroger was for the most part a good experience. I learned quite a bit about the different cultures and religions that are in my area, compared to my home town, it was quite the culture shock. Management  at Kroger has a couple of things to be desired from, their micromanaging skills need to be worked on and they need to stop being as indecisive as they are and be able to tell their employees exactly what they need from them. The hardest part of the job would typically be breaking down the trucks that we get every night, and making sure that everything is organized and dated. the most enjoyable part of the job would be the employees that we work with. I managed to learn more customer and people skills and how to better manage my time."
good,Not a very bad job just very difficult customers to deal with on a daily basis. It can get very stressful at time and management barely gives you a chance to tell your side of anything that goes on.
good,"I was definitely lucky to have a good team to work with, however without a great interactive team the job can be very stressful. However, that is an object anywhere you go."
good,It was a great fit for me when I needed to get back into the workforce and wasn't looking for anything complicated. I enjoy the way the company focuses on the customer experience above all.
good,Kroger was an easy job to do and I had no problem getting promoted to the position of front end management. It is a union job and they wont fire you unless you do something pretty awful but they will cut your hours. I just didn't see a future there and they do not pay well so I found another job.
good,You have to make sure you get enough rest before work. You will have to be accurate while you picking your orders at a speed that you will have to keep up for 8 plus hours.
good,"When everyone is doing what they are supposed to do, the job and the environment are nice. When things get hectic it all depends on the store manager. Overall the people that work here are genuinely nice."
good,"After a year of working at Kroger (Smiths Marketplace) I started to receive great benefits. The managers (at my location) seem to not care at all about their workers, I was promised several promotions (management and higher-paying positions) that never happened."
good,I used to enjoy my job but I am not a fan of the direction in which the company is headed. The focus of the company is no longer on the customer or the employee.
good,"Lots of work and should be disciplined. "
good,My time at Kroger was fun at first but it soon turned tiring after they had the new guy (me) do everything even when other employees are around. It just wasn’t something I enjoyed doing and I got tired of it real quick
good,Its ok working there but they are really bad at scheduling. The benefit are good but not good enough for me to suffer through it again. Id recommend this job for people with a lot if free time.
good,"I have been with the company over 10 years."
good,"It was an OK place to work, but being union is not for me. Your job performance has no effect on your schedule or how many hours you are given. They don't care about your home life."
good,Worked there 5 years and was mostly ok. Decent benefits with the union. Hardly got paid anything at all for the work you put in. New employees came in making more than I did and I put in 2x the work.
good,"Odd work hours and the management was alright. The most enjoyable part of my job is my coworkers. The hardest part of my job is lifting multiple boxes, all equalling 45 pounds. My typical workday usually started off by receiving my beginning tasks and complete them, then ask for more tasks, while completing my daily tasks."
good,Kroger was your basic “high school student” job with flexible hours and overall decent pay wages. My reason for leaving the Kroger Company was due to very poor management at the Bargersville store along with promised pay raises that were never received. Would not recommend working for the head of this store or a few of the managers located there.
good,"The work was rough on the back due to constantly bending over to stock low shelves, hours often changed, but on the plus side it was overall a low stress job."
good,fast paced but unorganized. unmotivated work culture. but did enjoy having three days off a week. Job was demanding but not self-fullfilling. poor management
good,"Kroger is not concerned about their employees whatsoever. The management is awful, and the benefits aren’t that great. You only receive benefits//holiday pay after a year of working. And they only count 4 holidays in the year for holiday pay."
good,"Overall not a bad place to work.  However the communication from corporate to management, and then from management to employees is poor at best.  Also, promotions are based more on who you know than what you know"
good,"Some days are good, some days are not so good. Courtesy clerks easily do the most physical labor and get paid the least which is no fun. One thing I learned people have bad attitudes while shopping for food which makes no sense. Running a cash register is easily done with practice however you must be speedy."
good,"Pay is low and raises are small. Most everyone gets along most of the time. But there is a lot of talking behind people's backs. To me it has a high school feel, with cliques and bullying sometimes."
good,"We’ve all have had jobs before where we question new policies and how they are enforced but Kroger is running itself into the ground with what they have changed over the past two years and how those very policies are excited and enforced. I was a produce manager for four years and I can’t complain about what the company did for me as far as career advances and pay ,but the people they have running some of their stores are complete maniacs!!!"
good,Kroger was ok for the most part the only issue was there were not enough people to effectively get every job done and the managers often ignore the issues
good,"I like the people I work with, but you almost never hear from management. They often don't schedule enough people to work on a given day. They want you to be outside for multiple hours getting buggies."
good,"it is great company, friendly environment but poor management commutation and discrimination towards some employees, great benefits and awesome employees"
good,"The job itself wasn't bad, but the management sucked.  I worked there 6 years and went through 7 managers and 9 co-managers.  So they really didn't care about the employees.  They let the slackers get by with not taking responsibility. Those of us that cared and had a work ethic carried the load."
good,"I quit the job about a half a year before the unionization, so my information is likely quite outdated. But at the time, the pay was not good, and the only raise I got in an entire year of working above average was 5 cents. It's been a hot minute, though, so I can't recall many other details, nor do I know whether or not they'd still be applicable."
good,"The job was simply most of the time, but the pay rate just wasn't there. Not enough hours was provided. One week I only had one work day on the schedule, with only 4 hours. Other weeks I'd be lucky to get even 2 or 3 days on the schedule."
good,typical day at Kroger store working various position from breaking down the truck to stocking shelves.what i have learned while working at Kroger is teamwork and basic computer skills.
good,Working at Krogers was an interesting experience. The environment all around was great. I learned new things by the help of my friendly coworkers whom I made great friendships with. Being able to help others with what they needed was something I looked forward too everyday.
good,I quit from there because the staff weren’t on the professional level they needed to be. Most employees didn’t last a long time because they quit or got fired. People don’t help when they need it and the amount of common sense is pretty low. The pay of 8.25 and then 25 cent extra for every year is not worth the amount of work you’ll be doing.
good,I had some issues with hours everyweek concerning school. I had to tell them what days i could work and hours. It was very annoying. Not a bad place to work other then that
good,It was ok. Just not the place that I want to spend the rest of my life at. It wasn't that great of a paying job. And they wouldn't let me work mornings so that's one of the reasons why I'm leaving
good,"Kroger wad a great place for me to start as a part-time employee. When I first began working there, the hours they gave me were consistent and fit well with my schedule. As I continued to work for the company longer, my hours became very inconsistent, as I began to work 30-40 hours a week as a part-time employee."
good,Sometimes being there can be stressful when you work everyday but for the most part its a good place to work at and you can meet different kinds of people
good,"Overall as long as you do your job and come in when you’re suppose to unless you have to absolutely call out it’s not a terrible job. The managers can be a bit much at times, the culture in the store was overall just trying to make it through the shift so we could get out of there, and a lot of times it got pretty depressing because of that. But the pay is consistent and that’s pretty much the only thing that kept me there for as long as I was."
good,"It was supposed to be a hold over job until something better came along anyways, but I am glad to leave.  Management at my location was fine.  The employees not so much.  You had some that were happy to help you and some who couldn't be bothered.  I hate that disgusting attitude because everyone was new once.  My immediate supervisor was not understanding at all.  At this point in my life I just won't take attitude from anyone."
good,"Over the last 6 or so months the company changed drastically,  new contract imply's we are not assigned the titles we started with,  we're all just considered clerks,  which means they can assign us to any department any time of the day,  one minute they might have you in the dairy department,  2 hrs later they'll move you to frozen.  Nothing's consistent anymore"
good,Kroger Gabe me a chance they were a good company to work for they strongly lack in training but they are good about internal promoting and pay rate is very good.
good,"Where all the rushes happens."
good,"becomes a family atmosphere after you are there for awhile, which is great especially if you work 30+ hours a week, you start spending more time there than with your own family at home"
good,Management needs work  people come and go all the time  lazy co workers and most of the time nobody ever knows what is really going on in the store until some big shot comes to visit
good,"My location wasn't that great. At first it was though because when I got there we had a good management staff. When I was a fry cook with the old mgmt staff, sales went up. Then KFC acrid the street from us went out of business, and another kroger location closed. Later on we became the mgmt training store with the district office in it so or whole upper mgmt and department mgmt got changed around and it was downhill from there."
good,At kroger warehouse the workers worked at a very face pace to the point where it was unsafe because everyone was on pallet riders no matter how fast you went somehow you still wouldn't get the bonus
good,"Kroger was a good company when I started,  it has went down hill. They can't get us help and we work short handed .........................................."
good,"Being an order selector was hard work but good money, the culture I did not like at all i believe some of the people could be rude because their money is more important. Management needs MORE improvement."
good,"while working at kroger you're gonna be asked to do a lot of things. anything from assisting customers, to cleaning bathrooms, working in the parking lot or walking the aisles putting items on shelves. this is a job where you are constantly on the move"
good,"Day-to-day work is steady to very busy, dealing with customers and doctor's offices and insurance companies. Co-workers at my locations are easy to get along with and we are able to help keep each other in a decent mood, even on a bad day. Customers range from really wonderful to super high-maintenance and rude. District is VERY concerned with policing our every move. I learned how to be fake. Pharmacy is hard and not for everyone."
good,"Despite the neutral rating, I cannot recommend working for Kroger. Management changes extremely often, and employees with long careers who DON'T join the Union often find themselves unemployed for any number of arbitrary or unreasonable expectations."
good,"a year ago, management was better than how it is now. "
good,Kroger is a good place to look for work due to the flexible hours it offers and the benefits it offers its full time employees. It is a good first job due to the flexibility of the hours and the pay is good.
good,they say you arent on production but they write you up if you dont have a high LMS.. other then that the pay is good and benfits are a little pricey..
good,It was just a job so many years ago. Just to pay my bills until something better came along. I worked until I could get better hours and wages at a full time regular job.
good,"Poor management "
good,Over time it becomes a drag and you lose the motivation to go into work because it's very boring and rather tedious at times especially with the poor management. They are basically just office workers now with one or two exceptions and whenever they do help the departments it's minimal.
good,Kroger does not have enough people scheduled to do the job the way they want it in the time they expect. So people work so many hours and it's stressful. Most people stay at kroger because of the benefits not because they like their job.
good,it seems at time there is not enough people. which some of the managers seemed seem stressed out. there was never enough hours to give I was told . that every departments have so many hours to give every week
good,"The entire time I have worked here, I have always felt as if the managers inside the store don't truly care how we are. It's as if the fuel center is it's own little island."
good,The job was ok but I needed something better . More hours better pay to have living it was just temporary but I felt kind u could really say there but I decided to leave
good,"Overall, not great. Management was a nightmare and refused to do much, instead they pawned THEIR jobs off on other employees who had their own, completely unrelated jobs to do."
good,The hours I. Get Arnett enough to make ends meet I had to fight to get wednesday evening and Sundays off for church  I like the job even though out hard sometimes
good,it has been good for me but I would like to do something different it has a good training and try to put people in the right department so they can keep working
good,"i didn’t like it besides a few things, there always short staff & did nothing about it. They don’t pay good at all. The only good things they had to offer was the benefits."
good,"Not enough pay for cashiers. Expect fe u to be on call because other people don't show up to there shift"
good,"I personally did not care to work at Kroger. I would not work there again. I had nice coworkers, but my schedule was continually messed up. I think the working atmosphere is alright."
good,"If you are looking for something extra on the side, my store hires anybody. Unions make it impossible to do anything but they make sure you have a job unless you steal. Management is just laughable at times and have a bad habit at throwing their  corporate pressure at you. They clearly value their customers over the people that keep the store alive which is okay but at time, they take the customer’s side even if they are lying. No actually  security at the stores. Just some random people that stand around for a paycheck. If you have nothing else to go to and don’t mind spending years of your life to get one week of paid vacation, have at it. If you want more for yourself and to get up in the world, Kroger isn’t the place for you."
good,"Despite the constant reminder that we were supposed to be working as a team and that we were a family, most of the work was solo. Your responsibility was your own, even when you asked for help. The management was not helpful to me."
good,"This job is exactly that: a job. It entails a lot of repetitive bagging/checking tasks while constantly moving around and providing customer service. It includes a lot of strenuous activities as well, such as bringing in large loads of carts or cleaning bathrooms and emptying store trash cans. For what it is is worth, the enviroment is rather stressful and it can feel like management does not understand what truly needs addressed. It was a great learning experience, and a lot of friendly people with stories come through the check-lanes."
good,"Kroger doesn't give allowances for the pregnant or sick, regardless of doctor notes. Creates a high stress environment and fires for minor errors. The only thing that made working there bearable was my coworkers."
good,"The bad thing about working for Kroger's is the pay,management really doesn't care about their employees and just worried about their sales also the department head likes to schedule you out of your availability"
good,Good for high school students that need a starting job. Not much room for advancement unless someone else leaves. If you get into a management position that would be a better start to advancing in the company.
good,"it was decent fast paste, some days were harder then others but we also had good days the specials that they will do for us as far as ice cream day was cool"
good,"A typical work day was bagging groceries and collecting carts. Sometimes you had to clean even though you were not trained on how to do so. Hardest part was collecting carts in the summer heat, easiest was doing take backs."
good,The job was stressful always changing things not consistent and always had the chance of if your drawer was over short you were going to get fired it's not a place I would recommend but not a bad place to work
good,I loved working with my coworkers. Managers play favorites. Not enough hours to make a living. Its really hard to claim full time. Managers make promises and never keep them.
good,"Good place to work, great benefits and a good opportunity to move up.  Training is good and job advancement is important. The team moral is high and teamwork is usually always giving."
good,This is a great Starter job. If your a highschool student or never had a job before this job teaches you some basic professionalism. However it is not great to sustain yourself. If you need a job to live its best to look elsewhere.
good,Kroger is a great way to start a job. Bagger is the most fun and easy. Working up to cashier is hard. Working at the service desk was a good first experience.
good,"Members of the store management always seems to pick favorites, they also LOVE LOVE  LOVE to micro manage back in our department. Other than that aspect of the job I love it!"
good,"This place is a decent place to work, but depending on what department you work, and what stores you work, work might be easy and relaxed, or stressful and quick-paced."
good,"As a cashier, you generally start at minimum wage, you get a quarter amount raise every six months, (till you get to like $13/hr tops)  the store, as expected, picked up by the day and time, sometimes you could stand there for long times, other times you’d work yourself for hours on end as people piled in your line. Management was fair with breaks as they were pre-scheduled. Requesting time off was easy, and reading the schedule was easy, as all of that was done online, there was online viewings Of check stubs and they offered checks and direct deposit for payment. You received discounts of 10% per Kroger brand item that you bought using your code as an employee."
good,"I requested part time but was given 30-40 hours a week and then I was new and they only had 1 line open as a cashier on a Saturday. Then when I couldn't come to work, they told me they'd pick me up. Interview was fine but management is horrible."
good,"All you are in the eyes of management is a human robot. If you show up on time, finish your shift & most importantly pull your %100 standard within your 9 month probation period you'll be A okay. If you call out a lot and don't pull your %100 score then you'll probably let go. Get past your probation period & it becomes much harder for the company to fire you now that you have seniority and the union has your back. Definitely a young mans job. repetitive & monotonous work along with long hours."
good,Being a cashier at Kroger is pretty boring.  You deal with rude customers and stand for the entirety of your shift.  Kroger pay is minimum wage with a very slight raise after 6 months.
good,"Kroger was a decent place to work at. Job salary and Employee dependency was unfair and at times very unequal. For Certain employees the staff was way more lenient towards, therefore resulting in them getting away with many things"
good,"great employees, fun to work with. Hours very flexible. great job to start of at right after high school. career advancement not to many but you can apply for them."
good,"Krogers is cool. The managers and management are understanding to their employees. I just wish it was better pay relating to experience and education,"
good,"Organize and begin to prepare everything before the store opens. If the opening cashier is running late step in as a cashier until that person arrives. The store manager/ co-manager will enter the store soon so make sure forms are prepared so can have the morning meeting with each department. Some of the employees in the workplace are lazy, entitled,  do not get in trouble, and are not team players. There are some employees that are hard workers and make it fun to go to work."
good,"I have worked at Kroger Co for approximately 7 years now and there have been ups and downs. For me, this was just a job to put myself through college and make some extra pocket money (when I had the time). If you are competent and intelligent, there will be no issues. I don't think there is too much expected of you if you are in a position that is below department leadership (as I was, a clerk). This is nice because it relieves some of the work stress. Especially if you are in school or have a hectic home life. I have met some truly amazing people through Kroger and some people that will be lifetime friends. On a different note, I don't think compensation was all that great. On a normal day, I work the lion's share of the truck and get compensated just the same as the people who slack off. Personally, I think performance-based raises would be appropriate. Also, I have worked in two different stores with two VERY different cultures. One of the stores I worked at had a TERRIBLE management staff and the other one had a WONDERFUL management staff. So, my experience with management at Kroger has been hit or miss. I will say, however, when the management staff  if well-trained and enthusiastic, it makes the work environment much easier to tolerate."
good,"For the most I have liked working for Kroger. However I feel that there does need to better time management. I like my current position. I just hate the long drive and the low pay despite the side perks that most really do not take advantage of.  This is job more for college students, retirees, or as an additional income."
good,It was a descent job. I am more educated so therefore I only worked there due to immediate needs of funds to take care of my bills. I learned how to operate deli slicers. I didn't appreciate how some workers in there didn't wash or sterilize deli slicers properly when customers requested them to do so. The customers would request that sometimes due to any previous type of meat that may have been sliced before the customers orders. For example: some religions don't eat pork. these customers didn't want any previous pork products touching or dispersed into their orders of a meat product.
good,"I had just moved to my current apartment which was a few hours from where I used to live. I needed a job quickly and figured I'd apply to be a pharmacy technician. I didn't find out until later that Kroger pays their techs the lowest compared to other companies. Its not a hard job but there really isn't much room for improvement. I would say overall it is an ok job, but not a career."
good,The interview process is to much for the position they need to know to much information for just being a stock clerk it's almost makes you feel that it is to much and makes you not want to work for them
good,My manager at the time wasn’t the best . He no longer works there. I do not recommend front end if you do not enjoy fast paced work. Other then that great job for teenager.
good,"From my experience at Kroger, I have met and worked with lots of people that I interacted with and felt very good working with. A typical day would be going outside in the unpredictable weather getting carts for customers and going back inside to bag groceries as part of rotation. Management was poor and did not do enough to support employees. The hardest part of my job was helping customers with things you did not have access to."
good,"The Company as a whole is a great one, Much better then others in the same market."
good,"Didn't enjoy not having set schedules. Also, management never made it seem like it would ever be worth working there in the long run. You're likely to never leave though because the company makes you feel like there are few other options outside it's walls."
good,"I've worked here 5 years, and in that time a lot has changed. There was a time where i actually genuinely enjoyed it. However corporate is always changing up the rules and methods of day-to-day work. They've forcefully switched us all to the overnight shift recently and will lose a lot of quality workers accordingly. They care slightly too much about their bottom line, and not enough about their employees. However its a good place for high school/college students to work and earn some money while getting through school. The work itself isn't too demanding at all, it's just the management and the inconvenient shift times that will drive people away."
good,"Management was great, however they weren't flexible with school/sport/extracurricular activities for students. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude/unruly customers."
good,"Working at the bakery of a Mariano's (owned by Kroger) was a fun summer job, easy to learn tasks necessary, usually something to do at all times. Willing to be flexible with schedule. The hardest part was throwing away the day old bakery items."
good,"Honestly this job seems like it should be easy. Delivery arrives, break it down, and stock it up nicely. As a general rule the co-workers and department management are great and understanding. Unfortunately upper management tends to be unsympathetic. The time schedules for completing work are unrealistic, the store and company goals change every couple months, and it's not unusual for upper management to apply policies differently across associates. The pay is actually rather nice considering the position but since it is a union position all pay raises are pre-set; there is no room for raises based om performance."
good,"Very productive, but can be overwhelming. Normally would be over worked for an underpay. Not all management were terrible. Kroger had its perks, but it is definitely a more stressful environment to work in. The most enjoyable part about working at Kroger, engaging conversation with the customers and having going away parties and or celebrating when goal is met. The hardest part, is overworking yourself, doing your best to get the job done, but much more is still needed to be expected out of you. Another task waiting for you, hardly any breaks, especially if you're understaffed."
good,Kroger was a good place to work in the beginning.  A lot of manager changes caused unhappiness with staff.  I soon realized I would not get the hours I wanted . I also did not get a  position I would have liked within the company.
good,The work life balance is good.  The lack of opportunities for advancement or cross-training is minimal.  I am in a shift lead role and there is no extra compensation for the job that I do.  The ability to step back out of the role is difficult because no one else will do it.
good,"the warehouse position paid well and the benefits were ok, its just a fast pace inviornment and your job counted on your quota which in a lot of cases people weren't able to give the kind of performance required, which in that case makes for a very high ""turnover rate"""
good,Nothing special about it. Case pick and LTO are offered incentive pay. Shipping forklift operators are not. Lunch is not paid. Relatively low base base pay.
good,It's an okay job to start in if you plan to go to school for something else ot if you plan to work your way up. They are suppose to schedule by seniority but it may or may not happen depending on who your supervisor is.
good,This company can be great for you and also leads to a good career path. Cons are that the balance is really not there and you are not treated with a whole lot of value. Good benefits and pay and reasonable accommodations.
good,"I enjoyed the time that I worked there before the new manager came into the store. He was very rude and disrespectful to my associates, friends, and even the customers. He likes to see a lot of the negative and not a lot of positive."
good,"Very fast paced, hardly any training was provided. Management was very strict, they were very efficient. You met tons of people from different cultures."
good,"Good company benefits. Customers and co-workers can be a little much, but that is retail. Management is a fifty -fifty some good some bad. You can move up in company."
good,"Too much favoritism, too much focus on 'quantity' (speed)...quality is better (good customer service). 'Get them in, get them out' is not good customer service to me. Good quality interaction with people isn't going to be as meaningful and pleasant with the pressure of a time limit hanging over your head. :)"
good,"I liked it that it was close to home I enjoyed working with most of the people there, but after a change in management, I found it less enjoyable. My supervisor moved to a different store, his replacement was less than fun to work with and for, and our managers were replaced by people that didn't work out in their own stores. I was offered better pay at another job, and left for that."
good,"Good place to interact with people. Many opportunities for growth. "
good,"I started off as a courtesy clerk and was able to be promoted to two different department, a drug gm associate and later a pharmacy technician. Working for Kroger offers a lot of opportunity to expand and grow your skills that you can take with your. The stores are usually busy making it a fast paced working environment, everyday is something new but its also a familiar routine."
good,I remember Kroger being stressful place to work. One day you would work 1-9pm and then turn around and work at 5am. Always short staffed. Not a set schedule.
good,Kroger's is a mutual feeling kind of place to work. It's either you really enjoy working there or you really hate working there. When the holidays roll around everything gets really hectic and stressful. But was the holiday rush is over it gets a little more relaxing but still stressful at times. There are certain departments that are a mess and makes hard to clean it up and get the department back on track and where it needs to be. The management would vary on the workload of that day. Sometimes they would expect way to much from their workers and sometimes its just a another casual day.
good,"Kroger is a great part time job for students looking for their first job, however it is more of a temporary job. The pay is fairly low, but the work is also not difficult."
good,"Maybe it’s just the Kroger I was working at but it was very unorganized. Management talks to you in a inhuman fashion and no one likes to do their job. I only stayed because I’m a student and I have tuition and books to pay for out of pocket, but if it wasn’t for that I would’ve been left."
good,"The best way I can explain my time at kroger is 'meh'. Kroger made me a very lazy person while working, I despised most of the management staff for multiple reasons, though there were diamonds in the ruff. The pay was horrible, and I always felt I was forced to work harder than what I was paid for, thus causing laziness. My coworkers made the experience bearable, and I met many good friends there. Their customer satisfaction policy is pushed a step too far, to the point where the employees are the last priority, though the union is nice, it simply doesn't make up for it."
good,"Kroger is big on customer service, so it is important to make sure the customer is satisified and will continue to shop with kroger. Fix prices for customers if necessary and if not satisfied happily refund the item for them"
good,"Kroger could be a nice place to work but management is poor and could use major improvement. Kroger offers short breaks for how busy the store is in certain areas. Kroger also doesn't try to work with the employees on any issues and management tends to pick on one person that they believe is their ""source"" of any problems."
good,"The manager of my departmen is a great man, however the other managers are not so great. They do not listen to what we tell them or what we advise them and it creates an unsafe work environment."
good,"I appreciated the work experience it gave me, but was not interested in keeping it as a permanent job. The management at my Kroger were nice people, but my school schedule could not accommodate."
good,Productive and busy place to where you are always busy never really a day that’s slow and you get to meet new people. It’s a job for people who like to be a help and are people persons.
good,I feel that the department I worked in needs new management that is understand of life and schooling situations. It was a great place to work until I was promoted for courtesy clerk to the deli department.
good,It is a good working experience. They will train you on every equipment. Fast pacing job with production. Co workers are great and fun to be around. Supervisor are hard headed and half of the time want listen. Long hours
good,Work was fun but it were days the management would knocked us down. Been nice to the customers made there days. Management was cool. T'he hardest part was when the deliveries trucks arriving when people on breaks or getting off of work made the job a little hard.
good,"Time management skill was the most valuable self taught lesson."
good,A very laid back working environment and you get to see all kinds of characters come through the door who you may otherwise never meet. It can be fun but can also be very monotonous and boring.
good,"No matter how far you advance in ranks, you don’t get any better pay. I’ve had many managers that don’t seem to care about me a bit. You get paid very little for what you have to put up with. This job is pretty nice for a highscool student looking for a couple bucks on the side but this is no place to make a career."
good,Store manager was very inconsiderate about employees family and personal issues. However they did make an effort to be flexible with employees about their availabilities. There were multilpe issues with supervisors strongly suggesting against decisions that would help employees better their advancement in the company. Also breaks and lunchs were always at least an hour late if they were given at all.
good,Its an ok job but thats just what it is a job put items from a box on a shelf and move pallets around but if your in need then its a good starting place
good,it was fine to work at Kroger when i first started but after being there for about a year and a half i got tired. and well i was working there management changed and not for the better because of that more workers got disrespectful and it was not a good working environment.
good,"It was my first job, but the customers made me feel welcomed and also you can create bonds with the Kroger team and customers as well. Overall, I feel like it was a good experience and would refer anyone."
good,"When I first started working here, it was ok, and as time went on it didn't seem like the store manager cared enough about the departments, and just wanted to have things done even when we were understaffed. Cared more about saving money then actually have things done."
good,"The hours  are not good they will not give you  enough hrs . been there 3 years   still part time  .they will hire outside   people with no exp  and make them full time . great place to work  just think those with longer  commitment to the place should be given a chance  to go full time, all they hire  now are part time . One of the lowest paid  meat cutting departments  out there"
good,"I loved working at the pharmacy for Kroger. I just felt like I couldn't meet there expectations, so I left the job. It was extremely hard for me to continue working there knowing I couldn't do what they wanted from me."
good,"No communications from managers as of what should be done as a team effort, As for new hires.,they place them in different departments without knowledge of how the job should be performed.and as soon as a new hire is trained properly for a certain department.there then switched to a different department. Just a very stressful atmosphere with,co managers and district managers constantly not communicating with each other,therefore your having to do the same job two or three times,,for example,the head manager will tell you what to do,but the co manager,or district manager will tell you not to do it.so who do you listen to? Now the head manager wants to know why the job wasn't done.it was too many bosses in my opinion,and no communication between management at all..."
good,A typical day at work can be hard but we get through it. we often have a lack of staff because of how they schedule us. management isn't always around to help and the supervisors often panic when it gets busy.
good,Ok job for teenagers really don’t see why anyone would want to make a career out of it except for going into a management position. Pretty easy job though
good,"The work wasn't too stressful. What was stressful about the job was that we seemed to always be understaffed, so everyone had to do the work of two people minimum (usually more). As a full time career, I cannot recommend this, but as a first job for someone with no work experience, this is an acceptable choice."
good,"Kroger pharmacy does not give enough hours in the pharmacy in order to learn my position completely. I have been stuck in the first tier of the pharmacy technician training and having a hard time moving on not only because of hours, but because of the other employees. They have ""seniority' so i cannot move up to a different station within the pharmacy to learn more on how to do duties other than run the register and check out prescriptions. I am not too happy, but I love this position."
good,Kroger's will be a nice place for employment for younger children not for someone with bigger more responsibilities because I don't feel like they're in for advancement management sometimes can be disapproval for advancement because I feel like they can also hold you back with the skills that you have and they lack to see and they're very not good listeners when you go to them with the problem and some issues they try to brush it off for the next person
good,i worked for king soopers a kroger company for 5 years. i started as a clerk and worked up to a produce manager pretty quickly. the pay is decent for the job but the management team upstairs and in the districts were horrible and very negative.
good,"A typical day at Kroger could either be easy if you are working with people who know what they are doing or it could be one of the most stressful days if you work with people who have no idea what they are doing and do not care. There is no in-between at Kroger store and due to the poor management, you are left with vague answers and poor excuses as to why you can not get help with your department or they expect you to be able to do everything by yourself."
good,When I first started with the company is was great. Throughout the years alot of changes being made that is causing alot of employees to step down or quit. Alot of micromanaging causing to feel unappreciated and a sense of distrust.
good,The manager would micro manage. She would watch the cameras from the previous days every night. She did want us employees talking to each other at all even if there were no customers around. The job was pretty easy except on a holiday stress levels reach ultimate high. Pulling in carts suck during the summer and when it rains. I was constantly getting sick in the winter from having to work in the rain.
good,Loved my store and people. Training new managers has some opportunities to be fixed. District coordinators duties need adjustments. Moved around a lot (which can be good or bad depending on your current situation)
good,"Kroger has provided me with skills that I didn't know I had. Kroger showed me how I am hard working and showed how everything is possible. Kroger has taught me to build character such as courage, to be able to work on my own and not to rely on others."
good,"Long hours. Hard work physically. No lunch break in the Deli."
good,"Management is poor "
good,The company is a good if you really need a job and are looking for a decent pay.  The job is stressful and fast-paced but also in consistent in the message.
good,"Alright"
good,I feel that the store needs a change and just how they don't ask you if cant work on your unavailable days is just not common courtesy. it seems that seniority doesn't matter.
good,"You will most likely be put into a union. The union give great benefits and ensures good pay, though wages aren't competitive and the job is relaxed. Max pay was 20 dollars through the union."
good,Lots of different positions to work at. Sometimes felt like I wasn't being given enough direction. Managers seemed to get switched around a lot. Got moved to different departments frequently.
good,"I never feel appreciated, don't have the managers back, I don't have any career opportunities, and there is lots of favortism...  I am just not happy working for kroger..."
good,"Very transparent leadership, very fun loving place to work, tools are good, not many meetings , folllows safe agile principles, lots of picnics and fun things"
good,Working for Kroger was decent. Pay was okay and the job itself was alright as well. Nothing to really complain about. Management could have been better.
good,A decent first job to give me a better understanding of how a job works. Typical day consisted of prepping food for customers and ensuring that their orders were completed in a timely manner.
good,I didn’t love my time there but I won’t forget it. There was some employee problems but other than that it wasn’t all bad. I liked most of who I worked with and got to know
good,"Working for Kroger can be stressful, as it can sometimes feel like a high pressure, fast paced environment, especially at some of the larger, higher volume stores. However, the longer you are there, you realize that a lot of it is upper management and corporate mismanagement than it is failure of the employees doing their jobs."
good,There was no future for me at the Kroger store. I was not advancing and living up to my full potential so i quite. going to work everyday was sucking the life out of me and i was not a happy person. I could not live like that anymore.
good,"Overall, the management would have been good, although there was a lack of general knowledge of my department so all problems were handled poorly. Rules between the two different corporate heads (Starbucks and Kroger deli) clashed and the two never worked together for clarity."
good,"Retail is reatail. The hours are rough, compared to other jobs in this area that pay similarly. The culture is conflicting due to the divide between management and associates."
good,The everyday work is standard for a retail grocery store but the hourly wages are significantly less then then competitors. Would recommend for a stepping stone job but not for a career.
good,when I started working there it was great they worked around by single mom schedule then management got changed and one in particular was very rude and made the environment intolerable. had to report them to Union several times
good,When I first hired on it was a great place too worked the management changed and I felt like they where on my back So they made my job bad I had to keep water with me by Drocters order
good,Good place to work at but very stressful leadership is very poor sometime unfair they will give you raises but might drop hours afterwards customer are very very rud
good,"I was not happy at Kroger, they do not care one bit for their associates. Peopke get passed over various times to move up in the company. Plis there is no notice on job transfers."
good,Kroger is a very easy place to work at but you are serverially under paid compared to any other store in the area. Here recently managment as been throw more and more stuff to do which is making it harder to get all tasks done in the work shift with the people and hours provided
good,"I enjoyed my job, just the hours were not what I needed and the job leader would not change them. I wanted early mornings. I worked in the Starbucks as a barista. I loved it."
good,"Being a dairy clerk at Kroger was ok. It was very fast paced for me and it helped me with my work ethic."
good,Most people think working at a grocery store would be a terrible job and it definitely can be. I personally enjoyed working here but it interfered with my schooling.
good,"The job in itself was flexible. As long as you correctly and timely requested schedule changes or availability requests, the would be accepted without fail. The management was poor and the employee turn rate was extremely high at my time of employment."
good,I just had a baby and was looking for work so I took the job being told I was going to get 40 hours a week paid time off and 10.00 an hour. They likd about all of it. I barley brought home 100 a week.
good,"Kroger was by far one place I honestly did not enjoy. They overwork you for so little an hour and expect nothing but the absolute best, I do not mind giving my absolute best, but it was not worth it. It also did not help me advance in my career in architecture."
good,Its an okay place to work if you have high seniority and have worked here for years but if not then it's not the best place to work because you will have last choice in everything
good,"Thankful for the job but I don't see my self growing at the job"
good,"I love work for Kroger, I was that Kroger was not closing in North Carolina.  It is sad because I have advanced in the Company but to only find out that they are closing."
good,"It was a alright place to work for, and some nice people to work with. The managers that worked with you we're really nice to follow but there was other mangers that would make some workers carry most of the workload and allow others to slack off. It was especially hard to work so many hours during school."
good,"management is difficult, hours vary if part time, but starting pay Is above minimum wage which is great. multiple departments to work in depending on store and advancement opportunities."
good,It’s and good job with benignity and also union but the management wasn’t good. There was too much  favoritism between one another and not enough hours to work
good,"Kroger is a good place to work. Great customers, great co workers HOWEVER some of the management team are very rude and hard to work for on a daily bases."
good,There is definitely a lot of different positions that you can apply for here which Is amazing if you are looking to learn something new. The workplace environment here is very friendly which makes it the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,"Not much to talk about. You're either going to be stocking shelves, pushing shopping carts, running a register, making cakes or deli foods. The pay is barely above minimum wage but pay more for more experience in retail and customer service."
good,A typical day at work was I would arrive 10 minutes early put my belongings in my lockers and go clock in. I would either start with carts or bagging groceries. I learned patience and gained a lot of independence in the work place. The managers weren't what I expected they were rude and snobby I understand the hard work that management puts in but I believe that no matter how your internally feeling you should always put a smile on your face and treat others the way you want to be treated. The work place was very fast paced depending on the day and time which kept things interesting but created space for mistakes but co-workers were always willing to help. The hardest ;art of the job was getting overwhelmed with huge grocery orders. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to children while there parents payed the bill or pushing carts.
good,"Kroger was just a typical entry-level starter sort of job. Nothing special came of it. No advancements, no bonuses. I personally felt over-worked and underappreciated by my management. But that might have just been in my store."
good,At Kroger they will randomly schedule you or not schedule you at all. They aren’t very lenient about family issues and missing days cause of it. They will also sometimes give your break to someone else.
good,"Overall it's an ok job to work at. You do your job and leave. There are advancement opportunities if you like customer service. Health care, and other benefits included"
good,"I enjoyed working at Kroger. The environment was great, and the older customers will ensure you get a great laugh. The only downfall was the pay and benefits. I had to work there for a full year to get only a 10cent raise. It's a good job to start off with but not enough to pay your bills."
good,Working at Kroger wasn't that bad. My co-workers were nice and the customers were mostly friendly. It wasn't a bad first job at all. The only problem was it interfered with school.
good,"I worked for the Atlanta district and we had decent pay and benefits then my store switched to the Nashville,TN division Now they don't care for there employees so theres new faces all the time it should be ok for a summer job but not a job for years."
good,Change in management has not been consistent.  I am unhappy with my employment.  I have been there over a year. I have gained experience from this employer.  Co-workers can be moody.  But I many were very pleasant.
good,"Customers and co-workers are the best and worst part of working here because of pettiness. As I've learned, it's not what you do or how well you do it that is as important as how well you socialize and baffle with bull. The hardest part of the job is watching people with bad behavior get promoted and/or not disciplined. The corporation has good business ethic guidelines and promotes itself as an equal opportunity employer. Associates and customers are highly encouraged take surveys but management does not show they are actually listening as actions speak louder than words."
good,"This is a great place to work as a first job, they teach you many things. You move around alot and get a chance to work in many departments. Its not easy to move up in position but you get a raise every year. Management gives you just enough hours to keep you from getting benefits."
good,The morning shift is used as a means to set up the store; load store cards and bags at each register. Middle of the day is when customer traffic increases. Bottle bins must be replaced every hour or so. My store failed to distribute the proper PPE for this part of the job so you may end up with cuts on your hands that will need to be washed immediately. The associated are very polite and friendly. The best part of the job is the meaningful connections you make with customers.
good,"I work about 55-60 hours a week and the hours vary from opening shift, mid shift, and closing shift. If you are looking for a job that allows you to have a life this is not for you."
good,"As courtesy clerk I was assigned to bag groceries , Collect carts, stock shelves, take out trash , clean restrooms and help customers when needed. At my location the management was unprofessional . The managers would treat staff poorly , sometimes in front of customers. Other than that the job isn't too stressful ."
good,Alot of people and not enough space to work at the pace you can to get your quote to be able to keep high pay so with that being said other people can be in your way and effect your pay which isnt right
good,"Kroger was my very first job in the work force. I started off as a cashier making $8.00 an hour. It was always busy, and the work was very repetitive. But the had an awesome Union. Which was a great  benefited their employees."
good,"The most enjoyable part of  my job is meeting customers from around the world. THe workplace is a okay environment, of course there are always going to be mean people, but kroger has a LOT of rude employees."
good,Working at Kroger was ok as a part time job.  I liked the customer contact and co-workers. I also learned about how a grocery store works on the inside.
good,I worked at the Kroger in Green Hills and it wasn’t a bad place to work. I just didn’t like working in the bakery because I’m cold natured and you had to walk in and out of a freezer all day.
good,"The work was not stressful."
good,its a fast paced job that also require you to tend to the customers. I like my job but I also want to advance and do more than what I'm just doing now.
good,Depending on who you work with managers can be very inconsiderate to your work schedule. Some days I have the time of my life but most days I’m very very annoyed. The customers there are very rude especially the older people. You must have a decent amount of patience to take on the role.
good,"Soo much to do little of time and one person to do it now way never go to this place again. 11 Trash can and 20 Trash can and 10 at the front end, serves 20s, and 5 restroom, and every hour there is a sweep timer"
good,"Kroger was my first job and I had the most stressful time working there. I'm still in high school and my manager got on my case and told me ""If you put school over work then you shouldn't have a job""."
good,"As a Fuel Center Clerk at the location I worked at, having to call into the store and requesting supplies is par for course, however, you'll be lucky to actually get said supplies. Not to mention the absolute hassle that it is to get a break or lunch on time."
good,There is a large amount of work (specifically speaking of the service deli) and there never seemed to be enough staff to get it done in a timely manner.
good,"This place is good if this is your first job. There's not a lot of room to actually advance further up. In fact some of the positions to advance has been removed. However, it does teach you a lot for pharmacy and is good if you are studying to be in the medical field."
good,A typical day was arriving making your rounds by checking in with each department and making sure that the total store was is order and ready for business.  Most of the day was spent handling minor issues such as customer complaints ect.
good,I honestly didn't even want to work at kroger. I initially wanted to work at publix but it took to long to apply. Kroger was a weird place to work at.
good,long hours with limited labor resources but great people which does make it fun. A typical day is 10-11 hours but can become 14-15 hr very easily.  Lots of new leadership.
good,"Most people and most Management is pretty good. this company gives guarantees about how many minimum hours you get but its just words, it all goes out the window once you start. This is really the only issue i have with them. I do look forward to going in and seeing the fellow employees and customers."
good,Once i clocked in i was doomed. I had to help bag groceries for mean and rude customers and then after that i would be sent outside to collect all the carts and bring them back into the store so others can use them. Since i was the youngest i was literally always on carts and i felt like they should have paid me more because everyone would be inside relaxing and bagging groceries and putting stuff back on the shelves and i would be outside pushing dozens of 20 pound carts in the 90+ and 10- weather.
good,Is hard to get people to work with you a lot of times you are on your own on what you need to do and get done in a certain amount of time and the date you're given. They're always short on help and you can never get enough done
good,"Worked for 13 yrs at first store in full time capacity. Needed benefits and income. Enjoyed most of it. Transferred to 2nd store for 2 yrs, part time, then relocated and left the grocery business"
good,Quick and fast paced days are common. The workplace culture is very collaborative and very helpful when it comes to hard or difficult tasks. The benefits are also ok.
good,I worked in management.  We worked 9-10 hours per day minimum.  Kroger managers had worse benefits than the union workers and was only paid once a month when I worked for them.
good,"my co-workers and managers were easy to work with, and tried to help as needed to make sure work was done on time. the schedule was kind of inconsistent, expected to do your job and help make sure others work was done, which is not a problem, just part of the job."
good,"Only worked there a few months and did not really like it, Was told I would be floating in my general area & got sent all over the place. Was very disoraganized"
good,It's hard to move up in the company. Unless you've been working there for a while your pay is very little. Benefits are good. Wouldn't recommend working for this company.
good,Manage product inventory at multiple Dc's.  Work with stores to ensure they get what for their customers.  Write new purchase orders to fill store orders. Work within the guidelines established by Kroger management.
good,"This is customer service friendly; however, there can be some  nasty customers. The management can be bias sometimes. Kroger is fast past and their competition is Walmart. You do receive discounts on Kroger items and the best part is gas."
good,"There are a rush of customers usually between the hours of 3pm-7pm. Afterwards it becomes slow in the store and your able to work on other things. Customer service is a priority, but it isn't really enforced. The team members are fun to work with and are really friendly."
good,"Although the job was easy, the pay was still very low and if you aren't a high schooler or a college student looking for some extra cash, I would pass on this job.  The staff also seems to have their ""in-groups"" and if you aren't a part of this group, then you're going to have a tough time here."
good,Management is either weak or rude and overworked.  The workplace attitude towards Kroger is mild to slightly negative. People will work there for years. Training involves either online quizzes that are very easy or just being thrown in and learning from mistakes and criticism. You clock in and out within 7 minutes of your scheduled time. Breaks are paid but only 30 minutes. Insurance cheap but not great. It's a good first job.
good,I started out at Kroger as a part-time bagger. I was bagging groceries and collecting carts  from the parking lot did go backs and clean the whole store. Then I graduated not long after starting this job I was a full-time closing bagger. Then I went for the opening bagger. then once I turned 18 I went to non-foods. when I was promoted I was moving pallets to the floor and down stacking them and stocking shelves working graveyard. the hours got to much on my body with little to no sleep. the company has great history but the management needs a little more when I was working there idk about now only because I've seen a lot of changes in the Kroger store near me.
good,"While working here it felt like the management wasnt interested in their employees. My pay wasnt enough to live off.  If you work for Kroger be sure to get another "
good,"they make up new rules all the time, so basically you are damned if you do damned if you dont... and they are always right and you are not. they will tell you what you want to hear but not do it"
good,"I worked at Kroger Marketplace in Gallatin for almost two years and I enjoyed most of my time there. There were some bumps and bruises along the way, but management were great and I enjoyed working every day that I walked into the building."
good,"it started out as a great company, in the recent years ive seen a decline. you are a union store which i feel help and hurts. your pay is minimum an you dont get many raises. the management says they care about things but in reality i feel they lack and dont meet expectations. its a great job to get in to get some experience but ive seen alot of people in and out within my years there. high turn over rate for a reason."
good,"I was thankful to have a part time job that allowed me to still keep my family as top priority."
good,"A typical day a Kroger is very hectic and the management wasn't much help. The management would walk around the store and not help the associates with the truck in the back or help with the ""go-backs"" that the customers leave behind. Instead of helping the associates they would ask silly questions that they already knew the answers too like""why was the truck not finished?"" Well when you have a 1500 plus piece truck and only have 3 associates to work it what do you really expect. Things would be better if the management helped more."
good,"Upper management was mocked, and out of touch.  Lower management frequently made the job bearable.  I don't know if that applies to other stores, I just know that my job was ok purely because our lower management frequently fixed the problems that upper management created."
good,"Working for Kroger is good part time. I worked there 2-3 years and started as  a cashier. By the time I left I had been trained as a dairy clerk, and truck unloader. Manager has the most stressful job."
good,"A typical day would include placing item back on shelves, counting draws, cleaning work stations assisting customers. I learned how to best insure friendly customer service to instill a great shopping experience."
good,the work load is unrealistic and management turns a blind eye to other members of management when they slack off or competently for go do any work at all.
good,"If your looking for something temporary, it's a nice job. But long term it's not great. Don't look at advancing anywhere unless you know and are freinds with management."
good,"I really enjoyed working here initially. However, as time went on management continued to change and was never totally reliable. It was a pretty stressful job and for some reason I always ended up being placed on the worst shifts possible."
good,Good place for a first job. Great people to work around with. Management needs work. Other then that good place to work at very fun and can learn many new things.
good,"There were a few incompetent leaders, who were hard to phase out due to union protection or other rules and guidelines.lots of power trips and control issues, but there were also great team leaders who cared and encouraged their co workers. There was to much gossip at the store, and often lesser paid departments had a stigma to them, that made it harder to move up to or towards better-paying departments."
good,"pros- I enjoyed working with the customers"
good,"I like kroger for what they do for the community, but they dont take care of their employees.  I was very disapointed in the management, no one had your back."
good,Everyone works along with you and helps you if you ask. Everyone does their job as needed and are polite to everyone around them. You can relax and be yourself while enjoying serving customers with their needs.
good,"Dillons was my first real job, and as far as that is concerned I feel that the experience was appropriate. But after working there for over two years and only receiving a $0.50 raise, it became clear that the work was not worth the pay. The management was 50/50 in my experience. I had a manager who was the best manager I've ever had in any job, but also a manager who was rude and terrible."
good,"This was a good job, very relaxed. The pay was not good at all, doesn't compete with wages like Walmart, and other stores. It gave you room to grow over a few years but felt like a dead end because the raises were only 10 cents every 6 months, good job for a teenager but once you need to pay rent you can't afford to work here."
good,"was a supervisor, and a cashier back around 2015 , the highest i was paid was only 7.75, some of the management was unprofessional but  to be in customer service and deal with bills and western union transaction and to get paid that much was nothing,of course they pay better after the fact."
good,I learned everything is not peaches and cream. a typical day is helping coustmers and cleaning and pakaging food and cooking food.i enjoy my co-workers. hardest part is always trying to please the consumer
good,"Kroger is definitely a good place for one to get started. The environment is fast paced many times, particularly during the holidays. One can learn a lot about one's self working at Kroger."
good,"Only negative part about working for Kroger is pay scale. Friendly environment, fast-paced, room for advancement of career, supportive employees, good management."
good,My daily task at Pontiac foods was packing seasoning.and get them ready to ship out to all kogers.It is a place that is slow and steady pace great work force.
good,"Even after working 5 years in the pharmacy department I was still making barely enough to survive. The retail setting cannot compete with what a facility or hospital will pay certified techs. I turned down a lead technician role because even with the pay it was not even close to hospital pay."
good,"Good Management, but because it was a call center environment there was little opportunities for other projects and no flexibility in hours. Pay was low for the amount of work we did."
good,"Kroger is a fine company to work for. It's retail so the hours aren't great, but if you do your job and don't make any problems, it's a good job. Very friendly coworkers."
good,"I won't say it was horrible, because it wasn't. It was a good job and there was a lot about it that I enjoyed. The customer service aspect was one of those things. I absolutely loved interacting with my customers, most especially my regulars. But, at a certain point, it became clear to me, at least at the particular store I was at, there was some favoritism happening and advancement was nearly impossible. I tried to get cross trained, to move up and it just didn't happen. Even when my skills showed that I was ready and that I was doing everything right, I was ignored every time I tried to express my desire to grow and advance. I eventually grew frustrated with the lack of good management and left on my own."
good,"When I first started working with Kroger I was very happy and upbeat. I loved my job. I love making people happy. But as it progressed we had several manager changes in a matter of weeks. The constant shifting of managers has caused confusion. Some of the managers don't even stay long enough for you to get to know them. Recently the atmosphere has gone downhill for me. People are becoming rude and I just don't like coming to work anymore. It may just be my store, but it is enough that I am looking to leave the company. In addition, the pay is terrible. There is a Wal-Mart across the street whose employees are getting paid $3-5 more than we are. If you want to work here, be patient with people, and choose your location wisely. Some are better than others."
good,"Every job had a set time."
good,"As a technician, Kroger is a good place to start and get experience, however with the amount of stress the company puts on its employees its not worth it to stay past a few years unless you have to. There no advancement for tech except to move on to becoming a pharmacist, and even though they are union where I work my schedule is annoying. Kroger also lacks training their newer techs properly."
good,"A typical day at working for a Kroger store was stocking items onto the shelves, cashier, jewelry associate (replacing batteries in watches and car keys)."
good,"Kroger was alright. The managers were not very active and the pay was not very well t all unless you had a higher up poition. Overall, the ji was just okay."
good,Get to work start pulling pallets stocking merchandise cleaning aisles helping customers locate merchandise helping employees that need it. Worked very well with the manager's.
good,"I was a pharmacy specialist, it was my job to help the new hires on the floor, as well as answer inbound calls and assist customers in refilling there medications."
good,"Kroger is a pretty good place to work. It is a unionized company, so that creates good and frustrating rules that have to be followed. Example: the pay rates for employees could be much better, but the benefits are pretty good. Work/life balance for management could be better as upper supervisors micro-manage too much. Management also work a 50 hour week, which is totally outdated and unnecessary in this day and age. Overall, Kroger isn't a bad place to work, they just need to make some changes to remain competitive in the retail and grocery work force."
good,"Working at krogers was a good job experience, but when you get sent out to corrall carts, they forget to call youback in and just wait for you to figure it out on your own.  And asking questions to the manager isn't a good thing to do apparently."
good,"Very busy at work. I have learned many thing to advance my job. Management comes and goes. Culture,, Hard part is accountability not being 100% for all. Helping associates do the best job they can"
good,"My first experience with the Brighton Kroger store wasn't the greatest. They told me that they would have no time to train me since it was the holidays. During my first few months I had to constantly ask for assistance on how to do my job because I didn't receive any on-site training, which took away from the customers' time. A typical day at work would be signing in and taking over someone's shift; many front end associates would get late breaks or lunches because of poor time management from the scheduling. That would be the most difficult aspect of that job. The most enjoyable would be engaging with the other associates there."
good,"Good place to start working with advancement options, granting you have a manager backing you.After one year of working all associates get time off paid. job security is decent just do your job and your good."
good,I would unload trucks and after the trucks were unloaded we would then stock the products in a fast but neat manner. Once all product was stocked we would then go through and condition the aisles.
good,"I didn't mind working there it was fun at times, I was a bag boy and did carts, and I would do whatever I was told by the staff that was above me and worked there longer."
good,"Overall I'll say my experience wasn't bad. Worked my way up from being a courtesy clerk to the many different departments Kroger offers. I will say that moving up in the stores isn't hard but maintaining hours is. but i suspect that is more about the retail environment as a whole than any particular store. I really enjoyed most of my co workers and managers. Every so often you encounter a bad egg but hey that's life. Hopefully no one makes them a career on the retail side but as a part time gig for extra income, you can definitely do worse."
good,I had a great time training and learning about the different departments such as the deli. Produce. Bakery and service desk . Wearing comfortable clothes and good work shoes ment a long day at work with great pay the union that they have will always back their members up.
good,Work with in store employees was mostly enjoyable
good,"Woking for Fred Meyer Jewelers was a really neat opportunity and I took the job eager to grow and learn new skills and as I finish up my first year with the company I am starting to see little room for growth and learning opportunities. The workplace culture is mainly focused on exceptional customer service which isn't difficult for people who aren't afraid to hear No 99 times out of 100 questions. I think the hardest part of the job is balancing all the operational tasks with the selling skills because it can be difficult to always have clear communication between other co-workers, mangers and stores. The most enjoyable part would have to be working with people and showing off our best merchandise and making people special moments even more special."
good,Busy all 8hrs. hardest part of the job was working nights. enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers. most of the employees are friendly. sometimes not enough help to get the job done
good,"This job is probably best suited for someone in high school or for a college student that needs a part-time job. The hours are flexible and the managers will work with your schedule when it comes to classes. As for work envoirnment it is typically either fast paced or extremely slow and there is very rarely any inbetween, the job really isn't that great for anyone that doesn't want a part- time job and they don't like splitting your schedule with other work places. They are also bad about abusing their employee's talents having them work multiple positions and giving them ""promotions"" with more responsibilities without increasing their pay or benifits. On a positive note, they are union which provides decent insurence options for employees that need them."
good,so when I was working at kroger I worked there for 2 years and never got full-time benifits which were better than part-time benifits and I was never offered full when I worked three times as hard as any body in that store. and they gave it to somebody that was lazy
good,I love working for Kroger's it was a good company nice professional managers and bosses nice that he plays quiet no trouble pay well and I will refer anybody to work there
good,your day went fast as you were busy.  you were on your feet the whole shift.  Holidays were very stressful.  Only recommend this job for younger people
good,"I have worked for Kroger for many years, and over the years I have enjoyed my job because of the people i work with. That is still true today. But I just had a baby and started a family and unfortunately, this career is not going to allow me to put my family first if i want to be successful."
good,"I work for Kroger for 5 years. The benefits are good, But you have some managerst with no education not just school but people and how to manage them, IMPORTANT for any manager."
good,"The job is not stressful at all, but the job do not get paid enough. New employees can not start off full time its mandatory part time, the benefits are horrible!"
good,They are customer service focused.  Not many opportunities to get high paying jobs at Fred Meyer. The management has had a high amount of turnover after Corporate implemented a reorganization.
good,Did not enjoy working at my specific store.  It wasn't managed well. They had challenges with staffing and the store wasn't kept clean. Did not have pride working at my specific location.  Other stores looked better.
good,"After working here for 8+ years, I've learned not to allow management to control or walk over you. Believe in what you can do, you are great at your job and no one else can tell you other wise"
good,"Kroger is far from a bad place to work, its just not good either.  Its great to start and get some experience but I would leave after six months to find better."
good,"Great Benefits and a descent salary, but very demanding regarding the amount of time expected to work on a weekly basis. In need of better top level leadership."
good,"I work in the bakery so I learned a lot of new things and there is still some learning to be done. They don’t care to teach you whatever you want to learn and it’s hinestly a good place to work, but for someone trying to put theirselves through college and life I don’t get enough pay or hours."
good,"The experience as a Kroger employee varies vastly from store to store. At one store in frisco I was overworked and my wishes were regularly disregarded despite my history as an above average employee. At another, my manager was very respectful, gave me whatever I needed and helped me with my duties whenever I was overwhelmed. It's a coin toss really, but it's worth the gamble for entry level."
good,This was a typical chain pharmacy position. Everything is the fault of the pharmacist and management would rather appease the customer even if they are wrong.
good,Working there was decent for a first job but after a year it seemed like they didn't really care about your seniority. They barely give discounts and if they do its only off their brand.
good,Very fast paced environment.  Need to be a self starter and up to a new challenge everyday. You enjoy people customers and employees this is a good company to work for.  You will gain great knowledge and experience in the food retail business.  You need to be able to manage people.  Sometime you feel like an over glorified babysitter with some of the employees.  You have the passion to teach coach and train you can make them into great employees.
good,Working as a pharmacy technician taught me how to work in a fast-paced environment while maintaining a positive attitude. Working at multiple different stations throughout the day means being on your feet all the time.
good,The Company is making strides to improve work life balance.   Pros are competitive benefits packages and somewhat flexible work schedule.  The cons are salary structure.
good,I really enjoyed starting off by walking around greeting team mates letting them know that I was there and available to help where ever I was needed I loved it because it gave me chance to get to know people personally.
good,I really enjoyed the customers and they made working easier. If you worked on evening or night shift you had to work alone with no help lifting heavy produce.
good,"Great people until the VRO, they let go all of the seniority in the Technology group. Leadership has changed, some for the better some for the worst. The people care but the Senior Leadership is not tuned in, and live by the oxymoronic phrase of Better, cheaper, faster. Senior Leadership in the Infrastructure space is a yes man, fosters a hostile work environment by pitting directs against one another."
good,Working at Kroger as a Cashier has provided me with great customer service skills and has improved my ability to work as a team in a fast-paced environment.
good,"Hours were ok, management varied, some were good, some weren't. Pay was better than I expected. I disliked it, but didn't hate it. It's a good college job."
good,"Dealing with customers was probably the worst part of my experience, a lot of them were entitled and rude. Maybe this is just something that someone like me is not equipped to handle. My coworkers made working there bearable for the most part but management especially in the Clicklist department was inconsistent. We had 4 different managers in under a year and I could not keep their rules straight."
good,"They were fairly okay about giving enough hours, but are very reluctant to give actual full time status where they'd have to give you benefits. Some people were great to work with but there are a great number of pretentious drama lovers there. All but one of the managers are not very nice people."
good,Quick paced environment that takes certain people to be able to deal with all the everyday customers. All the coupons and just the attitudes of them people themselves.
good,"Kroger is a great place to work if you are in high school, but as a young adult with just a high school diploma it is not ideal.  With the economy the way it is you would have to work three jobs to live comfortably.  If you are trying to attended college they make it appear that they are working with you, but they really aren't.  However, this is a great starter job for any high schooler."
good,The grocery manager's are constantly back biting in order to get one another terminated. Over-all Kroger inns a great company to work for as a whole. Just be mindful of those who want your job.
good,Bagging is simple and running cash register is simple. Stocking Grocery and bread is pretty simple just have to work a little harder. Night stock was in my opinion the best job due to the fact you would stay busy.
good,no work life balance at the company. great benefits but be prepared to work long days and nights. i would recommend the company to anyone that is interested in a fast paced environment; but again the long hours and lack or personal life cause the job to be very stressful.
good,"The top-out pay for a full-time employee is very competitive ($13-$14/hr as of 2017), but if a person doesn't have previous experience in the last 10 years, it takes 54 months to top out. All of the raises throughout the first 3 years are tiny. Keep in mind, this is only my experience, as each district negotiates its own union contract."
good,"people are nice and it's a pretty relaxing environment to work. The scheduling is flexible and tasks are repetitive. there won't be much of raises in salaries but as for a  part-time position, it's a decent place to grab some cash."
good,Not overly exciting just do what you are supposed to and you are fine. Might can get moved to a department you don't want to do. I honestly left because I was thrown at the customer service desk without being asked or receiving proper training
good,Worked 6 to 7 days a week. 12 hour days. Management was good people. They used two people to do three shifts. It was Ice Cream and Beverage so the summer you lived there.
good,Having to deal with many different people and their options could be a little challenging and management could be better. The most enjoyable part of the just is making the customers happy.
good,if you have a decent management team then it's not that bad.  Always join the union so that you can have a little bit of job security. Get a copy of your Union agreement and learn what they are allowed to do and not allowed to do.
good,"no room to grow within the company, no advancement training, but the most fun is the willingness of employees to assists each when it comes to assignment accomplishment, nice and safe workplace"
good,"Crazy work environment, good benefits, really good people, management changed every so often which caused for a lack of good management vs. poor management, chaotic holiday times"
good,"working at kroger for 2 years back in 2013-2015 I noticed the pay was really poor for a store.. paying the lowest wage possible"
good,"The company in the past 5 years has taken a turn for the worse.  Most managers have 0 experience in the company when hired, and little to no experience outside the company beforehand.  Poor leadership combined with the many metrics to measure productivity have taken what should be a very simple job and mutated it into a cumbersome and unrewarding chore.  G"
good,And it was pretty good for a while but then the people there started being shady and all that so I thought it was time for another job really and they did me dirty
good,"days run long, your superiors are also under pressure & will forget about your humanity so voice your needs respectfully. The organizational culture is good on a deep-level because everyone generally shares moods. A hard day is long hours, because lack of teamwork & team building."
good,i enjoy the people that i work with but it can get very stressful because we are often under staffed. We get a lot of complaints about our shelves being empty.
good,Depending on who you work with it was a fun job. Some managers were rude and played favorites to come other employees. The main manager is an awesome guy
good,"Wouldn't recommend if looking for job advancement. There's not much you can advance in. Not allowed over time, not guaranteed hours. Terrible training. Management is okay, lots of drama that isn't needed."
good,"My job duties usually changed from day to day going through cutting/wrapping/labeling cheeses of all kinds to redoing work from previous days or previous shifts, making sure all cheeses were in date and whatever needed to be cut was cut for the planogram to make sure its nice and full each day, check all the cheeses for mold and clean each piece to be rewrapped and relabeled for purchase. Flipping the giant wheels of parmigiano reggiano was the absolute hardest of the job when cleaning them and setting the displays for the parm wheels was almost as challenging as cleaning the parm wheels themselves were. Had to make sure no excess oil was on the outside of the parm wheels to ensure the cheese was not molding at any point in time for the account."
good,"Kroger is not a bad place to work. It can be hectic at times and if you do not have full-time status you are not guaranteed hours. It is a union job meaning that promotions are awarded based on seniority, making it extremely hard to move up in the company. I have applied for every full-time position posted for the past 3 years and have not been selected simply because most people in the company have worked there for 10+ years and are automatically considered over me."
good,"Kroger has amazing benefits but it is retail so you will work all shifts and managers must work minimum 10 hour shifts. If you are an associate it doesn't pay as much as the competitors, however the benefits are second to none. If you have no education it's okay as long as you work hard you'll rise through the ranks very quickly as long as you're young."
good,"I believe the amount of work to what you earn in your paycheck does not reflect well at all. Honestly, there are other competitors that pay 2-3x more to do the exact same work. I wish the ability to move up within the company was more apparent. Also, I think a lot of things could and would improve if the higher ups actually listened to their employees."
good,"There was always plenty to do between consistent cleaning or gathering carts, but the main issue was being stuck outside alone or how easily one could manuever out of obligations, but there gladly there was a lot of diversity."
good,"I really enjoyed my job and it showed. I have always loved working with the public. I gained so much knowledge from working at Ralphs. Working with growers, venders, price integrity and most important great customer service skills. I also enjoyed working on the register. I really cant say anything negative about my job per say. Except just a few flaws in management. The floral department was the first thing our customers would see. How beautiful it would look. I took pride in that. Everyone I always commented on just that. That made me love my job. along with many other reasons."
good,"A typical day is pre verifying and verifying prescriptions, giving shots, counseling patients, discussing  alternative medicine choices.  I've learned how to organize my time and how much of a difference we can make in the lives of our customers.  I manage technician staff, maintain narcotic logs amongst several other duties.  The culture is diverse in our pharmacy but that is what makes us interesting.  The hardest part is sometimes being so busy and dealing with narcotic patients.  The most enjoyable parts are the relationships I've developed and the care I have been able to provide our customers."
good,Kroger is not my favorite job. It is a fast paced environment with little to no advancement available unless you are willing to put in years and years of work.
good,I didn’t get the hours I was promised. And the manager wasn’t very good. She kept cutting my hours and didn’t tell me why. And I just felt like it was poorly ran
good,A typical day at Kroger for a sacker can start as early as 6 am or as late as 8 pm.  Sackers duties range from packing groceries to clearing the parking lot of shopping carts to stocking the registers with bags and cleaning registers.  I learned how to interact with customers.  I also learned how to voice new ideas to my supervisors in a tactful and respectful way.  The hardest part of working at Kroger was not getting intimidated by managers.  The most enjoyable part was interacting with my regular customers.
good,"A typical day of work in Produce is stocking, culling, and rotating product onto tables and wet rack, scanning and marking down product that is close to expiration date, and providing customer service to those around you. I learned a lot about the ins and outs of a retail store and marketing practices. Management is sometimes helpful, but favoritism and the politics in the store can become quite challenging to deal with. Hardest part of the job is working for a company that doesn't appreciate your hard work. The connections you make with customers and staff as well as the fast paced environment make the job exciting and worth it."
good,"Good part time job, learned social skills by dealing with customers. How to manage money correctly. People were really easy to work with and get along with."
good,It's a beautiful store. I learned a lot about how it was ran. A typical day at work I helped the front end of the store or customer service. I also cashiered a lot.
good,"Its a good job if you don't work the same hours everyday I had to work the busiest hours everyday and didn't get my 30-40hrs per week so yeah. It is a decent place to work if you can put up with the management, they are truly horrible. The job is easy but there was a lot of favoritism and some people had to work weekends but a lot of people didn't which I found completely unfair. he hardest part of the job is when you don't have enough help."
good,"For someone with no experience this is a good place to work, it isclose to impossible to advance and as long as this is not your only income you can probably afford to pay bills and maybe eat."
good,"It got really busy because so of the other Kroger are closing that it's none stop work. Its we are always low on stock. Customers are complaining to the cashier about it but there's nothing we can do about it we're not in charge of that, that's a management job."
good,Being a administrative assistant there was challenging to say the least.  Corporate implemented the position but a lot if not most store managers had a very hard to with it.
good,"It is not too hard to advance here, but some people get stuck in certain lower positions for quite a while. However, the initially promised pay raises (every 6 months and upon promotion) were not given to me. When asked about that they said they were changing the policy."
good,i liked working at Kroger because u meet people from across the world and everyone goes to kroger. The hardest part about working in the seafood department was smelling all the great seafood that was there
good,"A typical day for me was stocking, cleaning,and culling mechandise. Management was more friendly than other places I've been.  Workplace culture was one of gossip. The most enjoyable thing about working there was customer contact.."
good,"I came to work here expecting to become a Pharmacy Tech. I took the state exam, and did not pass by 30 points.  The Statlers were moving into another building, and offered me a better job with more pay. Could not stay in the Pharmacy without being certified."
good,"Kroger is an okay company to work at if you're in high school. The management at Kroger is unreliable and exhausting. You get a starting pay of $8.25 unless you have previous experience. If you're promoted to Floor Supervisor or Boothie, don't expect a pay raise. Its not a fairly paid job to have."
good,"Good place for life time employees.  Part time get nothing.  All kids on weekends. People who care and do there jobs correctly,and work hard, are not benefited because the ""kids"" come and go so often with call offs.."
good,"It is a good job for someone just learning what a job is. The supervisors are relaxed and don't supervise much, but the managers tend to be a bit neurotic and don't quite understand the position you hold."
good,"Always do your best ...customers appreciate. Working here has been a time for me to develop into a better individual. As well as afforded me the opportunity to meet a vast variety of people.which allows me many positive relationships. Which i did not have prior to being employed here. There are mant in store perks for employees like stickers from customers, who like your service, a added ty is always a plus. And my co workers are nice,which makes for an iver all good day. The one thing im dissatisfied with is the hourly rate of pay, if not for it being low, it would be a fun atmosphere to work in."
good,I was able to learn a lot working there and they gave me an opportunity to advance in my field. I was able to build friendships with some of my customers.
good,very fast paced the management was ok but we had some issues but over all great company to work for great environment and the pay was fair will always recommend this job
good,"worked with different cultural people "
good,"Kroger is willing to work with their employees, however the wage paid to front end employees is not enough."
good,I would have to get carts and clean the bathrooms and bag customers grocery's. My favorite part was see wonderful and happy customers. I enjoyed helping people there.
good,"Some managers are great! A few need to retire now. I don't understand why so many requirements for ringing out customers. (Items per minutes ) when to ask for Kroger card ect."
good,"Kroger is a great place to start off, if you're looking for your first job. They pay every week, and are flexible with your schedule if you go to school."
good,"Fast paced and heavy load of work.  Goals almost unattainable and compensation had a ceiling that after years of service the employee would hit and then never receive even a COLI.  Kroger does not believe in COLI, only merit."
good,Lack execution in administering company culture. Long days and hours. The diverse group of people you interact with makes the job enjoyable overall the company invest in training their people.
good,"Good communication with management as well as fellow associates. Finding hours is hard with given position since there is limited work to do. Pay is reasonable, and work culture is good."
good,Hours are all over the place. Job security. Sometimes have to work 6 ten hour days per week. The employees for the most part are hard working and caring.
good,"Typically, a pretty stressful environment between the overreaching demands of both customers and management. It was a daily challenge to maintain work composure with both the physical and mental demands of the job"
good,"Krogers  was a great store , but I would recommend a better staff. It was very organized and always kept clean. There were problems with the time clocks. Customer would leave very satisfied and some would not. The lines moved at a fast pace. some associates were very helpful to customers, including myself."
good,"Kroger is a very fast paced job. You'll mostly work alone which can be overwhelming during a rush, which could lead to stress. I recommend this job to high school students in need of a part time job."
good,"I worked here for over 15 years. I started at the very bottom as a bagger, and I worked my way up to a frozen food department manager. Went from $5.45/hr to $18.85/hr over the course of almost 2 decades. The culture is likely decent, if you like retail, and don't think very hard about your job or have much better off friends to compare with. Otherwise, it can be a very frustrating experience. If you are a good worker, you'll often find you're saddled with doing not only your own job, but other people's jobs as well, because competence is not a prerequisite for working here. Maybe it's just the stores I worked at, but somehow I was always surrounded by demoralized and demotivated people, who usually seemed to be on the verge of burning out. The pay was generally adequate, although due to changes in leadership I managed to have a 9% paycut the one year from the company cutting back on overtime. So definitely don't count on overtime at most stores, and if you seek a department head role or managerial duties, get ready to have to deal with incompetence and overwork, as well as being overburdened if you do well."
good,A good place to move from Mission Apartments in change shift based on your lifestyle they also had the opportunity to come and has fire a refresher courses along with sending you to the training center to perfect your skills
good,One of the reasons I disliked working at Kroger's is the fact that it is seniority based. It is not based on how good of a worker is but how long they have been there. I found a lot of co-workers sitting around chatting while on the clock. I even walked in on an assistant manager sleeping in the office.
good,Went in looking for a part-time job for high school and regretted it. The employees were great but management was terrible. They never communicated with other staff other than those with higher positions.
good,My time there was good.  It was a good part time job while I was in school.  It was a great place to learn my communication skills.  I would recommend this as a good place to work.
good,They dont train new people very well and the baggers are under paid and treated bad and poorly the restrooms arent cleaned right cause half the people who work there are not trained right
good,"The Kroger deli was good to work, but had its issues. Weekends needed more people to cover the department. many of my co-workers called out several times a week. Overall it was OK job and atmosphere to work. No room for advancement."
good,"For me the issue was that I had to leave and come back to get more than a 5 cent raise after being there for more than a year. There is a pressure to get everything done and set in your department by 9am, but, they don't allow enough people to come in and work the morning shifts to get it done and when its not done you have three or four different managers lecturing you on how to do your job instead of letting you do it. "
good,"A typical day consisted of taking calls for Kroger Pharmacies in order to assist patients with renewing medication fills, insurance changes, and checking to see when medications would be ready."
good,"8 hour work days "
good,"Kroger is a starter job that is a job but you would learn that getting an education is important. Associate's or Bachelor's Degree. No pay raise, could not move to another section of the store, promotion. $7.25/hour."
good,"the workplace was very stressful due to many customers. there was very little teamwork and an unfair management system. for example, the people that were friends with the manager never got in trouble for slacking but those who weren't didn't get so lucky. Many customers were rude, and the pay wasn't quite as much as I would have hoped given the many responsibilities I was given as a courtesy clerk. The hardest part of the job for me was dealing with the customers, because many of them were very rude. the most enjoyable part of the job was collecting carts from the parking lot because it was extremely rare that you had to deal with customers. I learned how to be more tolerant of people through force. all that being said, I did enjoy working there because I enjoy work."
good,Got to me loads of new people and made lots of friends. The work environment was nice and laid back and the management was that bad in my opinion. My co-workers were very friendly
good,"I got weird hours there and didn't get full time hours. The management was not good. I worked there a long time ago, so it has probably changed since then."
good,Working for one of Kroger's grocery chains was an overall decent experience.  You get out of your job what you put into it and there is constant repetitive work.
good,"The day would start by checking and cleaning the bathrooms for the customers.  Then we would bag groceries for customers when needed.  And finally, we would collect any and all shopping carts from the parking lot."
good,Being in this company i got to see what happened behind closed doors per say. I didnt agree with the way things were run and i also didnt agree with the way staff was treated
good,"did my job daily , enjoyed working with the public , steady work environment , good coworkers , safe work place, good equipment. enjoyed my time there,"
good,"High turn over rate, when I worked I had to quit because of a lot of work place drama, they're pretty fair to employees though about flexibility with school and other programs, but once you pick a shift its the only one you get."
good,"Health care benefits are great. Lots of room for advancement. friendly work environment. Inconsistent goals, makes some goals unrealistic.There is no work life balance, 50+ hour work week. Management compensation to comparable jobs are relatively low.  You are allotted 3 weeks vacation but company makes it difficult to take time off."
good,Its not a job you want to do your whole life. I'm just working here while I go to school and my manager is really good at working with my schedule. Seems boring most of the time. Can get busy though.
good,It is a good company to work for.  The stores are always looking for help.  There is many different kind of jobs.  There are stores almost in every state.
good,The pay was not great but the opportunity to advance and the benefits were worth the stress. Managers are under high pressure so there is a lot of trickle down anger.
good,There was a lot of tension in the department where I worked.  Everyone was fighting for hours.  We had to go to other departments for hours.  The people were great.
good,"a typical day at work consist of facing product on shelves making sure product is visible to customers enjoy helping customers find product. i work with stock people when they need me. management"
good,Prefer not to say. Current employee not impresses with management and some associates not treated fair. Not impressed with the Union. Starting salary too low
good,"I have worked for Kroger Stores in a span of five years. I worked as a cart pusher, cashier, grocery clerk, and as a produce clerk. I believe that I was not getting paid fairly, but I could always get my part time hours without any problems."
good,I helped people purchase food for their families. I learned valuable skills for relating to difficult customers. Management generally left us to our own devices as long as the job was done properly.
good,Never know who's in charge and most of the keys are grumpy older folks or get too amped when its busy and cause more issues as well as being rude to customers. Not terrible if you need the job though.
good,"It didn't start that way, but we've constantly been understaffed. Flexible hours are a good thing, but they jump around too much. Co-workers can be fun to work with."
good,"although the pay was low when I worked there. The group of people that worked there were great. It felt fun to go to work with people who were genuine and just wanted to love life,"
good,It was a good job to have maybe not for someone who wants to be full time and make the money to raise kids. All in all it was an okay job. It just just sucked not having a set schedule
good,Managers are great but it was the employees that needed to be in check. Kroger also has an issue with promising its employees yearly raises. It is unfair that we work very hard and are treated like we have no value.
good,Management needs to communicate better with others. Pay is too little. Good work goes unrecognized. I like being able to do my job without having to take care of other positions.
good,"Stay very busy in the deli department.  Sometimes had  to run whole deli by yourself.   Staff was helpful.   Have a credit union can get discounted movie and trip tickets if needed."
good,It is slow stock up product. Or either put away products that arrive in the morning so it can be easier for the mid shift. Clean the coolers at night.
good,In the three and half years of working with this company I enjoyed working there. I was able to take leadership and was able to learn how to place orders and check in vendors.
good,It's not the worst place to work. Management is awful; seems like the least qualified get promoted. Those who should get fired don't because management is too lazy to go through the process to fire them.
good,Department management was unreasonable trying to schedule highschool teens (i.e. would schedule shifts for obvious times when kids had school) and overall inconsiderate to employees regardless of work ethic.
good,"great place to work, good benefits, even for part time employees, great employees there, easy to get along with, and working with. will be gald to work for kroger again."
good,"I overall liked working for Kroger's.  The only exception, is the pay is not well.  Not all, but, some supervisor's act like a child.  No appreciation for the work you do.  They absolutely hate for anyone to have overtime.  The union rep does not do his job, and some management will not back you up."
good,TLC should work to improve their diversity among fulltime providers. They lack diversity and culture growth. Management very focused on procedures rather than the customer
good,"a typical day at work for me is to make sure all the product is stock, neat and scans are perform before the customers get in the store.Its very important to me perform these duties everyday while working in the frozen department."
good,"I do not have a knack for retail work. I have been shunted into three different positions, and didn't really enjoy any of them. However, I learned how to work hard and manage a schedule. We have a relatively nice break room, good benefits, and ok pay. The hardest part of the job was dealing with middle management; conflicting demands, constant unannounced rule changes, and a lack of consistent enforcement caused a lot of misery for those of us caught in the middle. Fortunately, we have great customers who are patient, kind, and full of gratitude. They were my favorite part of the job."
good,Not working for Kroger Corp I am unable to give a viewpoint of their company or how their employees view them. I think they run a very good and profitable company.
good,"Meeting people was the greatest part of the position of cashier.  I found it hard on a person's body, but you adapt to the environment.  You try to give the best help and assistance you can give."
good,"The wages aren't very competitive, more often than not the management and supervisors treat lower level employees poorly. Co-workers are basically the best thing about working here."
good,Kroger is not a bad place to work at all. The only problem is I was terminated because my fiancé had a miscarriage and it cost me my job. In my opinion they need to learn that family is going to be important to everyone in this world.
good,Starting pay sucks compared to competition. departments are often understaffed (90% turnover in our district). Too much focus on friendliness of employees.
good,you get aid weekly and the union has its benefits but i fond it hard to get accomodation for real life events that work interfered with. also most of the management i worked under gave most folks a hassle for things that werent even work related
good,"I worked front cashier, breaks were not always on time as scheduled, the new management did not provide for transfer to different departments as requested.  The managers expected for a cashier to stay overtime, as they told you and did not ask if you were available to do so.  The workers were great. I learned customer service, how to run a cash register, and work self checkout.  The hardest part was the difficult customers wanting something that was not on sale for the sale price. The best part of the job was people that I worked with and the customers that I met.C"
good,"Good to work for a successful  company and reliable income with benefits.  I feel that Kroger as a company is highlyfocused on the needs of the customer how ever ,it really is about the number and corporate directives."
good,Working at krogers was very stressful and filled with alot of drama. The department head managers did a terrible job with communicating about things and making the schedule. Krogers do have really great associates.
good,very satisfied with the way the company work with your schedule. people there are real nice and the overall atmosphere is very nice and we all work together and have get the job done
good,"If you start early in life, you can grow in the company and develop a good career. Chance are thin you'll ever get rich working here but you can develop into a good living."
good,There were many opportunities for advancement but those promotions came with little to no raise. The job itself along with the management team were decent
good,"I had worked in 3 different departments at my store, and have talked to other Kroger employees around the state and it seems to be the norm that the work is average, your coworkers are nice, but upper management tends to either not know what they're doing at all, or they pick favorites and use everyone else as a scapegoat."
good,"Working at Kroger/Ralphs is not a difficult job. However, days can be stressful, long, and customers can be rude. "
good,Working at Kroger's was ok at first.It is a job preferably for teenagers or someone who won't work for longer than a few weeks.Bad management with no communication.
good,"Having spent over a decade at the store, I saw it slowly but surely decay from a spectacular place of employment to a place I didn't really feel comfortable being employed in. Understandably, when they stripped the tile floor, slapped some paint colour on it, and then polished it to call it good was the first indication that cutting corners clearly was their new 'in thing'."
good,"For the most part, it is a decent place to work but some of the managers could care less about their employees. So it's a little discouraging. I do enjoy the atmosphere and my co-workers are awesome. I just wish that my manager would be a little sterner because some of my co-workers leave early without their work being done and calling in every week."
good,good Company just no work life balance at all. you have to be all Kroger every day and there is some stores with more days off than others for the same pay.
good,A typical day at work was cooking and preparing the case for the day . I loved meeting people and getting to know my customers. I learned so much on how to manage a deli.
good,"Very easy, always enjoyed coworkers here. Problem with the place is good or poor work is treated the same. There's no reason to work harder than anyone else, pay raises are given out only based on how long you've been there."
good,my experience at kroger wasnt the best but that has a lot to do with where i started in the company joined as a deli associate and my department manager wasn't good at her job long story short i left the company
good,"It was an OK place to work at, but there were too many issues dealing with scheduling and a couple of tasks that went wrong and made me feel too uncomfortable."
good,"Fine, required to work in many places,"
good,"I like how the people will stick together for any situation. But it is difficult if you can not handle rude customers or work for long hours. For the most part, it is an average call to work until you have wanted you to need."
good,Kroger is a decent employer and a preferable choice in the grocery industry. The variety of jobs within Kroger is quite broad and as such is a good choice for entry level work.
good,The Kroger I worked at had issues with management. There was constant confusion and chaos with orders and item management. You have to be fast and cannot sit down. Expect to work with many laid back teenagers.
good,Anything could happen at anytime. There were too many close calls with the electric pallet jacks and the forklifts. I never truly felt safe there. I effectively learned how to stack the boxes onto pallets to get the most I could in an order. The hardest part was keeping up the pace while you felt sick in the cold parts of the warehouse. Most workers did seem pretty helpful if you needed it.
good,it was a good college job. it helped pay minimal bills and provided spending money. worked inconsistent hours and pay was minimal required for college budget.
good,"Being full time college and part time working was not hard to balance, however the store always seemed shorthanded and always demanded that I come in on unavailable times. I felt very pressured to come in on my off days and it wasn't a part time job anymore in which I was not able to accommodate for especially during midterm and finals. Other than that, my job was a decent job to have had for alittle side money."
good,"The main problem, or hardest part of the job I had working here was the difference in management styles.  There were so many managers and they each had such different styles and egos that I found it so annoying after a while."
good,It's fine. I have a lot to deal with but I manage. The hardest part is dealing with people your age or older. It's like an adult day care but I'm making the best of it.
good,"Didn't enjoy my time here, found myself very bored. Couldn't wait to get home, and fought very hard to motivate myself to get up and get to work, did it anyways."
good,"This was a fun workplace and you get to meet lots of new friends. However, if you are a hard worker you are more than likely expected to do everybody's job. While being a closing cashier there was hardly any help from my department."
good,depending on what time of day you clock in the day can start out slow or fast. if the store is busy they will forget to give you a break or a lunch. They will tell you they will get someone to take you for a break which they usually forget until you ask again.  The hours are flexible as long as you change it ahead of time
good,"I started here when I was in high school and transferred when I went away to college. I went from bagger to cashier to customer service to floor supervisor to bookkeeper and only saw $8.00 an hour the entire five years I worked there just hoping for a change so I could stay. No luck so I quit. As a beginner job it is great, and it did teach me a lot and give me a lot of experience. Worked well with my college schedule and offer scholarship help too if you do community service and volunteer which is very enjoyable actually,"
good,"In this Kroger store there was an apparel department, I learned how to color wheel clothes and set up displays, the most enjoyable part of this job was a great diverse workplace."
good,"Typical work is the same thing all over again besides when it is hot, what I learned was to treat customers with respect even if they give you attitude and that the customer is always right even if they aren't"
good,Well first they placed me in a position that I didn't apply for and out of the kindness of my heart i filled in somewhere we're that they needed me at the time. I didn't receive the proper training to be left alone then when they did get a lead he didn't know what he was doing so I had to pick up his slack and do my job when the times I was given I couldn't finish my daily job.Also the management doesn't even know sometimes how to write a schedule much less when there employees are coming in.
good,Poor compensation for company expectations. No positive feedback. Not many opportunities for growth in the company.Favoritism plays a major role in promotions.
good,"The year I spent there was horrible, management failed to fix many issues and simply spent money on things that didn't need fixing, as well as hired many unqualified employees who were either fired or who simply left, leaving big openings in the work schedule. The pay isn't worth the position either, and after a full year of working I got no more that a $0.10 raise while working meat and seafood."
good,I found out just how creative I am by working in the floral department  I  actually like doing it. Management is not best therefore the store suffers.
good,However if you have no seniority good luck finding more than 15 hours a week at minimum wage. Its a good company to work for and the benefits are pretty good but you have to work for a year before you get benefits.
good,Can be high paced and opportunities to move to other departments are good. Met a lot of nice people in the community. Some flexibility with work schedule.
good,"Good Bandits. Yearly raises not so great. Annual bonus payouts were unfair."
good,"Very stressful and not very good with keeping things in control. However, the job itself was easy and very nice as at points it was fast pace and other points it was slow pace. It was very physically demanding but most of the time it was ok."
good,The workload was easily manageable however being paid minimum wage for the amount of work you had to do was ridiculous. The management was decent but you were often required to help with other departments because most people quit from the pay grade
good,"Days as a front end utility cleaner / janitor are stressful. Pushing carts, cleaning bathrooms, changing trash, and doing whatever management tell you to. Some days are better than some, others are more stressful (i.e. around holidays where you cannot get anything done)."
good,"write sales budgets, customer complaints, payroll processing, over bearing executive leadership, staffing concerns, 10 hours work days (sometimes longer), career advancement, nice compensation, great bonus potential, strong union environment."
good,"Front end is fast paced all through the day, cashiers and baggers will be stressed out. If you need money desperately they will hire you and keep you. They offer very flexible scheduling and a lot of unpaid time off."
good,Walking store to make sure different task are met in every area of the store. This starts on the parking lot and ending in the back of store. Assigning task daily/ hourly to ensure freshness and quality.
good,This job had its ups and downs.  I was a member of a union and strongly opposed it.  My typical day started usually between 2pm and 3pm and usually ended at 9pm.  I was a closer responsible for the normal customer service as well as the end of the day closing procedures which largely consisted of a lot of cleaning as well as customer service.  There were periods in which unreliable people were hired that made my job more difficult.  With exception to the store director for my first year and half the management team handled situations the arose as best as they could or were allowed due to the union.  By the end of my employment there I had stopped taking classes and was ready to find gainful employment.
good,"Depending on when I come it, the speed of how the day will go. I learned a lot of skills that kept the department clean and how to clean product. Also, I learned many ways to communicate with different customers."
good,Store manager was completely rude to a customer just because she waz trying to get her money back for met she had bought that was already spoiled and didnt have a kroger card. That happened on the day i went in for my interview which was also my hire date.
good,was my first job out of school did whatever they asked me to do from cashier to stockier to beggar and had different hours and did not have a car so I miss a day of work and was let go
good,"Would come into work and be greeted by other co-workers. Learned how to use the cash register, interact with customers, how to bag groceries, use the Western Union to send money, etc."
good,Your enjoyment of this job is entirely dependent on the people you work with.There were some days where i loved my job because everything went smoothly because the right people were there. However when those people were not around the job went less than smooth.
good,"Definitely a great job for high school students that just need experience to get a better job elsewhere. Moving within the company was rare. Hiring degrees from outside the company was common. I was a high school student teaching the assistant manager how to do his job which was very frustrating. Management is a great combination between some of the most caring people and the sketchiest people. At the time, there was no chance of raises for working hard, only a very small scheduled increase."
good,Upper management has a huge disconnect with the store level. The company hasn't shown much improvement with how they treat their employees. It's been a long 14 years and I've seen so many things and have been treated like absolute scum.
good,"Bad training system, had to mostly learn through trial and error.  Shoddy management.  Decent employees.  Hardest part of the job is dealing with management, but I do enjoy socializing with employees."
good,"Kroger, I would say, is a great first job for teenagers or just about anyone who needs a job who can't be hired elsewhere. Most of the managers are very nice and try their hardest to respect the exceptions and standards of every employee."
good,"I love my job, the environment, the the different type of people I get to meet everyday. Also, the fact that we work as a team to get things done around the store, and making our that we are keeping our customers satisfied. i Just feel That Kroger should pay their employees a little more. Other than that, I love it."
good,"An okay company to start off with to gain experience, but the right company to have a career with. There are some good days and bad days. The co-workers are very nice and fun to work with."
good,"The customers make this an enjoyable place to work. Managers are willing to help in any way (most are). The only issues i can see with this company, or stores, would be the atmosphere. at some points you have to watch what you say to who you say it."
good,Job was easy but not enough hours to work. Benefits were excellent co-workers were easy to get along with.Overall morale of store was very low not a good atmosphere.
good,"Management can be rude , working in the bakery can be fun the co workers are easy to get along with . It would make a good first time job . It's a good place to work"
good,Everyday seemed like you were always rushed to do the best job you can.  The experience I learned was good to begin with.  You'll need a lot of energy for this type of job.
good,"Managers mistreat their employees. Employees are under paid. When I was a curtesy clerk, they told me that I had no benefits after my first year was over and curtesy clerks didn't have benefits."
good,What can I say you work for a grocery store.  Its union.  It was terrible.  Most of your employees were lazy.  It was just a good job if you never graduated high school.
good,working at Kroger gave me the experience to deal with people throughout the city and building my customer service skills along with communication skills
good,"Not much time to do this since I have to be to work there in about 1 1/2 hours...I am a Cashier and Deli Clerk so I can get more hours. I am only making minimum wage, which I am not used to or happy with. They think you live there, and call to have me come in all hours, which I do, only because I need the money. The people are friendly, Management has been good to me. Too bad their pay is lousy."
good,The managers are rude. The coworkers are very friendly. The customers are rude. The prices are wonderful and so is the company itself. But the people working for the company is not so pleasant. If only we could change the emplyees to the managers that'd be great!!!
good,"come in read the bored to see what my goals are for the day , after make sure all cashiers are ok and don't have backed up lines. I Learned that not all jobs are the same some of them have come in goals and some have goals you go along."
good,"Pretty good place to work, flexible, pay is less for more work, management was good and others were terrible; hardest part of job was no benefits; best part interacting with different cultures."
good,"Day would usually being in evening with checking the floor to make sure it was stocked.  Then, we would receive shipments from the back and bring it to our freezer and sort it out into the correct locations.  After, we would continue to stock the shelves."
good,"We almost never have enough people on-hand and need to grab people from other departments for sacking/cashier duty.  Schedules aren't consistent and you'll probably be called in for emergency help anyway.  There are roughly 4 managers at any time, so there isn't any consistency from week to week.  Still, it's nice to make customers happy and help people save money.  Easy access to the store's clearance sections makes it easy to save money on groceries, so that's nice."
good,"Kroger Technical Office In Blue Ash, Ohio is fond place to work though it is very tough for me as I have to commute form Maryland to Ohio every week."
good,Working for this company was a great start for Myself it gave me the experience I needed to move forward in the work place. I learned great cash handling skills great customer service skills and how to work with a team to achieve the goals of sales
good,"I love working with my co workers. I love the benefits that we have, but I don't like the messy rumor around the store or lazy people that don't like to work"
good,"The department I was in was always understaffed, so there was always more to do. Attempting to keep up with demand was a challenge that was always rewarding when accomplished."
good,One has to be able to keep accurate records and have great verbal skills. I had the ability to meet a lot of people and prevent a lot of merchandise from being stolen.
good,It's a great place to meet new people. It's very fast paced and constantly gaining new employees. You get to connect with all types of people from all over.
good,I liked my coworkers and I had fun there. It is a lot of time on your feet and a lot of repetition which can get boring. Management weren't the nicest of people but if you did your job well they weren't a problem. The employee discount is great.
good,Honestly I don't think I ever spoke more than 10 sentences to my manager. It was very clear what I had to do on a daily basis. Very standard. Nothing much to report.
good,"A typical day at work is dependent on time of day and day of the week, as well as any major happenings such as School Start, School End, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Superbowl, lunch, dinner, etc."
good,"working for Kroger was a good experience, I would deal with customers on daily basis, I would also promote new and signature products, and assigning shifts to the rest of the employees within my department."
good,"It is good place to work, especially for cusotmer service, and willing to work with students and their hours. However they do play favorites for certain employees."
good,"I worked at night, and all I did was get the loads of food and items from the back, bring them out to the floor, and stock them wherever they belonged."
good,The scheduling is pretty inconsistent form week to week but the management is alright and fairly flexible with employee needs. Some safety aspects of the company could be better addressed.
good,Working for Kroger is ok untill you get new management that does not know what they are doing and make your work place unconformable and against all the complaints the bad management still lingers. Yes untill that happens its ok provided that your regular customers are not a handle to deal with Kroger is ok.
good,"ok work place, raise every six months, hard to advance or get full time, not to many advances, management does ok with off days unless its around the holiday."
good,"Always counted on you to do your job"
good,"Ok placed to work, but hard to advance much without seniority. i advanced from register fast, but once i got that advancement that was it, it was hard to advance any farther"
good,"I had a lot of fun when I first began to work there, but with all of the coworkers there I felt like I was just dropped in a crowd and forgotten about until you cause a scene and speak up about the job you were promised apon hiring. I was told that I was going to be hired as a cashier and that I can make it up the latter fast If I stuck to it, but as soon as I got hired I got put as a bagger and a cart grabber. It took them almost the entire time that I worked there to finally start training me as a cashier, but by then I was done with that job."
good,"This job was exactly what you would expect from an average summer job. I needed to earn money so that I would be able to focus on school during the semester, and I think Kroger did an ok job of providing what I needed. The job was boring, mind- numbing, exhausting, and unappreciated. The staff were hard workers and good people."
good,"Was a good first Job experience. Not something I'd want to make a career out of.  Pushing carts was probably the worst part about to job, regardless of the weather."
good,"i love the customers that come in. i love that i get to meet a lot of new people. there are lot of good and hard working co-workers. i talk to customers everyday, i also help restock and clean everyday."
good,Recently they changed management and the place has gone downhill. I have been getting less and less hours and the tasks that they have me do are simply busy work.
good,"Typically we are very short staffed, and we are working to serve our customers with great customer service, and always giving great satisfaction! Our managers do not always thank us for our tasks that we complete, we are always suggesting new ideas, and helping customers out with any questions they may have!"
good,"Can be dull, or upbeat. Depends on the amount of customers. Poor hours, and no connections with co-workers. Usually poor care. Bad bathrooms. Basic Job for those who need one until they find a career. Terrible communication. Bad vegetables. Poorly managed. 15 hour guarantee of work per week, I only got 8 hours one week. It's not worth it, but It's as basic as a fast food restaurant."
good,Mismanaged liked nothing I've ever seen. Worked here for over a year and no raise still minimum wage. Scheduling is odd they use a one week schedule instead of two. Perk you get paid every week and the people in the Kroger are salt of the Earth wonderful.
good,"Good Strong company.  Work/life balance is rough, 60 hours plus per week.  Average work week 6 days and several turnarounds with only 5 hours in between shifts per week.  Management is tough but fair.  Fair compensation and benefits."
good,"While I enjoy what I do there is little to no room for advancement within this company. Unless you are a favorite of management your work is rarely noticed, but expected to continue to perform well. There is no succession planning and an old mentality that if I teach another my job that I will then be out of a job."
good,"If you are looking for a starter job then kroger is for you. I have worked there for 3 years and I've already been promoted to department head. Though you MUST show that ""can do"" attitude in order to be considered for said positions. I have learned to deal with the toughest of customers and managers and I'm glad to have started out at a kroger for my first job experience."
good,"Kroger overall is a good place to work. The employees help each other out to make the store a good place to work and shop. Management is okay. They help when they can. Kroger maintains to stay busy, but there's not enough help to check out most of the customers."
good,"A good starter job, good benefits, but pay is minimum wage and only 10-15 hours a week with no more than 6 hours every other day."
good,As a courtesy clerk my job allowed me to learn how to move at fast paces along with gain social skills by having to assist customers
good,I feel that the store I work in really seems to care about their associates. Every year we are treated with Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner. I enjoy working with a variety of people on a daily basis.
good,"In my opinion, this job sucks for how much you're paid. Co-workers are nice but way too many expectations for minimum wage- considering there's the fact that you have to bag people's groceries exactly the way they want, push carts into the store, clean up various messes around the store, along with ""chores"" if you work later than a certain time. I think it's silly that cashiers get paid more when they have WAY less responsibilities than us, and if you have cruddy management you'll probably stay at this position. We stand at the end of isles as long as cashiers do, and move around much more often, but we don't get a mat beneath our feet like they do. If you've never experienced customer service/grocery before, it's a great start, but only a START."
good,"While being a Mariano's i had to open up my drawer and count up money before i started my shift. I did not have any problems because time would pass and you would have fun getting to know the customers."
good,"This is a good place for a first job if you only need pocket money. Definitely not a job for the average person to keep for life. Compensation is bare minimal. Managers don't care about you, just that they have the timeslot filled."
good,Learned about working in an union based job. Hours were unreliable and management wasn't very understanding or helpful.
good,the work is actually fun but they are unforgiving of mistakes and they give very little training. Which wouldn't be bad except they want you do do jobs outside of your job description then they get mad at you for failing to do something you weren't trained to do.
good,"Great place to work, however there is a level advancement system via computer in order  to move  up within the company. Sometimes time does not permit the computer training."
good,"No benefits until being there for a full year, they were nice enough to keep me full time hours, but pay is really low. They are super flexible with taking time off if you need it."
good,Managers always come and go. Store policy constantly changing. Weekly pay is really nice but sometimes doesnt feel worth it. it is easy though. There are a lot of politics in my particular store.
good,Very challenging job that is rewarding at times. The organization is very focused on improving the customers perception of a pleasant shopping experience.
good,"-decent place to work at"
good,"working at Kroger was OK I've worked in worse places. being a courtesy clerk was easy just took some common sense "" don't bag bread and bleach together. being a meat clerk was far worse i was never given proper training. i had more injuries than anyone else in the department because i was never shown how to do anything when i asked for more training i was told that i would only be shown how to do anything if i walked on someone else doing it. The problem with that was i was night shift and i closed by myself so there was never anyone to ask when i needed help. when i went to the head of the store he told me to suck it up and start cutting the meat. It was a vicious cycle i eventually quit caring and quit."
good,Basically if your not busy stocking merchandise then you may be dealing with different customers who have different needs.
good,"Poor Executive leadership. The company has great goals, but puts focus on the customer over its employees as an excuse to drive revenue. Associates are overworked and under paid."
good,"great company to start out at. Hard to advance or move up in the company. fun people to work with, great management. good benefits."
good,"Good benefits,  good numbers of off days, equipment pretty streamlined threw out the company.   No real start time, get your work done and go home. Pour comunicate on threw out the company. Departments are segmented, and do not comunicate.  There is more concern on what is not done, than what has been done."
good,"A typical work day consisted of lifting items up to 50 lbs, retrieving items from the freezer and dealing with customers with a positive attitude and efficiency. I learned very valuable trades including proper scheduling, customer appreciation, how to properly treat coworkers, punctuality and various other important retail trades. Management differed daily so responding and treating each manager with respect, honesty and integrity was key to maintaining a healthy work environment for both my coworkers and myself. My coworkers also varied due to the high intensity nature of the job, but communication was essential regardless of who I was dealing with. The hardest part of the job was balancing school and work, along with the fact that their were various disagreement surrounding my wage and raises. The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with customers and building friendships with some of the long-standing employees."
good,"Come in at midnight"
good,"When I joined the company, it was a little daunting but I soon settled into an easy routine.  Everything was great; and then management started coming around more often.  Nothing is ever right for the store managers, though the comanagers are often very cool and easy to get along with.  That said, hardly anyone ever gets promoted and almost everyone leaves within the first year, year and a half."
good,"While working at Kroger I got to experience actions of people in a work place for the first time as an employee. A typical day, for a courtesy clerk, is very busy. The job requires a lot of movement and time management. I was forced to learn how long I needed to be inside helping customers as well as how long I needed to be outside gathering shopping carts. The management can bee seen aiding the staff as well as working with the customers. Seeing them actually aiding in the work is both surprising and amazing since I never really saw that in most stores unless there is a problem. All of the other employees working there also kept themselves busy with there work but will find time to help you if you ask. The hardest part of being a Courtesy Clerk would have to be task managing. The courtesy clerk is needed inside the store and outside the store, so it can be hard going from one area to the other in a short amount of time especially when someone finds you and tells you that you are needed elsewhere. The most enjoyable part about the job is seeing the customers leave the store with a satisfied smile on their face. When customers leave the store with a smile on their face then everyone knows that the day is going good. Overall, working at Kroger was a good opportunity and it is a good place to work."
good,"5 out of 10. lack of hours, bad upper management, and hard to progress on the job. The moral of the stores employees are always low, even when upper management thinks they are doing something to boost moral. This is for store 49 only, other store have different management and other ways of doing things."
good,"Must greet the customers and provide excellent customer service by responding to the customer’s questions and requests in a courteous and helpful way. Must also stock various meats onto counters, prepare customer orders and keep them on account. Maintain a healthy and clean work area."
good,"I have learned many new things working for Kroger, many things I did not know as a shopper. Most days were the same, I would clock in, clean my work area before starting my shift, and make a mental list of things that I would have to do for the day. Members of management were kind to me, my co-workers were average workers, some days were good and some weren't but that's everywhere you go. The hardest part of my job would have to be finishing others jobs before I could begin my own work. I would have to say the most enjoyable part of this job was learning new things."
good,Standing on your feet all day. a lot of repetitive work. Very hard to get on full time. A lot of heavy lifting. Very fast paced.
good,The employees are great! Management expects a lot of each department but refuses to hire more people. Typical workday will go well with no problems or overbearing managers until big bosses arrive. Then they will try to talk to you any kind of way. If you call the union sometimes they won't put you on the schedule or tell you to go home.
good,the staff was very lack luster in their approach to their employees and  customer service. wasn't the best place to work.
good,You can take pride in your job because you know that it is making the store look better. Management helps to make sure that you know what the details of your jobs.
good,"A typical day at work isn't bad , it gets really busy at times not a lot of cashiers are present so one line would be open and there would 5+ customers. At Kroger I learned how to communicate better with individuals. My managers weren't as nice as my Co-Workers supervisors were AMAZING. The hardest part working at Kroger is having 10+ customers in your line with no baggers your time would be outrageous. The most enjoyable party was the breaks after a very long day./"
good,"It is an ok workplace, they work with your schedule and the benefits for working inside the store are great but if you work in the fuel center you do not get health insurance."
good,Can be a decent place to work yet can be too stressful for the lack of pay. Benefits can be decent but not being able to move up in postion can be an issue.
good,"I really enjoyed this job, I liked what I did and was good at it. However I started to get sick, and while I was trying to solve issues and trying to get FMLA but before that I was sick at my desk and had to run to the bathroom. Instead of seeing me as sick and throwing up, I was seen as being away from my work station. this was not the first time, and later found out that doctors notes didn't cover absences. I was also told to it's better to come in sick and get sent home. Which is exactly what got me fired. So basically it's a good job as long as you only get sick for one day at a time. People I worked with with were always helpful and it was a good environment. I hold no grudges against co-workers. I believe management just has a bad attendance/sick policy. I would like to work there again only if my job felt safe."
good,"Smooth morning , love setting up cases. its great to hear my customers comment on how my case looks great and fish looks fresh"
good,"Kroger is what it is. All the management is grumpy because they realize they've wasted their entire lives working for a grocery store. All of the employees are either high school kids with an attitude and a lack of common sense or disabled vets. "
good,"I work usually a 8-9 hour shift almost every night at the Kroger store in Ohio and if there is one thing I learned is that nothing is every constant. Since I have worked here I can say that the store is always moving in different directions which can be good and bad. I have nothing really bad to say about this job except that I wish I made more money. The hardest part of this job is the changes in strategy you have to have at any time. You will never have the same day, day in and day out there will be a new challenge."
good,"Depending on department your job can vary. Over the span of two years I worked- Meat Department closer, Seafood closer, Seafood opener, Meat cutter, Meat Packager, Meat Stockman, Bagger, Checker, Nightclerk, Night stockman, Utilities and grill master for events."
good,"Working at Pick N Save was a great experience. The managers I worked with cared about employees and customers. Some days would be busy and fast paced, while other days would be slow. I've learned patience working there. The hardest part were the rude customers but having those times actually helped out a lot to learn different problem solving techniques. The most enjoyable part of working at Pick N Save was the fun events we would have for the customers, especially for the kids."
good,Everyday you see different faces helping new people out and some of the same faces which is always fun meet new friends and enjoy the location.
good,"Good luck working here and trying to put gas in your car! My starting wage was $7.45 an hour, and after fighting tooth and nail with the management, I was finally able to get ALMOST 33 hours a week. You will NOT be treated as a human by management. You will NOT make nearly enough money to supports yourself (very important to a young 20+ year old trying to live independently), managers will literally clock you out at 39.99 hours (if by some miracle you get that many) just to make sure you don't make it to 40+ hours. l learned how to use a bandsaw but that's about all the is to learn, since there is NO chance for advancement unless you sell your soul and 50 years of your life to the company."
good,A typical day at work would be my lazy coworkers barely doing anything but the customers were always nice and I enjoyed putting a smile on there faces just like they did for me rather they were having a bad day or not. I've learned to work the register and cope with bad attitudes and smile through it all. Out of all of my managers only one of them were really nice and understanding. I didn't find anything hard about my job. The most enjoyable part of my job was making sure the customers were satisfied.
good,"Work with the day to day operations of the business while coaching your associates. Dealing with customer concerns are a must. "
good,"Kroger is a decent place to start out and get job experience but should not be anyone's goal. Coworkers often expected more of new employees than they should, or tried to push their own work on employees. Little recognition of good work but quick to judge bad."
good,"Ive been at krogers for almost 3 years, haven't had many problems its just underpaid, definitely not everybodys dream job. I like my coworkers. Being at Kroger I learned how to use the handheld to scan items to tell if we have it, and how to make markdowns. The management is okay, I see there are favorites I haven't had any issues but from my coworkers I always hear stories. the hardest part of my job would be the physical of the work. Ex: Pulling, Pushing, Lifting, Bending, Reaching. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with the customers, making them happy to say hi, and answer any questions they have, and finishing the goals for the day."
good,"A typical day at Kroger is pretty simple as a cashier, you get straight to work because its always busy in the store. You find a manger and they tell you which register to go to and you stand and work for in the same place for 4-8 hours. What I learned about working at Kroger is that there are a lot of opportunities to advance within the company. Management varies to store to store, overall the mangers are pretty helpful with questions and overall are willing to aid you with anything."
good,"Easy to find a job that suits your skill-set and career opportunities are made available, but turnover rates with entry-level employees can be very high. Salary and benefits for full-time employees are good, but your experience will vary widely based on the location and leadership."
good,"fast-paced work environment, lots to do and never enough people to get it done, they constantly call you to the front if you know how to check on a register so you can't get your work done"
good,"I have learned that it takes a person with a manager-type of mindset to work in the kiosk. For the majority of the time, while working as a fuel attendant, the employee will work and handle any problems that may arise independently. Calling to speak with a manager or supervisor should only be made as a last resort. "
good,Staff was great and getting paid every week is a good thing. I love my experience working in the Kroger community. I would recommend people to work here as a first job.
good,very mirco manage - very budget control.. a typical day is busy and then next week will be calm. i have learn to use a lot different terms and the the corp office is great they have a of engaging with employees
good,"I love Kroger's, they are one of my favorite stores. To me, we don't get paid enough for all the hard work we put into our job."
good,Stack pallets with product all day. Wrap it and put the right store number and shipping labels on and stage it at the correct door to be loaded. I learned how to be efficient being on a time schedule for each order on top of stacking a pallet so that it wouldn't fall over.
good,Management was rude and ungrateful. Kept pushing without any help. Good place to learn customer service and basic work ethics.
good,Overall it's a good work environment. It was a great experience as far as learning good customer service skills and learning how to interact with all acts of people.
good,"I was lucky enough to have a great manager for the Deli, but there was always a lot of drama. Along with not many places to move up in the company."
good,A typical day was always the same.  We bagged food and pushed carts inside.  I learned to socialize better and getting along with other people.
good,"I worked for this company for 2 years. Starting as a lowly meat clerk at minimum wage. I took extra training and learned to be a butcher and how to order, and how to lead my department in case of the manager's absence. My reward? A 10 cent raise. I worked as a butcher (very dangerous job) and some days as a manager for 8.25 an hour. Ten cents more than MI minimum wage for the time. This company will take advantage of you, tell you what you want to hear, and never deliver on promises. You will never move up, just add responsibilities at the same pay and title. It's ok as a first job. Just don't get caught in the trap."
good,"I personally do not have a problem working here, my motto is you treat me with respect you get the same in returned. My only problem is that the starting pay is not good, not even for students. they feel that you should work hard and get the job done no matter what and be lucky they hired you. once you reach the pay limit that is it, you could be there for 20 years and still make the same. This company loses a lot of good people because the pay is not good. The hardest part of the job is trying to hold on to good people, but the most enjoyable part is making friends."
good,"Mellow atmosphere and great co workers and team members"
good,"Work was either you are really busy or bored out of your mind. "
good,"A typical day is clocking in and checking to see where you'll be stationed for today. What I've learned working for Kroger's is that its important to have product in proper area so that customers can have easy access for their purchase. Management was very reasonable, respectful and laid back, very easy to get along with. My co-workers were very helpful and friendly, enjoyed working with such a helpful team. The hardest thing about the job was trying to locate product was not on plan or is no longer being sold in the store. The most enjoyable thing about my job would have to be my co-workers, got out worked and had fun doing it."
good,"I learned how to engage with customers professionally, mentor others and train customers in the operation of the website and informed them on products and services to increase customer loyalty."
good,"It is a wonderful place to start your employment. Training was not properly done, but the job was not difficult to understand."
good,"Overall department (food, apparel, home etc) managers are great, as is the store director. You couldn't ask for better people to work for. Individual managers within the departments (ie deli, bakery, meat) are horrible to work with. Will throw you under the bus to appear better to upper management. Very frustrating because they have a more significant impact on your day to day work life. "
good,A wonderful company if you are looking for relatively quick advancement. The sacrifice in advancing so fast is making Kroger your new way of life. I worked 70hrs the week of Christmas. Including the night of Christmas. I also worked the whole day of Thanksgiving. I very often worked 14hr-16hr shifts. It takes a toll on the body and mind.
good,Took care of customers. Made sure that they got what they needed. Checked them out fast so that they could get on with their day. Helped other departments during down time. Cleaned my register made sure it was stocked with supplies need through out the day. Helped other cashiers with questions and bagging for them until I got a customer to wait on. Counted in and out my registers. Assisted the  front end manager while they was on break by getting the calls for them. I got along with almost everybody I work with.
good,"Unorganized, in the worst location, too much drama, front end management was not professional, area is awful, there was a lot of stealing going from customers and employees"
good,"This is a great entry level job to start off with, there is also room for growth and achievement. The hardest part of the job is working during the holiday rush."
good,"Management could do much better"
good,"A frustrating place to work. A great lack of communication between upper and lower management. A typical day at my level was consisted of stocking shelves, coordinating with management, delegating tasks, unloading of trucks, ordering products, building displays, maintaining a 5S standard."
good,This company has good benefits with a demanding work culture.  The holidays are very busy like any other business.  The management has seemed to improve.
good,"This was a great place to work at as a student. The hours were great, however it was depressing to work 2:30 to 11 every weekend night. After some time, I was working to 11 on school nights, even though I was underage at the time. Management could be a lot better, and better pay could attract better workers."
good,Everyday was another challenging. It kept me on my toes and constantly learning. Hardest part of the job was the hours 24/7 365 all the time with little to no down time.
good,"Kroger to me, feels like a job for people who needs part time work for awhile. its hard to get promotion at Kroger. its a stand still job to me."
good,"ok place to work. Bakery is easy and fun. they teach you how to bake. everything is already pre made, you just put it in the oven and bake it. Co-workers are friendly, managers are nice. Hardest part of the job is probably the customers. Theres always going to be a rude customer. I like working here because its fun."
good,"for me it wasnt so good, not alot of communication with managers but it may fair well for someone else but i didnt last to long there."
good,"I enjoyed the variety of daily tasks given to me. I learned how to order new product on a BOM. My co-workers were not as friendly as they should be, but that didn't effect my work ethics. The hardest part of the job was balancing being up all night as opposed to working afirstt shift schedule."
good,"I have learned a lot while working for Kroger. I learned that I must come in ready to work every day and on time. I learned that hard work is very much so expected, and anything less will definitely not be tolerated. I have had a great time with many coworkers, and I have also noticed a tough time with over-all morale."
good,"An okay place to work, you learn ways to talk/help customers. "
good,"I have been with the Kroger company for 8 years, and have never had any issues until I came to the store I am in now. I used to really enjoy my job, as it is not the worst place to work. I was able to advance to the position I am in now, and have had nothing but problems and grief from the management at this store!"
good,"My first paid job, so I can't complain much. Co-workers are/were friendly. Ended up doing Full-time work for Part-time pay due to hour cuts."
good,"The workload isn't bad, but if they see you are a good worker, they exploit you for everything you are worth. You are expected to work 110% at all times, and criticized if you don't. However, there are no ramifications for being a slacker. In short, there is no accountability whatsoever."
good,"Strange hours, Some people are great to work with some not as wonderful. Overall not a horrible job. Takes someone with an attention to detail."
good,"Working out in the fuel center was all around terrible. "
good,My fellow associates and most supervisors work together and help one another out to improve and maintain a positive work environment. The management staff don't know how to operate self check out properly or a cashier effectively so it makes it difficult to ask for help.
good,Kroger was a good starting job i had while in highschool. worked there for about a year and made good friends that worked with me along the way.
good,"an average job for high school and early graduating students, pay is minimum wage and management is extremely laid back. co workers are usually friendly and the hardest part of the job is getting your body used to all the germs and some peoples' attitudes."
good,"come in at 6am and make sandwiches, keep my work station clean. Make sure everything is set for the morning people to come in. Make sure I have enough sandwiches made for the evening and night since no one comes in after me to do sandwiches."
good,"A typical day is busy, the work day is ok. most of the stores are fairly easy to back into but there are some that are tricky. I attempted to learn how to stay out of trouble with management. Riverside management is very over bearing upon the drivers always looking for some one to write up."
good,"Working here isn't so bad, all though the management tends to have horrible communication skills.  It was a decent job to start off at as starting out working or college student"
good,Satisfying Work Environment that kept me working hard. Pay was less than adequate and position offered no insurance or benefits. The actual work itself was challenging and allowed me to interact with customers.
good,"Stable work place."
good,"I worked for the Kroger Company as a courtesy clerk. "
good,Good starting out job.   Pay was better than minimum wage and union medical benefits are realy good.   Union kind of got in the way protecting bad workers.
good,"Kroger is a great place to work, especially if you're looking to acquire your first job! It was mine! I enjoyed working with the younger employees and getting to know the new ones. Awesome managers that work with your schedule. The only problem I had and still have, is that its very hard to advance as far as pay. I worked there for over 2 years and when I resigned I hadn't even reached $8/hr! This may not be a big deal to some, but you just cannot make a living as a college student making $7.65/hr. I feel that Kroger could make their employees feel a little more appreciated and increase their willingness to work, if they paid better. If that was the case I'd still be there, because that grocery store has a great atmosphere."
good,"Working here was okay and great on some days, just clocked in and started your day. Greeting customers, taking care of all of their needs, and I learned customers always come first, and you need to make them happy before anybody else. The management was alright to a certain extent. Co workers were cool, well some of them. Most enjoyable was working with customers."
good,"I overall haven't had a great experience with Smiths.  There are lot of advancement opportunities and options, good benefits, and great compensation.  However, I have had lots of difficulty with lots of management.  Co workers are great, corporate and management is very difficult.  Employees are treated like theyre replaceable."
good,"Got to explore multiple departments, and department head when people were on vacation. Co workers easy to get along with and everyone was easy to work with"
good,While Kroger is a good place to have as a first job the store I worked at is not the greatest for long terms. It showed poor communication and little respect between employees and though management skills differ between the four managers; the store manager does not have the best kindness toward is associates. It was a decent enough place when I started out but I have seen associates get in trouble because they were unable to make it to work because of an accident or a car that has broken down. There is also way to much gossip that occurs in the workplace and unless you are a BIG suck up you are highly unlikely to move up in the job. There are some decent people in the store and when I first started one of the co-managers was awesome and supported the associates but he was later transferred to another store to many of the employees disappointment. Unfortunately the store I work at hasn't shown very much compassion or understanding to those who have lost family members or gotten injured and couldn't do their job. I have seen associates forced out of a department or fired because someone else wanted their job or didn't like them. I have seen a head of a department set up by one of hi co-workers because the other wanted his job. I have seen those who should be fired get a better position because they are buddy buddy with management. It is great as a first job for me since I was looking to get experience. They gave me a chance but I wish to work in a fair environment where I can make a career. The hardest part of the job was when they had me going back and forth from night shift
good,"- depending on your department you may have an easier time than others, as some jobs are more physically demanding."
good,"This was my first job and for a student in high school this is a great way to learn the workings of having a job, earning, money, and proper work place procedure."
good,On a regular day we are a busy store and you can not let negative people bring you down because it will make your work day worse.
good,"Pick n Save is a great place to start out in the working world. The stores have job advancement to a certain point. The upper management changes frequently, which can stress out the long-term employees."
good,depends on you store location and management. pay sucks. insurance is okay after 1 year. easy to move up in the company if you are a well like person
good,"Good job, it was steady somewhat only worked 2 or 3 nights a week. But bad once you got in its like me and my other buddy working was the only ones working. Pay was horrible thats for sure. Never certain schedule."
good,"My typical day would've been helping a customer find what is need and that their service to their satisfactory. "
good,management is o.k they forgot what its like to be staff. staff is incredible. wages are lopsided depending on department. bad union
good,I loved the people I worked with. Everyone was always trying to make the work day as fun as possible while still getting everything we needed done. The management was terrible though. All they care about is how to make more money. They don't care about your opinions.
good,"Kroger is not a bad company to work for, only real thing is the pay just isn't exactly what I'm used to. A typical day at work is not bad, the customers are great and my coworkers are great. I've had better much better management but I've also had worse. Nothing about being a cashier or a floral clerk is hard, I'm actually glad that I got to discover my creative side while working in floral."
good,"The was a good job to have as a teenager, however there was not any space for me to grow or excel in this place of employment."
good,"Working at Ralphs has had a big impact on me. It exposed me to dealing with people of various personalities and how to deal with them. Whether if its the co-workers or the shoppers, you need to know how to adapt and to be able to think on your feet because of its fast-paced environment. I have become more wise and feel more confident in how to work for a company and be a asset to them. I put a lot of hard work into my job or anything that I do and that is something I wish to always carry with me throughout my life."
good,I do a store walk and check on what departments I may need to be in to help. Then I write notes to myself so I don't for get. I check in with other members during the day and with my management team and we go over any problems that need to be taken care off. I work my day and make sure the store in is a good place before I leave for the night
good,"Taking calls from angry customers regarding Kroger related issues. I have learned how to deal with rude people and stay calm. I also learned how to navigate through several computer programs. The management  listens to your concerns, but rarely takes action. The turn over rate is very high. So I'm able to meet new people all the time. I enjoy helping the customer who appreciate what you have done for them. It gives me a since of satisfaction.  The pay is below average."
good,"Kroger themselves is a decent company, but the call center portion is a nightmare. There is no job security, let alone any compassion or understanding. I did enjoy talking to the customers that came in over the lines. It was really the only thing I loved about working there."
good,"My typical day was to come into a very hectic work day and having to catch us up on all the backed up orders."
good,Checking out customers who purchased groceries. I was no longer shy after working at this job and that wherever you come from in the world we all want the same good things for ourselves and families. Management was good and spent time with all employees. I liked the diversity and many age groups of my co-workers. The hardest part of the job and the most enjoyable part was the interaction with the customers especially the regular ones-their good times and bad.
good,Decent job to have as an after school job or a job to have while your in college. If you want to grow with the company you have to know the right people
good,I have currently been with Kroger for ten years and I have learned a lot but the management is very one sided and plays favorites. This company is good as far as job security but they dont like paying you overtime and if you are not full time its almost impossible to get any kind of steady hours.
good,"Typically, a day at work involves running the customer service desk or running the fuel kiosk outside. When we happen to be fully staffed, everything runs fairly smoothly and depending on what shifts you wind up with depends on how busy the desk gets. Weekends tend to be pretty busy store wise while weekdays don't see much traffic until beyond about four in the after noon. The hardest part of the job is when we have a few frustrating customers but it's not all terrible. The most enjoyable part of the job is the co-workers. Everyone i have acquainted myself with is very friendly."
good,"Typical day at work would be greeting customers and ringing up their sales, always keeping a smile and leaving a positive experience for customers. I have learned to work much more confident under pressure and work efficiently while multi-tasking. Management was not the best but I have always kept myself positive for better opportunities moving forward. Pay was not the best even though many customers clearly see how kind, honest, helpful, hard working I have been for the company. Having a not so good pay motivated me even more to complete my degree and pass my pharmacy tech board exam. I would say the most fun part about the job is interacting with people. Especially the ones that come there frequently, it feels like a small circle family."
good,"based on cost of living, a new hire will not make enough to live on their own. however, the health benefits are very good and fairly inexpensive."
good,This is a great start to get into the workforce.  Moved up quickly into a position to where i could do more inside the company.  Also learned a lot about structure and food with being in the produce department.
good,Learned how to use hand-held RF. Challenged myself finishing work loads which varied. always different people to work around made job fun.
good,Kroger was fast pace at times which made the work day go by faster. I learned how to really handle money working there. Management was very helpful and willing to answer any questions with no problems. The work environment was positive for the most part and my co-workers were easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was adjusting to the computers but I soon mastered that. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and engaging with customers.
good,"Bakery clerk duties are split into three categories. You have bakers, cake decorators, and merchandisers. Bakers bake all of the goods like bread, cookies, pies, and breakfast items. Cake decorators take care of cake orders, gourmet cases, strawberry product, and the cake case. Merchandisers break down frozen deliveries and fill the floor with thaw-and-sell items. In most cases, you will be responsible for all positions in a given day. To work in the bakery, you will also be required to be trained in the deli (deli is not required to be trained in the bakery.) "
good,"The job itself it simple but time consuming, quicker if you have good hand-eye coordination. Some managers seriously lacking in communication skills, others excel. Co-Workers good people, though a bit disgruntled at times. Hardest part of the job is getting everything done on time on high traffic days of the week. Most enjoyable thing is generally laid-back environment."
good,This job was nothing more then just fun because of the people I worked next to everyday. Everyday it was hard to deal with all the customers that cam in the store.
good,low pay with bad mangers who point and blame sales and over stocking on goods if you cant sell your back stock low wages no raises
good,Overall Kroger is a decent place to work at if your fine with a retail environment. It was a decent job while I was going to school and there is room for advancement into management once you finish school.
good,Wonderful staff.. Although was highly bullied by my department head and nothing ever came of it. Overall staff is great though and a great family enviroment
good,"Well managed company"
good,"Kroger distribution center was extremely hard work. The benefits and pay are pretty good. I drove a pallet jack around and picked orders and sent them to store around Ohio,"
good,"Greeting and serving customers is the best part of my job. Management really don't care about their employees at all. This job is for students only, you can not pay any bills with working with this company. Other than that its a great place to work! the environment is sooo welcoming and the food is amazing considering its prepackaged. The customers and the co-workers keeps the peace."
good,The franchise could be renovated and still needs to be renovated but the co-workers overall were OK. The hardest part of the job was when headsets in the drive stop working when we head to
good,"When I was hired here I was only 16, they paid me the ""under 18"" minimum wage and they required me to pay the Union Fees even though I didn't work enough to be part of the Union and I was too young. I was also told when I was hired that they would work with my band schedule, but that was not the case. I kept missing work due to band being graded. They also would give me almost 30 hours a week to 12 the next week. Very inconsistent. My co-workers were like family to me there and the job itself was not hard. It was a good first job and taught me what it was like to work in the ""real world""."
good,The work is fun and keeps you on your toes. You meet a lot of really nice customers and develop a great friendship with them!
good,"A typical day at work would be gathering carts,bagging groceries,servicing customers.I learned nothing.Management was too hectic,they have like a million people who are ""managers"".Coworkers are non friendly.The hardest part of the job was carts.Most enjoyable was a 10 percent discount."
good,"standing all day, 2 15 minute breaks but no lunch break, how to deal with the general public the good and bad; great coworkers, being able to help people every day."
good,"Product merchandising, ordering product, customer service, coaching fellow employees, and time management were some of the skills I learned working for Kroger.  over the years I worked some great managers as well as some managers that I believe didn't know what they were doing.  my fellow employees were great I have worked with people that are just earning a pay check and others that applied themselves.  The demand to get as much done as possible with the least amount of employees would be the hardest part of the job.  Working with the customers, going up and beyond for the customers, seeing the reactions on there face when you give them the best customer service is the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"Very demanding job with a highly demanding schedule.  Pay was decent, however due to the work schedule, it was just too hard to enjoy the fruits of my labor."
good,"Management only is concerned about customers not staff, very diverse company, potential to move up quickly, very secure job with the protection of the union, typically a fair job, wages are low"
