rating,review
bad,Closing Down.  Reorg due to bankruptcy. Moving all operations to Houston Texas.  No solid information as to who will be offered a job with the newly formed company.
bad,"Field employees getting fewer, workload getting very heavy, lots of overtime. I am getting very run down with overtime and working conditions. On call rotation comes around too often, and too much area and equipment to take care of ."
bad,last couple years employees in NM have been neglected and then sold. used to be a good company until the bankers took over and were more worried about money  than employees.
bad,"I wouldn't recommend anyone to work in the California area. No help from management. Once you get laid off, be prepared for phone calls asking for help on how to do the work you no longer do."
bad,"Management is disrespectful, rude, don't provide things they have promised. At a moments notice you will have to go out of town. They do not provide the training that is promised.  At the Louisiana office if the manager doesn't like you he will do everything in his power run you off. No one in that office will have your back. So if you join that office keep one eye open. Don't count on the measurement management either."
bad,When Linn came out of bankruptcy with hedge fund people on the board the culture went out the window.  There is no defined future for the company or the employees.
bad,"Was one of the most enjoyable jobs I've ever had, but became one of the worst job experiences of my life. "
bad,Great wages and benefits until a series of bad business decisions and the drop in commodity price forced a bankruptcy filing. Coming out of bankruptcy included being forced to cope with a new board of directors who know absolutely nothing about the oil business. They are only interested in lining their own pockets with money.
good,"Linn Energy for the most part is a decent place to work and they have a great out look for their employees. They have great benefits, vacation, and rotating weekends. Great place to learn multiple jobs in the same work area. Management could use a little work with communication but other than that not a bad place to work."
good,"was fun when Linn was on top but management was greedy and sunk the company, lied to employees"
good,"The best thing about LInn is the Flex schedule. They offer a 9/80 work week and the company is closed every other Friday. I've learned a lot about the oil and gas industry. Its hard to move to other departments though, they don't post open positions. The managers just bring in who they want for the job. Not a good practice."
good,Some preferential treatment was given to select groups when considering promotions or merit increases.  Flexibility in work hours  or working remotely varied group to group.  Required Management training could be beneficial; mentoring is not very evident in most groups.
good,"The people here are good to go to learn new things, they help when help is needed, Linn vaules and the respecting other and doing a great job."
good,"Linn started out to be an exciting place with a great business model.  Somewhere management lost sight of that model and began to make not so sound decisions which in turn caused the recent layoff."
good,"Grew too fast.  Market fell which cause it to bankrupt.  At first things were great.  Linn Kept buying more properties and expanding it's portfolio, however, when the market fell, it couldn't keep up the pace.  It folded."
good,"am allowed to work without being micromanaged.  Work flow is easy and productive.  "
good,High paced fast environment. New tasks to always keep your self entertained. Good management but it's hard to get efforts recognized. Teams are not very well organized.
good,"Was a fun 6 years, but I feel like they were trying to do too much with too little. The equipment we worked on was built in the 60's and we worked 12 hour shifts all the time with zero compensation."
good,"A typical day at work for myself was used to help out anyone and everyone I could between all departments to increase the efficiency and training among the LINN team. My coworkers were wonderful, but it was evident that management did not always appreciate the individual members contributions.  Over time with layoffs, work (as it should be) got designated to individuals daily tasks, but unfortunately the compensation wasn't trued up to account for these extra responsibilities - hence the lower rating.  I truly enjoyed working for LINN because they feel family comes first and there used to be a great small company feel to it, which over time has started to fade a touch."
good,I felt management was working too hard to overextend the company into bankruptcy to the detriment of the employees and assets.  The benefits were good and pay was reasonable.
good,"Overall it is a good company. Slightly unstable financially. Although compensation maybe distributed unfairly, overall pay is good. Offer decent benefits"
good,"It’s a great company to work for truthfully, I’m just looking for growth and the fear of our industry failing makes me want to take cautionary action to ensure my future is taken care of."
good,Limited career opportunities.  The bankruptcy and subsequent downsizing of the company made this even more difficult.  Many benefits were cut around the time of the company's bankruptcy and were not reinstated when the company came out of bankruptcy as a new entity.
good,"This is a small O&G company that is struggling like a lot of other small companies.  I love my team, both manager and team mates.  We work AS A TEAM to find the best solution both for the asset and the company."
good,The company culture is great. It is a laid back work environment that keeps you busy all the time. However as a contract employee I receive no benefits or compensation or any of the above so it is time to move.
good,Stayed on property when ExxonMobil traded lease with Linn. Company has great benefits package and match my wage. The relationship between supervisors and operators was lacking. Linn doesn't train their employees like Exxon did.
good,Rapid change and associated integration strategy proved flawed when the industry economics were downgraded.  Great culture and great people.
good,"Great place to work and I love the environment. People are nice and friendly and they have great benefits packages. so great.............."
good,Good job possibly should not have left but I was offered a sales position with high earnings potential. Also work tends to be pretty boring on a day to day basis
good,"Great place to work as long as the Oilfield market is doing well. Management was quite laid back and unassuming. Our roles became service oriented in respect to the field teams. Quidance, direction and company automation policies were ultimately dictated by the local technicians which left room for big improvement and differences across the wider spectrum."
good,"I think they need a more aggressive attack at handling some issues, but overall laid back and nice environment."
good,"I have the freedom to do what  I want but there is a definite hierarchy that cannot be penetrated.  Its difficult to express your feelings or be paid what is fair.  they take advantage of people who dont have a complete knowledge of the industry.  There isn't a real sense of teamwork.  Besides the negatives, it is a very comfortable place to work.  MOST people are easy going to aloof.  there is a constant work load and there is job security because there is always work to do."
good,The company went bankrupt and the company was sold.  Linn Energy offered career advancement and was a good place to work up until the industry slowed down a few years ago.
good,"A typical day at the office consists of reviewing title and leases for issues that may arise in potential drill locations, typing correspondence, proposing wells and calculating interests. This job has given me an opportunity to explore several avenues of the oil and gas industry exposing me to regulatory, division orders, lease records, and right of way. I enjoy my co-workers they are dependable and reliable and always willing to assist in extra work loads, questions, and learning experiences. The most difficult portion of the job is the flexibility, constant changes in the drill schedule means that you have to be able to switch gears very quickly sometimes causing reactive behaviors rather than proactive. The aspect that I most enjoy is that this is a very wonderful work environment, the people genuinely care about one and another and it is a family environment. Also, the work is challenging and different each and everyday, keeping you on your toes and constantly learning."
good,"This was to be an eye-opening, new experience and getting me out of my comfort zone. I've never traveled or been away from my wife and family for so long at a time. It turned out to be the best step forward I've made. I learned to be independent and more self-supportive. Plus it worked wonders on strengthing my marriage and life at home. If Linn could have survived the oil and gas struggles of 2015, I might still be there working today. I was offered a full-time position, at the end of my contract. As of today Linn files for bankruptcy protection in 2015."
good,"Company promised a lot, had some great plans that ultimately failed. I do not regret my time here, i truly loved my job. I just hate some of the corporate decisions that were made."
good,"I enjoyed my job at Linn Energy however due to the industry decline my office was closed. I would have relocated if the option was available. The benefits and work schedule were excellent, as well as the opportunity to learn new skills."
good,"Company was heavily engineering based, and supporting individuals with other degrees was difficult, limited growth possibility within the company."
good,"My day is very diverse - never know what might come up. I have learned a lot about the industry, from regulations to hands-on training in the field. Management and my co-workers are very kind and respectful. The hardest part of my job is the inability to plan my day, but that it also one of my favorite things about my job.  I enjoy meeting planning, making travel arrangements. I also enjoy distributing my charitable budget each year and planning our group volunteer day outing."
good,Got a long with co-workers. Had some good times. Go to field office and download computer data. Then check well and batteries and figure production.
good,"It has competitive salaries and great co-workers"
good,Good Company. Nice benefits and work life balance. I had worked with several good people in and out of my department. The company also encourages you to go and pursue higher studies and support financially.
good,"has great company values, motivates employees to perform to their best ability, provides opportunities for personal and professional growth"
good,"Monitor overall network health, Install, Maintain, decommission network equipment.  Provide support to 50 field offices."
good,"Challenging and fun work environment that helped me grow as an engineer and an individual. Worked in Traverse City, Michigan."
good,"They provided lunch and learns to enhance knowledge with great opportunities for growth."
good,"I transfered to their Oklahoma City office in 2010 as an Addministrative Assistant III for the Geology Dept. Then started working in Petra and Smart Section. Scanned logs and started making maps."
good,"2008-2014 overall, good company culture, compensation, flexibility to learn, working with other departments on different process improvement projects."
good,"I felt like working with family, every one was great to work with and people respected your ideas. I learned how to optimize wells by calculating formulas and load factors."
good,Great place to start a career in oil and gas. Must work a lot of overtime
good,"I loved my Linn Energy family, so sad that it ended in bankruptcy.  I would have loved to continue my career with them.  It was a great atmosphere to work in."
good,I definitely was paid for the work that I did. They thought I was a hard worker and I was good at what I did and they acknowledged that daily. I enjoyed it because they were understanding of life circumstances and were kind to their customers.
good,"it's a good place to work, IT implements current technologies in the industry. Good managers, and good workplace culture. Most employees have their own office."
good,Linn is a very fun and nice place to work.  I assist all types of customers from the CEO on down.  The most enjoyable part of my job is assisting my customers with efficiency and quality to resolve their computer issue quickly and painlessly.
good,My short time as an intern at this company was pleasant and educational. All of my coworkers were all helpful and friendly and the management was awesome.
good,This is a great place to work. Very knowledgeable and friendly staff at the Houston office. I learned a lot from working here.
good,"As I'm a contractor I have nothing much to say about all the benefits they give. But it is a nice place to work."
good,"Great place to work, fun workplace and wonderful group of people."
good,Linn Energy offered 9/80 schedule which I loved so much.  All employees get every other Friday off which help us to plan for our vacations a lot easier.
good,"SR/VIP desktop support"
good,"Great place to work if you are a full-time employee. Good work-life balance. Management values its employees. "
good,"They give oppurtunities to advance, help each other in the field, enjoy doing things together"
good,"I have worked at a few different oil and gas operating companies, and Linn Energy is the most moral and family oriented that I have worked with."
good,"I loved working here, until bankruptcy set in.  Things went downhill after that.  The new board was more worried about money than the employees, and it used to not be like that."
good,"This was an excellent job that unfortunately was eliminated due to the sale of a portion of the company to Four Point,  I enjoyed the work environment and the employees."
good,"drive to work check over 60 wells 8 batteries, the mangement is great i have become really close friends with my co-workers. the hardest part is having to fix all the old wells and keep everything running in hard times i enjoy working with my hands and teaching other people what i know."

good,The busy environment was great to be a part of. The management was supportive and great to provide guidance. They provided tools to make certain you could do al aspects of your job. The support and technology was an asset.
good,"they went bankrupt"
good,"We worked 9 hrs a day with every other Friday off which was great.   The management for the company and for our office were trustworthy, fair and great to work with.   My job consisted of many administrative responsibilities like production side of the oil & gas business like entering oil, gas, & water gauges, checking oil run tickets,  regulatory reporting, ordering supplies, setting up food for meetings, communicating with guys in the field,  keeping up mileage for company vehicles and some filing."
good,"During my employment with Linn Energy we succussfully completed dozens of acquisitions and integration of employees, teams, cultures, producing property, inventory, vendors, and fleet. "
good,Linn was a average company to work for compared to the other companies I’ve worked for they were always concerned about how things were going and I always had a good relationship with my foreman and  superintendent
good,Great place to work. Flexible and rewarding. Management is very supportive and believes in team. Does not micromanage. Provides department needs.  Great coworkers.
good,Work and personnel were great. It was always a day of hard work.  The management was good.  We always helped each other. We worked as a team.  We communicated well and worked well with contractors.
good,I was contracted to Linn Energy through Wood Group.  It was the best Job I have had.  They were fair and very good to me.  I hated to leave.  But i went through some family troubles and had to relocate to Oklahoma.  But I give them 12 out of 10 stars.
good,"Daily checks of production of oil and gas wells are conducted. If issues are discovered with production adjustments are made to increase or correct production.  Production numbers, oil production in tanks, gas measurement through SCADA & charts and potential equipment are checked daily"
good,"Linn was a great place to work.  Knowledgeable coworkers, fun work environment.  However with the selling off of assets and reduction in force, the future is not healthy."

Management was great to work with as everyone was available to help when you had questions or a problem. Co-workers were a good team to work with, helpful, and a large knowledge base to draw from. The hardest part of the job was moving from contractor to company consultant.The best part of the job was showing up to work with a group of people that enjoyed their jobs as much as i enjoyed mine."

good,LINN Energy was overall one of the best companies I have ever worked for. The people are very accommodating to working families. The compensation packages were phenomenal and benefits were amazing. I miss working for LINN but had to leave to further my career in other states and further my expertise. If given the chance to work with this company again I definitely would.
good,The people communicate well and are great to work with.  Management is very involved with field operations and construction.
