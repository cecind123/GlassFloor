rating,review
bad,Be careful this is the only place i have ever worked where you are rewarded for telling tails on each other and rewarded for not working  or sleeping on the job if your polish it's ok
bad,"First thing company did was to Lay hard working employees off.  People that had been there for years.  All the while buying new office furniture and plans to re-do the. Obviously not employee oriented."
bad,"Flowserve hired me knowing from the interview that I was in school to finish my degree. After I was hired I worked for 3 months and was able to continue with my school to finish my degree. The branch manger that hired me left the company and a temp manger was assigned to the location. I was then informed by the temp manager that. Flowserve does not promote or support their employees attending school while working for the company, which I found questionable due to Flowserve having a tuition reimbursement program....... I ask to be put on a night shift for 4 weeks to finish a class then I could continue my education and work without my school interfering with my work schedule. I was denied. I reached out to the HR to see if there was something we could work out. I was told no. So I had to resign. After leaving another worker who worked In Same department was attending a school to finish his degree. From my experience I had had with company he thought he had to leave because Flowserve refused to work with me on my scheduled informed the company he was going to resign so he can continue his education. They offered to move him to a different shift so he could work. Flowserve discriminated and does not treat their employees fairly. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this company."
bad,"Very unethical, had a medical issue and was hospitalized. Was terminated because had a serious medical condition under fmla. Terminated immediately . Now since termination I have no job."
bad,Company tried to build itself as being 200 years old when in fact it was build of a couple companies that can trace their heritage to 200 years but Flowserve has only been around since about 1995. The quality of the products continues to decrease and if this does not change Flowserve will be broken up
bad,Don't waste your time. HR is useless. They pay their employees peanuts. The company wants everything for nothing and they will lied to you so get everything in writing.
bad,"I worked as a Business Analyst at Flowserve and to sum it up it was unorganized, the leadership is horrible, everyone in the IT team is scared to lose their jobs. I did not even get formal training on the applications I was in charge of as the former employee would not train me and everyone else on the team was clueless. No documentation was ever created about our applications and our programs and softwares are so old it poses a security threat. This is a fortune 500 Company we are talking about and I worked in the world headquarters. it was embarrassing."
bad,"find somewhere else to work, life is too short! If you like to polish rear ends this is the place for you. Skills mean nothing and the raises are meaningless. there was always some excuse to stop your bonus"
bad,"Horrible place to work if you actually work. If you are lazy and don't care about doing your job right, this is the perfect place for you. Management punishes the hard workers while the union allows them to. Union officials will protect the lazy people at all costs. People tend to play the race card quite a bit here too. Does not make for a very productive environment.  Routinely scheduled 50 to 60 hours a week to correct other workers mistakes while they get their weekends off. No work and life balance. There is no chain of command to correct any of these problems. Management pretty much looks out for their bonuses and not running the business in a fair or profitable way."
bad,"Sneaky co workers, unprofessional leads. Manager bias decisions, they never listen to the small workers.  Too much politics.  Leads are very rude.  Old Machineries and bad parts blames on operators."
bad,"Company has more managers than working people. "
bad,it was wonderful place to work you got to learn new things and friendly people to work with and you got to learn new products
bad,"Management is very dishonest. Abusive environment. Very un productive environment. Management talks down to staff. Very un professional. Managements creates a lot of problems on the work floor. Worst safety practices I have ever witnessed in my 31 years of experience. Many 90 day dismissals. DO NOT APPLY. They take advantage of the labor market in Brantford. You will never get in fulltime!!!!!"
bad,Great teamwork with coworkers and management team.  Enjoyed working and maintaining site machines.  Very challenging career that kept me motivated. Continiously encouraged to become a better technician thru training.  Allowed me to be self motivated and oversee company control systems.
bad,"If you really need a job, then MAYBE consider this company. They will pay you as little as they can while they work you inefficiently. Any profit is gobbled up by corporate for golfing trips and pointless company travel for non-productive execs. An archaic business model, out of touch elitist HQ that will provide a dead end job with zero long term incentives. Forget about overtime unless they are screwed and need you to catch them back up."
bad,"Forced to work a weekend shift, Low pay, unreasonable expectation of productivity without any training on the machine operated."
bad,"I worked here for almost 4 years and this shop has a Union however, management makes the rules and there is no reasoning.  They will make your life unbearable and make it very difficult to come to work.  The pay is good but for the amount of stress that you go through, it is not worth it.  Politics are horrible here and if you try and talk to Management, they will not listen to you.  If you go to Human Resources, they are on Management's team so they will not listen to you either.  Very cut throat, workers try to set up other works so machines crash or parts are messed up and the blame is put on you.  Horrible place to work.  Can never keep anyone....there are some workers that have been there for many years but stay because of the $$$."
bad,"Flowserve, cookeville has the most unprofessional hr people there are. The management is a dictatorship"
bad,"ambiente lavorativo stressante, non organizzato."
bad,I was the only monitory and the treated me very bad. I will never forget how the trainers had no Respect and lac of knowledge and patience. They make it sound good but could not keep their Word on alot of things including what shift or time ibwould be training
bad,Management doesn't care about what goes on. Co-workers kiss up to managers to move up in the company. Co workers will also lie about production vs how long they have been at work. Need better management. It's funny knowing some of the managers never touched a machine in their life but are MANUFACTURING managers. A lot of the managers make rules and enforce them on certain people instead of the whole team because the company is very clique-y.
bad,Management doesn't know what they are doing. Then this falls all over the chain of command leaving employees confused. there is no place for advancement.
bad,Tak Flowserve Olomouc pod vedením p.Bačika je tak nějak komunistický systém bonzovaní a donašeni jeden na druhého a věřte že vím o čem mluvim jelikož jsem měl tu možnost tam pracovat. A proto také spousta zaměstnanců odešla a odchází i ti nový protože s tímto panem Bačíkem který je svým způsobem zamindrakovany ubožak nikdo nevydrží a vedení společnosti jako linka důvěry ta nic neřeší je jim to jedno několikrát jsme na něj a nejen na něj upozorňovali i na pana Mikšíka který vše kryje a jdou si spolu na ruku. Takže pokud chcete zažít ponižování a vidět opravdového ubožaka tak je Flowserve Olomouc s p.Bačikem to pravé pro vás. Já osobně v této firmě budoucnost s tímto vedením nevidím
bad,"Duriron used to be a fun place to work with a lot of nice people, but when FlowServe took over the company, that all changed. The benefits weren't as good, a lot of people were leaving, and the majority of management didn't care what happened to us here in the Dayton, Ohio area. The company used to have over 400 people, but it was down to 80 because the company no longer cared about this division. I was there over 25+ years and they wouldn't even give 5 people who had over 25+ years (out of the 80 left) a bridge to retirement for 30 years. I have very little good things to say about the company. This is what happens when a company takes over, they no longer care about the old company or people."
bad,"The opportunity to work for the most unethical, arrogant, self serving management team I have ever had the disgust of interacting with could be yours.   The team that hired me 8.5 years ago has all but been eradicated and the new wave is here to stay.   If you have no pride, deep seated knowledge and experience you may be capable of accepting the degradation and oppression that the management feels they ""need"" to integrate into your work environment in order to ""achieve"" their unrealistic goals and expectations.  Make sure that you have no opinions, suggestions or observations as they have no place within their system. If you want a job were you can mindlessly go to work, have every minute dictated and go home feeling used and abused then you may be a perfect fit."
bad,"All departments are horrible including Finance.  Management has no people skills, they love to put people down. You will work for 10 days during closing and each day will consist of 12 hours days.  No compensation for the salary employees, its part of your job to work 12 hour days."
bad,"Non union job and they know it, dictatorship. If you don't like it there is the door mentality. Supervisors spend time covering up their indescresions. Co-workers have this click type mentality, if your in your ok if not they will stab you in the back."
bad,The work does not match the pay rate. They will try to figure a way to get rid of you if they suspect you finish a job longer than it require. Its like they want you to drive 50 miles to a destination in one hour but strictly want you to drive only at 20 mph speed limit. Then they will make you sign an agreement paper that terminates you if u fall behind a few time. Stay away from this company.
bad,If you want job that you are a robot and not allowed to think this is the place for you.This is a yes man culture and if you say anything you are not a team player or a trouble maker.You Have no life because overtime is a way of life and you get told to work at the last minute. It’s like a night mare.The place is run by a bunch of self serving idiots. The HR manger especially
bad,"If your not related ,its just another job. Supervisor is an law to the lead. Night time lead is cousin to daytime lead. No chain of command..Everyone wants to be a boss.Very unorganized from the office to the assembly. Not good communication. Even if you are desperate stay clear. Supervisor let's everyone know personal business alot of gossip and unprofessional."
bad,Not worth the time to work there no help from  management work load is overwhelming don’t waste your Time working at this company unless u want to be stressful all day long
bad,started out as a good job plenty of work and all the overtime you wanted .My boss was a great guy to work for.About 2 years ago they changed management and things went bad fast.Seemed like nobody new anything about what we were doing.Just a bunch of yes men and bean counters.My boss had been a meat cutter and new nothing about manufacting but he had people skills!Ha! Ha! Lots of the work is being sent to India and Turkey.Rumors of lay offs.This is not a goog place to be
bad,Management does not know how to make a part picks friends and gives them the royal treatment and the harder you work the more they expect. Management makes a wrong decision you get screwed with it and can't wait to find a new job
bad,"If you got a family and you really need to keep a job, you need not apply.This job is a joke, this job position will never be filled its been open for atliest 3 years now, save yourself some time.I am a well sesoned machinist worked there for 2 months and 29 days,1 day shy of getting hired this place sucks."
bad,"Very negative atmosphere. Very bad management. Fear and intimidation used as management tools. Retaliation is against company policy, but many employees have been retaliated against in subtle ways that cannot be proven. Management has obvious ""favorites"" who can do no wrong and others who can do no right. Management shows no respect to employees."
bad,"Passage extrêmement difficile d'une fabrication  process engineering en process industrial avec des nouveaux produits transférés, et surtout sans la qualification du personnel non remplacé à leur départ en retraite"
bad,"was a excellent place to work till FLOWSERVE took over and are sending jobs to MEXICO for increased profit. We made a profit but FLOWSERVE wanted more, local management didn't have a clue with what was happening on the shop floor"
bad,Not a good place to work for have had a bullying culture in past some of boss that have been there a long time still think they can still bully those worker that will not stand up for there selfs.
bad,"1. Completely collapsing organisation structure."
bad,Most people that apply and get hired donot make it through 90 days.
bad,"Flowserve has one of the most acidic and controlling work environments that I've yet experienced in my IT career. Even after a long military career, I have never seen anything quite like Flowserve when it comes to rigid and threatening work environments. The IT leadership is mostly composed of non technical people that have a genuine dislike of those that understand technical complexity."
bad,"Good ol boy floor management. If you're a smoker and a hick it's perfect. The duties are not explained in the interview. They lie to you. There's no local help or information for the 2 full time jobs you get assigned after you're hired. I've never felt less welcome at a job. They've gone thru 4 people in 2 years for the ""inspector"" position. Stay away from this place."
bad,"Great place to work if you’re a drinker, even better if you choose to drink with the decision makers. I worked at the Pittsburgh PMC for in excess of a decade and witnessed what was an amazing place to work devolve into a place without honor, and rife with nepotism as it applies to promotion or opportunity. Only those who can navigate shop politics will thrive there. If you at all want to be part of a team where merit, or competence  is rewarded, I would stay far, far away."
bad,"the management was incompetent, especially the man from Argentina. the group followed example of the boss. unpleasant environment. urgent. Expect to work many hours. very demanding accounting group. unfilled positions while I was there so as a result too much work. will work you to death.  this job is for young people coming out from public accounting and used to work 80 hours a week."
bad,The people I worked with were great but the shop manager was way over his head. Quantity over quality. He told me it didn't matter what the weld looked like as long as I could get it out the door.
bad,"not a fun place to be, a lot of inappropriate  conduct went on and I was told there was nothing I could do about it. Very abusive boss verbally and in other ways this program will not let me write."
bad,"The 4 years I have worked at flowserve I have learned quite a few things. "
bad,Just check the turnover in IT at the corporate offices in Dallas. Jobs are open for more than 12 months because their reputation is terrible. Management is terrible and don't know what they are doing. Major multi-million dollar project delayed because exec leadership missed major costs ($1M+) required for implementation.
bad,"Flowserve is a very dishonest place.  The company culture that is spoken of is not practiced.  People are often being set to be let go, despite exceeding performance expectations, per their reviews."
bad,"Business is poorly managed and needs to update business systems and technology.  Management ""expects"" work to get processed and get done regardless of work load and number of employees."
bad,"It is a great job if you are not looking for a career. Excellent Money. Management in the Sulphur Springs Texas area is awful with some. You are taught safety and quality but when it comes down to needing stuff out the door both are overlooked. Product gets half made and processes, that are vital to the product purposely gets skipped . I was an excellent employee but It got to where doing things right became difficult. Family working together was an issue. Management was beyond awful ,  especially when they hired two new managers that didn't care about the product....just delivery. At times forced to work long hours and threatened with punishment. It just wasn't worth it after my 10 years there. I held pictures above my station as a reminder that as a single parent "" you've got to do this, those babies depend and deserve it. As they got older, I spent the last three years trying to get myself a voluntary lay off. As of 2017, I finally got it. You have to learn to stand your ground and do whats right ...not what makes money."
bad,"Job cuts announced two weeks after you start.  Your boss asking after three weeks if you can old job back because no one knows what's going on.  6 weeks on the job your travel budget gets cut to zero, they announce a 12 month salary freeze and what you were hired to do is completely changed."
bad,"Management does not care what happens to employee's there words exactly ""we can find anyone off the street to do this job"""
bad,"Leadership above the Director level are well respected and very accommodating and approachable.  If they only knew what happened at the Organizational level!!!!  Some immediate managers are incompetent and make command decisions without consulting teams who actually do the work.  Risk is not mitigated, but transferred to the teams who all are looking outside of Flowserve for more stable, less stressful positions."
bad,"This place is full of people who don't know what they're doing or how to go about doing it! But it's because they're all friends and relatives of higher-ups who are the same! They don't know how to use the resources on-hand. Take me, for example, i'm a c.n.c. machinist/programmer and they put me on a manual machine. This is the reason that i'm looking for work elsewhere; i want and need to be programming c.n.c. machines. I also wish to move back to Florida, or at least along the gulf coast of Alabama, Mississippi or Texas, or the southeastern part of Georgia."
bad,"Buena empresa para laborar , mal ambiente de trabajo."
bad,JJ the boss is not a people person and people are leaving because of him they need an overhaul of management and they need to pay veterans more than they do now and not the people that kiss but..
bad,"Millwrights don't work there, any other place then flowserve"
bad,"A work day is between 9 to 12 hours a day."
bad,I was raised not to say anything if I could not say anything nice. So No Comment.
bad,"Good place to start.  Excellent opportunity to travel to great places.  Great people on the ""deckplate"" level. Incredibly poor leadership on the ""24th floor.""  Poor decisions made at the top with negative consequences for mid level management.  Lack of transparency, absolutely no loyalty to those who make the company succeed.  Toxic culture.  Lip service paid to veteran preferences with the opposite reality.  Apply if the job looks good - keep your resume handy and keep looking while you are there."
bad,"Worked for Flowserve for many years and witnessed many changes that negatively impacted the employees. An example would be making the metrics for receiving a bonus nearly impossible to achieve. This of course drove morale down across every department. The facility I worked at was completely chaotic and run by managers who had little idea what they were doing and little to no business management experience or education. Most managers were previously Engineers that had been with the company for many years, were promoted to a manager's position due to the longevity even if they had zero knowledge of the department they were managing. The managers know very little and do even less. If you are looking for a stepping stone position, this would be a good company to work for; move on after a few years because there is no opportunity for growth. I regret staying as long as I did."
bad,"It is culturally diversified, which helps to get along with different people from different parts of the world. Flowserve Calgary office has a small team with well qualified engineers."
bad,Poor management and leads are not properly trained to their job.No motivations from management .Machines and ecquipments are obsolete delapidated.Job title and positions are not properly filled up with experienced and without  experience.If their old machines failed they blame on the operators.
bad,"buon rapporto con i colleghi, ma lavoro stressante, manca meritocrazia e formazione."
bad,"This company called me directly for a phone interview,  had me come in for a formal interview, then called me with a job offer for which I  excitedly accepted.  However, my first day on the job I was told I was a temp. employee with a 6 month contract!  Had I known this was a temp. job I never would have taken it.  The management here is constantly looking over your shoulder and the moral was horrible."
bad,"Es una empresa que como proveerdor de equipor de bombeo especializado son de los mejores a nivel internacional."
bad,"do not recommend working for Flowserve any where. Long hours, low paid considering the hours worked. No appreciation from management. You do 110%, they will demand 120%. Most associates are very unhappy"
bad,"Es ist ein Unternehmen wo keine Struktur gelebt wird und werden kann."
bad,"Very poor management all around; negative culture; no bonuses in several years; no salary increases for anyone except executives.  They rarely, if ever, promote from within."
bad,"Last manager I had, which i understand has since left, was frankly unfit for the position he had. Pretty much, I feel like the focus was getting all they could out of an employee without fair compensation."
bad,Lack of transparency in compensation. New CEO and a lot of changes being made at corporate. Only thing that has ever been consistent is that this company is all talk but no walk.
bad,"Work is fine but there is a lot of administrative rules which has to be followed you do'nt fell free to work."
bad,Flowserve will give you the hours you need. The hidden factors are longer days at the end of month.. Why? This company needs to improve the process of shipping department. The manager has little to no idea of how to operate his work team.
bad,"A typical day was stressful to say the least. Is it just me or are the new managers hired these days (at any age) missing something? It seems as though they lack the operational knowledge. There is no control on inventory and with that inventory is inflated, lack of MRP knowledge, invoices become a huge problem, schedules go out the door.....I just don't know. I have witnessed this with 3 managers recently."
bad,"A good job with nice equipment that is micro managed to the point it ruins everything. Promotions are done by who you know and who's friend you are, not by experience or hard work. Leading to incompetent people in  lead positions not knowing the capabilities of equipment and people, leading to the higher skilled people leaving. Management takes no criticism in any way without retaliating."
bad,"It is one of the most tight fisted companies I have ever worked for."
bad,"Flowserve has the worst environment and culture I have ever experienced. The management consists of people who have taken advantage of internal politics and trickery to advance. It is entirely a ""yes"" man culture. The company has devolved over the years to only focus on the bottom line. Available positions are filled according to demographics ( i.e., anyone they can underpay). I would not advise you put any trust into this company."
bad,Not the greatest place to work not team Swap stuff constantly would not recommend this place to anyone. Compulsory volunteered overtime....................
bad,"Since I have been at Flowserve, there have been layoffs about every 6 months for the past 5 years. It is a dinosaur of a company with limited vision for the future. Focused on constantly cutting costs rather than leveraging the assets it has to expand its product offerings into new markets. Only thing keeping this facility going at this point is institutional inertia, but it definitely feels like it is slowly grinding to a halt."
bad,They really pushed you to understand the core function of the company which is very important. There are too many companies today where employees lose touch of their purpose.
bad,"If you like being micromanaged passive-aggressively, this is the place for you. Just go along with everything you're told and accept it wholesale."
bad,Management lacks the necessary knowledge or capabilities to abide by the companies standards or code of conduct. Senior workers allowed to abuse time and not reprimanded for it. Favoritism to certain employees for all the wrong reasons.
bad,"A typical day at work was demanding and chaotic. When an effective system is in place, work flows and employees are more productive. I learned more about production planning and the nuclear valve industry. I learned how to maneuver and create successful projects in spite of low company morale, adverse work processes and challenging areas within the system. "
bad,"If you are happy with, and don't forget, that your sole purpose in life is to make this multinational machine money, then you should be ok. If work/life balance and/or being treated like a person is important to you, you may be disappointed. FLS is for people with either no spouses or spouses who are also married to their jobs, no kids, no need to make personal commitments (such as working out regularly, social things, etc.). The two men I reported to liked to say two things to me: #1 ""Dollar waiting on a dime"" (i.e., he the valuable dollar, me the less-valuable dime). #2 If I didn't understand something the other would say, with a screwed up face, ""Would you like me to draw you a picture?"" Its true...no thanks!"
bad,"Our main goal is to meet customer requirements & the quality of work we give should be 100% error free. Everyday we learn something new as we start doing a new job."
bad,I worked at the Lakeland Fl branch. The manger is the worst I've seen. If your not in his little group or disagree with him at all your done for.
bad,"Dedication to your job and previous accomplishments receive no acknowledgement, but management will terminate you based on fabrications by others who act on personal feelings."
bad,"Poor management/leadership"
bad,I worked on the seals side of the business and was blacked balled and never received any call from any manager to discuss the issues at hand. Safety was a joke. It was only exercise to cover the company when they seen fit. If something was a real concern it was sweep under the rug.
bad,"I've got varying opinions on Flowserve. There are a lot of good people, but the management is very cut-throat. They need to value their employees more. Based on my personal experience, they tend to put you in a box and squeeze as much time and life from you as you are willing to give."
bad,Enjoyed working with other FLS employees very much as well as the ability to work independantly.  Poor job culture that needs updating throughout the company.
bad,"Knee jerk reactions to almost any and all situations. Good ole boy network, you're either in or you go nowhere. All loyalty is on your part, non to you."
bad,"Learning, Team work with Spirit, Respect to culture, values, Visions, CIP, Supportive and good PAY for new comers. Enjoy challenge working nature."
bad,It's an okay job. Made a lot of friends despite the drama. My supervisor is awesome. Accommodating with students. Poor pay. Horrible morale. High school drama. Back stabbing/making stuff up about you behind your back. Random mandatory overtime.
bad,Management was awful and Hr was just as bad. Very hostile environment. They have shown a lot of favoritism and cater to the senior employees but treated hard workers like trash.
bad,"I would consider Flowserve jobs as good entry level jobs, there is no room for advancement. The work environment is easy going but is lacking in management and communication."
bad,At present there are few highly advanced people working for the company but they are close to retirement. Young engineers can learn from these people. There is no value for the knowledge in Flowserve therefore I will not recommend any one to look for a long term career in Flowserve unless someone is very good in PR.
bad,"Not enough promotion opportunity for non engineer workers. Not many benefits, non health related benefits. No room to grow, very little non engineer training available."
bad,"Challenging role have to meet very stringent tolerances and at a very high standard to keep clients satisfied. Very educated workforce, that are keen to help and give advice if needed. Experienced employees throughout the facility."
bad,"I wanted to retire from this company in the beginning, but I don't feel the same anymore. I started working in the paintbooth and I later learned that I was the first female to ever work in that department."
bad,"A lot of changes in senior leadership and very low moral. Turn over is high at the moment, but hopefully it will stabilize as the new management team comes on."
bad,"As a summer intern, I was able to work with the materials engineering department to find better ways to manufacture pumps and valves for different services. "
bad,"Long hours, great team of co-workers.  Tight reporting due to excessive information reporting.  Most employees plus 35 years so culture is difficult to change."
bad,"Accountability is not taken seriously."
good,Good Place to work. There are many people that have worked here over 20+ years. It is good fir someone trying to advanced their career. It has been a good experience.
good,"Ok, seriously, Indeed.... you might want to rethink this all out. Constant badgering of people to fill out this is rather old and odd. People are seeking improvement and employment, not to re-hash some work adventures in their lives that make them question the rights of others to be here on this planet. I give it a 8.5 because it has a good beat and I can dance to it."
good,The day to day process was mostly routine.I learned six sigma and became yellow belt certified.Management was very poor.The hardest part of the job was never having time for outside life.The best part was the pay.
good,"Worked here for 7 or 8 months on a contract to hire. I worked in the dock area pretty much just receiving, scanning in, and putting away inventory. I worked with four or five other people also contracters. Not a bad place to work, but there was some culture of HAVING to work overtime or you were look less upon. Which was bad for me because I was also attending school. I wasn't going to put school on the back burner while I was still pretty much a temp, I would have if I was hired, which never happened. Long story short, they started hiring newbies full time positions rather than the temps that were already there and knew what they were doing. Shortly after whoever the guy was above our manager said he had to lay one of us off. I volunteered. I was like the only one without kids and/or married. Plus after being there so long, I had no reason to believe they were ever going to hire me. Wasn't going to sit there and just rot away. For a better job soon after. So beware of employment agencies and the people they send you to if you are a vet, which most of us were, you are just a tax credit to them."
good,"Company is in constant flux, management just throws initiatives at the wall to see if anything sticks...not a great way to run a business. They need to pick something and stick with it long enough to see some benefits."
good,"Mandatory overtime with little work, reprimands for small manners that have no consequences to the business. As long as you can blame whatever goes wrong on someone else, you will be okay"
good,"Typical work day mandatory overtime especially at the end of the month. They constantly rob work from the next month to ship in this month to make their monthly numbers look better. This only increases the overtime and expediting costs."
good,"As mentioned above, compensation is above average however, the work/life balance is totally one sided towards Flowserve.  The average hours per week worked is 55-60 hours.  You are lucky if you don't have to work a full day Saturday and find out on Friday at around 5-6 p.m."
good,"Aprendi a lidar com cliente de diferentes paises, a trabalhar de maneira global."
good,"Learned how to deal with difficult situations.  There is tons of cooperation from the majority of groups.  As in most places, some more than others."
good,"Flowserve senior leaders are not sure what they want and frequent turnover of executives has created an environment of confusion.  They are also ill prepared for increasing competition from overseas manufacturers."
good,"As of 2018, the entire C-level suite has been replaced in the past 9 months. Any review I can give is outdated. The new CEO, CFO, and CIO are trying to right the ship however they have a large task set out for them and one of their first steps is to cut staff. Time will tell if they succeed."
good,Corporate management full of sales minded people who do not understand the ramifications of not following regulatory requirements. Not much talent at the company so it easy to be the goto guy or superstar.
good,"Mucha carga de trabajo con pocos recursos invertidos en su recurso humano administrativo. Al fusionarse la empresa creció en trabajo, y lo que parecía ser una oportunidad para mejorar lo antes mencionado, se paso por alto."
good,"For the last 6+ years I have been a Sales Engineer focusing on Compressor Gas Seals, Seal Support Systems, and Field Service products.  My OEM & Enduser territory was the North East USA and Canada and Global Proposal Development Teams and SCM.  I also successfully executed and supported several global projects with my Global Sales, Engineering, and Operations teams in tandem with the EPC’s, EU’s, and OEM’s.  I have hands on knowledge of compressor retro-fits and upgrades and a strong history of field service support at the Enduser & OEM accounts.  I also bring 13 years of Engineering, R&D, Testing, and Design knowledge that allows me to logically understand, process, and resolve product issues and come up with creative engineering and design solutions that can save the Customers and employers’ time and money.  I have a strong working and personal relationship with my co-works and customers and believe this is one of the most critical role of sales."
good,"troublesome due to employee issues. with a good inside sales system that helped even the day out."
good,Seems every week Flowserve has a injury of some sort. Poor training on employee safety seemed to be part of the problem as was the nature of the product.
good,I worked with EE's to create test fixtures using Labview. Design new housings out of plastic as well as die-cast aluminum. Designed test procedures for testing the assemblies.
good,"Days start with pulling spare parts, identifing receiving needs and then shipping parts and valves. Good people to work with. Hardets part of the job is very tight time constraints."
good,Sabotage of work to be able to get something to report about. Many were 30 to 40 years veterans and refused to do what company owners wanted do. They were smarter than the execs. Wouldn't teach you as that was their idea of job security.
good,It was sad to see so many good people get laid off. No one seemed to understand that leaders eat last. Shareholders seemed to matter more than the workers.
good,"Good Luck if you go down this rabbit hole, Flowserve management does not understand their product or the operations required to produce it. 1930's equipment that will not be replaced and 1970's C.N.C. equipment on its last leg that will not be replaced its a shame for a company who's customers are ""oil rich"" and pay a premium for the product. Flowserve does invest in their associates financially as the pay and benefits are okay. If you are okay being a puppet for management with no brain. You might be moved to the express lane for advancement."
good,environnement de travail assez plaisant et collègues très sympathique. petit bémol sur le management car pas assez organisé sur la répartition des taches et pas sincères.
good,"I was working through a temp agency, loved the people and the job, would of liked to continue working there, but due to consolidating I had to be let go."
good,"Compnay was great to work for up until they stated closing the doors of our facility come 31 August 2017. "
good,"aprendi metalurgica, sobre turbinas, me lleve muy bien con mis compañeros, me gustaba lo que hacia. trabajo por contrato"
good,"foi uma oportunidade boa,aprendi trabalhos diversificados na area de usinagem"
good,You will learn from people working around you.People are really friendly and helpful.Did not approve of upper management.
good,The demand of the job versus life is way out of control. Sales Personnel are not being fairly compensated year over year. Goals are now set at an almost unattainable level. Great company! Poor Senior Leadership!
good,Uma excelente empresa com ótimos benefícios porem não possui um plano de carreira eficiente para os seus colaboradores
good,Process & system are inefficient. Management takes long time to take decisions. Lack of flexibility in approval systems. Always stick to set of procedure and do not allow deviations whatever is a situation. Best thing about company is ethics & values.
good,Management should spend more time listening to employees than in meetings.  Promotions given to those that have been here longer rather than those that deserve them.
good,"Overall rating is 3/5. Good job work/life balance. Compensation was a little low, excellent benefits. No advancement opportunities. Management was very difficult to work with."
good,Starting out as Applications Engineer it's good pay but after a few years there is no incentives to move up or career guides provided by management. Office environment is very good but the work load can get stressful.
good,"Good place to learn but the amount of work load and meetings held is way too ,much than required, MNC with an indian Management. Stressful work and less support from managament. Work life balance is not great."
good,"While the work environment is standard for the industry, the management of the facility is sub par. Many of the leadership team so lack of knowledge of the business."
good,"For the past 2 years, we have received little to no bonuses, for all the hard work we do.  However, those that sit in the ivory tower, enjoyed $7M worth of bonus moneys, while the ones that made it all possible got zilch,"
good,"You can learn a lot in Flowserve apart from your work."
good,"Too much input from Corporate causing Management turnover and indecision.  During these times of slow sales, lots of finger pointing and back stabbing."
good,I learnt lot of new things at Flow serve. Got to handle a team of 3 people in out Dept.Got an opportunity to make all reports (MIS) and submit to Management.
good,"Management changed throughout the years, and so did the work environment.  I enjoyed document control/document entry, and clerical duties.  I enjoyed working with my coworkers, and I enjoyed working with the public."
good,"Tranquilidade em trabalho de equipe, aprendizado eficaz no dia a dia, boa gerencia, otimos amigos"
good,For a fresher its a good workplace to learn a lot of technical things and develop the skill set. But at the same time here personal growth as well as professional growth is very slow.Favoritism is seen at some level and there is no proper performance review system.
good,"Working for top management is tough especially when there are a lot of politics in the company. "
good,"Looking from the 10k foot view the company doesn't appear bad (speaking only about the Raleigh plant).  Lets get a closer look."
good,A very good company but can't keep very good employee Records.
good,Plant is like working at 3 companys it is veary hard to get anything done .
good,"fun to work .but lacks something...things company teached me are good team work capabilities, leadership qualities...."
good,They was going through growing pains at the time when working there. Ladies that run field guys are great. Upper safety is great but safety man had no business being in safety.
good,"Moving constantly, always something to do, whether its kitting jobs for manufacturing, completing customer orders for the days shipping to putting product or supplies away.  Using the forklift to unload deliveries or to load outgoing shipments."
good,"Flowserve is a great place to obtain the management, mechanical experience you need to step into the refinery, and chemical atmosphere. The company, is been changing rapidly, and too many old process with attempt to adapter to the newer process."
good,"Average work life balance"
good,"Es una empresa dinámica con un mercado muy complicado en estos tiempos (Oil and gas), la mayoría de sus ventas son proyectos, lo cual la vuelve una operación compleja pero muy interesante, te obliga a estar al dia en las nuevas disposiciones de USGAAP y controles internos."
good,"PROS:  very challenging work, tight deadlines, great for multi-taskers and people wanting overtime"
good,Okay work place but it all depends on your job title and responsibilities. Not much room to grow/advance here. Once you're in a position plan on staying there.
good,"I do not prefer to elaborate. I enjoyed the culture, but my departure was unexpected and unmerited. Alot of poor decisions are being made by management without sound logic or cost analysis. They are moving out of desperation and led by people with less than a quarter cycle's experience with Flowserve."
good,"Stressful job, highly demanding."
good,My experience and knowledge in sales and projects properly not used by the management.I am worried on that part at every time.Problem solvers and decision makers not given any encouragement.
good,"Empresa de nivel mundial, muy importante, siempre se aprenden cosas nuevas y te da oportunidad de seguir aprendiendo a través de cursos y capacitaciones, el estrés de trabajo, siempre está presente, pero buscan la forma de reconocerte el esfuerzo a través de premios y reconocimientos."
good,"It was great accomplishment  after successfully executing the Reliance project."
good,Lots of red tape and politics make it difficult to get things approved.Disconnect between upper management and divisional offices.
good,"mala la coordinación del personal supervisor así como del taller para entrega en tiempo y forma de los equipos de bombeo."
good,"L'azienda per la quale lavoravo era di buon livello,professionale ed in grado di darmi nuove direzioni nell'utilizzo e nella gestione delle strumentazioni informatiche a disposizione."
good,The company has a really good environment among it co-workers and the work it is very dynamic what gives you the opportunity to meet a lot of interesting activities but career opportunities hardly happen due the lean structure that the company have in Brazil.
good,"A day at flowserve prep pumps to be sprayed masking,cleaning , keeping areas clean. The number one thing is on time performance and paying  great detail to your work!"
good,"Decent job, for someone in need. No real advancement opportunities unless you know who you know. I worked there 7 years filled in for supervisory roles, etc. Showed my worth, expressed interest in bigger roles and better opportunities. It got me nowhere but back on that production floor and back to work lol."
good,Buen ambiente de trabajo y salarios excepcionales.
good,"many departments to transfer too. plenty of overtime to work, fast pace work shop good people to work for, layoffs may occur during slow season part of year."
good,"If you enjoy working on something one minute and the next being ripped away from it to work extra hard/fast at something else, this is your place! Other than that you have job security and some decent co-workers."
good,It was a laid back place with a lot of cycling people. Most people didn't stay for more than a couple of years. But it was a great learning experience.
good,Mostly completed basic accounting book-keeping functions for the branch where I was located. I also completed some basic sales analysis reports for the sales manager.
good,strong company going through management changes.  Most employees have engineering backgrounds.  Many facilities worldwide provides many different opportunities..
good,I was not able to get around the casting quality issues from our asian suppliers.  This impeded any headway made with other suppliers.  This is all that can be said in this matter.
good,"Flowserve grew too fast to keep the quality intact.  The Gas and Oil market failing in 2009, and desperate attempts to correct general business approach through management restructuring has left Flowserve in a downward spiral.   They are a business, they take steps they seem necessary to stay in business, and the devil with ""our employees are our most important asset"""
good,"Full plate of work and maybe more"
good,empresa esta´vel sem grandes movimentações no mercado Brasileiro
good,"A place to work and retire. If you are looking for career development, this is not the place."
good,Enjoyed my time at flowserve. High work volume. Good group to work for and I hope they are doing well and not very affected by the o&g downturn. Benefits could be a bit better
good,"As a machinist at Flowserve, the emphasis is on OTD, quality, and safety. The work is consistent and flows well through the shop. I enjoyed my time at Flowserve."
good,"a typical day involved in-process inspections, receiving inspections on all parts."
good,"This is no longer the case. Most employees have not had any raise in years.  Benefits keep on reducing each year and cost of the benefits to the employees keep on rising.   The company has been poorly managed for the past 8 years at least.  They set goals that are poorly executed and never get met.  "
good,I cannot say how they are doing in Mexico. They had to keep 10 percent of out business in USA do to customer requirements and once we got the new building up and running they terminated all but the plant mgr.
good,"Flowserve n'a pas de culture d'entreprise comme d'autres entreprises multinationales. Chaque site n'emploie que des personnes locales, pas de staff international stationné plusieurs années. Pas de formations internes qui inculquent les valeurs de l'entreprise. Ce ne sont que des usines locales avec l'estampille FLS sur la coque des pompes."
good,"Flowserve est un acteur majeur en mouvement de fluides (pompes, vannes, garnitures mécaniques). "
good,"Overall a good company to work at.  But that is just it, it lacks great leadership,  a good company culture, and development of employees.  If you are looking for a ""fun"" or ""engaging"" workplace, this is not it.   If you want to go to work, put in your hours, get paid fairly,  and have good benefits, this is your place."
good,"they build many custom application industrial pumps for many different industries, from food to oil and everything in between. lots of good people to work with"
good,Flowserve was a pretty good place to work not quit as good when Nordstrom owned the company. Lost some benefits when flowserve took over. Flowserve cleaned up the place.
good,"As an Employer Flowserve keeps the value of its employees and helps people to grow."
good,"The company provides good benefits and compensation, but they seem to be in a downsizing and consolidating mode at the present time. Closure of multiple locations with little or no reasoning or notice given by top management. Over the last two years there has been a large turnover of senior management positions. This has lead to very different ideas of programs and division value. No bonus last year and a small bonus given this past year."
good,"Learned to handle the Instruments as a beginner of the company"
good,There is so much to learn being in the shop daily seeing the equipment opened up. They capitalize on training for the engineers and the employees are great to work with. There is a wealth of knowledge working on the equipment with some of the employees working with pumps for 30 years. Great place for a young engineer to start.
good,working at flowserve is good working environment and good salary structure but no individual professional growth software used within the organisation but has less scope in market.
good,Good company to work for if you are career motivated and wanted to establish greater opportunities to yourself. Not many complaints did I have while working there.
good,"The hours, pay, compensation were great.  My directs and co-workers were great.  I typically didn't take a lunch or breaks because i was so busy.  "
good,es una empresa donde se aprende mucho para poder trabajar y hacer practicas profesionales
good,"pumps site installation and motor alignment, service support, mechanical seal system unit installation, barrier circulation at site, commissioning and troubleshoot of pump and motor system."
good,"Service Qualité très bien managé."
good,"The sad part is Flowserve decided to close our foundry in Dayton, Ohio and move the work elsewhere.  This has been the best workforce that I have ever supervised."
good,I liked how it was more of a job shop than a production job. I was constantly altering programs. Sometimes writing programs when needed. Making tooling and fixtures to run parts. Ran CNC Lathes and CNC Mills. Sometimes ran Manual Lathes and Mills. Hard to move up and get good raises. The benefits are decent but have had much better. When busy I worked as much overtime as i wanted as long as someone else was there too. Overall a good job not the best place I have worked at but not the worst either.
good,It is a good place to work.  It is a US based company with great opportunities for employees.  The overall operations and management teams are developed and continuously improving.  Great staff and great relationships with internal and external customers.  There is a great amount of red tape and politics between the US an Canadian business units.
good,"The upper management people are terrible and all of them should get fired.  So many lazy people here and they do not want to change."
good,"Should have stayed at the company, didnt see any room for growth, management was great co workers were great. Close to the house"
good,"Old guard company in energy industry with highly customized products for specific applications in oil, gas, and nuclear industry."
good,"Es una buena Empresa, Pero requiere de mucho tiempo  que pertenece a tu vida familiar"
good,"Poco compañerismo en general pero una minoría."
good,"Ambiance agréable et travail interrressant"
good,"Currently manage a team of 4.  Commodities include castings, machined castings, soft goods, actuators and actuated components.  Most of what I manage is in India so I have a very strong understanding of Indian culture and business practices.  I keep track of all open orders to ensure we meet the needs of our production team.  I also manage inventory turns, on time delivery, cost or poor quality and ensure my team understands priorities.  I also ensure my team has the resources to be succesful both with their vendors and their career goals."
good,"every day is different and exciting"
good,"Good to start your career. you will get a load of experience not just in your area of expertise but other areas as well. Mainly because the operations are run very lean due to the nature of their business. they are also slow at hiring. "
good,Facility was closed due to shrinking market place in the fossil fuel sector.
good,"Technical Skills:"
good,started out in assembling move to machinist enjoyed the challenge of machining raw parts to spec to make functional parts.
good,High expectations with little recognition. Lack of development.  Not market competitive with pay
good,"Buena empresa , con alto sentido de responsabilidad laboral , sobre todo en lo relacionado a la seguridad "
good,The employees of flowserve are by far what makes this job enjoyable.
good,Great place to be if you like working for the North American leader in this industry.
good,"Flowserve is the one of the Leading Centrifuagal pump manufacture in coimabtore. Flowserve has good QMS,EMS and safey functions."
good,"Good company. Have good culture and follow good ethics, but when coming to Indian office, it is not that much good since they push and make to stay back which destroys the work life balance. also only people who blindly support management are promoted."
good,Flowserve is an industrial manufacturing company that does not place a lot of importance on in house software development. Thus you will not get the visibility to become a rock star.
good,hay que estar acostumbrado a trabajar bajo presión para poder desarrollar un buen trabajo y seguir las ordenes al pie de la letra. algo muy destacable es como cuidan a su personal operativo y de confianza. la seguridad es primero SIEMPRE
good,My day was going thru my pile of blueprints and making parts based on their due date. I learned various machines and processes. It did have a negative work culture but I'm a positive person so it didn't really bother me. The hardest part was just the very short dead lines which resulted in a lot of overtime. Which isn't the worst thing.
good,This company offers great benefits and a great work culture.  In most departments there are not enough employees to cover the work so there will be long hours worked at times.
good,"High turnover, little chance of advancement.  Great for those who love monotony and where you can be blamed for everything wrong with a 50-year-old product."
good,"Abusive management, abusive leads specially in 1st shift ( harassment, discrimination ,bad attitude , unfair treatment ) . manager not listening to your complain."
good,"Corporate management continued to make changes that were detrimental to the success of the company as a manufacturer.  As business declined, staff was cut several times.  This increased the chances of failure for meeting goals.  In the end, I was one of the staff that was cut in the name of saving company money."
good,"Gran multinacional, muy centralizada con una estructura muy sólida, muy bien reconocida en el mercado."
good,"This was a large company; again I do not believe that it is an appropriate use of this for reviewing publically any employer, that is against all sorts of privacies and it makes me highly uncomfortable to be asked."
good,"Flowserve works on some highly engineered products, but the engineer needs to be self motivated. A lot of people working here are very content in doing basic job needs. There is not a lot of higly motivated people and passionate about wha they work on."
good,"While working in the field on projects, worked numerous hours to complete the tasks required for successful completion of the project.  This sometimes entailed working with multiple technicians in order to get the overall system working.  Also worked from home to help with other on-going projects along with CIP projects for the factory as needed."
good,Good place for fresher to learn something different and direct interaction with management. its reduce the gap between employees and employers. If have a good talent you will be moved good position.
good,Too bad the Flowserve Lawrence Pumps had to move to Mexico was a good place to work.  A good place to learn the trade of machinist for someone willing to learn.
good,"Simply too volatile, unstable industry. Not sure where to begin, but if you're looking for advancement you will have to be patient. Love the company overall, great experience!"
good,"Safety first company.  Stress company safety and OSHA policies. Typical company culture, positive and negative attitudes.  Not a lot of stress and my job was full filling yet challenging at times."
good,"Uma ótima empresa,com excelentes funcionários um lugar incrível para o aprendizado e agregar conhecimento a corporação."
good,It was alright untill they hired someone off the street with no experience as a permanent instead of taking me on from temp to permanent. There is also alot of nepotism.
good,Flowserve has its ups and downs just like any other company.  But one thing that they lack is room for further advancement within the facility.  It seems that once you reach a certain level you hit a plateau.
good,Pay scale was done buy who you knew not buy what you know. Putting people in charge who didn't know there job or how to do it.
good,"Thw daily focus was on planning, MRP,inventory, and customer service support. We had a strong team of planners with very long years of service.It was a family support organization with many outside functions involving family. The hardest part was motivating employees with long years of service to support a recently installed ERP system."
good,"•	Data entry and coding of invoices  "
good,"Good place to work, advancement opportunities all over the world"
good,"The workplace is good with good benefits like free lunch, cab etc."
good,I loved it when I started.  I still believe in the company as a whole.  They are working toward establishing a consistent culture.  Hopefully they will get good people in the right positions to make this happen.
good,"Company is in the process of building a new executive team which provided a very challenging work environment.  Typical day for me started at 6:30 am throught 6:30 pm.  Learned a ton about database development, requirements gathering, Q&A testing, cloud environments.  Hardest part of the job was navigating the management culture (constantly evolving due to building new executive team and management teams).  Most enjoyable was working with the individual contributors who had a can do attitude despite the management challenges."
good,It was a good place to work. It was in oil and gas industry. The pay was fine. The benefits were fine. What else do you want me to say about the flowserve
good,"8-4.30pm work day"
good,Our jobs are being outsourced to Hungary.  No future room for advancement. The company is closing facilities and cutting 400 million by the end of December 2018.
good,it is wonderful company. i have worked in overall 6 years. there is working culture is good. but working stay hours is very high. my overall rating is 3 star.
good,"In the past a great company to work for but in the past few years upper management, that is new to the company, has no loyalty to the faithful employees."
good,A good place to work and learn. Work life balance will be so good here.work place culture was great and you can feel it every moment.
good,Learning & fun loving experience. Colleagues & Management were helpful & were like an extended family. Always there to help you during your hours of need.
good,"Als Systems engineer in 2013 de opdracht gekregen de engineering afdeling te reviewen vwbt huidige tools en processen. Deze waren  verouderd zeker in relatie met 3D ontwerpen."
good,"Profile of application engineer is challenging every day."
good,A lot of challenges and areas for improvements.  Company provides training to help you in your job.
good,"I hereby declare that the above written particulars are true to the best of my knowledge and brief."
good,High expectations and a very large work load...
good,Determine which jobs need to be inspected first. Inspect parts and accept or reject in computer system. Move to next work station on traveler.
good,"Actually i have started my career in CRI Pumps pvt ltd. It was a Industrial pump manufacturer unit. i was working in Vertical turbine pump."
good,"The company was founded on smart, savvy financial and engineering principals, but it is going through a period of uncertainty given the oil and gas market volatility."
good,a typical day at my job involves me making 3 to 4 parts a day. It's and every day learning experience because you never know when you might get a different challenge that you have never faced before. Management is ok i believe it could be way better. my co-workers are great people to be around we do our best to treat each other like family and keep each other safe.
good,"good place, working was good, working was good,"
good,Great group of people to work with. If I were to move back to that area I would consider working there again. Great atmosphere overall great place to work. Plenty of room for advancement.
good,"it is a good place for team work , Hard work and success spirit mentality "
good,"My time at Flowserve GB was, for the most part, was pleasant and rewarding. I worked with a very approachable GM who was always willing to listen to new ideas and concerns that may occur."
good,Flowserve provides many different opportunities and challenges to help maintain interest and motivation for a long career.
good,"Full day job , no pressure on job, "
good,I like working there I had a lot of years of service in at Flowserve but the Management was horriblle the last ten plus years. Now I am looking a very secure place of employment
good,"Uma empresa de qualidade,que se preocupa com seus funcionários,buscando lhe garantir segurança no seu serviço com ambiente saudável."
good,"The company itself has some great benefits in its corporate office in Irving and the pay was reasonable.  "
good,great place just dont like nights with no chance of going to days
good,Every day presents a new set of challenges that we must overcome as a team in order to build a highly engineered product while still being able to achieve 100% on-time delivery without any accidents and NEVER compromising quality.
good,Not a bad company to work for.  A couple sub par managers to deal with but the company itself is a good place to work. The company even buys hurricane supplies for employees & donated money to help repairs for those that flooded.
good,"I was selected to Flowserve on a rotational program which included 6 months of rotating thru 4 different roles - R&D, Engineering, Manufacturing and Design for mechanical seals. I then moved to the Flowserve pump business as an Applications Engineer for 2.5 years and then promoted to Sales Engineer."
good,Gran compañía multinacional pero con pocas posibilidades en el área financiera
good,Salary and benefits are very good.  There is a steep learning curve to get up to speed.  Flowserve as a whole has had a rough last few years.  The Lynchburg plant has been very profitable throughout this time.  Limitorque has been a stable company in the community for 50 + years.
good,Not the best payor but the management works well with employees to solve concerns. Lots of overtime available and benefits are decent. Management is slow to discipline poor performers which can bring down good performers moral. Difficult to change shifts to first if that is your goal. Lead men may not be best suited for the role in all departments.
good,"Good startup to work for freshers"
good,"mostly manual machines, good place to work. dailly dutie consists of all type of pump repair, installing of wear rings and bushing turn to finish size .001 tolerance"

good,"Empresa com boa jornada de trabalho, bom clima organizacional e ótimos pacotes de benefícios."
good,"Good learning curve with fun colleagues."
good,"Veel geleerd, veel kunnen bijdragen."
good,Every job was different from the next. Custom assemblies and hydraulics were designed by customers specifications. Learned many different aspects of a company that operates as an engineering based industrial shop.
good,"* Good place for studing in correspondence"
good,"Flow serve is a good company to work with . Too much  of pressures are built on low level employees. Company should concentrate more on employees. "
good,"Ambiente familiar, profissionais muito envolvidos com as tarefas, empresa da todo o suporte para execução das tarefas empresa muito boa mas deixa a desejar em certas situações"
good,"Learned many new trades and received several certifications during my time there. Learned industrial blueprint reading, industrial painting and how to operate several machines. Supervisors were fair and decent to work with."
good,Like the laid back atmosphere. Time to do your job safely and correctly. They paid a good salary with good benefits. The company had a good on-time-delivery rating.
good,"Great company"
good,"My internship experience was really good. I got to work on my own project from start to finish, and I had a lot of support from my co workers. My only complaint is that they failed to follow up with me afterwards, and the program itself was very unstructured and didn't have direction. If you aren't able to strap up your bootstraps and do things on your own this probably isn't the internship for you."
good,"Great place to work. Friendly people that are willing to help. You must work hard to progress in this company and they do not just give positions away. Once hired you must prove yourself and strive to succeed. As with any company in the oil & Gas industry... Make sure you are not expendable, during down turns they will let people go."
good,"Starts with accountability meeting followed by busy schedule work. "
good,"Fast paced work environment."
good,"vannes de régulation (usinage, montage)"
good,"A typical day consisted of reviewing of client emails. Having a production planning meeting with the manager, purchaser and application engineer.

Shipping out valves assembled during the shift"
good,"la seguridad es responsabilidad de todos"
good,"I was offered many opportunities to enhance skills. I was able to work well on my own or with others, which makes me self-motivated or able to work as a team."
good,Typical large corporate environment. Healthcare benes paid holidays etc. There are several different entities which operate differently. There are several pros and cons depending on which division you are applying.
good,"Typical day at work is very busy creating export documents, applying for US Export licenses and dealing with freight forwarders."
good,"Uma empresa onde se tem um desafio novo a cada dia, aprendi a lidar melhor com as pessoas no ambiente de trabalho. A parte ruim da empresa é a localização da mesma. A direção é um bom ponto nesta empresa pois a mesma está ao seu lado quando necessário."
good,"Flowserve is an established company with great benefits, however they do not acknowledge accomplishments and push their employees to their limits."
good,"Good company that allows for creative thought.  Technical company that evolves around pump fundamentals, design, etc."
good,"I work as a outside sales/technical specialist, so my day to day will be different from the employees that work at the factory.  "
good,"On a typical day, I would prepare various sales and production reports and assist engineers with advertising and promotions of new pipe valve."
good,"Venho me desenvolvendo muito na área que atualmente, pois faço parte da equipe de projetista e por isso consigo atuar em áreas diversas para o desenvolvimento de produtos, por esse motivo venho adquirindo muitos conhecimentos, tais que veem me acrescendo de maneira positiva e pessoal e profissionalmente por pode interagir com diversas situações no ambiente profissional."

good,Understanding the project flow in the meeting.
good,Good learning experience and some chance for advancement.

good,"Buena empresa con oportunidades de mejora en administración de sus recursos, tanto físicos como sus recursos humanos."
good,"se trabaja bajo presión y se labora con mucho estres, pero el apoyo del equipo y demás compañeros fomenta un ambiente laboral agradable"
good,"I truly enjoy my work. I feel as though the industry I work in is changing, and bringing certain job changes with it. I think my job skills could be better utilized elsewhere. I wish to relocate to be closer to family as well."
good,"Empresa boa de trabalhar, com muito foco em resultados."
good,La compañia ha cambiado en el ultimo año. El ambiente laboral actual ha decaído
good,Gran empresa multinacional con grandes expectativas y un gran convenio para los trabajadores
good,la empresa cuenta con bajas prestaciones y en cuanto a capacitaciones y cuidado de empleados si los cuidan muy bien y hacen mucho examenes para verificar que se encuentren bien
good,"Azienda in continua evoluzione, dove chi vuole impegnarsi e mettersi in gioco trova le sfide professionali adatte allo sviluppo della carriera."
good,"Typical workday involved interaction with customers and distribution to increase market share, and educate EPC's, Engineering Firms, End-users and OEM accounts of the features and benefits of Flowserve's product offerings, Engineering and Project capabilities as well as product service and support."

good,"Typical day at work is based around answering emails, customer and vendor update documentation. Communicating with Project Managers on Late documents."
good,Usually the day started out with a meeting just to catch up on what the work load was and how we was going to handle it. any safety concerns where brought up during that time. My co workers where great and usually the highlight of my day because we had great relationship.i was very good friends with the manager and supervisor they where good men. I'd have to say the hardest part of the job was the times when there wasn't much to do because as long as we where busy the day went fast.
good,"My work day is never boring and my ""to-do"" list changes hour to hour.  Running 9 sites (appr. 900 employees) keeps my Manager and I very busy. I have become very comfortable with travelling alone as business needs arise.  The hardest part of my job is conducting terminations, even the egregious ones tend to tug at my heart strings.  I love what I do and I love that I get to come to work everyday and be productive and helpful to my company, my employees and my co-workers."

good,Flowserve is an accumulations of purchased which has resulted in a multi complex computer system.  Due to the upper management high turnover rate the company's' business direction has changed with the new management's direction.  It is a fast pace work environment that demands your attention well past the 8 hour work day.  It requires devoted individuals that have passion and drive to do their utmost best in their position.
good,"Muy buen ambiente laboral, compromiso, trabajo responsable"
good,"What don't you like about working at Flowserve Corporation?"
good,"Lawrence Pumps is a 60+ year old company that manufactured pumps to customer's specs. Not off the shelf. That requires a certain ability to create new an a regular basis. Our pumps weren't the least expensive, but in some applications, money isn't the bottom line. that created an environment of constant change, that made the job interesting."
good,"-The supervisor have a very lack of knowledge practice of the industry, this is a new branch in the Field Services they are trying to open but I know Flowserve can be very successful but only with the proper management in place.I had more experience than the supervisor in the installation we have to do but I try to say what need's to be done with the API regulation and keep ignoring me and at the end it end it up costing more for the company pretty sad.Also a lack of working with the client not against the client is a big thing."

I have been to Vernon, USA for 3 Months for Pump packaging training. Only draw back in flowserve is manufacturing plant is not available here. Because of this, there is less chance to know about daily work challenges in Manufacturing plants."
good,Predominately a sales driven company for control valves. Had to communicate with various industries across a vast area in WA and NT. Increased the Maintenace revenue for my area by 300% in my first year. Great co-workers and the company looked after its employees.

good,Il breve periodo in cui ho  lavorato in questa azienda non mi permette di indicare una recensione utile.
good,The company is not set to meet the demands of the customer.  Results in many conflicts during order fulfillment.  An on-going process to bring up technology.
good,"FLS is a company in flux. As a manufacturer, they're having trouble as the ""old guard"" who knew the products inside and out are retiring and people with more soft skills are coming in. Also as a manufacturer, they're feeling the pain of a lack of interest from the younger generations in terms of the trades. Very few parents send their kids to machining school these days. Because upper management is so far away from these daily struggles, they rely on metrics and KPIs to judge performance rather than understanding and working to correct these issues."

good,"Flowserve has a great culture and is a collaborative work environment.  As an applications engineer there, it was sometimes difficult to find access to the information you needed to provide adequate part selection and costing information, but if you asked around you could usually find the person or location that could provide you with the answers you needed.  I would still be there if it wasn't for an industry downturn that resulted in consolidation of the Project team."
good,Working on the pump components and working on the R&D projects gives more exposures in manufacturing methods and new techniques. Very good working culture.
good,"Its a good place to work, although they have had lay-offs recently. this place has a future. The benefits aren't the best but better then some places I have worked."
good,"Workplace culture was very friendly and easy going. I strengthened my skills by cross-training in many departments.  Depending on shift, the work load varied. Unfortunately managers played favorites and there were social clicks that if you weren't a part of, had negative effects on job responsibilities and leniency. Good benefits and compensation."
good,Corporate management is decentralizing control of the business units and relinquishing authority to the local level. Project Management is not at a mature level at Flowserve.

Compensation and benefits are good overall, but have stalled over last two years. Advancement and progression can be very good or bad depending on the quality of your management, but exceptional work is typically recognized."
good,"El ambiente de trabajo se torno muy tenso debido a la crisis petrolera."
good,"This company is good at introducing one to the world of manufacturing, though some of the management policies can seem highly political. Communication may sometimes be an issue, but the team works hard to ensure customer satisfaction."
