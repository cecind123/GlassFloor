rating,review
bad,"Worst company worked as full of supervisor with 0 man management skills"
bad,Not a good place. If you are not the favorite you will not go anywhere. They think you should know everything with no training or anything. Some people act like they are still in High School there and if you are not from there area they look down on you.
bad,"Glad to no longer work there.  "
bad,typical day nothing specail another day at job management was oki went home early never complained hopefully other witll not choose to work ther.worked their in orl
bad,"Hired as administrative assistant, then not allowed to fully do my job. Manager did not possess skills to manage people.  Very stressful due to most disgruntled employees.  Awful place to work."
bad,Initial starting period was great. Happy and enjoyable working environment. Management changes and all perm staff suffer as contract staff begin to rule. Can't question or voice out and you will get totally penalised.
bad,Poor management and mergers have led to a extremely low moral at work. Low wages compared to the industry counterparts have led to the loose of many valuable people leave the company. Some have even quit without another job just to get away from the totalitarian style of leadership.
bad,Hardest part of the job is being gone offshore at months at a time.
bad,"Blue collar jobs have an high turnover. Oceaneering is honest and makes sure you know that Louisiana is a right to work state. Additionally, broadcasts you are a ""at will employee""."
bad,"Muito dinâmica, agradável de trabalhar.dando oportunidades a seus colaboradores,muitos bons benefícios,com muita preocupação com a segurança de seus colaboradores. nível profissional muito bom ,fácil adaptação."
bad,The Company is a sinking ship. They have frozen pay for four years running now and are gutting our health benefits. It was a huge mistake coming here.
bad,Oceaneering is not an employee friendly company. The upper management has no idea what work is performed. It is a very tense work emvironment.
bad,"Worked in the Subsea Services and Rental team and there was no direction on whats been done, no career progression and the American Managers was treated like god by his cohorts from Houston. Avoid by all means."
bad,I was given 4 days of training and then asked to take over the biggest contract Oceaneering had received to that point by myself.  This happened while I watched people in similar positions able to train side by side the person training them for months.  If you are looking for structure and clear policies you can follow this is not the place.
bad,This is a terrible company to work for....I have never seen a company's management that rewards employees that voice complaints about their co-workers....If you have a brown nose then you will fit right in with Oceaneering.
bad,HR really talked up a high turnover position. . .and I fell for it.
bad,Heat Treating/Asset Integrity division is horrible. Overall it is a great company just be mindful of what position s you apply for. Stay away from Asset Integrity and certainly heat treating.
bad,Management was not supportive and the environment was negative.  Employees are not treated equally.  Not appreciated that you work more efficiently or going beyond what was expected.
bad,They don't make you feel comfortable. They don't do anything for employees. No work/life balance.
bad,"So I'm part of being hired on the few ""hundred"" of people they hired. From what I've heard, most of the people that got hired on have quit. I havent worked more then 2 weeks in real work time and I'm in debt already because I have been out of work for 1.5 months and wont be leaving till next year. They talk you up about their being so much work but, for new hires it's almost non existent."
bad,Dropping like flies due to the downturn.  Multiple divisions disbanded and regrouped with others.  Layoffs continue.  High pricing in the market doesn't help.
bad,Provides unreasonable time frame to complete work. The hardest part of the job is to meet the deadline with very limited resources available. You are required to take over the the duties of people who left the Company. Never hire people for an open position. Recent change in the Management has drastically affected the culture of the company. Not a great place to work any more.
bad,Pay is low management is terrible no one Know what going on. The job is easy pretty thoughtless the job is not challenging at all.  
bad,based on the buddy system. politics and favoritism. you have to be part of a (group/click) to get more offshore time. Its pretty much who you know to be chosen for more work
bad,"Was not happy in my position. Mgt stopped being sensitive to business goals and how each employee is a part of meeting goals and should be managed to motivate, not aggravate."
bad,"Favortism is blatant. If you are not willing to kiss butt and play the game you will get no where. Expected to work long hours to get your job done by the deadline while taking on more work and expected to go 3 years with no pay increase, not even a cost of living increase. Just keep dumping more work on you but as long as you are in the inner circle you will get more money. Comes down to who you know, play golf with and how brown you can get your lipstick and nose."
bad,Nothing but layoffs since I started there. All I have to say. Cliques and only care about bottom line and not people. De-humanize you when you are laid off.
bad,"Very insular company. "
bad,"The Oceaneering International is indeed a good company to work for except under India management which is highly exploitative with regard to salary. However, there is no denying that the company is one among few to provide opportunity to freshers. However, in the name of providing opportunity to freshers, it exploits its employees in India to their hilt. It goes a step ahead in extracting not only a very draconian bond from its Indian employees for a period ranging from 07-10 years but also a financial bond of INR 1,500,000-2,000,000. In all cases, it has misappropriated the rightful dues of its employees when they chose to quit to seek better employment elsewhere. In India, this company is only focused on profiteering even at the exploitation of its employees. The company is virtually run as the personal fiefdom of its Country manager in India. Oceaneering practices exactly opposite to what it teaches its budding supervisors i.e, 'Stomp the Elephant in the office' but ensures to put elephant in the office with total disregard to the exploitation of its field staff. As a result, one amasses wealth at the cost of the rest."
bad,"Was a Marketing job for one product, and it did not sell."
bad,"My experience at Oceaneering was bitter sweet. After years of dedicated service, I have witnessed a lot of shady work practices. I have worked with people who had no idea how to do the job that they were hired for. This includes management. Kinda seemed like the screening process was serverly lacking. The safety culture was good for most part. There were some cases where safety took a back seat when time and money were running short. I feel there is a serious problem with the leadership. On many occasions I felt ""is this person the best they can come up with?""  The different types of projects I was a part of was great. Not so great with sharing information though. "
bad,"Não importa o quão qualificado seja o profissional, se não for recomendado por um dos chefes. Empresa valoriza tão somente os laços afetivos e indicação por amizade."
bad,"If you were not retired from the Military, you really were not treated as well as those that were, if you were Ex-Military, you had a better chance at getting a promotion or in the Bonus Program whether you were the most qualified or not"
bad,Depends on what group you work in and who you work for but overall I do not recommend working for Oceaneering.  Poor management.  Low morale.  Zero communication.
bad,They will never get rid of the old so there is no room for growth. When they try to change management they still listen to the old management. They have there favorites that they will always choose. If you want to be stuck at a dead end job this is the place. You just have to look at there stocks how it takes a nose dive. That doesn't give comfort you clients.
bad,Loved the work but the company doesn't care about employees they focus on bottom dollar and will get rid of people at the drop of a hat.they have been laying people off like crazy and it doesn't appear to have any reasoning behind it
bad,"If im completely honest....... not  a good company to work for but it was a start in oil & gas for me. After 3 years, with no training, and no push for management to progress in my career there, i finally decided to resign and move on to something else that i could learn from. "
bad,"good co-workers"
bad,A empresa me proporcionou bastante aprendizado em um dos seus maiores projetos da história da empresa. (Lula sapinhoá) A empresa possui um ótimo ambiente de trabalho e boa interação entre os setores.
bad,"During the time I worked for Oceaneering, I had a safety training in locations with machines.And also I had the opportunity to learning about some tools running in plantaformas."
bad,Been stuck at the same pay and grade for 3 years  due to pay freeze and new employees getting paid the same as I am even though they have little to no experience.
bad,"The company was very good when times were good. However, when times got tight, those who helped make other people keep their salaries, In the end, it's just a change."
bad,"Oceaneering provides comparable compensation; however, failed to provide a positive work environment. The company has gone through  a high growth period and has not been able to maintain a professional offshore work force."
bad,"I lasted only 6 weeks even though I had more experience than most. Got paid off due to going for to many cigarettes,  but it was my boss who was telling me to. Manager had digs at down syndrome children, disgusting."
bad,the company has gone under a lot of changes over the few years and its not been good for there offshore employees. Based out of there Louisiana office.
bad,"The travel opportunities, and cool factor in the work is probably the only two good things about this company. The pay is pretty terrible. You travel half way across the world for long periods of time (Months), with very little to show for it. Be prepared to make a fraction of what people usually make for working abroad. To make it worse they write the checks in a way that you CANNOT understand or make sense of. I can have several checks in which I've worked the SAME hours with the SAME pay, and the amounts will be hundreds of dollars off. It is also not a job for someone who likes   a solid schedule. You may find out 2 days in advance that you will be going to Asia for 2 months, and then may end up staying longer after the hitch is ""over"". The job is definitely not for everyone, including myself."
bad,Oceaneering pays the absolute lowest wadges in the industry. Due to the pay they hire individuals that couldnt typically hold a job any where else. So in return the Supervisors are left dealing with incompetent individuals in a offshore environment.
bad,"The company constantly complains about poor integration, none working basic functionality but Sr. management doesn't want to put the necessary process management in place to rectify the technology problems that bring the business to a grinding halt."
bad,"Oceaneering could be a great place.  The employees are talented but are left with legacy leadership that can't think out of the box.  They don't allow their employees to be creative or empower them to do great things.  "
bad,"Promotions used to happen often, sometimes biannually if you kept up with your competency program, but with the oilfield downturn all ROV promotions and pay raises have been put on hold until further notice. "
bad,"Can't recommend until oil prices rebound.  "
good,Oceaneering is called the gateway company into the Oil and Gas industry.  Come in knowing nothing about Oil and Ga and leave with knowledge you learned by OJT only.
good,"aprendi que para ser e acontecer é preciso ,ter humildade reconhecer erros para acertar ,e ajudar o meu próximo e saber conviver com as diferenças."
good,"I learned a lot about building umbilical's, and how they work underwater."
good,"Good place to work and up your skills in your field."
good,"I was there over a year, enjoyed it. Management was a bit disappointing, not very supportive. Some good jobs on site, a lot of heavy lifts, some not so good jobs that riggers shouldn't be doing."
good,A good workplace and workforce. Openly unionised. Very much in the mold of who you know over what you know. Lots of hours worked with little in return.
good,Its a hard culture to conform to and the lifestyle doesnt really pay off unless you enjoy being out at sea away from life. Meet some interesting people and get to do some interesting stuff but ultimately I dont recommend
good,"it used to be a great company, changes in office management tore the place down.  more interested in keeping bp happy than keeping employees happy"
good,"In order to make a decent wage you need to be available to work offshore for extended periods which, if you have a family, could put a tremendous strain on your household."
good,Compensation was great! The relaxed environment was great at first but it became clear after a while that it was to relaxed. I love the work i did but i did not like the environment i had to work in. It was very confrontational. I did not feel like management had my back when it came to coworkers causing problems and picking fights about anything.
good,This company has changed in the 6 years since i have worked there. They have had many layoffs and seem to want dedication and loyality at a small price.
good,"I agree with the review that stated there is a hostile work environment. A typical climb-the-ladder and don't mind who you step on, back stabbing kind of place that is big on playing favorites. If you're not into that, if you just want to do your work and mind your own business, you may be ok there. It all depends on who puts a target on you."
good,"Work was challenging and rewarding. Many good people but the work environment is hostile overall. It is a dog eat dog atmosphere with the leader of the pack (management) playing right along. "
good,"This is good place in general to work at, and the other employees are good to work with. However, there is clique of clowns who came over from Newport News Ship Building and they are the ones who give out the ""raises."" Get what you can coming in as, the raises are garbage for outsiders. Not even cost of living."
good,"On the government side of Oceaneering, they are just looking for Captains and not real experience people. They are going to loose people with real work experience."
good,A good company if you just want to sit around and collect a pay check with benefits.  Management is not professional and there is no opportunity for advancement.
good,"The pay and hours were good.  Management was OK, but they never seemed to stick to one idea long enough for it to truly fail or succeed.  No real company culture and low morale.  Also, the location was kind of lacking."
good,"Great company and benefits. Due to current industry market, no advancement. Great people and provide training necessary to carry out job duties. Very easy going work environment."
good,Management was out of touch with shop employees. Critical lack of communication and understanding. My co-workers and shop personnel were the greatest and we all got along well. Job became extremely off the hook and over demanding. Motivation did not exist for me. Company needs too implement ISO-9001 and stick to it. To many insist on doing things  outside ISO plans and process.
good,"Not challenging enough, employees are treated as what they are (just employees).  Not enough training on the technical or operational aspect.  I did get intense training of safety and equipment usage.  Management never around to get an input from the employees.  The chances for advancement are very slim, hence employees get stock at the same position for years or forever.  The hardest part of the job was just dealing with the heat, not very challenging.  The part I enjoyed the most is the family atmosphere between the employees and co-workers.   We where a very close group, hence we took care and watch for each other."
good,"Really good projects and experiences. Good entry job into the engineering world. Co-workers are generally helpful. Newly implemented career framework is great for engineers going into management, bad for engineers who like to work on projects."
good,"The Job is like at any Typical MNC services."
good,"Whilst onshore, work can be very stagnant and days tend to drag without somthing to keep the mind busy."
good,"I didnt mind the on call 24/7. What I didnt like was that they would call you 2 or 3 hours before saying you would have to be at the dock in Louisiana by a specific time with very little notice. The pay is good, but you have to be ready at a moments notice to leave."
good,Fellow technicians have great camaraderie.  This is a good company for an introduction into the Oil and Gas Industry.  Management will pick favorites a lot of times for the higher paying offshore jobs though.
good,No long were there opportunities for advancement. Traveling was hard for work and losing the travel pay as well as pay cuts made it difficult to balance work and home life.
good,"Management changes were difficult buy company culture is great and employees got along well, good team work but the downturn in the oil and gas industry dissolved many positions."
good,"6am -6pm Shipping and Receiving delivering items fast pace. Item stock, Poor Management could have ran alloy better, Great coworkers, Nother I could not handle, making everybody`s job easier"
good,"With the recent oilfield difficulties, Oceaneering is laying off employees at this time. Because of this Oceaneering is not truly hiring for the gulf coast area."
good,Made great money when working but the weeks without work were unbearable. Just had a new born baby and really needed to work. When I would call to ask about work I would get the run around.
good,The work life balance was decent but the culture in some of the groups was a bit toxic. Definitely not for everyone
good,"its a safe diving company that works in the gulf of mexico, Africa, trinidad, mexico. well known for safey records and setting the bar for safety as far as dving companies go in the americas region."
good,Created and managed all things Training.  Very Operations based company and very political in their promotions. Global Operations that are very siloed and do not communicate well causing lots of rework.
good,I didn't always feel like I was supported in my job.  There were a lot of egos to have to deal with.  Not everyone was treated with respect or kindness.
good,"The management is a pain, There's not really any normalcy to schedules, You can work for 9 or so months out of the year and only make about 65-70K, Unpredictable working schedules, can't plan anything, raises are a joke."
good,It is unclear  what is to happen or to be accomplished in the company. There is not enough interest in the career development and advancement of the full time employees.
good,I didn't work for this company I worked with them and this questionnaire is pulling random words from my resume and assuming they're jobs makes it very dificult to apply for positions.....
good,"Sometimes it was stressfull ; The shop needs to be more organized ; Never had raises , Choose , pick who wanted go off shore, and needs to be better rotation ."
good,Oceaneering are the gatekeepers of the rov. The pay is not the greatest and they will lay you off when the industry doesn't do great. I think there was kind of a disconnect between new guys wanting training and the rov supervisors.
good,"Did not have a great experience with the company. I was not a cultural fit."
good,At Oceaneering a typical day was gathering information to compile the document for which we were writing. Verify that information and talk to engineers to ensure it's accurately documented.
good,"Very busy, non-stop place to work with flat management structure and approachable management. Recent market conditions made job very hard in last 2 years with continuing redundancies which affected morale. People I worked with were great."
good,Great place to work and great people to learn from. If they took advantage of the skills and knowledge the have will have a team that can accomplish anything.
good,"Oceaneering provides great benefits for their employees. Unfortunately due to a downturn in the oil industry, they have laid off thousands of employees, myself included."
good,"Good place to work, lots of travel internationally if you want it.  Friendly folks which were the best part of the place prior to 2015.  Once the oil slump kicked in high gear, people needed to wear flak jackets at work."
good,"This is a great place to work and learn. There are some very good technicians working here. It is a great place to learn. That is especially true, if you're from "
good,"My day begins with the proper PPE. We have a safety meeting before any job starts. We use the right tools for the right job. Safety comes first, it is my priority."
good,Don't even try to get a job here unless the oil field is doing good. The hardest part of the job is not being at home with your family when you want to be. You will be working offshore on oil rigs and away from your family for up to a month at a time but you will be home with your family for up to a month.
good,"Friendly co-workers "
good,"working here was cool, but the pay was horrible because it was through a staffing agency and on top of that they didn't offer insurance"
good,"Management could have been way better, no job security do to the oil field. I learned a lot due to the tech. that trained me. I had some pretty cool co-workers we all got along very well. Hardest part of the job was dealing with management, they would act like they had no trust in the workers and treated us like kids."
good,"I would recommend this company for a flat line job.  "
good,Had the opportunity to exposed to factors related to NDT inspections & ROVs. The hardest part of the job was difference in mentality towards work of colleagues
good,"Good environment to work in.  General office duties.  Worker's compensation prepartion, filing"
good,"E uma boa empresa para se aprender pois te possibilita ver varis escopos de trabalho não fica limitado apenas em um foco só, paga em dia todos os funcionários e seus beneficio também. Tem ótimas pessoas para poder aprender e a crescer. Parte difícil e os maquinários são muito velhos e ultrapassados e os salários poderiam ser um pouco melhor."
good,"Excellent benefits - if that's what you're looking for. The pay depends on what division you enter the company, so do your research."
good,"A big company on its way to be huge, but that's not always a good thing."
good,The people at this compnay were great people to work with felt like family
good,Empresa bem equilibrada em todos os quesitos e trabalho em ritmo equilibrado
good,This is an oil and gas company . Everything more about getting the product out than about your safety. This plant could getnvery dangerous at time. So be cautious
good,"Awesome crew of guys to work with who were willing to help a green designer get his feet under him and gain experience."
good,"The company in general pays well and has good benefits.   The culture of the company is changing for the worse.   The company used to value loyalty and service, and was a very enjoyable place to work.  Oceaneering now values the ""friends and family network"" of hiring and promotions if you know the right people.  (You are set if you are coming from Baker Hughes)."
good,Good place to work but not stable for long term.  The company in the space system is small so when a contract is lost then it affects all parts of the sector.  It is unstable in that regards but it was great when funds were available.
good,6 weeks out of 2 months are spent offshore. 12+ hour days inspecting oil and gas platforms. Short on staff due to layoffs which is seen as a money saving technique. Great people.. for the most part.
good,Love working here but not much opportunities for advancement in desired sector.
good,Very busy daily with lots of request from varies department but you may learn alot from the global team. problem there too much politic and problem will kept coming.
good,"Falta de visão de longo prazo, metas bem definidas e plano de carreira."
good,Good overall culture to be involved with. Safety conscience with attention to personal aspects.
good,"- Reunião diáris com a Supervisão e Gerência operacioinaç para melhor definição do Planejamento. Controle, requisição e devolução de matéria prima para produção. substituição direta aos Supervisores de fábrica em caso de doença ou férias. Responsável pela ferramenta 5'S e suas auditorias diárias. Preparação de documentação para produção. Relatóriois diáriois e semanais para a gerência e GM."
good,its an ok company too work for dont like being away from home though the management is ok depend on where you end up
good,"Overall a great place to work, Great benefits package, But below average pay. "
good,"Supervise 14 employees, and approve 7 employee's time. I run orders for international and Gulf of Mexico shipments. I was at the company for 6 months and got a promotion to Lead Material Handler. I like my job because I'm able to give great customer support. The hardest part of my job is letting it go! I always want to continue my work until it's complete but sometimes that is just not possible."
good,"Oceaneering can be a great place to work, if you work for ROV. Do not ever go to work for DTS. ROV is a collaborative, helpful, positive work environment. They build up their employees and provide advancement and training. "
good,The technicians are excellent to work with. If you need help they are willing to help you at anytime. Management is in dire need of improvement. They tell you everything is going to pick up in the next couple of months (which it never does) just to keep you around.
good,"The offshore crews are good to work with as long as you do NOT mix with the boat crew or ROV crew. "
good,"> um dia de trabalho,movimentação de carreteis de 28 pes com o truck e mov com empilhadeiras"
good,"Os membros de toda equipe são ótimos, porém existe alguma dificuldade de comunicação entre as áreas, o que acarreta uma série de problemas."
good,Oceaneering was a company that helped me to grow up professionaly. I had an excelent manager. Hardest part of the Job was to meet the dead line of a load out.
good,"An ISO certified company that has a diverse portfolio with a culture of safety, training and development.  I worked in the Entertainment Systems Division as a subcontractor."
good,Was lovely when I first started and then the good ol' boys club showed their ugly face and made everything seem segregated. that's when everything changed.
good,Good Company that is trying to re-establish new culture in Subsea Projects Industry. Significant change in upper management over past 2-5 years which has brought in a number of new assets from outside the company to energize the team.
good,"worked for 12year+, and was sad to leave, due to redunncy,  worked well with others and was part of a good team that has unfortunately been reduced over the years."
good,"I was in management so I did not have any typical day's, learned a lot"
good,"Oceaneering treats their own as family, taking care of you as long as you get the job done. Colleagues are also helpful and friendly, where team-building is strongly encouraged"
good,"Repaired and built equipment that the engineers requested each day.   I was involved with work orders, safety briefings, and job briefings."
good,"Good company in booming times,but when oil price slumps people get laid off.I have learned more in 7 years than in my whole life before.I learned to fly a robot remotely 2 km under the sea and using various high tech equipment. Also how to troubleshoot a problem when the vehicle needed attention. Absolutely loved my job and the challenges it provided.Worked with people of all races and became very good friends to this day.Hardest part off the job was not being 100% sure about the longevity of  the contracts you worked on."
good,"Oceaneering is a major innovator in the subsea oil and gas sector. The company is smaller than many competitors which helps drive the culture of innovation in new products. The management is comprised largely of long term employees who have risen through the ranks, most with engineering backgrounds."
good,"Empresa bastante familiar. "
good,"Good entry level programming company.  If you excel, recognition will come.   If you are average to good, get a couple years experience then find a job that pays better."
good,"The day to day environment is very dynamic depending on the production schedule.  At any given time various problems can arise and all duties will be shifted in order to solve the current problem.  There are many different departments and sometimes communication and involvement between departments can be very difficult.  I learned an immense about the equipment, Lean Six Sigma, and the various types of behavior issues one can encounter in a large corporate company.  I found the majority of my coworkers to have less drive than I would have preferred and most of them tried to do as little work as possible and never stepped up to the plate to contribute to the team."
good,"Starting out you have to prove your worth to the company. Being from the area or knowing a lot of people in the right places helps alot. Some supervisors are not very pleasant to work with while some are great and would take the time to train others. Pay is sub par compared to other ROV company employees. Good safety culture on paper as long as you have adequate time to do your job safely. If they are in a hurry or waiting for something to be fixed in a hurry, its all out the window."
good,It was the best ROV company I had ever work for. Great training program both in class hands on and online. All the folks that work in the office were always willing to help you with what ever you needed even if it was not there job. How much money you made was up to you and how many days you will willing to work offshore.
good,"With a flexible work schedule and casual dress code, the office environment was laid back and comfortable.  Being new to ROV operation and safety issues,  there was never a shortage of lessons to learn.  Oceaneering puts a premium on safety and their ability to make it work.  The biggest obstacle is learning the unique platform architecture."
good,"Empresa com boa colocação no mercado, porém com poucas oportunidades de crescimento"
good,"Great company to work for excellent benefits and job opportunities, but a very unpredictable and unbalanced schedule."
good,"Everyday Oceaneering became a school. And the teachers were supervisors with extensive knowledge of ROV's. Where everyday I learned something new, what made ​​me proud to be a pilot ROV."
good,"Com relação a salário e beneficios é excelente, tem muito cursos para o crescimento na parte técnica, infelizmente os cursos são feitos no dias de folga."
good,The company was good company and going through software and/or accounting procedure changes.  There was a employee turnover while is was there on a contract job.  I was moved to another industrial style location.  The group seems nice and facility.
good,Oceaneering provides a work/life balance job. A self learning environment which provides opportunity to strengthen knowledge roots. Growing opportunities in Oceaneering India can improve salary ranges . Overall a nice place to work in India with 3.5 rating.
good,It is a nice place to work at. Great benefits. Not enough training and poor management. The work atmosphere is very friendly. New hiring employees need more technical trainings.
good,The career I have at oceaneering is one that I thoroughly enjoy. The culture and work environment is great. There is a wealth of knowledge among the employees that keeps me learning and always challenged. Overall I enjoy my experience within the company.

good,Go in motivated. The management will help you grow. There is a plethora of positions available if you want to move up. It's up to you. There's always LMS ( LEARNING MANAGING SYSTEMS } which opens the door for growth.
good,Working inventory control between multiple warehouses building amusement ride vehicles for Universal Studios in Beijing China. Secure control of parts and hardware to release to assembly technicians.
good,"good company to work for overall, there where times it was touch and go but its the offshore life and you have to know what you are getting yourself into, but would advise accepting call if you get it"
good,"Joining the Oceaneering Team was an exciting experience. Their expansive industrial influence makes for amazing career routes to choose from. Providing some of the best Benefits that I've experienced throughout my working career. During my four years with the team I was able to hone my TIG and MIG skills and learn to work outside of a Military structured work environment. With all the multiple venues to grow within that company, it was disturbing to find that the growth in the local area was limited to the Military maintenance and refit programs. Slow growth potential and slow pay scaling with a culture of ownership that presides individual development."
good,"Business related detailed day.  No relationship with employees .  Strictly business.  There are not a lot of employee related activities."

Plenty of overtime and sea time, Learn a lot of new equipment, work with some really talented people, Just time off is unheard of, I spent 3 months aboard a derrick barge with no relief. Management didn't rotate people as they should you are just a number or another set of boots in their eyes. Enjoyed working here when I first started but then a pattern emerged of bad management and PM's not caring for the men under them."
good,"Very positive place to work, the company has grown faster than they can staff and trainf employees. Otherwise a greast place."
good,Empresa agradável de trabalhar com bom relacionamento no meu setor de trabalho.

Great work life balance but I feel that they always prefer female candidates over male candidates when performance is discussed."
good,"Oceaneering is a good place to work. Every job has its negatives, and Oceaneering is having to chart its course through the new market just like everyone else. Ultimately, it is a decent place with good people."

All diving equipment inventoried, maintenance conducted, and prepared for operations daily. Every two hours making rounds on Life Support Equipment. Conducting Diving Bell recovery/launch operations. Learning more about Electrical/Electronic equipment, HVAC and Hydraulic systems. Co-workers are diverse in appearance, character, and backgrounds which makes for interesting conversation when there is time.

Only problem is a lack of consistency in work schedule and pay rate."
good,"Teamwork oriented work"
good,"My review was exceptional  performance, Very close to home during my career here and this is an great company The management was not as involved as I would have liked for them to be.

My co-workers were my supervisors, we are a 3 man crew to install and setup everything. Long hours up to 84 plus hours a week 7 days a week and up to 12 weeks at a time. traveling to country to country was the hardest part of the jobs.

good,"A typical day at work includes processing invoices by checking for correct codings against PO and making sure the items match.  Reconcilation of accounts,  match exceptions/ RNV.  I also voucher the invoic into people soft along with scanning and linking.  My job has been rewarding to me when I forst started I had no experince.

I love the fact that I have been  given the opportunity to learn new skills with this job  through the help of god management."

The most hardest part of the job is during summer time in the middle east and the most enjoyable part is when you complete the daily task safely."
good,"Work included electrical, hydraulic, and mechanical maintenance and repairs, along with the piloting of the ROV. Hardest element of the job was executing repairs while simultaneously maintaining high standards of quality and safety and diminishing non-productive time. While piloting the ROV required extreme spatial awareness, non-traditional hand/eye coordination, and the ability to multitask - it was easily the most enjoyable aspect of the work."
good,Working for OII was a nice place to be. While working in the Safety Dept. it was never a dull moment and always had to be on your toes and  prepared for anything. My manager was opened minded and listened to suggestions made. I know I have many long term friends from the job that I will cherish. When there was a need everyone came together to help. The benefits were the best. The hardest part of the job when learning to disconnect at the end of the day. The most enjoyable part was there always seem to be laughter in the room.

good,"The workplace is filled with good people, but the offshore work is extremely unpredictable.  Three day jobs can be extended to a month, and having under 24 hours notice to go offshore is an often occurrence.  However the safety culture that has permeated the company is very well managed and encouraged by many.  I enjoyed to work mostly because of it's variety."

good,"I loved working for Oceaneering as a data processing clerk and I would have stayed long term if it wasn't for the horrible co-workers that management did nothing about. I had never been so bullied and put down in my life. Really wish management would have done something about them, not like they worked anyways. "
good,Work was very simple and everyone had everything they needed to get the job done.  The computers worked fast and all the programs needed were fine.  Management treated employees well.  We would have cake for employees birthdays the first of every month. The co-workers were very nice and I got along fine with them.

good,"I was an ROV technician and pilot working on a variety of missions and vessels from subsea asset inspection on drilling rigs to suction pile setting on anchor boats.  This was the coolest job I've ever had and I loved every minute with Oceaneering.  The people were great, the job was fun and exciting, there was opportunity for advancement, and they paid well-enough.  Unfortunately, I could not justify these things against being away from my two young sons for long periods of time (as you generally must travel offshore for 2+ weeks at a time for your work shift) so I left the company."

good,"Overall good company. Relaxed work environment, fexible schedules, pay could be better.  Management is good, just depends on the department you are in."
good,"I loved my time at Oceaneering. We would work 12 hour shifts on a 21 day rotation. The only downside to the job was the time away from family.

However, things have begun to bounce back and I know anyone working at Oceaneering will benefit greatly."

good,"One of the best companies to work for in the area of Ship Repair, including employee benefits which are second to none as it relates to the other competitors.  The work environment is comfortable, with typical expected stressful situations as it pertains to deadlines.  I would rate the overall management team as above average, with your typical exceptional leaders filtered in to balance things out.  The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting the deadline ahead of schedule, with all the paperwork properly certified.  The hardest part of the job is when the supply chain fails us and we're forced to improvise (but that goes with most performance based companies)."
good,"A typical day at work I tired as much as to be safe and anybody around"
good,"enjoyed my interview with the company. It worked out pretty well into my favor, was worth going down for the job. you simply fill out some paperwork and leave the overhead to do its job . After that sit and listen to them rant and take the weld test and move on. One of the few companies in Virginia that can clean up after itself."

good,A good place to work either offshore or office based. Very good culture and personal friends. There are a lot of opportunities but currently they are limited due to the downturn in the Oil industry
good,Working for Oceaneering was a great challenge. I wish the off shore industry had not fell out but it did and now I'm looking to take my talents someplace else.
good,"Oceaneering is filled with immensely intelligent and talented team members who are more than willing to mentor and share information freely.

good,"Great company to work for. Only left due to personal life issues. Management is competent, open to new ideas and accessible. Great working environment and really invests in their employees."
good,Working there as a temp was a great experience. I was not fortunate to secure a full time job. The management I worked for was fantastic and very thoughtful. The Administrative Assistant was awesome and very kind. She taught me a few things I did not know and I am grateful for that.

I also produced isometric piping drawings for these reports as well. Summer is the busiest season for this job. The management and my co-workers were both very dedicated. I enjoyed my time there.

good,"Coming in early at 6:30am could be hard but the fact you gotta love what you do to make the day go smoothly. Those whom come in early start to work as soon as we had that first cup of coffee. Then again as soon as it was made we stop for a minute and take off to work. After the cycle count is completed then the pullers whom some also does they cycle count start pulling parts for customers.  I help in anyway I can to find along with a couple of other co-workers to find the part in question. Sometimes it is just simple and was put into the wrong location or an older location.  Help do bin to bin locations for the part being moved and also making new locations on the computer system.  My boss/Manager is easy going but tough when needs to be. It seems like one of the coffee pots is always empty when I am near it and he wants his coffee. He looks at me and ask did i get the the last cup. LOL  The warehouse/inventory leads is the same way. Fun and also when need to be all business. The leadership in inventory along with the folks I work with are like family. The best part that is not work is when we eat on our own time. We love the cajun culture of eating Boudin the first Thursday of the month and having lunch/breaks together. I do miss everyone there but hope that one day."

good,"The first day I walked into Oceaneering I realized I didn't know as much about subsea assembly as I thought. My co workers were we cool with explaining the proper procedures that OIE followed to create the awesome products they do. The 10-12 hour days were tough at first but once you get into that groove, it moves pretty quick. The thing I loved about it the most was that we were all there fir each other and had each others back when it got hard to finish a deadline. Unfortunately I had some severe health issues that didn't allow me to be there as much as needed, so understandingly I was let go. BUT however, I have been fixed by the doctors and am looking to reestablish myself with the company. I currently have apps in for review."
