good,"I worked as a Seasonal Sortation Associate during the busiest time of the season (Thanksgiving/Christmas). It is a typical factory type work, morning briefing, stretch, and walk to your assigned position for the day. No fuss talking with others unless there is down time. Management stresses safety and I appreciate that they do care about their workers. The warehouse can be very chaotic at times with the huge amount of packages coming through the main lines, or specific auto sortation locations with constant heavy volume. Training is available to learn and do different tasks, but you have to make a strong effort to reach out to 'Learning'.  Guidance for success is minimal, so you have to have drive to learn by asking. Overall, the job is easy to quickly learn, no micromanagement looking over your shoulder. I think a lot of the monitoring is done through cameras so don't expect to be lazy and get paid.  I enjoyed working with a few management associates and they do have a passion for their job.  Sadly, due to a high volume of work, worker turnover due to many seasonal positions, you never really establish a connection with anyone including management."
good,"Esperienza lavoro top, part time e da casa"
good,"The pay is good (15$/h). There are many different shifts available but once you choose a shift you stick with it indefinitely. A typical day goes like this. Get to work, punch in, pick up bags and packages and put them on carts. take the carts to a specific location, rinse and repeat."
good,"Fast paced and hard going. Rewarding and simply work. Enjoyed my time there, support at all times. Amazon management was really great, some of the agency staff working there were a bit of a disappointment."
good,"As a Former Amazon Employee My Experience at Amazon Was Amazing."
good,"I’d rather not respond, but working there in the beginning was an great experience until everyone find out I was pregnant I felt like everyone was tip toeing around me and I didn’t like that, I was there for the seasonal job and was told I can come back after I had my baby which I didn’t understand because my pregnancy has not stopped me from working nor did I ever complain about working with my pregnancy I don’t understand why I was told to come back after if anything I could’ve stayed and gotten a maternity leave"
good,"Very busy and fast paced, travel all over New York city to deliver packages. Manage employees to see if packages were delivered on time. Made sure the packages that were ordered for the customer was correct."
good,"On travaille en équipe mais c comme on est une famille. "
good,It was a best place and I learnt initial lessons of my life there. People are very friendly and helpful. I'd recommend Amazon to my friends.  It was a great experience.
good,Fun and interesting.Everyday was a new challenge and great Co-workers.More effort should be put into knowing your employees and utilizing their skills and strengths.
good,"Amazon is a good company. The pay is awesome. The hardest part about the job is that you're on your feet the majority of your shift, so it does take  a toll after a while but you will get use to it. The thing about Amazon that I would like to see change is there communication between management and their HR staff. You have to make sure that the two know what's going on if there's a discrepancy. I've learned time management while working for Amazon. Because the facility is so big you have to learn to maneuver through the building in a timely fashion!"
good,Travaille très fatiguant un peut dur au début mais sa aller
good,tout c'est bien passer aucun soucis lors de ma mission chez amazon
good,Lo correcto es llegar a tiempo 15 minutos antes para recoger los paquete y terminar a la hora que se te asigna
good,"Was a great position for my 2 year run. The fact that it was work from home was very beneficial for me as a single parent. The only downfall is that during the holiday season they expect you to work 35+ hours. With working an already full time job at 40 hours a week, there is no way I could work almost 80 hours a week, be a full time parent and breath a little bit. I made it work for the first year but to me Part time means part time, not 5 hours shy of full time. Other then that, it could be beneficial who is going through job transition, or part time student."
good,"While it can at times be a stressful place to work given the demands and deadlines, I always appreciated that as it was pushed me to develop a work ethic and a determination to push through moments when the workload may get on top of you and it prevented complacency from creeping in to my performance."
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, hay compañerismo, se recalca muchísimo la importancia de la seguridad ante la calidad y cantidad de productos."
good,"Over all amazon is a good paying job. It's a friendly easy going place to work. But Amazon wants to much Mandatory Overtime around the holidays, the time people wanna be aroud family."
good,Flexible with scheduling and easy to access locations . Never bored and always busy with high benefits when quota is met. Once hired on permanent benefits are really nice and worry free
good,no problem with amazon very good company the drivers are all very friendly to make thebcustomers happy and the staff wich prepare the parcels are very careful
good,"You just sort boxes. Stand there wait for boxes to come to your section, then sort the box based on what is written on the box. Scan and go. You are ranked by speed."
good,"I worked for an Amazon LLC Warehouse and the job was one of the best jobs I've ever had. I was a product lister so I just had to make sure products were in good shape and price them. Pretty easy, pay is superb, stable hours."
good,"Ambiente de trabajo divertido con café gratis, valores innovadores y ganas de trabajar."
good,"Ok...Head down and sort packages. Strenuous work demanding a rapid pace. Small, very limited benifits and don't be late or a no show....No forgiveness."
good,"We are all set tasks with time limits which should make a difference. It should all even out which should also dictate scheduling up or down....over time or schedule time. Take an associate who works steady pace, yet over achieves or completes considerable amount of tasks while you have marginal associates there to sneak by. Management continues to ask for extra help because marginal associates get paid same wages"
good,"Amazon was good, it got really busy over Christmas period but it’s a good job and it pays good money. Maybe one day in the future I will return but for now I’m looking for something else."
good,Amazon 4-star was and still is a brand new concept that an only online company is attempting to conquer and it shows. This is a very very fast pace environment where policies that were in place a week ago may be obsolete the next. Your tasks are constantly changing and everyone is scrambling trying to keep up with all the changes going on. Amazon did a fantastic job hiring a very diverse and trustworthy team that i would recommend to anyone. With the right mindset and ability to adapt to change quickly anyone can be a star at Amazon. They do a great job of showing recognition of their employees and try their best to make sure everyone is treated fairly and equally.
good,Flexible and great pay job. It is tiring but it is worth every penny and the time. Schedules are horrible and you will be tired no doubt! APPLY great benefits too
good,"Fun and exciting place to work in and opportunities for working in different areas and working different tasks. However after a 9 month period of working on behalf of an agency there is a slim to none chance of being kept on after that. "
good,"I would suggest people to work at Amazon if they want to enjoy their at workplace, but if you are working at lower levels, pays are very less...as compared to other companies"
good,Amazon is a really great job. The warehouse is not as bad as you would think. The management is a little off. Some co-workers are terrible. And some buildings have little to no security. But overall I loved the job
good,A lot of walking and very boring but I am only a seasonal associate. Was hoping to be full time but they don't convert anyone to full time if your seasonal (say they do but lie) heard from several people who work there and no longer work there that they don't. Not hard work & LOVE only working 4 days a week after peak. 10 hr days. Also Medical insurance is FREE! Your not trained well and told not to do something & then told to do it by someone else and so on..aggravating but I still like it. Worth it compared to factory options where I live.
good,I've worked for several different types of warehouses and Amazon quite honestly was the easiest work. Pay wasn't very much but there was usually overtime to choose from.
good,Could be better hr department unfair with proven circumstances and reasons for missed time or happenings the Tim they give you is ok but a point system should be in effect cause it’s people own fault if they waste their time but the points should be enforced if they use time without reasonable notice
good,Good working culture. Growth ladder is  not transparent. good company to work only for short time cant build one's career with given minimum option.ok to work for short period
good,"Good and encouraging work place. It’s something that you can do for some time, then expect something better and good. For those who are seeking for something to manage for something tome. Hours are flexible"
good,"My day begins at 7 am and ends at 5:30 pm. We clock in, do stretches, then make a mad dash to the area we are working. All four of my managers have been great and understanding. The hardest part of the day is standing for ten hours and not being able to get to the bathroom easily. The people I have met is the best part of the job but would be nice if you could talk to them while you worked."
good,They do not work with you to change schedules. Amazons pond if you dont like it get out mentality by management and workers. Benefits are awesome and maternity leave is great but day to domay work you are just a number and they do not care if they lose you.
good,je trouve que l'equipe et simpa je trouve que le personnelle et droit convivable le personel et correcte las bas
good,"Smart people, strong work ethic, business challenges. High expectation that you manage and navigate your career. Some flexibility in WFH/remote based on the team."
good,Good working enviroment  weight lifting is regular. Office politics also present. Long timing of shifts and shifts timings are early. Very professional in services. Good company policy to work.
good,You stay busy all the time. Beginning of shift you stretch which I think It is great the company does this so people don't get hurt as much lifting and moving all these boxes. You can move to different positions if you want to so you don't do the same thing over and over again.
good,Working long hour shifts kept me busy. No time to loiter and chitchat. You are expected to produce 3-4 packages per minute. Management is flexible and friendly. Very loud environment due to heavy machinery.
good,"Rapporto ore mensili/retribuzione è buono, lavoro non leggero ma se li affronta nel modo giusto non causerà problemi"
good,"There is no flexible rules never be late, HR representatives all say something different but you will feel burnt out after the 4th week. I worked the 4:30 am - 8:30 am shift and the hardest part is trying to balance the rest of the day because you are tired"
good,"Long hours and good pay for a non occupied single person like me."
good,"It was very productive. Safely performs all tasks in a safe manner and following all safety regulations."
good,I enjoyed the co-workers in my department and learned to be efficient along side of them.  I gained knowledge in almost every department; inbound and outbound.
good,"Warehouse Associate- Responsibilities include: Picking orders, loading/unloading, separate orders onto"
good,"Retail can be unforgiving, but the customer-centric experience that amazon shoots for makes it more rewarding than I would have expected. The management is great as well"
good,Great pay  just they only have 3rd shift available at the moment and no other options. Other than that I can’t think of any other bad things about it.
good,"bonne entente , respect du travaille , agréable , communicante"
good,Rad na tu praci vzpominam.Libilo se mi tam.Byla tam nejlepsi parta lidi co jsem kde zazil.
good,if your into physical labor nd meeting tons of new faces this is the job for you. very team oriented but management is somewhat poor with long working hours and short breaks
good,I was a delivery driver for Amazon and it was a great experience.  The management was very encouraging and answered all questions. The coworkers were very helpful and the environment was friendly.
good,"learned troubleshooting, strict supervisors, enjoyed watching the drones, made a lot of friends; I worked as a seasonal worker, November to January. I was injured at worked and was assigned to filing."
good,I thought that it was pretty good working there. Of course it was competitive and fast paced but it wasn't difficult at all. The job is easy and the company make you feel like you belong there.
good,"bonne entreprise, bonne ambiance, expérience agréable"
good,In general work at Amazon is very physical  it will take time to adjust   They strongly encourage focus on the opportunities for career advancement etc   Be mindful of the fact that performance and errors are tracked in the learning curve  they do give write ups which affect one’s ability to apply for a different position or transfer   If you can get through that the opportunities are there
good,"Buoni propositi ma difficile fare una carriera perchè i contratti non vengono rinnovati, ma questo dovuto secondo me alla non presenza dell'agenzia sul posto di lavoro che controlli i meriti e demeriti del lavoratore."
good,Good opportunity for anyone without a college degree. Be prepared to work long hours. Over all I enjoyed the experience. Make sure to not have a problem being on your feet for hours.
good,Working for amazon gave me great experience working inside a warehouse. As a long term job it could prove difficult depending on what you hope to achieve.
good,"Pros"
good,You must make the numbers or you will be let go immediately. It's a number game and the numbers are important but overall it was a pleasure working there.
good,The job is mentally and physically demanding and of you’re not use to working warehouse jobs than you won’t last long . They have good befits that’s start as soon as you start.
good,"Great working conditions "
good,Receive warehouse items and finish them in timely manner.scanning items with RF in fast manner. Friendly- environment and job discussions with supervisors.
good,"Best company i have worked for. "
good,Depending on placement in Fulfillment Center or Sort center mileage may vary. Wide array of tasks available to learn and do. Lots of training available.
good,"This is not a bad job to have as long as you do the work. During peak season, there are long hours and hectic movement. They bring in a couple of thousand extra temps for the seasonal rush. Just plan your day and it will go by fairly quickly."
good,Flexibility and being openminded is helpful here. Things change daily. There may be work unavailable work in certain areas and you will be required to go and assist other departments.  You must be flexible and still determined to give it your all.
good,"This was a pretty straight forward job and the team that I worked with was efficient and had no drama. The management staff was great and was there to help us succeed. Job movement, however was stagnant."
good,That job was very entertaining and easy to do .. the people was great and I learned  new things to do. I interacted with many people sharing a lot of experiences.
good,"Amazon is a great place to work. I work directly with the associates and the management team to help clear  work place, time card, payroll, and benefit issues."
good,Staff can be disrespectful at times and un organized. Late runs that start at 4 or 5 usually contain 1 or 2 packages that are for businesses which are undeliverable do to time constraints that mess your weekly stats up
good,"Nice team match. Unfortunately, the top leadership was unstable so we had this reorg and my favorite people left, so I had to follow. "
good,"Great place to work as part time job, especially during the Christmas holidays. Team mates were nice and helpful. The job is fairly easy and very fast pace."
good,Working for amazon can be great at times. I currently  have a seasonal position that will end shortly. Amazon has a flexible schedule and a number of positions.
good,"The work environment was demanding and management could have been flexible. However, I enjoyed my experience there. I would actually enjoy returning to work at Amazon."
good,ein sehr angenehmer arbeitgeber. es macht viel spaß hier zu arbeiten
good,good place to work and learn. Normal hours shift that bonus hours were given. Ability to move up is there. The hardest part of the job is at first getting used to the fast-pace environment.
good,Der Einblick in zwei der vielen Arbeitsbereiche im Lager bei Amazon war sehr interessant und die Arbeit hat sehr viel Spaß gemacht.
good,"the hardest part of the job is adapting to the almost daily changes that occur. a great challenge.  fun place to work.  the schedule and challenges to change it is sometimes an issue, but nothing that cannot be worked around."
good,"Culture feels like a startup. No day is typical at Amazon, you never stop working. Unspoken rule is 80+ hours a week. HEAVY intra-office politics and need to be first to market cause a dismally sub-par customer experience. Burnout and turn over rates are obscene."
good,I would like to work with a company that has a drive that gives me a chance too excel more & striving for the same goals  with that in mind looking forward to growth in the company always double checking my overall work
good,"It's good to work here if you're going to school or need more income. The jobs simple the standards are easily met. Bad thing is there is no advancing here, no full time, no benefits, its not a career it's a part time job at its best"
good,Was a good job with great people and benifits and room to grow. I would highly recommend people to apply there in there looking for a great company to work for.
good,ok place to work I stayed to myself always came to work on time not much exciting to say most people stay to themselves come to work and go home long hours but I didn't mind them
good,"Delivering packages based on set route for the day. Meet for standup meeting in morning, take van from lot to station, pick up set route, deliver packages for 8 to 10 hour shift."
good,"Working at Amazon is nice, the hours aren’t bad and the pay is good. Team work is really important when working at Amazon because without it nothing would get done at a reasonable time."
good,"Working for amazon was a task all by itself, you had to meet the demands that the company was asking. The pay was unfair to us because we would  do more work then what they paid us for"
good,"I working with Amazon PDX7 Salem OR, I am happy with my work at receive each and I have more friends they make me happy working work hard have fun and have learn more worked"
good,It was fine working with AMAZON. Learned a lot from AMAZON. Management was partial & supportive. Workplace culture was good. the hardest part of the job was leaving the organisation and the most enjoyable part of the job was my hard work.
good,"Work with highly energized team of managers and associates to fulfill customer orders in a timely manner.  Amazon provides fair pay and benefits, and is a fast growing company with plenty of opportunities."
good,"Its a nice job for one if they go in with the mindset that it is a great starter job or a job to supplement income. Go in do what you're asked. Nothing less. "
good,"Amazon always tries to engage with associates and makes them feel valued. You have the option of different shifts, get differential pay, holiday pay, and time and a half. It was a great company to work for."
good,"Amazon warehouses are an extremely fastpaced environment."
good,"Great economic opportunity brought to the neighborhood.  Opportunity for employment available to all that wish to work."
good,"DSD1 averaged (back then) 26,00 - 28,00 packages per day per morning shift.  Hours were 4:00 am sharp to 8:30am.  Period."
good,Amazon is a good place to start if you have never worked in warehouse. My everyday experience at amazon was overall very nice. I learned a lot about the difference between inbound and outbound. How they run.
good,"Great place to work, nice people, great benefits but pay could be better than 16/hr hard to save money or have extra when 16 dollars only covers Bill's and expenses. "
good,"The shifts are long, usually 10hrs. Breaks are short but the time goes by fast. Working as a fulfillment associate you can expect to be on your feet all day."
good,"Good place to work, great managers. There’s room to grow and find your way into management. Everyone works well together and help each other when ever someone has a problem"
good,"Third party tasks through Amazon.  This is not an empoyee of Amazon job. No set hours, just work whenever you want. You're given a list of tasks to choose from, each with different pay rates. Examples of tasks:  Data entry, extracting info from reciepts, internet research, surveys, editing, etc. Most pay very little. Payments are through Amazon, and I feel they do a good job of getting the payments to me as well as protecting my account/anonymity."
good,Great pay n good benefits they just work you like a slave 60hrs mandatory or your fired they don't care about anything but getting the product out! Do not have any kind of life because they don't care
good,Fast-paced environment able to move up quickly 10 hours shift meeting new faces as you deliver door to door have to be ready for all type of weather whether it rain or snow still having to be ready
good,"got to work from home, at my own pace, no dress code, just simple quality checks data entry and following instructions. Could take off days when I wanted"
good,you need to be comfortable with taking charge and devoting basically your life to your job. No place for people who only care about putting in the bare minimum.
good,"My experince at Amazon was friendly and a safe enviroment for the workers. The typical day of packaging boxes making sure all orders are correct, also pushing them through the assembly line to be packed onto the trucks or delivery cars. The work pace was simple, but still comes with a challenge because their is a strict time limit to ensure all orders are delivered on time. "
good,"Dynamic, competitive and fast paced. If you are willing to be fully committed and go the extra miles - Its definitely worth your time and the salary reflects the amount of effort you have invested."
good,"Amazon is a great place to work, if you like to grow in a warehouse business this is a place to go. Great pay and places to grow. I am enjoying my time at amazon and so will you"
good,"Quick on your feet, have to have great customer skills, tech savvy, nice for people who thrive under pressure, while working there I develop great customer service skills. One of the cannons of the company are customer obsession, and I live by that principle because I am obsessed about providing great customer service to people."
good,Excellent place to learn and grow. Helped in realizing real world data problems and how they are tackled at scale. Highly knowledgeable peer group who are always ready to help.
good,The work is very stressful to many hours of work low payment and is not worth ! Maybe if the only option on the market but only on that reason overal not worth
good,Bon travail où tu peux être former un peu partout donc très polyvalent
good,It was an alright place to work. The work environment was good. Timing for breaks was decent. There was enough work to constantly stay busy at all times
good,It starts off decent. Because they give you a nursery route which isn’t that many stops. I would say that’s about 55 stops which you can be done in 2 to 4 hours depending where it is located. As they see your flow they will give you more packages. They don’t want anyone slow but then again if you just take your time. I caught on quick. Not bad to me except when we have those technical difficulties with the device
good,"Learnt a lot of new skills such as sorting, pallet re-stacking, pallet receiving and how to be effective with my time while working."
good,"the managers aren't great but they try. they have a motto they go by ""we are building the plane as we fly"". so with understanding that they are personally telling you that they are learning on the go"
good,"Great, easy warehouse. I came for a month for Christmas cash, I’m still there and loving it. Communication within management could improve so everyone is on the same page."
good,great pay an 3 day weekends 10 hours work days fun place to learn how to be a leader an fun time with co workers to build great relationships an be a strong person
good,"The workplace Is alright, but your coworkers are the problem. Amazon mass hires, so a few bad apples get in. They don't start trouble, they just suck at their jobs. Considering the fact that a lot of the work there is team based, it's a real problem. The breaks feel really short. You get 15 minutes, but you also have to walk to and from the break room in that time. So you really get 8-10 minutes, depending on where you're working relative to the break room, and how fast you can walk. I was on a 3-5 hour shift, so it wasn't an issue for me at all though. Most importantly, they have an Indian call center for employee help. When I called in to resign, they totally botched it, and I have no idea how. Not only did they fail to submit my resignation and get me blacklisted, I got an email for my friends resignation in my inbox."
good,"Good place to work, always keeping you busy and have great benefits that come along with being full time employee. I would recommend as a place to work"
good,Working at Amazon is for some one who is ready for a fast pace schedule and can endure the elements of Chicago weather it is a job that requires a lot of movement so it’s best that you be in shape.
good,"Enjoyed working, learning new areas of Seattle. Learned a lot working as a driver.  Willing to be flexible with my schedule it was a nice experience"
good,Managers don't plan work schedules and job roles in the right way to avoid unnecessary staff some days or to get an agreement on the placement of employees to specific departments.
good,agréable bien que le travail soit stressant et les pause trop courte
good,Amazon is what you put into it and what you plan to do with this type.of employer. I see some of the higher level positions that are posted internally require a degree or at least two years of experience w/Amazon. That means there is room from growth if you desire and plan for that upward movement.
good,"Overall, it was a good experience. I got to learn a lot about customer service. The pay and the perks are best in the marketplace. Work place is dynamic. Most managers are friendly."
good,Great place to work if you're between jobs. Management and employee turn over is high and never enough staff.  Cross training is minimal and advancement is almost impossible.
good,"Management unorganized. Will treat you like a number. You are replaceable. Will fire you at the drop of a hat. Very wishy-washy. They will bounce you around if they are understaffed. If you work in the back of the warehouse and it's break time, you will spend 5-10 minutes of your 15 minute break just to GET to the breakroom."
good,"In Amazon devi avere spirito  di squadra ed essere fisicamente forte e dinamico . La pecca è l’orario definito notturno che però va oltre le ore 7, per chi sceglie lavoro notturno dalle 7 in poi dovrebbe essere libero per impegni del mattino appunto"
good,I was a contract worker and didn't have much visibility to benefits through the company. Management is great and collaborative and open to hear everyone ideas.
good,Gut aber schnelllebig und nicht für die Zukunft geeignet.
good,"A lot of turn over,  pay is not very good, it’s a warehouse with a warehouse environment. I was between jobs so it filled a purpose. The benefits were pretty good. The healthcare costs were some of the best I’ve ever seen."
good,A typical day will have you on your feet for 9 1/2 hours. Break rooms are well socked and restrooms are always clean. Hardest part  of the job is trying to meet production requirements.
good,"overall not a bad place to work, heavy work load at times but balanced with easy workload on off peak times. heavy turnover from time to time. many people stay a very long time"
good,"It was very flexible in terms of hours of work. The work was easy to do and the compensation fair. Good team atmosphere, but too hierarchical. Good starter company."
good,"Fun place, easygoing people and great environment. Good work/life balance and gives me an opportunity to go to school in the day time after getting off my night shift. Highly recommended to anyone looking for a good place to work!"
good,The most amazing about this job is flexible work hours. You can make your own schedule weekly. Go to station pick up your packages ; and delivery on the time.
good,"Typical day: Clock in, log onto shopper app, wait for orders, shop for orders, pack orders, repeat, clock out"
good,"Consistant work here, must be able to be physical and on feet no matter what job path you are in. I have experience with good and bad managers here at this site."
good,"Overall Amazon is a good company to be apart of, even though I only worked with them for a year I learned a lot and grew some what as a person. I appreciate them for the opportunity"
good,"I  worked at Amazon full-time for almost an year"
good,Awesome company to work for. Really good at development and grooming people to their full potential. Amazon is based off customer obsession internally and externally.
good,"fast paced "
good,Working at Amazon is best suited for individuals without any dependents as the shifts can be straining on relationships with family and friends. The benefits provided are very good and the environment is fun.
good,Great place to work at. Great work hours with overtime. Positive attitude and great team work. Great atmosphere and benefits with ability to grow with the company
good,"Working as a driver for amazon as a third party company, No perks for the job because I’m not hired directly by amazon. Although my company tries to give us some benefits but I believe by the amount of work we put as drivers we should be appreciated more. Specially from amazon it’s a 2 billion dollar company they should give back to us because at the end of the day we’re  representing them."
good,"Good paying job with benefits. Definitely a lifestyle if you have no kids, not going to school or have a second job. I wish the hours were shorter for those who families or secondary job."
good,Enjoy this job but hard time to catch schedule for work and positive and friendly and fun also new people to know help each others and communication by text and make sure everything follows directions as well
good,"Good insurance, decent pay, works well with school. The culture is not always the best. Amazon is very competitive and you do not have a specific job. The average person who works there usually are very interesting."
good,"Stressful fast-paced job environment. Work hours are too long at a time, therefore standing is too long before the pressure can be relieved from the feet, also there is too little time to eat. I did not learn anything that was of benefit to me, the job was mechanical and repetitive. I took the job because I was a student and needed work to support myself  so I worked part-time, I hated the culture, people worked in absolute silence just trying to make the required quota so as not to be called out. The hardest part of my day was walking through those rotating gates and the best part was limping back through them at the end of the day as my feet hurt badly."
good,"ambiente rispettoso pieno di ragazzi,ambiente giusto per imparare a fare il magazziniere,"
good,es una buena compania para trabajar. tiene un buen ambiente
good,"Amazon is a ok place to work at . They have benefits an different things to help you . If you like to work out a lot it’s a great place , you meet different people from different backgrounds ."
good,"The overall experience was very fast pace work,your delivering more than 100 packages a day. It have to be delivered before a certain time. My Opinion It Could be more organized"
good,"L'accueil et les agents sont très agréables."
good,muy buen ambiente de trabajo y buena relación con los encargados
good,"Amazon's OAK5 fulfillment facility, in Newark California, is a fun, physical, fast paced, sometimes noisy, great seasonal employment opportunity. Thank you."
good,"While being here, the job is mainly repetitive and pretty easy to figure out what to do. Stress levels can rise, but depends on the workers patients levels. Few hours, but always extra  work available for those who want it."
good,e un luogo che ha molta cura con il lavoro e i lavoratori
good,"nice place to work , mnagers care about employees growth. gopod facilities within work place, enjoyed every bit of time i spent here.good place to grow career."
good,Happy to have the chance to work for Amazon. It was a challenging work environment that impacted my personal growth and experience for my future.  The experience was fulfilling.
good,"You'll first be taught how the sales and production at Amazon works and the delivery process from the moment of the purchase all the way to the shipping and handling. In this job, you'll be working with the machinery of the shipping process. It was a decent temporary job, I recommend this to anyone who's trying to open their own Amazon FBA store and wants a more in-depth understanding of Amazon's business model because you'll learn exactly how your orders are processed from within Amazon's facility."
good,Amazon is a good company to work for with good benefits and a positive culture. Amazon values outside experience more than experience gained from the company so be prepared to leave the company if you want to keep your earing potential raising.
good,"I learned to communicate better with other associates, I had to Unload packages on the electric belt which went up to divert and they had to separate the packages/boxes by the letters that when scanners scanned the packages/boxes it was A B C D E F G H and J and then we go to break for 15 minutes then we pick and stage we go to the lettered Aisles and scan the packages/boxes to our cart and scan the staging area where the Amazon Drivers scan the cart put it in their vehicle and deliver it to the Amazon Customers."
good,"Clean, good pay, lots of co-workers, good environment, good management, ways to grow, fast paced work, they make work fun with contests and little events"
good,ottima sede con molti impiegati e ottima organizzazione
good,"a typical day at work lasts about 10 hours, it's hard at first but you learn to keep up afetr a few weeks or so,management is great pay is great,the most enjoyable part of the job was the workpace culture."
good,"Amazon is a Good work environment especially for those who like to keep busy. Nice conditions, clean environment & respecting staff. Amazon is the place to work!"
good,I liked working here I just didn’t like the either you work 1st shift or 3rd shift. If they had a 2nd shift I would definitely stay and for amazon. Other then that a great place to work.
good,"Not the best shifts."
good,A well oiled machine for packing and shipping orders for worldwide transport. Learn packaging regulations of merchandise restrictions and labelling. Great way to acquire communication skills and  working as part of a team. Great teamwork involved.
good,"lavoro in turni non intercambiabili una sola pausa, pagano puntualmente"
good,"es una empresa muy amigable, el método de trabajo es bueno."
good,"Had to be fast at the job to stay on rate."
good,"I worked for a temp agency that Amazon used to hire Seasonal employees. Massive facility in Lebanon, TN. Parking was always nuts! I was primarily a Picker. We had handheld devices that would list the location and amount of each item we needed. We were timed between each item. Long days with short breaks. This was also my first introduction to ""Mandatory overtime"". Not the biggest fan of that one."
good,Bisogna essere molto veloci a effettuari tutti i lavori richiesti
good,"The job itself is quite easy, however the hours are long, once you realise what your getting paid at the end of the week it’s all worth it and I’ll definitely go back again."
good,"great company and people who push you to dive deep and work hard. Everyone who works for Amazon is extremely talented, so there is alot of healthy competition. The day to day can become monotonous, but the people you meet, will make it worth coming into work everyday"
good,get business to get your foot in the door regardless of what field your looking to enter as the company offer endless opportunity once you become an amazonian.
good,"L'ambiente di lavoro è giovane, mi sto trovando bene in questa esperienza."
good,"it was amazing time and the start of my work journey, I was a picker and actually enjoy the period of my work. I have learnt a lot, and I gained experience."
good,long shift but very fast paced with outstanding pay only down fall was supervisors weren't the greatest with really bad skills to be in authoritative positions.
good,"I'm a data scientist intern. "
good,Good Place to work if you want a stepping stone in life. Good if you want to work during Christmas or the holidays to earn extra money. Flexible hours and days off
good,my time there was fine other then my manager wasn't very good at their job. also the way sick days where handled didn't really make since to me either
good,"Pay is nice, people are friendly but you are forever under staffed. They say there is room for growth but from what I have seen/heard/experienced its pretty hard to go up. "
good,"Lo que más me gusto es que se te pasa el día rapidísimo gracias a la dinámica que tienen a la hora de trabajar, difícil no veo nada siempre que pongas interés, un día en Amazon puede ser cómo en cualquier otra empresa, todo depende de tu actitud y de la gente de tu entorno."
good,"Start with shift meeting with projected workload information, then you get to ensure your station is properly set up with relevant supplies to fulfill your job. At busy times there are events/promotions to motivate. Good canteen and free tea/coffee. Additional training as needed on the job and assistance to hand for any issues."
good,"I loved working at Amazon. It was dream came true for me. I have worked for 1 year and enjoyed every moment of it. I have learned may things and understood the e-commerce business from background. "
good,They had management issues with figuring out how students work for them. They cared very little of a full time students schedule and therefore are difficult to reason with.
good,I enjoyed working with all the people that worked in our area managers were very helpful if you had any problems they helped me become faster at my job
good,I don't want to write any thing  about Amazon okay when I first started there  it was a nice place to work but as time went on it became a different place. It seems all they were worried about was rates not employees
good,I would would recommend this place to my friends or family . I enjoyed this job. I wish I could have stayed a bit longer but certain   Circumstances Arose and I couldn’t.
good,Its a great company to work for.. They can improve in air conditioning... All they had was fans and it was way to hot to work in that kind of enviorment without and kind of cooling.
good,A typical day was waiting for the totes to come down the line with the items in them. I learned to keep thing to my self. The most of the management is friendly and some of them don't care about the people who work for them. The hardest part of the job is having to deal with the lack of work on the lines.The most enjoyable of the job is getting to see what kind of items people ordered.
good,This was a great learning opportunity to learn new things. Learning how to drive a hostler truck & was able to move semi trailer around the yard. The toughest part of the job is handling the different types of weather
good,"It a good place to work , the people in the company are very nice and hard working, the best company in the world, I have to many friends working with them"
good,"I loved working for amazon. They had great training, great skill building, schooling opportunities, and was a very fun environment to work in. Also i worked for 2 different warehouses in 2 different processes"
good,"Fun environment, great people. ratings AND nice, very very busy and associates always have to be on point and be productive on their job function. thanks!"
good,"They've got some real cool stuff there. Was only an intern. In a typical day, we would do standups. Free coffee. Workload was decent and did not feel overburdened."
good,Good place to work. Cant goof off have to stay on task. Just don't like how they ended up doing the rate on everyone like your racing against each other.
good,"The working conditions are fast paced but by no means beyond reasonable demands. No job in an Amazon FC is for someone that wants to slack off but if you're willing to work hard, it is fulfilling and challenging."
good,Long hours not good pay flexibility and also room for career advancement such as education and employment advances within the company and others such as higher education within the company and outside
good,"Good environment, but time is of the essence. Being able to manage your time and hundreds of deliveries get very stressful at times. However, with the support network in place it is manageable."
good,Alles war relativ geregelt. Die Arbeitsatmosphäre war entspannt.
good,"on feet for 8 hours, walking lifting and stooping, hot and sweating all the time"
good,"Ambiente te trabajo muy tranquilo, horarios súper accesibles al igual el transporte gratuito"
good,"High energy and cheerful person, then this may be for you. No room for messing around! The pay is good but very little room for advancement. Fast Pace!"
good,"You always had something to do. If you met your goals, they would pile on more, so my coworkers always made sure not to surpass expectations, just meet them. Got $15 an hour."
good,Arrive making sure truck is organized and ready to go. Make sure all items need are in truck. Check for gas then I would start my route for the day and help others if needed
good,"Agréable journée"
good,I worked there for almost 2 years. It was stressful but an easy job. I got paid every week. It's a part time job but not enough hours. It's not a long term job with benefits.
good,"Work is not that difficult, management needs to work on motivating workers and giving credit to those who excel in their work. The culture of the workers at Amazon in my opinion makes it a great place to work. Everyone is very friendly and always willing to lend you a hand if you need help."
good,"Il y avais beaucoup d'opportunité d'évolution mais faut savoir travailler vite et organisé tout cela dans un temps très limité. L'aspect le plus agréable c'est lorsqu'on est fier d'avoir atteint notre objectif du soir. Et l'aspect le plus difficile était d'être efficace avec du matériel défectueux (scanné qui fonctionne rarement, les sac avec le code barre effacé). Asser intense quand même."
good,i recommend people fresh out of school to work there it will open other doors and get you great experience for other jobs to come in your future and you'll have great stamina
good,"Good Company, Good Benefits. Good atmosphere. Lots of travel opportunities and can move up the ladder by working hard. Tough and long interview process."
good,I had load up my truck make sure I got my packages and drive to my destination to deliver the package but sometimes it’s get hard n tricky out there because the GPS will take you to different location
good,Time goes fast ....Past pace environment...Company buys lunch for employees during holidays..Amazon provides nice safety equiptments.Holiday give away is awesome..      Great benefits.
good,Just i say that company is very good company in the logistics
good,"Mir hat der Job im allgmeinen gefallen, da man bei der Tour sein eigener ""Chef"" ist. Man ist selbst dafür verantwortlich, was mit den Paketen passiert. Das Schwierigste an dem Job war, dass die Tour ein Knochenjob ist, da man am Anfang das Auto selber beladen muss und das man Ein und Aussteigen muss,sobald man das Ziel des Paketes erreicht hat."
good,"Bon travail d'équipe. bonne formation, petite mission."
good,"Good job, very helpful. Recommend the job, good colleagues who are extremely friendly and easy to get on with. Work load was slightly repetitive however."
good,Good employer. Lots of Areas to grow. Long hours and low pay. Fast-paced environments with additional perks if you perform. Management very supportive
good,great place to learn about customer session and innovation. I wished the company invested more in developing its talents and rewarded group collaboration
good,Management not understanding to employees health. Only top performers get better working hours and other benefits. Not a family orientated organisation.
good,Iam hard worker I need job and I follow the time and rule ad regulations and iWork hard and amazon is best company it gave more specifically for me and I wanna need job in amazon and really iam hard worker
good,l'ambiente di lavoro è piacevole si lavora bene se si è un buon team
good,"I loved working here and learning some of the basics of transcription and annotation. The schedule was extremely flexible which fit my needs very well. My only complaint is that my contract was terminated (along with my coworkers) very suddenly. I would have liked the chance to reapply for a similar position. Also, I had to pay shipping to send the equipment back."
good,"per lavorare in Amazon bisogna entrare con la mentalità giusta: non dare nulla per scontato. Personalmente mi sono trovata molto bene. Nessuno ti rimprovera, ma ti spronano a dare sempre di più, in quanto, i numeri della tua produzione, devono raggiungere alti standard."
good,Excellent work environment with great management. My job requires me to have networking + software background. It has helped me grow in both application and networking domain.
good,working with Amazon I have had the chance in meeting diverse kinds of people from all walks of life. Have had the chance to strike a very good rapport with clients. Delivered good customer service at all times.
good,"Overall good experience, good work environment, friendly staff members, good training, good experience, good company to work for, learned a lot about a call center"
good,"They rely to heavy on technology and the process, no real supervision to organize work. So even though technology does provide for productivity, productivity is not always as efficient and effective as it could be. Rating system fosters negative competition, the company would argue that ""TEAM WORK"" is their vision, it isn't."
good,I took a part time job in a sort center in San Bernardino. The job was seasonal and the hours were flexible.  If you are in okay physical shape the work is not too demanding.  I didn't stay long because something else came along that paid better.  $15 per hour isn't much more than minimum wage in California.  I'm not sure that I buy into the consumerism that fuels Amazon.  It seems like a lot of resources are use transporting a lot of stuff people don't need around the world.   Will that plastic widget really make you happier?
good,A great place to work if you enjoy a good community and fulfilling work. Many people there are still close friends of mine. Nights were long but very much worth it
good,"The job pays good but is not without its share of hard work. This job will make you stand for long periods of time, keep up a current pace, and will require 110 percent. Amazon gives good benefits and is a good place to work for real hardworkers."
good,"Amazon FC especially, is a crucible to grow skill and turn normal carbon into a polished diamond. This is a job that is high stress and requires commitment and discipline. I know many people who have worked at amazon FC and used the hardened skills they learned there to grow and pursue higher jobs else where. I know twice as many if not four times as many that were never able to reach this level. Amazon plays by the rules and they expect nothing but this. Step out of line from those rules and there are policies that have to be abide by. However, they will take someone with no experience or schooling and make them into one of the best in the field they pursue no matter what it is. They offer an abundance of resources to help achieve this and give opportunities to soar, it's always up to you to achieve this. Other than that this is the perfect place for someone who's single and willing to relocate. you can go very far very quick if that is you; be warned though this job requires commitment and time. Life and work balance is on you not the company which considering what they offer is fair to ask. Overall this work place is what it is and still the best job I have ever had. You can think of it kind of like New York city, everyone there is chasing a dream and working to make it real. Amazon FC provides that at a Fulfillment center near you."
good,Overall it was a decent job for those in need of one and the pay was decent. There was always overtime and the possibility of pay increase is there as well.
good,Nice company. Great people and working environment. People are friendly especially the boses who always try to make sure you are in the right direction.
good,"Wenn Fragen gestellt wurden dann bekam man ordentliche Auskunft."
good,Working for Amazon was good and I enjoyed it but unfortunately my contract ended so I had to be let go. They were helpful and the managers were always there to help anyone when needed
good,"Good workplace to work at, however it can get really hot during summer months. You do need to be physically fit in order to keep up with the speed and the targets."
good,"Ok if you need a job, difficult if you can't stand long hours, mandatory overtime during peak hours. Peak can be 50 - 60 hour weeks for about six weeks."
good,My typical day as a helper was very physical getting in and out of the vehicle constantly. Going to different residential buildings delivering different packages throughout the day.
good,"job summary educational  any other people's Meeting and talking to them to addmisson this follow     "
good,"Out of all of the customer service places I've worked at Amazon was great mainly for having the work from home option. The biggest issue with this, though, is a lack of technical support on more advanced issues."
good,I liked working at Amazon but I worked there for a staffing agency for quite long time and  never got to work as a Amazon employee. I stopped working there to pursue other Interests.
good,"Mi sono trovato bene,colleghi molto simpatici, lavoro duro ma buona paga"
good,"Un ambiente lavorativo giovane e dinamico, attento alle necessità delle persone."
good,"It was a great experience, extremely challenging. So much growth and full of opportunities at the same time. I really enjoyed working there. Such a great company."
good,I had a great time working at Amazon Inc. It was adaptive and easy to work there. I had no hard time or difficulties at the time I worked there. I would definitely recommend to friends and family.
good,loading conveyor belts to scanning parcels to loading and unloading trucks working as part of a team chilled place to work and meet new friends. some managers were w*nks but some was really friendly and helpful
good,"very fast environment good team leaders,explained job very clear and loud. very helpful, always friendly welling to teach you again and again if you did not understand how to do something."
good,It was a lot of manual labor but a lot of freedom to rest and recoup to continue working. The supervisors are attentive and every employee has been friendly and teamwork is encouraged.
good,I was very happy when I got a job offer after clearing all the rounds of interview.I was truly amazed about the facilities and advantages provided when i joined this company.Very nice work culture and a pleasant working environment especially for young graduates.One of the top ecommerce industry in the world.
good,"Its a fun place to work"
good,Enjoyed the experience. This company provided me the on site experience to manage 200+ personnel on a daily basis. This was what I needed to round my resume for future growth
good,I went into my employment with amazon trying to make some good money at a pretty stable job. Upon being hired i realized that it was very unorganized.
good,"Every day we left the huddle meeting with brilliant and confident strategic objectives to pull the best of the day. it is a good company."
good,"People management, Reporting, Quality analysis, Projects, Operations, Hiring, Cash applications, Stake holder calls, meetings, Drive team numbers, Disputes (etc)"
good,It’s an ok place to work if you like to walk. The people a lot nice. Good benefits very good pay as well. If you want to work and leave then come back you can.
good,"A typical day at work would be sorting packages, picking product, packing the product and shipping it out. Making routes for delivery drivers. A well repetitive work load."
good,"it was a very stressful job they always want you to work night shift, the hours were very long and the control inside the warehouse were pretty intense"
good,Easy roles but doesn't challenge my skills at all and after few weeks of working there you don't feel very motivated. Hard to change your role if u wish
good,I enjoy working for Amazon. I just wish my position was full time and I didn't have to apply each day for a shift. There are to many people applying for the same shifts so sometimes it's almost impossible to get a shift.
good,"This job has plenty of pros and cons. If you need a job right now, apply as no interview is needed! They hire anyone who can pass drug test and background check. Con to that is the people that I work with have very little motivation, drive or manners. Many people just want a check.... lots of lazy people. Managers are overwhelmed and over all the processes. No medical benefits and no paid time off!"
good,"It's a good place to work.  But you have to work hard to meet goals and expectations of the department that your are in.  Management is changing all the time, so the atmosphere is always changing.."
good,This job started off very fun and exciting for the first few months and then reality set in after the 4 month of being yelled at by people who weren't even managers
good,Friendly environment but also management barely keeps employees updated. Great hourly rate but the hours given is scarce not including that you might get sent home early after working a 4 hour shift.
good,I enjoy the work because it is simple and easy enough that most people are able to do it. I am by no means the gold standard for this work but I do know that anyone can learn and be effective here.
good,I had a great time working for Amazon i usually stayed in the air because i rode a cherry picker which is used to pull product from high of the warehouse racks. The leadership was A1 they will try to work with you if you come across any problems work related or at home.
good,"The job is physical in most roles. You will just have to deal with the pain for the first two weeks or so, then your body will adjust to the constant movement. I lost weight and found muscles I had forgotten about. I spent many years in warehouses, so I wasn't surprised by the environment. If you are willing to work, it's a great place, if not... Keep looking."
good,"busy at times but not overwhelming, pay should be more than $15 for outbound that are TDR certified and PIT Trained. Managers are ok some better than others and HR can sometimes come off rude depending on who you talk to, but overall the job is manageable"
good,A relaxed work environment that allows you to work individually at a self-pace but also allows for work with other co-workers to get the job done. They would reward and motivate me to work hard.
good,"Fast paced work environment."
good,"Amazon is very fun and interesting company to work at."
good,"the job is easier team work is not really required the hardest part working at amazon is the long hours being on your feet for 10 hours, the company is well managed"
good,"When you work for Amazon your part of a team and everyday may be challenging but it’s fun and worth it"
good,"My overall experience was positive. I enjoyed working at Amazon and at times thought I may want to try and get a full-time job. Other issues, like commute time and school, kept me from pursuing a full-time position with Amazon."
good,"A nice work environment. Some managers were cool. Others liked to micromanage and could be a little annoying. Some of the coworkers were racist and petty but Amazon cant help the type of people they hire. Just let management know about them and they will handle it. Overall, good."
good,The work was easy and self explanatory and the scheduling is very flexible and there peak times where alot of overtime its a great job to be a second job or temporary
good,"Productive and fun workplace and get good exercise as well. Management was great, fun and enthusiastic. They always showed their appreciation for your hard work."
good,Amazon is a place where you don’t get to pick your favorite position for you all work as a tram in a warehouse. It’s a very fast paced environment for the next 2 hours once you’re in but after that it’s chill time
good,"All of the supervisors were very friendly and outgoing. Before every shift we would gather as a group and do an exercise. It was a way to get us ready and pumped for the shift. The only negative while I was employed there was that it was very slow, I think because they had hired way too many employees."
good,Overall a good place to work but not the best. During the holidays it gets really busy and you work 12 hour shifts for a couple months which is good money but very tiring.
good,I like working there its a nice place to be its quite and not a lot of drama and the hardest part about the job is probably just the time but everything else is pretty much fine to me
good,"I had to resign my post because Amazon was not able to accommodate me unless instructed by doctors, although I was a rehire and they knew of my condition because of my files and recent application. While awaiting to get paperwork I was fired."
good,"The workplace is a great environment, the noise level keeps you energized. The scheduling and shifts were nice, pay was great, they are very strict with their rules though"
good,Well know professional company that handles and shipped out customer’s products within estimated time to meet customer satisfaction. Company also displays offers from time to time to provide for customers while shopping.
good,Amazon was okay very for uplifting people who is very energetic who loves to meeting of the new people but very focused job it requires full attention but normal common sense not a hard job at all very strict but very rewarding
good,"I worked at Amazon Fresh. The temperature of working there depended on what food products I had. The workplace was very busy and honestly not organized very well. Most of the time I spent trying to reorganize shelving, but overall a great experience and made a lot of friends."
good,Amazon starts each shift with stretching exercises to help keep employees limber. The team work atmosphere was great and the pay was ok for a job I didn't intend to retire from.
good,"Easy job functions at ONT5 in San Bernardino, CA. Management is not the best. Very unorganized and uneven labor distribution among employees. The pay is fair."
good,Fast paced work style. Loading vans and getting out of the warehouse to start my route was exciting and a good warm up to start my day. Delivering could be challenging.
good,Not enough break time. not enough security for personal belongings. It's a faced paced environment. Most of the managers seem to care enough and try to learn your name.
good,"Just under 3 years of working, 2 of which were spent in the same department i had 4 different managers and 5 different PA's. Favoritism seemed to be a theme and you have to be friends with a friend of a manager in order to move up."
good,"Overall, I really enjoy working at Amazon. There is always things to do, no idling. The managers and supervisors are highly motivated. The hardest part of the job is standing for 10 hrs, with limited bathroom breaks. The most enjoyable part motivation, learning, communication, having fun but always safe cautious."
good,Amazon is a great company to work for if you understand the politics. It's a company where you have potential for growth but once you level up once it's very hard to do it again.
good,"Big warehouse(fulfillment center)...lots of walking, plenty of work to do...friendly environment, work with great people...great pay...wonderful benefits"
good,"I started at DEN5 during the holiday season 2018. I meant for it to be temporary but I'm still there. Why? Because I've lost weight and it's a good supplemental job. It is a completely physical job; you are standing, walking, lifting, reaching. Why pay for a gym membership when you can get paid to work out? I wear a fitbit and I often walk 4 miles or so per 4-hour shift. "
good,Amazon challenges its employees to solve some very difficult problems. Good place for those looking to enhance their skillset. Stress levels can sometimes be quite high though.
good,Good place to work but very busy most of the time. Everyone at the warehouse is pretty friendly and you eventually get to know everyone there with the amount of hours most employees there put in. Hardest part is the traffic in the morning and on the way home but overall not a bad place to work especially if you're just starting out as a delivery driver.
good,"Working here can be challenging dealing with coworkers who act live divas and 3yrolds. If you want  to get VET or VTO better hurry and get it real quick, because there are some greedy people who will take it. Every time when VET is available there are people who will take it but never show up for the day they signed up for. Plus it makes it harder for other people to get extra hours. Amazon facilities in the colder states need heat and air conditioning. Nobody should be freezing or sweating in their under garments."
good,"this a very common sense driven job, an easy way to make quick money but if you don't follow up with expectation you will not to be there long. would recommend to any one who is looking for extra money in there pocket with out having to sacrifice their current employment or situation."
good,"I can't really complain, people make this job fun and all one thing I don't like is how they manage things, but other than that it's fine. People at work make everything fun"
good,"you would always be on your own at the jobs site, you can't sit down anywhere. so you would have to continue working into break or lunch. you could hang out with your other co-worker at lunch time."
good,"I had a lot of fun working here, it was fast paced and entertaining. I learned a lot working here and picked up skills I can use in everyday life. Amazon is a great company."
good,"Employees are driven to innovate at a pace that can lead to burn out.  Constant change in the name of providing the highest customer obsession at times destroys work-life balance.  When in balance, Amazon can be a great place to work at.  Amazon can provide endless opportunities to lead and operate at the next level."
good,"If you need a Job Amazon will hire you. Do you best while you are there. They may hire you if you work really hard."
good,"Great place to work, I liked the fast-paced environment and the people I worked with. I especially enjoyed working in the freezer. While there is a limit on how long you can spend in the freezer, my stowing rates were always fantastic because there is so much space compared to the rest of the warehouse. I also like the cold. "
good,"Not the worst company to work for, just a lot of physical demand and standing for a long period of time. They offer benefits and are always hiring it seems."
good,"What I liked most about the job is that you get the freedom to put your software skills to good use."
good,A really great job. The job helped me fix my credit and buy a car. The mornings were hectic but things calmed down after the drivers left the dock. I would work for them again.
good,"Get to work"
good,"I'm an independent contractor - at the Mechanical Turk project that means no managers, no coworkers, just direct contact with the employers (Requesters), set your own hours. And learn everything you need to know to be effective on your own."
good,"You are daily monitored to help ensure production is maximized. Having patience can reward you if you apply yourself. Management as a whole has a purpose of assisting associates with becoming more productive over time doing more with less. Moving ahead, safety is always first, but being productive is very important and key to success. Hardest part of the job is having the capacity to adjust to the ever changing environment, and always pushing yourself to be better. Being part of a company that has made such an impact on a few industries and still is growing, is an awesome feeling, especially as a member of leadership. Knowing you are assisting the associates in accomplishing company goals and setting more for them as well."
good,"It was an okay job, just kind of repetitious and tedious.  I enjoyed the people I worked with and the environment.  The shift was challenging because it was overnight."
good,"As a picker at amazon was hard work."
good,Nice environment with steady chances to advance. Safety culture was straightforward and the personnel were well trained and the directions were easy to follow.
good,A good seasonal or temporary work experience. It could be the start of a good career if you can make a good impression and apply for one of the numerous permanent jobs available in myriad departments.
good,Stay hydrated have fun work hard and make history the job is easy and under control if you make it that way those who slack off are the first to quit typically
good,Definitely not a bad job to hold on to but wouldn't look at moving up or staying long term. It's a job to keep you afloat until you find whatever you are looking for. Great benefits and pay.
good,"The work life balance might not be the best, but the quality of work is utmost. Employees are taken care of, and the perks are as good as the market standards (if not better)"
good,"My experience at amazon was great. Was brought in on a 6 month contract and I can say I did not have any major complaints. They pay a little below market rate, but thats about it."
good,"soe of the products in packing area where to heavy, it was a very fast pace company, kepting up with production was a requirement to keep your job. the supervisor where friendly"
good,it was a fast -paced work environment where we were coastally rushed of our feet it was a fun job but the hardest part when tea time came and we got flooded with over 400 costumers
good,"Amazon was good place to work, with a good steady flow. Sceduleing and comunication with employess and managers was a little confusing. VTO (voluntart time off ) was the most confusing and you would not know until shortly prior to your shift, meaning you would be on the way to the wear house or even show up and would not be aloud to work. you would then get attendance points for not accepting VTO in a timely manner"
good,I loved working there though many people feel differently. Requires hard work and attention to detail. You need to push if you want to learn new things but management was willing to teach those who were interested.
good,"Personally I love Amazon. I love what they're doing. I was a contractor for Amazon and was just treated exactly like one. I was always skeptical of doing a contract and I found that out through the exact reason why contracts aren't fun. I'll give Amazon the benefit of the doubt and say it was just this particular team I was on but it was not a great experience. I was an overpaid admin that had a job title of ""Recruiter."" Recruiting is my passion thus far and I didn't feel that in my 7 month role at Amazon. I wished my training was better and that I had better success planning and growth potential leading up into being converted to blue badge. I didn't have any support and felt like a ghost contractor just working and not leading anywhere. To give an example: I was sourcing for a team and supporting a regional recruiter. I learned from the regional recruiter and all the ins and outs of that job; I lived it and breathed it because she was my counterpart and without me she couldn't do her job and vice versa. She eventually switched teams after about 5 months of me being there and I expressed great interest in taking her position to my manager and she also expressed to the manager that I take her spot since I was the most qualified. From there we got a ""we will consider it"" quote. After about 2 weeks nothing, then 1 month nothing and at the 1.5 month mark there was an annoucement that the spot had been filled with someone who was on that team ages ago. At that point I knew I had wasted my time. No communication and just contant darkness. Instead of interviewing a contractor who"
good,"I got a lot of great experiences from Amazon, but the culture is what made me leave. Management spoke to team members like they were robots and they did not care about personal situations- everything was strictly policy, which I understand and respect. But there are some things that should be dealt with a little more delicately in my opinion."
good,I liked it they had good training strategies guided u the right way and the environment was fun. They would give giveaways. Easy and nice to work in just not enough hours
good,Good work environment and fun co-workers. You learn a lot. Tons of work but keeps you moving and in shape kind of. Fun and caring management. Great pay.
good,Benefits are excellent but work/personal life balance is bad. Not for single moms. Pay is okay. Management sucks because they are constantly changing managers. Working for amazon requires team building skills so if you aren’t willing to be apart of a team then it’s not for you.
good,"Amazon has several types of jobs available for part time workers. i work in a  distribution center. this is pretty much standard warehouse work.  the main part of this job is sorting and setting up packages into routes for delivery. this is  fast paced  due to same day delivery Amazon offers to their Prime  about half the time. the rest of your 4 hour shift of the time is spent setting up the warehouse for for the next wave of package deliveries."
good,"Overall good decent place to work people are friendly and it's a fun atmosphere ,,.,.,.,.,.,"
good,many challenges all positive very quick paced and diverse environment. can be a bit complexed at times because of the deadline and workload. Great Job
good,All around good experience.  It was a part-time job at a warehouse which was a good experience and taught me about work ethic but was far from rewarding and was exhausting.
good,"For an office employee at Amazon I’m sure is an awesome place to work, but as a warehouse associate is not the same case. Amazon is a good place to work if you are able to move up within three years. Management in my department I had no clue how to handle employees, though their ability to handle operations were ok. In there you are treated like a number, unless you are favored. They have an open door policy which means you don’t have to drive up the ranks with a complaint or concern. Though sounding efficient, most complaints were pacified with promises of rectification but no result. I left at my 5 year mark there because I kept getting passed over on opportunities to move up, also how unprofessionally they handled the process. If you have experience or a degree that would land you a higher position at Amazon, your chances are better and you can skip over waiting years to advance. I can sit here and write all day, every job comes with their ups and downs. It’s not for the weak or lazy."
good,"No gym needed, you get your workout here and get paid for it. "
good,"Every day I came into work was never a bad day. No matter how much work we had to do in our shift, we always worked hard to try and achieve the goal. I made some friends there which was nice since I had just moved to Arizona. I worked with some great people and would do it again if I could."
good,"10/10  would  go  back to  work  there.  friendly  co-workers. "
good,"On a typical day, you'll arrive, store your stuff in a locker and then pass through checkpoints before entering the warehouse floor. Your shift team leader will brief you before you begin work. "
good,"- You can learn a lot very quickly in a very short time"
good,"Managers are a hit or miss. When new ones join your team, you don't know what you're getting.  Not a bad place to work for a college student.  Very fast paced and they expect you to be working non-stop!"
good,"For starters, Amazon is not terrible. It's also not a place where I would take a full-time job nor work often. The labor output during the holiday seasons (Christmas/ Thanksgiving) are terrible. You will be so drained. Also unless you are full-time or know how to finesse, your hours will be very inconsistent. They will NOT under any circumstance let you do over 30 hours and they attempt to make you not get anywhere close to that. You work 3-5 hours per shift, nothing more nothing less. It is very hard to make plans because you never know when you're actually getting off. 15 an hour sounds great and all until you're making less than someone who works 20 hours a week for only 10.00. AAAANNNDDD they say your breaks are 15 minutes but it is actually only 10 because they allow you 2.5 minutes to get to and from the break room(s)"
good,"It’s a basic warehouse job. You will clock in, go to stand up, stretch, talk about the plan for the day. Then more than likely you will scan/sort packages to containers."
good,Constantly contacting customers throughout the day however the salary and benefits do not match up to the amount of work that is done or has to be done.
good,"It  one of the places to work for once in life time, great exposure which changes the mindset."
good,"Long shifts are manageable especially with the pay but, it is taxing especially with increasing performance standards. As a picker, you are isolated for hours which can be a problem for some. Personally, I found that the culture needed improvements, as breaks were often spent listening to others complain about their workload"
good,Its more of a fast pace job and a lot of new people new ways to work great place to work just couldn't do the hours at night. i couldn't sleep as much
good,"Amazon offers competitive pay, great benefits and offers a lot of learning experience that you can use in other jobs. However moving up is difficult, Amazon hires 70 percent outside for manager or supervisory roles. If you start on the call floor you are not likely to ever move up beyond the call floor."
good,"You get to own and execute end-to-end your project. You get to learn a lot in a short time. Its very hard to find work-life balance. The compensation is very good compared to market average but there is no other benefits that many product companies provide like free food,  free coupons as recognition, etc."
good,amazon has its good and bad points. From working there i did not feel as though it was career worthy it was more of a job that is exhausting and was not worth the pay in certain areas
good,"It is a very physical job. Management is  not consistent, and advancement seems to play favoritism overproduction. It is a good job when you can’t find the job you want, just know that advancing varies ."
good,"Good benefits meet a lot of new friends from different country."
good,"fast paced environment"
good,I started after college and I really loved working there but doing the same thing every day can really effect a person so be sure to really show off your best skills and learn how to problem solve your own issues in order to move up. They offer great benefits plus balance between work and life is pretty good.
good,"When it comes to benefits, they're really generous. A typical day at work consists of hard work, but a whole lot of learning each day as well. H.R team is helpful."
good,"Great Team to wok with everyone helped one another, leaned to identify and correct issues, managers were pretty hands off, we were allowed to work at our own pace. The hardest part of the job was just getting there. I lived too far from the facility for it to be profitalble."
good,Amazon is a good place to work for. Great benefits. Sometimes during the holidays there are very long weeks with 50-60 hours. In normal operation you work 4-10 hour days.
good,"Each day was different, fast paced and filled with opportunity. my daily tasks consisted of what the operation needed that day and making sure i was removing barriers for associates."
good,"Working at an Amazon Fulfillment Center is eye-opening. The work is demanding, but fast. Managers are great as long as your performance indicators are in line. Fall behind and you fill find yourself ""transitioned"" out of the building. "
good,"Challenging and rewarding"
good,"good busy work around customers was the annoying part. overall was a good job to have if its your first. "
good,Always on your feet. The pay is a little above minimum wage with varying hours from 24-40+ a week. Coworkers are great! Everyone is usually nice and respectful of one another.
good,"A lot of hours and time on feet, management is difficult at times when not keeping up the standards they expect. Such as rate, time off task. It is fun and great co-workers"
good,"I would prefer not to participate in this request.  I have learned a lot at Amazon and have met a ton of great, brilliant people. It is a strong company."
good,"It was a demanding job, however you were compensated well. I do feel that a little more flexibility would be beneficial, especially for those whom had kids. They tried to keep moral up, but they kept taking away the things that everyone enjoyed."
good,"Amazon had a great culture for productivity and advancement for employees, and also for people to come together for a great cause to work as a team to deliver smiles across the country."
good,"i love that place. it pays well, teaches you new skills each day and they are very strict on safety and rules. Timing is also a very important task with Amazon as you must show up on time to work, breaks and home safely."
good,"Bonne expérience, Personnel compétent et courtois qui est à l'écoute"
good,Good experience. Every day is day one at Amazon. Data driven company.
good,"The job was fine and fast paced but like most jobs there was a lot of high school drama. I actually enjoyed working here even though I have a few complaints. A typical day is you clock in have your morning meeting, do your stretches as a team, look at the board to see what station you are assigned to, and go to work. The facility I worked at had fresh management, what I mean is that they just graduated college 4 months prior to getting the management position. Most of the jobs at the facility are very straight forward, do this repetitively until it's time to go home. The breaks were fast (15 minutes) because the timer starts as soon as you leave the area that you are working at, my facility was very big. if you needed to smoke it was a 5 minute walk to the area and a 5 minute walk back (10 minutes in walking for 5 minutes of sitting) you also had to be back at your station within the 15 minute mark. The lunches were 30 minutes which is fine, they had a cafeteria with all kinds of food, snacks, drinks, etc. during the ""rush season"" (November 1st - January 1st) is hectic and longer hours  they hire around 1400 temp employees to help with the holiday shipping demand. Like I said the job was fine Management made it annoying with favoritism and wouldn't train you in other areas so that you could be utilized properly. The company itself is a good company but they will work you to death, it's ok though they have a mini hospital area with medical staff, were they can check you out and if you can still work...well then back to work. repetitive work"
good,Fast paced work environment with a lot of advancement opportunities. Overtime and sometimes mandatory overtime hours. Weekly pay schedule with multiple payment options.
good,I was a contract worker so this survey is not applicable to me. I was a contract worker so this does not apply to me whatsoever. I signed up for and was accepted as one of their DSP.
good,"Working for amazon to me is a must have experience. If you’re in any type of leadership role you are tasked woth crazy deadlines and goals, but it teaches you timekeeping and the importance of such a thing and you definitely learn how to coach others to improve their current skills. Growing from within is a stressful process, but worth it for those willing to work hard, and be consistent. The work was never an issue for me, but the leadership and morale of the building I worked for did it for me."
good,"learned a lot of things from amazon . good environment to work"
good,"I worked in amazon for almost five years as quality insurance colleague. the job was very dynamic and interesting, confronting other departments associates was a challenging over discrepancies ."
good,Nice place to work. Very flexiable with work hours assigned. Decent management but a lot of room for improvement. Good benefits and good pay. I worked there during an experimential job position trial period. The position of delivery driver only lasted for two months.
good,Amazon gives you a platform to explore opportunities out there. It is a place where we can learn and innovate not only with our own team but also in any team of the company.
good,Can be a tough culture depending on leadership.  Found a lot of camaraderie and focus.  There is pride in the growth and efforts put in by the team.  During peak season there was a lot of stress and one always feels like they are potentially on the chopping block.  Overall a good place to work.
good,Ok but breaks are not long enough. Other than that ii would've like more of an opportunity to move up within the ranks. I was in a decent position  but i had potential for more
good,"A great place to work, if you like a consistent schedule and great for all types of people. You have to be willing to work and be able to handle last minute situations if they happen to present themselves. Fast paced and you have to pull your own weight but they do have lots of opportunity to advance and move to different positions within the company, ut yo have to be willing to work as I stated before."
good,"Escasas posibilidades de contratación fija "
good,It was a nice experience working at Amazon warehouse as an Admin. Nice and fun atmosphere with friendly and working people.   Different shifts that can accommodate anyone.
good,Its a fast pace place to work. Where the most  important things is making sure the orders get out on time. The rates that you are given are sometimes ridiculous. Some Managers are great. But most are not. Its either there way which is sometimes the wrong one. But the benefits are good and the pay is not bad.
good,"A fast-paced job with little advancement opportunity. Mandatory overtime was rough. Free coffee machine in the break room, as well as a PlayStation 4 and arcade games."
good,I started out in the dock hates it I learned picking wasn’t so bad but after a couple hours your feet hurt and you get thirsty and have to use the bathroom guess what your not aloud to leave your station same thing goes for stow but My main position I worked in iss and it was a mess day shifts and night shifts could not get along it was always a mess coming in have to stand in one spit not able to sit sercrim shift manager for iss just weren’t good managers. Hr related they say there willing to help you with your outside issues and there way of helping you is either firing you or placing you on leave where your not making money so both options you don’t get payed than stress even more about money and they think it’s a fix. If you ever work for these guys never let them see your issues and be ok with gettting in trouble for things that are not your fault. Amount of money you make is not enough to want to stay and deal with this terrible place of employment.
good,The day would start with a 5-minute stretch and go over the game plan for the rest of the day. They had an open style of management where we would often see our managers on the floor often helping us with works hands on. They were always available for out our questions.
good,Overall a good job for pay and benefits. Working for .com customer service can be challenging. I don't recommend working for amazon wireless department. Hours can vary each quarter.
good,"Every day is different, and they allow you to really be creative when it comes to solving problems. Very fast pace environment where you have to be self motivated."
good,"I liked the work very much. It was hard working and freindly environment. Managers were so nice and initiative. "
good,"Constant over site created a flowing sense of work. Though not allowed to sit, there are adequate breaks. The communication between departments is high and helps alleviate disputes."
good,Working for Amazon Flex has been great because I have the freedom to work when I want and I am not required to work a certain time or day. I also use my own vehicle and don't have a dress code and I can bring friends or my dog along for the trip.
good,"It is a good place to work as a first job, gives you warehouse experience, and helps pick up your strength and agility, the job will work you to the bone. Attendence is highly important, lateness is a matter. Pay is decent but hours aren't. Promotion is good if you can last the first 90-180 days. Must keep up with performance or you will be spotted an watched for coaching, if not termination. It's a fast paced job they are strict on so many levels, management is not so great, supervisor have there favorites, they may not say it but you'll start noticing.as a new worker they will expect you to perform as if you were there for a while, they will compare you to a employee who has been there for a while an is at the top of there game. If you can't meet up to there standards this job is not ment for you. Also Bing your own lunch or bring a good amount of money , break time is short as ever."
good,"Good place to work. Good benefits."
good,"friendly place to work people are good- hours are long"
good,i enjoyed working there. the money was good and plenty of overtime. some days were slow and boring but most were busy so the night went by fast. i made friends easy so that helped
good,I enjoyed the every day tasks and work flow at Amazon. I learned every aspect of their shipping and loading systems and used all the equipment required to the positions I did that day. Management provided adequate instruction and training. Rules and processes were strict but fair and their safety regulations were top notch.
good,this job is okay very stressful at times. 60 hour work weeks during peak season all benefits up front but dont go negative in your time or they will fire you
good,learn to new things well management...one of the hardest job but enjoyable part of the job and there is no growth...its like a politics...but company is very nice
good,fast paced delivery where you work at your own speed. come in at 645 load your van then get on the road and deliver to areas 30 minutes to an hour away.
good,"Its relatively easy, but very repetitive and managers are not very helpful when it comes to issues. The most enjoyable part of the job are the associates that you work with. Otherwise a lot of people are miserable. The pay is what makes people stay."
good,"Provides a good salary and many benefits. Working only 4 days (10 hours shifts) and then 3 days off. Very nice HR team. Work hard, have fun, make history...."
good,"Everyone knows amazon.com and work places vary wildly even when the same type are right next to each other. personal experiance was mostly postivie, except for the few bad apples that pop up every so often."
good,"i would load my truck up with bags of packages in an orderly fashion to deliver packages in a timely manner. its fast paced but, very independent while on the road."
good,There are many different cultures around Amazon.  Some are well balanced.  Others are cut-throat and stressful.  Management can be helpful depending on the person.
good,"Especially as a student with a long holiday, Amazon is a great way to make money whilst meeting new people. it was really helped in making me have a stable income. Also, there is the quick elevation in a matter of months, but it's easier to go via the temporary work route to secure permanency than the actual Amazon recruitment."
good,"After working for amazon, I left with a lot more knowledge than when I started working for amazon. however, the employees are treated very poorly, they treat them as if they are robots, and when something goes wrong in the warehouse, they always look for who too blame instead of how to prevent that mistake again."
good,"Still need to be more organized, offer more permanent jobs, and improve manager staff. The hiring process needs improvement such as filling out the application based on your experiences and not on questions that has nothing to do with the job. I wish there was staff to help you understand some of the questions being asked. I wish you had extra time to be able to submit medical packets in order to keep or obtain employment."
good,"Working long days"
good,"Supportive company"
good,this was a seasonal job so i don't have much to say we worked just a hard if not harder than the regular employees and you wonder why they get to keep their jobs and you don't
good,"It's really fun because every day before starting to work, you exercise. Working at Amazon is really tiring. There is no easy advancement to become easily a full-time worker."
good,"Very fast paced work. Even though they say that accomodations can be made for the disabled,  so far as  I  am concerned  that really isn't  true. I  liked working for this Company  and the people  are wonderful  to work with but the breaks are a joke. By the time you get to the break room your break is over. They need an elevator down to the wharehouse."
good,Wages should be attractive enough to attract the numerous amount of people. Atmosphere should be a descent one and volunteer extra time should be allowed.
good,"work is heavy, schedules change a lot,"
good,"The work you are assigned to you can learn in less than a day, but it takes awhile to perfect. The average day would include slowing away a wide variety of items into bins that fit there appropriate size all the while scanning everything. The only thing I have negative to say about the job is the tree mistake rule. If you make three mistakes you are terminated automatically. An average day you would stow away over 3000 items if you were slow so a mistake is bound to happen here or there. The tallies get knocked off after a month of no mistakes, but its still a pressure that can weigh on you."
good,"Overall working at amazon is a good gig, but after working with some of the people there you will quickly realize that common sense isn't very common after all."
good,It's a great place to work at first but the more u learn the more they want and at first they know ur name but after a year all u r is a number and so on
good,It’s a great part time job because you’re able to pick your own schedule. It’s busy work but not complicated. Really relaxed atmosphere. You must be self sufficient.
good,"I really enjoyed this job, it was great while it lasted. Management within the driver program could have been better they were consistently making mistakes. No written warehouse policies, one person would say one thing and another person would say something else. So the rules change by who’s on duty."
good,"•	Handled telephone inquiries and addressed customer queries about product availability and order statuses."
good,"N/A "
good,i leared to work with people with diffrent lanuages the hardest part of the job there is non ist very calm place to work the most enjoyable part of the work is that some times tey will give you extra breake.
good,Since my fiance died last year Amazon was a good work choice as far as hours of flexibility for not only my children and their school but with me back in college as well.
good,Amazon is a great place to work if you have experience. For starting positions there is a lot of repetitive work and you have no control over decisions.
good,Hard work and have to meet a quota. Non personable and felt I didn’t fit in. I would only go back if I had no other choice. Maybe a different position would fit me better.
good,It is the typical warehouse job. Tasks are repetitive and productivity goals are to be met. The good thing is there are no surprises you pass or fail completely of your own merits.
good,"In my own opinion, Amazon is a good place to work at as they pay very well starting at $15/ hr and $15.85 for nights. My only problem is that there will be a many times where one will butt heads with HR and higher management that is not seen on the floor as some of them I'd deem as incompetent and rude. Other than that it's a great place to work but because of the long hours I suggest finding coworkers you can talk to on the daily."
good,Amazon was a very good place to learn about digital marketing. Great working place with fun and knowledge. Good working environment for the employers to not feel stressed about the work.
good,very fast worked place nice pay friendly co workers nice supervisors nice lunch rooms nice discounts  nice overtime easy job position was great food was good
good,sono entrato a contatto con un nuovo mondo lavorativo
good,"Work is strictly routine. No change in anything but stations. Not a career for anyone older that 21. Management is in their bootstraps. You don't get recognition unless you are doing something wrong."
good,"Receives product using frequency scanners, pulls and packs products and unloads shipments from trucks."
good,"It was a fun work environment when it was busy season for Christmas, after that and it gets slow... they start letting people go and go home early. Not as much work to do."
good,Amazon is very go go go. High paced and focused on getting as much work done. Wasn't much of a change in place unless you got switched to another area but as for the most part it is repetitive.
good,Working delivery was really easy and the hours were flexible. Only issue was that the longer I worked there the less shifts became available. Pays well if you're able to pick up enough shifts. Make sure you have enough room in your car. You will definitely fill up all available space.
good,Une très bonne entreprise mais qui est situé trop loin de mon domocile
good,Very fast moving physical job.  Would like to get hired on permanently but not sure how or if that will happen.  Happy for the increase in salary!  $15/hr. and we earn it!
good,The hardest part of this job is being on your feet CONSTANTLY! There's alot of standing and walking. This IS a physical job which includes lifting and pulling of product. It'll take some time getting used to.
good,Requires you to be able to stand for 9.5 hours per shift. There is no sitting except for breaks. Pay is competitive for the field but not up to cost of living in NJ.
good,Work life balance needs improvement. Hiring is prretty strong. Company invests a lot of money and time to ensure their employee are developing technically and personally on a regular basis.
good,I have learnt new skills related which has helped my personal growth. Work culture is good. At times it gets too stressed and there is no growth importunity in long run.
good,"Although I really loved my job and did as much - if not more than required, the people that ""cheated the system"" are the ones that were rewarded.  Although there were some situations that I may not have agreed with, I appreciate the time that I was there.  All in all, I would recommend Amazon."
good,"everyone is laid back, it is fast paced at times and there is a lot of standing on your feet throughout the day. Had no issue with management, overall I would recommend this employer to a friend."
good,i liked working at amazon good place to work love working there great benifits good money help me with the bills i would worke there again again and again!!!
good,A lot of lifting. Decent place regular people. Worth while job if you like a steady paycheck. I feel like I am being forced into this review lol. I would recommend you guys!
good,Breaks start as soon as your scanned your last item and not when the scheduled time was. Every time you were not scanning an item you were off task. Rate were extremely high and at times felt like they were impossible to make
good,"Productive and got to learn a lot of new things from the company.Has been a very nice experience, got to learn a lot of tuff situations in the company and how to handle them in a professional manner."
good,"This was a great job. You were provided your percentages daily along with constant communication from your manager if you were doing well or needed to improve. Wonderful benefits and options for overtime, and advancement or cross training."
good,Friendly and competitive. The friends you make there will last a lifetime. Once an amazonian always an amazonian.            All the people you meet and the HR team in my facility were great.
good,I enjoyed working with new people and meeting all deadlines and numbers. It was a great experience. I just wish that there was more consistency with the schedules!
good,Managers are hired in straight out of college with no prior work experience. They treat some employees and associates like pieces of nothing unless they need work done. There is no communication between management and associates. Fear of losing our jobs is strongly stressed and there is no appreciative feedback. I enjoy my job because I am good at it but Amazon needs some major improvements.
good,"I work at an HVH, Prime Now and Whole Foods Market locations. I can work up to 40 hours during peak!"
good,"buen ambiente laboral, buenas instalaciones, transporte"
good,Working for Amazon at home customer service had its pros-and-cons. the pros was that it was at home and it can be relaxing but at the same time fast-paced the con is you get customers that can be extremely disrespectful
good,Good place to work but with little job advancement. A fast paced work environment that can be stressful at times but the pay and compensation makes it worthwhile.
good,"Picked, weighed, and packed correct type and quantity of items based on customer orders. "
good,"great workplace secluded work place and helpful staff , graveyard shifts lobby were messy and no place to sit. would like for enviorment to offer more opportunity while on current job."
good,"It has a great Workculture , the  work was Target oriented and over all aCustomer and Employee centric company.The monthly appreciations were great way of encouraging associates to push themselves."
good,"Was given great opportunities and worked with amazing team. However,  I left due to lack of career development options within the business. Would work for Amazon again"
good,worked my butt off constantly everyday and didnt get good job security. have to pretty much be like flash to hit the numbers they want you to hit picking.
good,"decent job but very boring and cut thoart. overall not worth it. lunch and breaks go by so fast, annoying leaders and workers you have to deal with all day"
good,"The hours are good but you do a lot of walking, your body is going to hurt for the first 2-3 weeks, you meet some good people their. It's just very tiring and in the summer theres not air and in the winter theres no heat."
good,It was a good learning experience working at Amazon. There is a lot of opportunities and business areas to work in and gain industry experience. And you get to take your dog at work!
good,Ok company to work for. Not good with accommodating as far a schedule change due to school. Easy to move up in the company could be both a good thing and a bad thing.
good,"The job was ok until my feet and knee started hurting from the long hours. I enjoyed the benefits very much, one of the problems i had was i think they should have paid more."
good,The work was sustainable however the pay lacked greatly. No overtime and no room for advancement. The company overall is very wonderful and if given a better pay I would like to stay and grow within. That is what I am look for.
good,Environment and work culture is good but in my process no proper metrics design for employees. You have recreation floor but no time to go and enjoy..
good,its a okay place to work i need better hours and more cash i wored nights and  wanted to have a day job and more times with my friends and family . there was good times and bad times but it was good over all
good,"Good part time job fair pay . paid training, and great team environment would recommend to a friend or family member. And its on the bus line good job all around"
good,If your not money motivated don't waste your time they believe in work you have to have some time off experience in Warehouse and logistics to understand how important your role in Amazon is and driven by money set a goal and work towards it
good,"Needs better leaders at Amazon Cle 5 location.  Great pay, unstable hours. Made friends,  clean facility.  If you want to work at Amazon, make sure you have the shoes on."
good,"Amazon is tough. It's going to make you sweat, no doubt. I worked closely with Inbound and Outbound. We worked hard. However it's extremely easy to find someone to friend. There's so many different demographics at Amazon you are sure to find a friend. At Amazon it's the strong who survive. As long as you work hard and show compassion in the jobs that you are assigned you will love your job at Amazon. The community of people are amazing, however the management is not. They treat you horribly. But no need to worry, they're hardly ever managing anything anyways so you'll hardly see any on the floor. Most of them are right out of college and think of themselves as hot shots. They can be disrespectful, talk down to you, and will make you work harder while they stand around and point their fingers. Amazon is a great job, as long as you don't have to deal with management."
good,"Amazing company to work for, very steep learning curve in terms if data analytics"
good,go in get scanners get assigned to a section didn't need scanner if working the sort table or if driving the equipment but very fast paced and made new friends.
good,"Fun place to work, but everyone gets paid the same amount per hour which isn't fair to those of us who work a lot harder than others.  Management is good, easy to talk to or go to with concerns."
good,amazon pays well for the work you do. they can be very competitive. constant work and constantly standing. somewhat physically demanding. overall not bad
good,"Quick-paced job, very competitive, but good pay. Enjoyed working there and the work was enjoyable. The pay and managment were great and made the job easier"
good,"I liked it there lots of over time, very fast pace have to pay attention and do your job. Lots of benefits and perks although some people don’t like it I really did. But it was temporary for me"
good,"Amazon is proud of it's fast paced competitive environment, they promote high ratios and recognize employees with the best numbers."
good,"Working at the kiosk is great. It's a small, but effective team. If your a part time worker its hard to get a second job unless its strictly overnight because the shifts fluctuate every week. But its great if you are full time."
good,it was ok  I guess a very good second job if you ask me with a lil bit of hours. but that was back in 2016. time has change so I don't know how they run things now .
good,Enjoyed my work days at Amazon face pace environment and helpful people. Managers were always helpful and easy to talk to and the pay was always god and on time.
good,Amazon is a great place to work. Each department meets separately in the morning and stretches before starting your shift. Stretches are also done after lunch.
good,"You meet a lot of people , make new friends and if you're good at what you do, you have room to advance if you're noticed. Paid training, which is good."
good,"Work as pop up associate for seasonal job, very exciting and great team to work. Manager was excellent and open minded. Employees from other pop up store were very great to work. On district meetings everybody was nice and food was unlimited and the best. I would recommend if given a change to work for this company."
good,"Good and productive work place , very good part time job , flexible schedule , hr and managers very friendly and response to any task of any employee."
good,"AMAZON- Smyrna, GA	     2018-Present"
good,"very fast paced job, a lot of people everywhere, a lot of waling, okay pay rate ,hardest part of the work day is short breaks, I learned how to stay efficient"
good,"You are constantly pressured and told to work work faster than the machines or be fired for getting below/ behind on production."
good,The job overall i would say is fine if you like being in one place all day and getting your job done. Money was great here and they have wonderful benefits. My experience here with the Mangement was not so good.
good,"good work place, Fun and good people"
good,"Amazon is a company of high customer care and trained me well to ensure the requirements of customer satisfaction was met by achieving work targets and working as a team to get the job done successfully. Working with other team members closely to ensure the parcels were organised, sorted and distributed on time to ensure full customer satisfaction."
good,Not the best for night or twilight shift. Transporting boxes with a team that didn't always wanna work  but chat yet always full of drama. No more night shift.
good,"workplace culture couldve been better, management was a revolving door with no connection to the work force, the benefits were ok, Amazon doesnt appreciate its employees"
good,ich finde das ist toll arbeit und ich bin glücklich
good,"Career advancement is practically not visible. The more time you spend here, the better you get at work. "
good,Eleven dollars an hour definitely does not cover it especially when I lived an hour one way and I have two kids to put in daycare! They also changed there working systems to many times so you would have to relearn all of it over again.
good,"Amazon is doing lots of cool stuff. 've been at Amazon for a month now, and I've seen none of the horror stories being communicated to the public, although Amazon is a large enough company that I'm sure there are good pockets and bad pockets. Everyone here is really smart and wants to succeed both personally, and as a company. People collaborate and help each other, focus on data, and truly focus on the customer. Every company I've ever worked for …"
good,"For this sort of job you have to be a repetitive person with no doubt about it."
good,"Hard to advance, short breaks, and long overtime hours! Must be a Hard Working productive person or you won't last long! Advancement is very difficult and the management is on a constant movement...changing all the time! Need to treat employees better!"
good,work from home customer service job. this position was only available bc of the holiday rush. i enjoyed the customers and the team members on my team.
good,"Amazon is a face paced warehouse.  Physically demanding, but in a good way.  Ample room for advancement.  Good, clean workplace.  Overall, a good place to work!!"
good,Walk in go through security clock in go to conveyor pack and label merchandise. Had to run packages at a fast pace and meet daily quota. there was a lot of people around monitoring you. When time for break or lunch everything was very far away and did not have much time to get designation. other than that the pay and hours were great.
good,"really good place, hard work but worth it. many people would work together, talk and keep everyone busy."
good,"Typical day is 10 hours long (More if you are member of management.) Learned how balance labor, employee relations, project management. Management was middle of the road, had some that I really liked and some that were just OK. Culture at Amazon promotes team work and working safely. Hardest part of the job was conditions to advance and hours worked."
good,Its the kind a job for you to find a start you move up or move out kind of job constantly changing.Its also perfect if you go to school and they work around it.
good,A typical Day at Amazon starts at 9AM when i pull up to the loading area. I pick up packages at the designated warehouse and then distribute them along a Delivery Route. When deliveries are done head home.
good,"Worked here for a number of months, I enjoyed my time there working on the security side of Amazon. A great team to work for and met kind people who were polite."
good,"each day was a productive day. I have learned many ways to handle customers queries with effective and efficient solutions."
good,"At amazon I was part of a sort center where I helped get pallets of boxes ready for the post office. This includes wrapping pallets, sorting boxes, and scanning boxes. The management is decent they listen pretty well. The hardest part of the job was the late hours. The most enjoyable part was my amazing co workers."
good,"Amazons turnover rate made it difficult for management to keep a working and coordinated team.  Because of this, it was very cut throat for promotions."
good,Entreprise agréable avec une très bonne ambiance et des responsables proches de ses salariés.
good,"For growing purposes we need learn the workplace atmosphere. thus, amazon provided me the space where I learned a lots of phases of a business and I learned the team work and put efforts to achieve the common goals."
good,"If you like warehouse work and aren't afraid of a fast paced work environment Amazon is a great opportunity.  "
good,"relaxing culture and divere environment - dress code is usual and offers flexible working. base pay is low, but is compensated by the company shares which vest over a period."
good,They are pretty flexible but they expect you to be there no matter what for you shift. They do how ever push for you to succeed and that is pretty nice.
good,"Buon ambiente di lavoro, ma instabili condizioni lavorative."
good,If your willing to work hard. you can earn good rewards. You will be your own boss and no one will bother you throughout the day if you can follow simple instructions. bad side is if your fast you'll be expected to do 200+ parcels a day
good,You have to keep moving and its always best to keep water with you and soak yourself every night. The first week is the hardest but you get used to it.
good,"Fast pace environment. You have to be on time, of course, every day. Breaks are on the short side."
good,"Overall, I love amazon. I love what they stand for. Internally though, micromanagement seems to be a common trend for most buildings. HR is very unresponsive and unreliable, seems to be working against the employee."
good,"The position was great for someone who needs a non-traditional job, such as working in the home. Their Flex program allows workers to pick their work schedule, with a minimum of 1 hour of work each week. You sign up for shifts as they are released. This job is not for someone who has young children in the house who need to also be monitored. You will need to have a quiet, interruption free work space."
good,not very much down time. always on your feet. most enjoyable part about the job is the people you meet working there. worst part is that at times you feel like all amazon wants is numbers and doesn't really care for employees.
good,"Flexible schedules and quick paced work culture, pay is low but the training for the job is sufficient. Have the option to work as many hours as you like."
good,Great Company. Provided great training and great benefits. Would recommend to others. Company culture is great and great fit for college students looking to make extra money and gain experience.
good,fun and stressful but i would still recommend the job to my friends because it pays well and you will get the hours. it also gives you warehouse experience
good,Spent nearly 15 years working for Amazon. Great benefits and good people. Not big on promoting from within and would rather have someone straight out of college running their teams than experienced associates
good,The job is challenging and the experience you develop there is definitely worth it. It is a great place to work. There is always room for improvement.
good,Amazon is a good place to work. The have good benefits and the people are nice there. I highly recommend it to anyone that’s looking for a long term career that’s all
good,"To be fair, staff has treated me well. "
good,"The environment for the work place is based on the management and PAs. Some try micromanaging which makes the job stressful and unpleasant. Overall the pay, work and benefits were good. The rates were easy to obtain working inbound stow and ship dock duties."
good,Great work environment. Company is conducive for both job security and advancement. Great work ethics and job culture! Job Work/Life balance is optimum.
good,"Was really nice, i enjoyed my shift even i didn't had a too many breaks because they only gave me 15 minutes twice p/ day and half a hour, i think it's not enough."
good,"It depends who you work as but overall there are friendly people working there ,so they make every harder day a better one. If you need help there is always someone that can help you out and that is the best thing"
good,I enjoyed working for Amazon.  Management style there could use some work in regards to building a team structure rather than dictating orders and using fear and intimidation tactics.
good,"wake up and start work at 1pm and finish at 11.30pm. To be honest i didnt't learn much as it was mainly basic knowledge. work was easy, once you got to know everyone it was a laugh"
good,"Relaxed atmosphere, friendly co-workers and managers to work with. Goal oriented company with many perks. No holidays off except Christmas and lots of weekend work."
good,"TM wasn't great. Put work off on his ""assistant'. GM was wonderful. HR doesn't help you much. Was told my hours could be changed when school started back and they refused."
good,"Not enough hours. I averaged 18 per week. "
good,Fast pace - physical - management is not always available - people are friendly - opportunity to work double shifts - no consistency - some of the people hired are there for paycheck only.
good,"Was with the company for 2 years and opened multiple locations and it is stressful at times, the complany is good but the management they hire are onse that are fresh out of college that know nothing and become arrogant, theres a difference between bosses and leaders and they just hire a bunch of bosses"
good,"how to use a pallet jack "
good,"this was my second job in customer service, and it was way better than my previous experience.  Although Amazon still wants  you to hit certain numbers per day, they are more understanding if you do not, because they are more focus on being all about their customers."
good,"The amazon company workplace could be considered your typical warehouse job. The people I worked with were enjoyable and even became my friends, we even went to a movie together. Other than that not much else."
good,"As a driver we were were put into a situation were we often had to work overtime to get all of our deliveries made due to poor dispatch planning. The driver pay was low considering the cap was $19.00 per hour, and places like U.P.S. start their drivers at $18. 68. I will say they provided the best benefits package I've ever seen, but there were so many ridiculous rules that one could be fired over that you never felt safe in your position. And there isn't a union, so any problem or grievance goes in favor of the company with no one to back you up."
good,They move you around. You had no specific place for you to be. If they didn't have enough work they would send you home sometimes you will have a choice.
good,"Interesting work - you get to exercise your analytical and troubleshooting skills and learn new tools.  It is usually fast-paced here, but a lot has to depend on the department."
good,They need air condition fans were never enough and also learned that getting water was a write up because that was a posilcy of theirs but they didnt care
good,"Working at amazon was a good experience for me because I had just graduated and it got my feet wet how the real world is, so I took the  opportunity to work there and it was only seasonal but I still enjoyed myself for the the environment."
good,It was just a job that I had to do for 10 hours four days a week. The work was not a problem it was just sometimes if there was nothing to do the management felt that we were not doing our work.
good,"Working at Amazon has been quite an experience. We have competitive goals to reach, and we're always encouraged to push ourselves to do our very best. Our managers are very approachable and extremely supportive. The position that I work for allows us to work from home, which is great for people who would prefer to say home rather than going to work everyday. Even though we work alone, we're constantly in touch with our team members and manager, and it doesn't feel like we're working in a solitary environment. All in all, it's a great place to work!"
good,Bonne expérience avec une équipe agréable. Expérience formatrice et intéressante
good,"Good place to work, good place for first good, good hour an environment , Long days good pay, nice people  to work with. your always  standing  it gets hot sometimes"
good,"When working in a warehouse you can not expect the perks of the corporate Amazon. You will be in a difficult environment that pushes you to meet certain expectations that forces you to move quickly and efficiently. If you are a driven individual you will reap the benefits of a good warehouse employee. "
good,"Amazon has a very particular view on how software engineering should perform. There is a steep learning curve, but the results speak for themselves. You need to hit the ground running in this job and be prepared to focus on all the detail."
good,"Incredibly easy work in that it requires little brain power (aside from basic thinking skills), but it can get incredibly repetitive and easily boring. "
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the experience. Take advantage of the knowledge and help this job offers. Such as the resume classes, the mock interviews and anything else that can help you progress in life."
good,"great company with great benefits. the job can be stressful  at times but the flexibility with paid time off certainly makes it worth it. If the building does great safety wise for the month, small bonuses are given out."
good,The manager always allowed me to lean new thing when i was ready.they pushed you to be the best you that you can be. they made going to school easy if that what you wanted to do.
good,"Very customer focused sometimes to the detriment of the seller and employees. Managers were focused on goals and assisted employees to follow the guidelines and operating procedures. Sometimes the change in procedures were not communicated easily and were difficult to find, however open access to the subject matter experts helped to minimize confusion."
good,when u work their its a good place till you have almost work there for 2 year then you might get in trouble some how right before your about to hit you 2 year mark
good,Decent job and would recommend anyone to work there. The employees and management are great and respectful individuals. The collaborative effort of both management and employees are impressive and efficient.
good,"working at amazon is a hard place to work if your not used to the fast pace work, the pay is good but can take over your life. working nights is good and you work 3 days off 4 days on but it takes it toll after a few days."
good,"i liked it here if i didnt have to move im pretty sure i would still be there. Its a cool enviroment, but it is fast paste dependiing on what department you are in."
good,"it was fun working at amazon, but the management at the facility i was working in wasn't favorable and it's not a job for lazy people and be ready to carry heavy loads."
good,this is a warehouse/factory job. depending on your shift will determine how much of a life you have. would not recommend the 3rd shift if you are a student.
good,"This is a great place to work in several way, but it is seriously lacking in friendliness. Among management it is everyone for themselves. You either become a favorite or you are forgotten about."
good,"I love the job and the company is excellent, but at my location the only full time positions are for managers, which only occur occasionally.  Its tough to transition from part-time into a career with higher pay and benefits.  Most employees don't stay long because of this fact, which of course creates high turn over."
good,its okay for the pay that is all its repetitive and there is a lot of favoritism but for what it is its okay the only thing that kept me there was my schedule and the pay
good,Was held accountable for numbers but couldn't hold hourly employees accountable for numbers.  Great stock options and good pay.  Need lots of polish and no rough edges to succeed.
good,Amazon is an excellent job because you're always busy the  expectation is high as far as the percentage you have to maintain because of the fast pace I think it's focused on the younger generation and not that considerate of older dedicated workers like myself but overall if I could've kept my numbers high i'd still be there. A great place for advancement
good,Very fast paced. Be prepared to work hard. There us a very mixed culture which is fun.  Some people work harder than others. Just pull your own weight.
good,I enjoyed the time spent working for Amazon. There’s growth opportunities and incentives to grow with the company. I would work for this company and I’m the future.
good,An sich ist das ein entspannter Job mit viel Pausen.
good,Good place to work for the area. I have trained several techs over the years that has been promoted within the company or moved on to other companies.
good,"amazon is pretty straight forward it is a fast pace working job and you most learn to find things quickly with being alert that you have found the correct item being a picker. They allow 15 minute brakes and they give you more than one a half hour lunch, and it the dress code is pretty laid back and the pay is just as good  the managers are friendly and make sure we are prepared for work with stretches. Also allow us to leave if we sick and depending we how long we have worked."
good,It's a nice company to work at but management has changed and because of them getting in finance background managers they are unable to handle the young generation of Amazonians.
good,The monies that was spent on those games could have been a pay increase. I left this job due to needing to relocate. I would love to return to this job but have not found an Amazon site near me.
good,Getting management assistance in a timely manner was one of the worst parts of the job. A lot of the supervisors would be off at night so it seemed liked you were out there all alone when a problem arise. Customer service was not priority with them.  You cant transfer a customer unless they request a supervisor. I feel they do not do what they can to get the customer satisfied and off the phone.
good,"it was a fun experience to work. meet a lot of great people. fast paced job ( keeps you active), can potentially make good money, many positions to work for."
good,"-always learning new thins everyday"
good,"Amazon is a great place to work and learn. The culture is analytical, focused, fast-paced, and results-orientated. You are always challenged to achieve your best, but it can be tough at times."
good,The pay was worth the horrible hardwork and long standing hours. You’re provided lockers however they do not keep track of the assigned lockers so it’s easy for people to still your belongings.
good,Always had something to do and everybody was friendly. I enjoyed the hours I worked but I didn’t get enough hours hence why i got another job in another warehouse
good,"The position I worked was more of a call center. I didn't need to make outbound calls most of the time, but it was a regular thing to have customers calling and yelling and/or cussing you."
good,"Fast paced work, especially when sorting packages on the moving intake belt ( pick-off ) and ( splitter ). "
good,"have to be fast, not get distracted easily. good 10 hours 4 days schedules. your feet may be sore for the first 2 weeks but will get used to it quickly."
good,Its not so much the company itself but the agency representatives who do everything possible to get rid of you as soon as you develop a sense of security. I was at the Hemel Hempstead branch of Amazon and I can remember during my onsite induction being promised such a safe haven of a work place only to discover that the termination of your assignment is ready for you.
good,"Great place to work as team player. It is a fast paste environment if u are working on the outbound side. Over all not a bad place to work for, the employees actually work together as a team."
good,Mainly picked items from work area to ship to customers. Human Resource staff was nice. Lunch periods were short. Bonuses were inadequate. I had three day weekends but worked 4th shift.
good,Amazon is a laid back place to work however it has many physical demands. You come encounter with many different people including those of another race/origin.
good,A typical day at Amazon starts out with stretching and announcements along with the dally goal. The managers are typically just trying to do there job but it comes off like all employees are just numbers
good,"very productive and fast-paced, physical work. it's ok if you are close and have enough rest to go back. you can get good pay but working load and working time and good physique needed to continue there."
good,"You will work for your pay.No lollygagging around.Physically demanding on legs and feet. Good pay. Good benefits. Paid lunches. Time off, no problem..."
good,This is most well known company in the world and the work is not hard if you have great customer service skills. This company is very will do whatever it can to help their customers as well as there employees.
good,Although they take too much fees and costs. You can still be profitable with the great services they provide. Your products are featured for a platform with millions of shoppers
good,Good work environment. fast pace Team   work Managing team too demanding of work load. less understanding between Team leaders and warehouse workers. Hard work.
good,A typical day at Amazon is usually fast-paced but monotonous. The culture is pretty good if you buy into the Amazonian Way. It is a numbers-based job.
good,"Was a auto lane scanner. Worked part time. Mainly scanned, base wrapped, ran manual, and did auto sort. Enjoyed my time with the company. The company was fair."
good,"This is a great company. The location is more along the outskirts of Fort Worth. Training is exceptional. The benefits are really great. If you are will to drive a bit, this is a great company."
good,Easy work just fast pace in standing on feet but its easy.     Work was long days doing peak season but the pay was good due to five day 12 hour shifts.
good,The work environment was nice but I would have been happier if their were nicer management and full shift hours. Sometimes we left after 2 hours of work.
good,"Great culture with utmost independence as long as the work was done on time. Friendly managers who made work a breeze, never felt uncomfortable asking for help from someone in the organization."
good,"It's all about hitting numbers, if you don't then unfortunately your out (fired). The managers are almost always new hires but think they know everything. People get promotions based on friendships and not on performance. What kept me here was the benefits and perks."
good,this job is really good if u want to do part time or full time and you would like it if you like to scan a lot of boxes and lift heavy weights and the lunch room is very clean
good,Not a bad company to work for. Just very competitive!.You have to be willing to work hard and be very fast at the job. Need to be organized and pay attention to detail!
good,"Work is like a 10 hour workout, which I enjoy, it keeps me busy. Before we start work we stretch to help us before we perform our best every hour and each hour we are acknowledged by our rates, the better our rates in each position the more work there is. Working here, I've never met a management team that was this caring for their employees, they ask if we if need to switch into a different position or if we need water, how we're doing, it's really refreshing."
good,Easy job. The work load varies depending on the season. The workplace is friendly overall. Mostly laid back. The hardest part of the job is getting any supervisors to promote your or even notice you. Playing favorites tends to take place as well.
good,The hours are great and the training at the facility. They make it real easy to understand their computer system for your day to day task. I think it is really hard to get hired directly through Amazon.
good,"The days can drag, but you will get the hours you want working here. If you're in need of a job that pays well and you're willing to work I say go for it."
good,"the pay was fine, the job was easy. the hours were weird and they would change them all the time. they would randomly let people go not based on work ethic so a lot of hard workers lost their jobs. they lied to me several times telling me I could transfer to full time but they never allowed me."
good,"it was fun working there but the manager was being rude to the worker's but he wasn't always there.met new people, made a lot of  friends, and got to talk to other people from other countries"
good,great place to work fast pace never slow at all......................... the pay should be a lot better for the amount of work you do. The best thing its room to grow with the company
good,Lead delivery driver working part time. Very flexible working hours and days. Easy work during PM shift.  Delivered 45 or less packages per shift all within short dintace of eachother. Worked for an independent contrator which provided company vehicles.
good,it was great! Could have been better with paid vacation and sick days. Pickings job is over all stressful trying to meet your quota and rate of picking. The job is hard at times but management is wonderful.
good,most of the managers there will bust they’re butts while others just stand around on they’re computers or just talking to each other. And when asked to help they take forever to help.
good,"Very easy job it’s just really boring they promote nobody, mangers suck they don’t care if the line are too full they just keep pushing out packages even if there falling on the floor"
good,"-Quick Paced "
good,They work the worker ot hard they need to hider more worker and give they just be more fairer they are a fast pace but they got to remember  it a big place the size of a football field and when they go you running to end to end you can keep up up with the order request's
good,"If you are not in a click, do not expect to advance in your position. "
good,"buena experiencia trato al publico, seriedad, agilidad"
good,Working at Amazon was fun with the right friends and they pay well. I worked at amazon in Rialto when it was first built so not much to say about it but it was fun.
good,"It was an at home job, but the hours conflicted with school after a while. I quit due to the fact that it went against my school schedule. The managers were really helpful and training prepared you to get on the phones with the customers. When you're hired around holidays vacation is not really an option, but that's understandable."
good,"It was fine working at amazon. The hours were fine the days were OK , the only issue is amazon really does take over your life you see more of work then home especially during peak and mandatory overtime periods . If you do not have energy or time then do not apply."
good,"A typical day at work is very quick moving, you have to move fast and pick/pack the items to meet the standard rate for the building. I learned to keep cool in such a fast paced environment while meeting daily goals for customer satisfaction. Managers are a little come a go and hit or miss. I have luckily had great managers who listen to their associates and can usually find fair and reasonable solutions to most problems. The hardest part of working with this company is the amount of time on your feet/walking. You spend at least 9 hours walking around, going up and down stairs etc (9 since two fifteen minute breaks and one thirty minute lunch)."
good,"This was a good job. It paid the bills. I only stopped working there for unrelated personal reasons. If I had to recommend this job to somebody else, I most likely would."
good,"Generally it is a very friendly, relaxed and fun work environment. However during the peak season, it a very a stressful job with a lot of physical demands"
good,"Nella breve esperienza avuta ed interrotta a causa di un infortunio fuori dal periodo lavorativo., ho apprezzato il lavoro che mi hanno incaricato di svolgere."
good,"Good peer group"
good,"very high paste job, must keep up with fulfillment in order to stay there longer than a couple months or they will let you go. on your feet all day. lunch room is usually very crowded so bring a lunch"
good,My average day Amazon was quick-paced with a lot of interactions with others. the managers are sometimes aloof. They could be better at communicating.
good,"Es gibt viele Anlerntätigkeiten, die Abwechslung in die stupide Arbeit bringen"
good,"This is a very productive workplace, however can be unprofessional at times when it comes to the workers. I learned a lot about the operations of Amazon and make purchases all the time."
good,The work was fast-paced and required a lot of walking and standing/squatting and reaching for items on shelves close to the ground or overhead. Overall the work was fairly constant.
good,i thought this was an amazing company to work for and loved the job. the only down fall is that a permanent role within the company  is very hard to obtain.
good,I check drivers in and out and pallet audit my job is very chill. I get a lunch and a 10 min break most I work at night with a small group of people along side with Ontrac.
good,"Fun to place work, flexible hours which suit me. Helpful support staff, friendly warehouse staff. "
good,Sometimes you are busy and other times you are able to work on projects or other things. It all depends on the time of year. Times can get a little crazy when the company has a lot of new hires or if it is during the peak season.
good,"As a stower, you are alone surrounded by carts that are full of small products with UPC labels on them. You scan them as quickly as you can and try to stuff them into cabinets that are made out of a nylon fabric that are already half full of other products. The only time you have contact with another human being is when a Problem Solver comes to fix your computer so you can keep scanning, or when your manager makes their rounds to tell each employee that they're not up to pace, or if you're on your 15 minute break (and the building is so large it takes about 8 minutes to walk to and from the break room or smoking cage)."
good,Fast paced competitive environment but only part time. I am leaving to find a full time position that will pay more and provide a full benefits package
good,"It took time to get caught up to speed on the Amazon lingo and systems, but once there it is pretty straightforward. Ask for help and you shall get it"
good,"I like it, my job, coworkers and environment.  I work overnight which has my work like balance backwards.  So I am seeking a position during the day. It is about impossible to move to days."
good,"Although its A warehouse full of goodies to look at, Its very fast paced and you will be on your feet YOUR ENTIRE SHIFT. of course not on breaks and lunch, but still this isn't your average warehouse job this is a Workout Job as i Like to Call it. But overall I Like the Job"
good,The job was fast paced and demanding. The environment  was both professional and friendly. The aspect that I most enjoyed was the general level of independence given to the associates.
good,"I worked at Products Ads team for 2 years. this was my first team at Amazon. I learned various techniques to review content. We were into product and service reviewing. "
good,"The name-of-the-game @ Amazon is numbers. If you can improve your team's/department's/building's metrics, you'll move up the ladder. If you get an bad manager, however, you're stuck because your manager needs to support your promotability."
good,"A lot depends on the area you work in and your particular supervisor. Initially we had an awesome supervisor but he was moved to another shift that seemed to be having issues. Amazon likes to hire young folks out of college without the needed experience for the department. Had an instance where I went and asked the supervisor for assistance and she did not even know how to do what I was attempting to work on. Good benefits, crazy expectations of productivity in my opinion. Lots of sacrificing of product & company image to maintain quotas... Again, in my opinion."
good,"Work culture at Amazon is one of the biggest talking points. Work-life balance is definitely going to take a hit, especially in most of the non technical processes."
good,They treat you like your garbage. They make it clear how replaceable you are. They dont care if you haven't been cross trained on something else and will wright you up if you make a mistake without that training.
good,"i quite enjoyed working as a picker packer at inside one of Amazon.com's fulfilment centres, the roles may be tedious and rather mind numbing but the unrelenting pace at which we were expected to work didn't leave much time for boredom, if you have something more about you you will be noticed and moved to positions which better accommodate your strengths, i was trained as a pack instructor within the first 5 weeks of working here. the biggest downside of working at amazon is the lack of job security particularly as a temporary agency worker, i returned home one day after my first shift of the week and received a phone call saying that i was no longer needed ""due to the nature of the work"" and that i no longer had employment effective immediately, i knew of others whilst i was working there whose ID passes would not let them through security on a morning, only to then be told that their employment has been terminated."
good,I was well received for the project by the team I was helping.  My input was greatly appreciated when it came to documenting and altering the process to make it work.
good,"Good company a lot of growth potential, wrong people in lead and management positions. Management positions held by individuals with no clue of what they are managing. The lost opportunity cost will a drag on morale and employee turnover. The revenue will continue to power the company past this obstacle."
good,"This is a place that inspires you to strive above and beyond, and you need to be a self learner. Day to day life will consist of meetings, 1:1 on a weekly basis with your manager, writing up reports or business documents."
good,"As a process assistant, we were asked to run on minimum staffing. Dock associates felt like they weren't as important as the outbound pack associates."
good,"clock in go clean AFE/stock up everything for my packers. "
good,"le rythme est un peu trop soutenu, l' on marche beaucoups."
good,"typical day is making sure you have the required ppe, and then get your scanner, daily meeting and then go to the assigned spot and then you do what your job is,"
good,Good place to work if you get with the right team and manager. Most of the colleagues are great to work with but poor management can interfere. The work itself is fun and interesting.
good,"I enjoyed my time at amazon, i didn't make the cut for permanency so i guess it wasn't meant to be. Best of luck to anyone who applies there . As i said, its a fun place to work."
good,I loved working at Amazon Sortation Center MKE5 because of the shifts available and the potential to earn a lot of overtime money during peak season. My co-workers and supervisors were an amazing team that lead to long-term lasting friendships.
good,"Love the benefits, but it's a stressful environment.  Most of the management are demanding and are not sensitive to associates needs.  The human resource department are minimal in knowledge and give you numbers to call instead of trying to help associates.  Being multiple languages helps greatly."
good,"Amazon is a fast paced company and growing as fast. There is no typical day there. The most enjoyable part of the job, for myself, is that I continue to learn new things."
good,I felt that the Warehouse wasn't a good working environment.  It was very hot & uncomfortable; the hours were long.  Once you were trained you only saw the Supervisors when you weren't doing a good job; not much praise.
good,Fast paced work environment. Just not enough hours. I was looking for full time. Too many part time employees.  They didn’t explain certain things about mandatory overtime so points were taken off
good,The benefits are awesome.  Worth looking into by anyone.  They are very clear about how often raises are given.  Paid time off and vacation tie are both offered.
good,"très bonne expérience, valorisante et très intéressante"
good,"V Amazonu si můžete zkusit několik pracovních pozic a poté zjistit, která Vám vyhovuje."
good,Extremely fast paced environment. Typical day involves managing a team of 50+ associates to meet daily volume goals. Management is not too focused on individual career development
good,"then you can do it. its easy. okay pay,  consistent shifts, long work days but doable. "
good,boone esprie  d equipe .bonne entrepise .et bnne entente avec le personnel
good,A typical day at amazon starts early in the morning and goes until around 6 is you're on day shift. In the winter it can be mentally taxing as you work from sun up to sun down and don't really have time to socialize.
good,Management hat sich bemüht die Arbeit des Customer Service so angenehm wie möglich zu gestalten.
good,it was good time to work at amazon during my college break.they were paying good at that time also they were providing the over time.but some of their mangers were not behaving nice.
good,"If you have excellent time management skills and not afraid of hitting hard challenges head on, it can be a great place to work.  "
good,"I was one of the first associates to open the new building in Colorado in September.  So far I have enjoyed the job and the employees that I work with are great.  We made it through a busy ""peak"" season (November and December) and now are slowing down.  "
good,Amazon is a good company to work for it’s hard to balance a life outside of work when your off all you want to do is sleep. But as an adult that’s life
good,"Not for everyone, depends on site and management, stressful, long hours, mundane work...are opportunities if you can last...pay decent...mandatory overtime"
good,i would work there again. They pay their employees really well. the long hours will have you exhausted and you will not really have a social life. great place to work tho.
good,"Like the title says, it's a fairly standard warehouse job. You sort packages and scan them to pallets, making sure that the pallets are built safely. Pretty cut-and-dry expectations."
good,At Amazon i had the opportunity to work really great people everyone was pleasant to talk to. The everyday was really repetitive and kinda slow at times witch made the days go by slower.
good,It was okay. I enjoyed packing the items their at amazon. There is not really much I can complain about. The pay was not what I would have liked for it to be. They can be rather demanding with productivity. You must make your rate(how many items you pack) when working their or else it means getting written up. It seemed like older adults had a tougher time their and often resigned because they couldn't keep up..
good,I would say they could pay more for employees who have been there a year and a half and longer.  It would be nice if they offered paid time off as well for sickness and emergencies where you show at work and had to leave early due to one. Working is even tempered and moderate. It would be nice also if they brought back some things they have decided to discontinue like earned UPT' s and teamwork Tuesdays and Thursdays.
good,"maximize work performance for business needs of inbound and outbound daily goals to meet customer satisfaction. Must stay ""on task"" and be flexible to which department you will be working in"
good,"Good work experience in a warehouse setting. Audit various items we carry throughout the warehouse to ensure it's at it best quality and standards. Ensuring nothing is broken, stolen, misplaced or wrongfully labelled."
good,"It was a seasonal position, I would do it again because you get good OT hours, I would want to have another schedule though, they are on PST so the schedule hours is funny."
good,fun job had its ups and downs with hours. Peak was full of alot of hours but the paycheck was good. 10 hour days werent so bad. however when work slows down you have alot of VTO which kills your hours.
good,This was my first job ever and I was happy with it. The only thing I wasn’t happy with was the hours. Other than that I would of stayed here. I submitted an application to change schedules but was never heard back from. Almost everyone that applies gets hired here.
good,"Amazon was a great family environment, meaning the shift you'd work on would eventually turn into your family. They will keep a terrible associate for for a life time, yet fire the hardest working associates they has without a warning. Once an associate moves up from a tier 1 to tier 3 they turn into the underpaid lapdogs & are given extra work that should be done by management. It is like being a pledge in a sorority....you get beaten down to hopefully get picked back up"
good,A good place to work depending on the department you are assigned to work in. It is a fast paced environment so if you don't think you can do a lot of waling and standing then it is not the place for you.
good,It was a great place to work for such a short period of time but was very busy and hard company to work for. The company are very understanding.......
good,A typical day at a sortation center was coming in and picking then waiting for van drivers to come in. The hardest part of the job was standing for long hours on concrete. The most enjoyable was the coworkers.
good,"In my experience, if you are willing to work hard good things will happen. Amazon was no exception to this. I showed up every day ready to give my best and it did not go unnoticed. The ability to escalate myself within the company provided me with drive and desire."
good,"Amazon pushes you to your limit and expects you to work faster after going fast but they want to push you . Amazon is slavery ! They get mad when people slow down , when they take a short break to catch air , they push you until you can't go no more"
good,Environnement de travail agréable. Échauffement avant la prise de poste.
good,High expectations and use of fear tactics to keep up Rate and overall productivity. Great job for someone who just wants to drone away working their butt off without much in the way of a pat on the back.
good,The people are nice and you have great hours. You will never feel unneeded and you will be paid fairly.  If you work hard and bring a good attitude then you will be fulfilled. ;)
good,"Mornings or nights are the shifts "
good,It is a fast pace work  environment but also very fun you gain more warehouse work experience you get to learn every position that is in the warehouse
good,very fast paced and stressful environment. Good place to work however management does not understand roles of associates and make calls that can sometimes make job difficult.
good,It was great for the first 6 months to a year. After that you start seeing how poor management is. Also after about 3 or 4 years your won't make much more than 16.00 an hour max.
good,"You are in a company that wants to give its best to give the customer the quickest delivery possible.  Also the goal is to give the customer perfect merchandise.  No damaged goods for them if possible.  I enjoyed working at Amazon.  Good management, good assistance to problems, and good fellow workers.  I kept myself busy and tried to give my best every quarter.  My goal every quarter was to pick as many items and to do better than the last .  Hardest part was that eventually the last quarter I was close to spent.  I would work there again if they would want me or need some more help."
good,"The Amazon was very decent with me. But in the same sense It was poorly raned at times. They definitely need a change in management.In all honestly, It was a love/hate job."
good,Amazon provided a safe working environment. Amazon was well-managed. The workplace was always productive. Amazon offered good incentives and rewards for employees.
good,"The days are long but pass by quickly. It's fast-paced sometimes with little true progress. "
good,"fun enviornment, great leaders. if needed help, others would come and help you finish your work. they never asked more of you than you are able and comfortable with handling."
good,Amazon has a very fast paced environment. There is consistent work and everyone's friendly. Gets very busy during peak season. Everything about Amazon is competitive. Everyone is treated equally.
good,Was hired through a temp eventually became permanent.  Stay for 2yrs got my CDL through the company with a total out of pocket expense of $250 which was great being that it would of costed me $4500.
good,Fast pace along with problem solving. There are day and evening shifts that you can switch from after working there for a year. Managers are good in some areas as some are not people person.
good,Good place to work but can make you tired really fast. Nice pay and a variety of start times. Different buildings you can work at. Needs better parking.
good,I love working at amazon and I love the people I work with. I have never worked in such a positive work environment among such talented people who are passionate about their work.
good,"Ubicación céntrica, instalaciones modernas, café y snacks gratis, buen equipo de trabajo."
good,overall I will say did amazon looks out for their employees with the discounts and paid time off/ vacation I would high recommend working here if you like peaceful warehouse environment
good,"I enjoyed my seasonal employment at the site. Fast-paced, friendly employees, an incredible amount of team work! Really great part-time job in my honest opinion."
good,good place to work. good leaves. work from home option cab facilities provided. encouraging managers and team co workers. great pay for deserving candidates.
good,"Great place to work after you graduate high school."
good,"Managers try to keep up the moral while working in a really fast pace environment. You are very fairly treated. They always have something like pizza days, pie days, fresh fruit days, ice pop or ice cream days in the summer."
good,A very fast pace place and they were very flexible with the shifts available. The warehouse was very clean and everyone was very nice. They were also a very diverse place.
good,"Empresa familiar que sempre prezou pelos seus funcionários, bons benefícios e ambiente de trabalho bom."
good,"Overall, Amazon is an excellent place for people just breaking into the job market. The atmosphere is ideal for first-time job seekers, still trying to break into the job market. The place is young and 'vibey', which is perfect for young people."
good,"Great place to work, great people."
good,"the day goes quickly as a picker, your must hit your targets or there is a risk of being let go. the trainers are very friendly and nice overall, enjoyed working here as it is easy and management are kind, this review is only for the work place in Peterborough EUK5"
good,"it's very fast paced. long shifts, usually 11 hours or more. new management isn't the best. hardest part is being on your feet all day.and it gets a bit tedious."
good,Attention to detail is definitely required while working. They were excellent with providing accommodations when I needed them. I do enjoy working here. Mandatory overtime is often implemented so if you have another job make sure you choose a shift that it won't interfere with. I think that the training that you receive could be a lot better.
good,"Consistent work. The job can get a bit tedious at times. Not a bad work environment just fast paced and very customer oriented. Decent work, Decent pay, and Decent people. Not too much to complain about as long as you do your job to the best of your ability."
good,"Amazon can be a great place to work due to their benefits, but the management and leaders are very naive to the work done by the associates.  The management seems to have their specified favorites when it comes to promotions and advancement.  "
good,They gave out false information about helping me switch departments. I wanted to switch departments because I injured my hand. They said they would allow it first but then changed their minds for whatever reason.
good,"mandatory overtime, system malfunctioning, you only received team work if you knew the other people, because people form cliques. morning work out before you start working"
good,"Overall good work experience, but you don't always feel appreciated as an employee. LOA team never knows what they're talking about and neither does HR."
good,I Answered all the Questions as honest as possible  it was cool a lot of rapid moving an high volume working you get three breaks 2 fifteen minutes an a 30  minute  lunch
good,"During my time with Amazon, I felt the company's passion to please every customer. They treat their staff well and provide many amenities in their break rooms."
good,"Productive And Fun starting point job. High paced working facility that isn't for everyone. Long Hrs,countered with adequate breaks,again recommend as a good first job or rebuilding job."
good,was an outbound worker and was on a 4-10 shift called the donut shift was a great shift.  was not difficult work but some goals set were a bit to high for certain people.
good,"You will be worked HARD here.  Expect to be worn out by the end of your day.  3 day weekends were really nice though.  There is a high turnout rate and job security is non-existent.  But if you are physically fit and can handle the stress, the pay and benefits are pretty good."
good,I worked at Amazon twice. Obviously it wasn't that bad if I went back a second time. You know you are going to get hours and pay is Ok. You just have to keep up with they rate they want you to hit each hour.
good,"If there is one thing that Amazon is known for is that it constantly changes. You walk in the door and something is bound to push you to do one thing or another. Some Managers were great but a lot of them were high strung and stressed and contently pushed for numbers. A lot of them would disappear throughout the night and leave the job for the Shift assistant to complete. The one good thing about working there are the coworkers who make it tolerable to be there. The pay was good. But if you aren't the type of person that can handle stress then I wouldn't really recommend working here. As long as you are willing to put the handwork to last at least the first 3 weeks, everything else will be easy."
good,"The staff and management were all helpful, enthusiastic, kind and grateful to work for Amazon.  Might take a season or two in order to get hired on but I liked the experience."
good,"a typical work day for me was okay. A lot of work, no growth. fast paced hard on your body. Good pay. Management are okay, can be pretty bossy and annoying."
good,It was good working there. Easy job and tasks. The Amazon that I worked at only dealt with producing and shipping books. We never handled the other items that could be bought on the website.
good,Amazon could be an excellent place to work but management and HR are incompetent idiots. Management makes things harder than they need to be and dont like taking advice on job processes.
good,amazon is a very productive work environment always kept you in your feet. it was very on hands; the management was well managed it was a very enjoyable work place.
good,"Its very hard work and very fast pase, but its a good learning experience, and the hours and pay is good, i say the best thing for was mandatory overtime was the best. A nice place to work to get ready for the holidays"
good,The trainers and staff at the amazon center are happy and welcoming. The overall work place was very well organized and the management was very on top of things.
good,"Amazon is simply Awesome"
good,I worked at an Amazon pantry warehouse.  Workers were provided protective gear while working in the chiller and freezer.  It is extremely cold and you work 10 hour shifts if you're full-time.  My immediate managers were great and always appreciated my work.  There is a high turnover due to the environment.
good,"I work in, what has been described as by others that transfer, the best amazon facility. From what I've been told, Den 5 is the the place where we are actually nice to each other. So take this with a grain of salt."
good,"We always had a goal set of how many items we needed to get in our carts. Constantly moving, helping coworkers out in every way possible. Management would walk around to help out."
good,"Hard work, wish I could have stayed longer to learn about other departments and advance in the job. Management lacked many times and often times managers would not help the workers on a hard day."
good,"They expect too much out of people, here. Not everyone is going to excel at the job. Working here destroys your body, to be honest...You're on your feet for 10 hours and it's hard work."
good,"First thing when you arrive at Amazon is you get together and stretch.  Then you would collect racks to put the bags of packages on them, so we can stage them for the Amazon Flex Drivers."
good,"I loved working for Amazon. within 3 years I became a mentor and helped train associates in my skill in the Philippines and Seattle. "
good,Amazon was great in the fact that I had complete control over my schedule and I worked from home. The only problem was that I never received much personal contact and review from my supervisors and my responsibilities kept increasing but my pay remained the same.
good,Everyday you had to organize boxes in the right place and making sure everything is put together. I’ve learned to be more of a multitasker in a fast quick pace. The management was decent. Although you never got a one on one with them often. Variety of people from all over. Hardest part of the job is that you don’t get much breaks while being on your feet moving fast. It was really nice meeting new people and learning different jobs so it was nice having a variety of things to do.
good,must be able to stand for 10 or more hours a day work overnight shift and be productive or you will be replaced sometimes your hard work doesnt get noticed. I believe it is a job for younger people since most of the managers are in their 20's and need a degree to advance
good,Load the company van with all the parcels going out for delivery. Once you have completed your route then you would either go home or required to assist another driver with their route.
good,"Great job"
good,"They have been one of the few places that haven't passed on me so for that I am grateful. The work is not for the weak willed. It is tedious, mutinous and laborious. But you will also gain fitness and substantial financial profit. If you can endure it then it is for me, I was an did while I could, because of the season of when I was employed I was eventually let go. No hard feelings about that."
good,"I started working here for little over 3 months . They are very critical on quality of work(what they should be). Even the most confident will have a problem one way or the other. They give you rates you have to maintain everyday, so your always on the go for a order picker. It becomes difficult when they close empty spaces and your left trying to find where to store products. It can be unorganized a lot of the time, which plays a big role in your rate...There has been times when my RF scanner would change products right in front of me, or shut down so if I stowed a item in the system would come up as an overage. Just be mindful of what your doing, a lot of problems occur from the system. If left unmentioned, can lead to repeated problems."
good,Overall its a good place to work fast and laid back work environment. The pay for what I do could be a little higher. workplace culture is relaxed and laid back.The hardest of the job is trying to keep your rates when picking orders.
good,"Good to work with Amazon, great working culture, but I personally have issues working in the night shifts and wasting my most time in travelling to the office as it's 40kms from my place."
good,A typical day at work is always busy. I Manage a lot of different departments so it depends on the area im working in. I have learned that Amazon is the number 1 distrubitor in the world and i am a proud member of that team. the hardest part of my job is when we a lack of staff the most enjoyble part of my job is getting the customers orders out on time.
good,"load and unload freight from trucks and sort it, i learned how to operate a forklift, the hardest part was the hours you never knew what they would be and most of the time it was late hours"
good,"Its a cool and perfect job for someone who likes to be on the go and doesn't really mind delays on the road and things like that. Also if you have your own reliable car thats even better. The job isn't for everyone though because it can get a little stressful if you're unable to meet the deadline they provide you, but other than that its a nice job."
good,"Amazon, i met some lifelong friends but other than that, supervision played favorites a lot and there we not enough mangers to workers. Which led to improper training and a lot of injuries."
good,calm place to work at. managers were friendly and very respectful. I only worked as a part time but was a really good experience. I would work here again.
good,My experience at Amazon Fulfillment was fairly good. I have learned how to be very fast paced and how to conserve my energy for 10 hours a day. The managers that I had were fair and reasonable. Workplace culture is basically safety first. The only challenge I would have is when there was not much items from the trucks that would come with freight. It all depends how many orders have been made.
good,must be on feet  10 hours   they really stress that you make rate   needs to improve with training  each  trainer tells  you thier way  of doing things  even if you have learned one way   stessful  for people who are really  trying  impossible to make the rate each day
good,"I am a Dock clerk Assistant Manager at Amazon my duties are to insure all of my associates are working and making rate as well as taking care of what freight comes in that day. My day is always hectic from the time I clock in to the time I clock out to go home. Management is poorly organized need some work in that aspect. The culture is fast peace, everyone just looks out for there own well-being. The hardest part at work is when I have to confront one of my employees to let them know that there job performance is not doing so well, especially when I know that day we might be having issues with either the system or sometimes freight. What I enjoy more then anything is getting to know all kinds of people and their culture."
good,"Only trouble was usually technical issues with employees.  "
good,Very difficult to make the jump from a contractor a salaried permanent employee. Enjoyed beautiful office with stunning view and wonderful semi-subsidized cafeteria.
good,"a cool place with a western influenced culture at workplace; a lot to learn where in many things coming in as an oppurtunity, there is also a transparency in the s/m"
good,You will have to get a certain amount of picked items nightly to reach a rate. If you do not reach the rate you could get wrote up after not achieving the rate. Very athletic job
good,I loved the schedule rotating work days .one week you work 4 days and the next week you work 3 days . Only thing I hated was you work 12 hours shifts and only get a 30 minute lunch
good,"Best factory job I've had and Amazon goes above and beyond to provide for their employees- I,e. Coins for the vending machine, vacation days from the beginning, paid time off from date of hire, free sacks/food on breaks, and a customer oriented environment."
good,fast paced environment that is constantly changing.  it is a decent company to work for the benefits are decent but unless you are used to physical and mentally demanding labor it is not the place for you.
good,Lots of packages to get ready to ship out fast paced and lots of work to stratify our customers. It's busy but they do advocate safety. and promote a safe work place.
good,"Fast paced, Stressful environment,  High Quotas to meet even though I had no problem some of the other labors had issues meeting quotas. Large warehouse."
good,Trabajos rotativos en obra. Con sus descansos establecidos.
good,"Typically you would start the day by doing stretches, then I would usually go sort on a line. Eventually, we would start wrapping pallets that were getting full, take a break and do it all again (though we were in a part-time building working full-time as a temp.)"
good,"working amazon requires hardworking because you have obligations and work rate to meet with..if you are diligent  and hardworking in your work position,you have a stress working day otherwise you be able to meet your rate and that will have a negative impact on your standing with amazon"
good,"Nice management, nice co-workers, very fast pace environment, a lot of walking and standing. Holidays are paid. Large and clean breake room. Non-stop working until break time."
good,Every day is coming with new challenges. Coming with new processes and changes applied with success in short time of period. Focusing on the customer.
good,The people were enjoyable and  the work was not all too hard. The management team was very helpful and always offered assistance. The hardest part of the job is the constant lifting and moving.
good,"My day is just work and more work.  There are way too many managers in this place IMO. "
good,"N/A not authorized to rely work activities . Signed contract stating no disclosure of activities. "
good,"It was a challenging fast paced environment. had the opportunity to meet many people and built lasting friendships.  "
good,"This job is in line with rideshare jobs such as uber or veyo. Major difference being the physical nature of the shipping industry. Typical day is scan boxes, load them into your vehicle, and deliver them to customers doorstep."
good,"Great place to work and good learning. Have best environment, collaborative, innovative, engaging, inspiring. Good work environment with best work life balance"
good,I would recommend working there if you are willing to stand and walk for 10 hours a shift. If you are in shape and can work at a fast pace this job is for you.
good,Everyone there works hard to meet deadlines and are given the creative freedom to do so. Because they have manufacturing and engineering in the same building it make communication much easier.
good,Amazon is becoming the world leader in online retail purchases. This company has great potential and if they could offer their employees better benefits they would not have such a high turn over rate.
good,"Amazon is a fun place to work, the work can be hard on some days , easy on other but management always made it fun so that you were not stressed. 4 days work weeks were nice as well."
good,"you frequently get new managers "
good,"Overall not a bad place to work. Just know you have to work hard and stay busy. Good benefits, but the pay could be better for the amount of work required."
good,"start off work fast work all the time, work without supervision most off the time.  everybody is being watched all the time so have to be pay attention of your surrounding and your job"
good,It is a not bad place to work the people are friendly for the most part but they have alot of vto days and it is hard to reach hr when needed. it is a fast paced environment
good,"Good place with good pay , but you dont learn much , there are people doing the same thing for 3 to 4 years and people grew to be managers in 3 years from basic level"
good,work was relatively easy it was just long hours and somewhat low pay. Great management but there was a lot of people to keep track of so sometimes they over looked things. It was relaxed environment except for holiday season. Sometimes had to work 10 hours of overtime which wasnt bad just tiring. Wish they paid a little more.
good,Scanning and packing customers orders. Lots of heavy lifting at times. Managers play music in the background to keep us motivated towards the end of our 10 hour shift.
good,Relaxed work place culture. Great place to come up with organizational/process inputs to the upper management. Needs accelerated work ethics to raise to higher levels.
good,Fast paced delivery using an app to scan and pick up packages and deliver them to customers. Adventurous job/ site seeing. Working in dark places where you can not locate the addresses. Putting smiles on the customers face when they recieve their packages after just ordering them
good,Very productive and laborite work high volume in productivity received. Would like to relocate from my recent location as well as the job. Learned from the sided management for such a job and assembling of the people we need to help do the job.. The hardest part is when all is not on board to get the job done and it's not distributed in a functional way. The most enjoyable part of the job is completing it to it's full capacity at the end of my shift.
good,A typical day at Amazon was when it was truck day and there was too much overstocked merchandise that had to be scanned in. The boxes would  come on the conveyor belt non stop.
good,"I work anywhere from 13-15 hours a day. Amazon is a great company to work for, but the work/life balance is tough to deal with some weeks. I take pride in building a ""fun"" culture with my Managers and associates. An upbeat and happy culture will help deliver positive results. The hardest part of my job is having to balance my time at work and my time at home. The most enjoyable part of my job is working along side so many great people. I enjoy development within the facility. Any chance I get to give someone advice on a developmental opportunity...I take it."
good,"it is a fast paced, stressful, and competitive environment. There are production and quality goals that must be met every week. You must be in excellent physical shape to work there. The people are stressed out but the managers are friendly. The benefits are really good. Once you make your peace with it, you fall into a pace that works for you."
good,"Very stressful work environment for a job that would otherwise be easy. I understand the reason for this, however, as we move a tremendous amount of volume on any given day ranging from fidget spinners to high end electronics."
good,I will recommend this job to anyone who's looking for one and has very great work ethics and good benefits if I didn't have to relocate I will still be there
good,"Management is mostly inexperienced college grads right out of school. The company as a whole tries to keep morale up within the buildings by giving incentives and goals. The safety team is great at involving everyone in upholding a safe work environment. Probably the strictest place I've worked as far as safety goes, and that's a good thing. You need to be a motivated employee to keep your job, but unfortunately there's a high turnover rate."
good,"i had learned time management, risk management, health and safety. the supervisor was very co-operative and helpful. health and safety was very good. Overall the job was very helpful in understanding all the managements."
good,"•	Training new associates for the job "
good,usually a very long and boring 12 hour work day. came in had our brefing and went on with our work putting away shoe after shoe. management was very friendly and helpful.
good,I very much enjoyed working with Amazon during their peak season. Hours are great and there's always plenty of work! No need to dress up for work because dress code is casual which is a plus considering working in a warehouse.
good,"A typical day as an FC picker. You clock in and meet at stand up with your manager, stretch and prepare for the day. grab a scanner, log into it to see what your assigned path is going to be. Find an oreder picker, fill out the safety checklist before operating it. Proceed to pick your items on the orderpicker or on the floor and drop off batchs to pack areas. At the end of the day you sign out of your scanner and order picker checklist and go home."
good,I loved working at Amazon. The people made it worth coming in and working hard. But the management and lack of consistency in policies/enforcement made it very disheartening and stressful. I would definitely go back if there were some better oversight and care of the associates.
good,"Fun place to work, but it is hard to spend time with family. The building where I'm from requires a lot of audits to be completed which sometimes take away from the job and communicating with the team. Managment does try to help, but you have to hope to get a good one. I Enjoy learning how the process flows from start to finish."
good,"This was a fun place to work at very fast paced but overall, a good place to work .although  it was seasonal. you can get a lot from working at a place like that."
good,It's a lot of physical work but your body gets used to it after a week. Pay is pretty good and getting paid every week helps keep up with the bills. Wouldn't be so bad if I wasnt working a second job in the daytime.
good,great place to work always have something fun and exciting to look forward to. upt time is a great ideal. Amazon gives a discount for the website. A typical day at work was very fast paced and productive. Non stop packages coming and the water machines are an added plus.
good,"It took two weeks after being hired to get a place on the line, then after that I was moved around twice. If you're doing this then you know what you're getting into. Hot warehouse job that pays the bills."
good,"Was good experience in job.. TL was good and motive us to do work , co-worker were good to hang with give us brk when weneed all the work is done with good motivation"
good,"fast paced. learned to work with others. Management could have been better.workplace culture didnt motivate. hardest part of job was that rate was always getting higher and higher. Enjoyed meeting good coworker, and new friends."
good,"Worked lots of overtime; fast paced, decent pay, short breaks and lunches for hours worked; driving to Kenosha in snow difficult; no notice when laid off no advance notice"
good,"Meeting rates of productivity and quality of performance are closely monitored. Time spent off-task gets noticed. Management is slow to respond to requests and have to get after them. Benefits are great and many have families and health issues that hold them there."
good,great place to work.. a lot of overtime offered during holiday season. different opportunities to work in different roles through out the facility. monthly bonuses
good,"Amazon was an overall very fast-paced and busy, but fairly easy when it came to the actual work load. The environment and workplace  was enjoyable overall. There is huge diversity which I enjoyed."
good,Amazon is a great place to start if you have little to no experience. The pay is well and benefits are good. Management is why most people quit as they can be rather unforgiving.
good,steady paced and willing to work with others on a daily. Moderate to heavy duty on some days. Exciting and easy to learn. Good place to gain warehouse experience.
good,"i learned diferrent cabling technics and how to be efficient to cable equipement on the go. i did lot of last minute deployment and repairs."
good,Learned a lot from the years I have worked here and I have grown a lot from this place. I have trained many associates in the day to day process of an amazonian. Just no room to grow when you know so much.
good,"You can have fun and work in amazon, one of the best workplace culture. most enjoyable part in job is you can take breaks when ever you want, nobody restricts you."
good,The attendance policy way to strict about the points system. There needs to be a more allowances for absence. The atmosphere was great. The hours are also flexible.
good,Work is really easy to do and you get paid decently. One complaint I have is that after 3 years you dont get any more raises and you hit top pay which is only $13.50 for a regular employee in Texas. Only way to make more money is to get promoted which Amazon does encourage. I've seen many get promoted after only 1 year of service there. Friendly atmosphere and people tend to get along.
good,"Work is hard but fun great people work there.Clean bathroom.get adiscount for working here."
good,"Leadership needs improvement, personal attitudes should left at the door, all associates should be cross-trained, service equipment quarterly,  pay associate's clothing allowance."
good,"For the most part I enjoyed my time at Amazon in Kenosha. I found most of the supervisors to be personable. Occasionally other associates did not have good attitudes or were not productive, but that is an issue found in most warehouse settings. For a part time job the compensation is good, but with strict attendance rules (especially for seasonal associates), Amazon can make balancing your job and personal life a bit difficult, and sometimes it felt as though I was planning my entire life around what is effectively a 20-30 hour a week part time job."
good,"Working from home with Amazon is a great opportunity. Although they don't have much give for work/home balance, especially when you have a family, the job is straight forward and not difficult."
good,"There is really no typical day at work when you work for Amazon, every day is different, if it wasn't than it would be a boring place to work."
good,"I can honestly say Amazon is a great company to work for if you looking to make a decent pay check and go to school. The benefits are wonderful too, as well as a great way to meet people from different cultures."
good,"The work isn't difficult, but it is physically demanding to stand for 10 hours a day. Management makes poor decisions, changing things just to make themselves look good, usually causing associates more work."
good,No es muy bueno para el.driver por que no cuidan al trabajador
good,Smooth on-boarding process as well as training. Friendly and helpful environment. Must have great multi-tasking ability and pay close attention to detail.
good,"If they would keep their associates up to date about policies changing instead of changing them without us knowing and suddenly terminating 50 plus employees for not following policy it would be a great company to work for. Benefits, incentives, motivation meetings... It's all good and the Amazon dollars when you are exceeding rate expectations is cool. It's nice to be recognized for good work. I know them firing all the permanent workers and then hiring double seasonal is saving money but it's not fair to treat your associates that way."
good,The people that work are pushed to do more. The people that do as little as possible are not talked to at all. I complained and was told not to rock the boat and just do my job or I wouldent have one. It is a good job  if you dont mind doing the same thing over ond over and over again. I would  work for them again part time.
good,"Amazon has a great business culture. As a result, it usually attracts great people. In the fulfillment centers, everything is metric based. So workloads can be quite stressful, and extremely fast paced."
good,"Shipping, packaging and loading was the typical work day. Everyone is friendly and management is great. Simple and efficient with the work place and had no problems."
good,"Typical days were long but easy. Learned how to operate forklifts and train new hires with ease. Nothing was ever too hard, just required a fast pace. Easiest part was stowing items as it just required attention to detail and a fast pace."
good,It is a fast pace and very competitive job. The people who work there are like family. good environment and very safe. HR is always willing to work with life situations. and the on site nurse is competent.
good,"It's esay to adapt to the work environment, work by youself but htere is always someone to help. great place for excersising."
good,"With Amazon i feel they should have paid compensation for mileage also considering i put 10,000 miles on vehicle in less than 5 weeks.  It is a good position but need a lil help with maps"
good,good company to work for.Very fast paced and they hold you responsible for everything that you do. They hold you to a very high standard. They expect the best out of you
good,"Reno 1 in Fernley, NV (no longer exists) was great. Made a lot of friends, had good management and leadership, and work was easy. Have not and don't plan to go to Reno 4 in Stead, NV, nothing but bad reviews and experiences."
good,Amazon.com does give you to tools you need in order to get the job done. Being able to work from home is a great benefit. Although the staffing and schedule changes can be heavily impacting.
good,"I am very satisfied to work in Amazon and  to work in walk in.  I recherch to work there with pleasure,   In my work, I respect it, to work as my time well, to be sure , to be regulate in my work. Thanks"
good,"Morning meeting while you stretched. Picked items out of bins, packed items in boxes, received items in, shipped them out, slammed them with labels, loaded trucks"
good,"I worked at building Hou1 and transferred to a new building Dhou1 and it was horrible, no security no hr and no good managers, I still can't scan on my own id yet and just working thre till i find new oppertunity for jobs"
good,"general relaxed environment, friendly team members, have random actives, fast pace environment, different areas to learn, generally friendly management,"
good,"The facility I worked was very fast pace warehouse. I learned that they really focus on your safety and every part of the warehouse from Admin to the worker bees, maintenance and medical were available and open to all shifts truly a wonderful experience if you are into the warehouse quota mentality this is the job for you."
good,"typical day at work consist of locating the pick up location loading items checking making sure everything there then making deliverys in timely manner,"
good,"Working at amazon was fun, but tiring. You meet alot of cool people especially night shift. They had alot of incintitives and made work fun. The management on the other hand is HORRIBLE!. Amazon hires straight out of college kids that you can still smell the beer on their breath from frat parties, with no experience in managing logistics or knows anything about hard labor. So dont worry about moving up in-house. Theres a 20% chance youll move up."
good,The office was a great place to work as the Amazon culture is quite different from the rest. It is quite relaxed and encouraging. It was a stepping stone for the start of my career.
good,"amazon is very fast paced."
good,Fun and Challenging Work. Interesting crew. Sense of team spirit. clear and transparent management with reasonable supervision and excellent pay for the position.
good,"good shift, helps you keep fit and there are great people to work with. learned to pay attention to detail in job role. most difficult part in the job is the repetitive nature of some of the jobs."
good,"Amazon is the world best online shopping site.Founded in 1994, it has reached now to a strong customer based worldwide with its service, after sales services and commitment to deliver on time."
good,"good benefits, long hours. i would rather work day shift than night shift being a mother and all. easy but boring. i would highly recommend it to anyone"
good,"i just worked the dock and went in, out of trucks there i earned my forklift license and started checking in trucks logging them in the computer didn't take long before i was eligible to become a supervisor"
good,"Typical day at work, drove the vans and delivered packages to house and businesses. I would have to say that the hardest part of the job was finding parking to deliver a package on a busy street."
good,"the work was fast paced I was able to keep up , but I wanted to go to school and asked for part time they told me I had to quit and re apply. Then they told me they had no openings in part time so I was without a job."
good,The people are nice but not a job for people who are older. The benefits are better than most places and the health insurance is great. They will usually accomodate your school schedule.
good,days at amazon became very displeasing as management came and went and the same employees stayed even with less and less respect. The benefits and bonuses made me stay the 6 years that I did.
good,"Hiring process to long, then when it was time for me to work there were no more positions available at the atlanta location. i dont not have a car. the commute was to hard so i had to resign. which sucks."
good,"fast-paced environment. good and nice management. but no opportunity to thrive. your contributions are not recognized, so everyone stays low. The best thing is that they give us flexible schedule based on the school schedule."
good,"Amazon is a great fun workplace. Things I learned while employed at Amazon was how to use a forklift, Inventory Control, and many other warehouse positions."
good,this job was good i learned a lot and took some important infomation out of it and i would recommend it to a lot of people the pay was good as well as the people
good,"The job was very interesting because I enjoy helping customers. The support was not good especially if you work in the evening  when a lot of supervisors are off. Escalating a situation can take an act of God. Not customer centric in my opinion. I feel it would be a great place to work if they improve their training by making sure csr are ready for real customer through shadowing and Hands on practice, also make sure they understand the first level before moving them to the next level. I spent two days in level one and then had to take level two calls before understanding level one."
good,"Working egress metal detector there was a rush of impatient workers trying to get through the detector on the allotted break and lunch periods. I learned to ease their impatience through levity and increasing my efforts to get them through more quickly. "
good,"Working at Amazon has helped me pay attention to detail, stay organized and focused on my task. The work environment is friendly and fast paced. I would recommend this job to family and friends."
good,"Prima bedrijf om te werken, fijne collega's en een goede werksfeer"
good,"The pay is decent but really should be more. The floor managers are nice, but I felt like I was not valued by the company as a whole. The job is very fast paced and accuracy is important."
good,Amazon is a great place to work as far has having great benefits and the people you work with. The hours are rough and it is hard to balance work life and personal life.
good,"Amazon hires kids in there early 20s mostly, turn rate of hiring and firing is high due to lack of mature adults. Its a fast pasted environment and if you cant keep up youll be fired. They have a rate you have to make."
good,I was seasonal so you are on your feet pretty much all day. Good experience in knowing how the fulfillment center works and processing returns. Not particularly difficult just  a matter of being consistent.
good,I only worked here for 2 seasons in order to pay for my studies. it was a great experience getting to know people and the culture of a corporate environment. This a great starting place for individuals to get use to a working environment.
good,"I have enjoyed working at Amazon, but unfortunately have another career choice due to long hours, repetitive job task and duties and my schedule which does not work well with my school schedule."
good,Typical work day was on your feet for hours always having something to do and being around positive people. I learned proper lifting techniques and methods. There wasn't really a hard part at this job. The most enjoyable part was always being on my feet and having something to do.
good,"Buena en general, gran empresa,,, Quizas abusan del trabajo temporal."
good,"Have learned alot in terms of dealing with international clientelle. Received awesome opportunity to be a part of a great team. Presented new challenges each day, inbound, outbound calls, emails, chats, promoting the company's ideals and standards, and providing all round customer service."
good,We start the day stretching and talking about safety. Once work starts it is face paced and they always want you to work faster and faster. Breaks are 15 minutes but the includes walking time so you only end up with less than 10 minutes to sit.
good,"I loved the work, but the culture of taking breaks from work to take care of family and other obligations was not sustainable.  they did provide a casual environment."
good,"It isn't a bad job, but it is hard on your back and feet even if your use to this kind of work. It seems no matter how hard you work the managers don't seem to really notice or appreciate it. They just try to get you to work harder. They are really on you about using UPT (unpaid time), but don't give you a lot of PTO( Paid Time Off). It could be worse. It is better then working at McDonalds and you don't seem to need any kind of experience to work, so that is a plus. All in all it isn't to bad but not a job I would work at for a long time."
good,A place where u work your way up and having opportunities to better your career and make a better salary wage than you start with I would like to reqttend .
good,"Nice people and management. Free coffee and tea or often food. 5 hours shift, extended to 10h per day if you want. Almost all bank holidays working. Busy warehouse and wages not adequate to it."
good,"It's a nice place to work at, but if you are a temp/contract employee you will need to go through a full loop to be converted to FTE and your quality of work there won't help you get the job, you will be evaluated as if they never saw you."
good,"Amazon China works in a very fast paste culture, a typical day would be expected to work multi-task taking on many projects as possible which is beneficial for company and own development."
good,I like this job. I like the people and atmosphere.  I am an order picker and do inventory control. I just wish there was more work so the workers would not get sent home all the time
good,Lots of fun. As with every company there are some great teams and some terrible teams. Amazon does a great job encouraging innovation and does an nice job supporting this. Amazon is also one of the few companies that truly puts customers first
good,"Overall a standard work environment which is number driven, Rates are manageable and operating powered industrial trucks are practically a most. Good benefits as well."
good,"I learned many things while working for Amazon. I would probably not go back again, however, because the work is physically demanding and I would not recommend to older or out-of-shape people."
good,its very good to work with amazon and management is also very good staff is very supported and environment is very good .each member is very supportive
good,"good work, good hours, no short shifts. the only issue is eventually burning yourself out due to the constant, repetitive nature of the work itself. excellent benefits."
good,Amazon was an okay job to work for. When they approve your time off without even looking to see if you have the time to be off is what is bad about the company.
good,At Amazon I picked products that were ready to be shipped out to customers as well as packed the products when they were ready to be sent down the conveyor to be loaded into the trucks. This job often times required me to fix the ranpack machines as well as the label maker whenever they would malfunction.  At this job I also had to teach the new employees how to do these things as well so they would learn for the future.
good,"A night involves starting your shift by clocking in, followed by a team briefing where you find out what is needed for the day, After that you collect your equipment and begin your work until instructed and moved onto other tasks or the shift ends."
good,"a typical day at work: "
good,Amazon is one of the best place to work as the working environment is different it's more fun loving environment. Got opportunity to learn how to investigate and find frauds and control the same to make Amazon one of the trusting E-commerce company to shop.
good,"Its ok to work here, however they only offer Temp or permanent part-time only. There is no benefits at all since your here as a part time employed. The people are very nice and the co workers!"
good,"It was my responsibility to collect customer orders, insure that the items were in good condition and undamaged, and send them along to the next step in the process."
good,"The best company to work for. you continuously get enthusiasm because of your peers, management and even the ceo. instant recognition for your efforts is guaranteed."
good,"the hours affect social life, theynot rotational and available for 24 hrs."
good,great place to work plenty of overtime during holiday season. after new years it slows down and lot of voluntary time off. great benefits. log hours and a lot of time on your feet
good,"I train associates at stations they do not understand. I also asin-flip, which is getting the product ready to be shipped out of the building. I help the production by trying to create a smooth flow of continuous work down the line."
good,Amazon is a stepping stone to making your future great. It is a demanding work environment but after a year of service they offer a career choice program. The career choice program allows the employee to further their education in a field of their choice. If you wold like to make it a long term employment thy do have many chances for advancement.
good,"great company to work, has lot of challenging technology, you will learn everyday and great team and get lot of support to grow your skills. a Great place to work"
good,"Working for Amazon definitely had you on your toes, the constant moving around a giant warehouse, were both challenging, and fun. it was like a work out inside a job"
good,Have enjoyed working with Amazon and have been with them since the initial set up in India.Looking at using my acquired skills and seeking senior level assignments
good,I have enjoyed my time at the Amazon Fulfillment Center and have worked with alot of great people. Fast-paced environment where you must meet your deadlines and be able to produce great results.
good,The atmosphere of the amazon company is very good. The security of all associate is very importent. It is a good company. The holiday plan is very good.
good,"Fired for having -1 on UPT. HR claims they emailed me on this, but I never received any emails. HR could've requested a meeting with me to discuss this before firing me, they never did. Others treated the same way as me. Injuries acquired on the job, never referred to a doctor or any workman's compensation either. Getting together with others treated as I and we'll discuss a class action suit against Amazon perhaps. We will get others for across the country as well to join this crusade."
good,Loved working in the facilities dept. Was always working on something a little different from day to day witch help make the days go fast.Most of the team members were very pleasant to work with but reason for my leaving was that there was one guy that I continued to have problems with and The Hr dept just would not handle the problem.So i was continuously Harassed and after 5 yrs of it and had to walk.
good,"Amazon is a wonderful place to work at. There are different management styles.  The Managers that have been with Amazon for more than 5 years are really great managers.  The newbies that come in and have not been there a year, does not understand the culture and lack the sensitivity to become a great manager.  They do not help develop the individuals that have great strengths but rather focus on individuals who are friends with them.  Overall, Amazon is great and kudos to those managers that have been there 5 or more years. Keep up the great work!"
good,"Good training, and good exercise most people stayed positive and ready to help. Easy to learn the job and always work available."
good,"Good people, pay could be better and also more hours. Otherwise it's a good place to work for part-time. Also I would like to see some paid benefits from the company for employees."
good,"Catch up on work that needs to be done, learned to drive a forklift, how Amazon FC's work, Analyze data, it is a multicultural workplace, it is challenging when it comes to assigning tasks to a group of people, we are business athletes, basically translates to getting paid to go to the Gym."
good,Amazon is ultra competitive. Leaves you always watching your back. It's a must to always strive to be better than the person next to you. Creates great products but leaves you always watching your back.
good,"This job was very fast paced but was very fun."
good,the pay and benefits are great if you can put up with being harassed every hour about your work. the work days are long and they treat you like a robot
good,"A very demanding job, costumer focused with a H&S culture implemented and followed across site."
good,"Typical day begins with a group overview followed by a periodic stretching routine and the work day begins. Management was very friendly, the walking may have been the hardest part of this job for some people but to me it was the most enjoyable part of the job because it helps you stay in shape."
good,"Amazon is a company that has you working hard and has you at your best. Its a lot of bending, lifting, walking and fast paced. If you like that, then this is a job for you! I enjoyed it because it keeps you in shape."
good,"Everyone I keep talking too about amazon says it's bad... it's not that bad all things consider, yet you work. I guess I'm Romanian and I'm used to it."
good,Fun Job challenging at times. Would be nice to have more freedom to move about the house when the calls are slow. Most customers are nice just treat them like a friend and all is good.
good,Good experience first hand for noobies. But long term goal isn't a good place in my opinion to stay. Work long hard hours and very hard to move up in position.
good,I had a fun time working here! The machinery was easy to learn and they had a great training program in place. The workplace culture was very welcoming.
good,This is a very fast paced company. You work 10 hour days and 40 hours a week. During PEAK seasons you are working a minimum of 60 hours a week so no time for family.
good,Easy to grasp once given a little help. Navigation could use a little adjusting and it can be hard to find parking sometimes. Customers are happy to see you arrive.
good,"long hours, the management is not the best, but get the job done."
good,Amazon.com was a fulfilling and rewarding job experience. I really enjoyed working for and being a member of Amazon.com I would recommend this job to anyone.
good,"I was able to work from home for Amazon and I did enjoy the work and the customers, reasons for leaving are between Amazon and I.  However, I highly recommend Amazon customer service for individuals who truly enjoy helping others, are able to have open communication with team members and their managers.  Individuals will want to have the need to learn and implement Amazon policies with respect and empathy towards their customers."
good,"Amazon gets a lot of stick but if you dont mind working then its not bad. take home £300 per week on night shift, my highest wage was £570 after tax which i got for 4 weeks overtime £2280 in the run up to xmas was great. People are friendly enough."
good,I really enjoy working with Amazon. I am seeking employment elsewhere only for an opportunity to receive more competitive wages. The company is very professional and there are plenty of chances to work overtime.
good,Good  nicejob and expected one  i need a highest post i need a job like in amazon  i like to work in amazon   achievement ..............................
good,"Customer service representatives handle customer complaints, process orders, and provide information about an organization’s products and services."
good,The long hours were the toughest thing about this job. working 10 hours at a very demanding and high pace company. the salary was nice. management was very helpful. but could be a little picky at times.
good,Productive workplace they have a convenient schedule you can pick your shift that you want the staff are very welcoming to everyone
good,"I know it's temporary work, but the company could give you a heads up before one's term ends. I'd also love to know about opportunities to become full-time (especially when I'm on record of meeting 200% of my goal every shift)."
good,Overall the managers and HR really work with you and help accommodate every situation. The hardest part of the job was the actual shift times for overnight it was really unusual. I didn't really make it my business to learn anything I just simply did my job.
good,"At Amazon a typical day was a hard 10 hour shift which consists of two 15 minute breaks and a half hour for lunch. The downside to working for Amazon is the rates you have to hit are very high, I would probably say that hitting the rates is the hardest part  of the job. On the other hand the most enjoyable part of the job is that there is always over time and that's even more money to add to your weekly pay."
good,"This is a good company to work for. The pay is good, the hours and days are good, and the insurance is good. The management and supervisors were all very nice as well."
good,My experience at Amazon was great. While working at Amazon I have experience working in a fast past environment. I also have experience being a team member with my co-workers.
good,"Very good working atmosphere in the heart of the city of Leipzig with "
good,Fast paced environment with a lot of hard heavy lifting. although warehouse work is hard I really enjoyed it and found the days going by really fast considering how busy I was.
good,I worked in the packing department during the Christmas season. It was pretty hard work but not to bad. The worst part of the job is how boring it is.
good,"Even though this job was only Seasonal, it was great place to work. Our team was always looking out for each other. It was an rewarding experience to be among people who care about their job."
good,"This job is somewhat easy, the hours are okay. The one unfair thing is they take time away from your Unpaid Time Off if you can't stay past the time you're scheduled to."
good,Its a great job you get to learn more about the city and you learn new things. It keeps you on your feet and in great shape. the hours of kinds long depending on the route.
good,"I have no negatvie things to say about this place.  They do worry about family time to well just you being able to have a life out side of its walls.  "
good,"I enjoyed working here."
good,"Would love to work there again, fun people and environment. There is a feeling of family and at this plant. I have nothing but good things to say about amazon.com I had fun we made history and we had fun of every day. This is a fast paced work fast place and you make great friends here."
good,"Better to be working 10 hours per day, every employee should work a week in each section, assign employee to where he/she is more productive. Most of My co-workers had the same view with me. the job was very interesting. The hardest time is when you are being sent to pick just one item in part M from the 4th floor."
good,Typical day at Amazon is to train and engage associates to follow the standard work procedures ...to have a Safe and Defect free work place.. meet customers satisfaction
good,Amazon is a very good company to work for. Pay and benefits are reasonable. The job is sometimes tedious and repetitive but not particularly strenuous.
good,"Amazon is a great place to be, though every team is different. I am grateful to have worked with an array of immensely talented people that honestly cared for the customers we supported."
good,Worke dat shipping anf it was easy. nice chill place to work and cool co workers. I had to make sure orders were rigt anf ship them out. wwe had good amount of breaks
good,Customer obsessed warehouse but management motivate employees and alot of changes for advancement. Other associates make work fun for the most part the warehouse is made up of young associates.
good,Great place to work but the training is needing to be revamped and to be put in actual scenarios.  Training should be updated to go along with all situations you may encounter.
good,Not the best environment for coworker friendliness but overall good job with real nice pay and tons of bonuses. A very understanding place in terms of weather and traffic and gives plenty of opportunities to succeed
good,"bad management, not approachable with associates, communication problems. "
good,Amazon is an good place to work for your first job. They give you higher than minimum wage starting out and they have a lot of opportunities to advance.
good,"I worked  in a  department  called  Amtram , we used  to  sort  the  boxes on the  pallets  and  wrap  them  "
good,"Always was exited to attend work, very friendly staff. Learned a lot about packaging and codes. Managers were very helpful and loved their job. I enjoyed learning how the company works."
good,Managers do a monthly meeting to let everyone know how's things are going as a building and as a whole company informing them of new and exciting things to come for employees and customers. They hand out tshirts exclusive to employees. They celebrate birthdays by having birthday lunches each month. Hey run competitions to help boost production with cool prizes like gift cards. Benefits are nice they give you stock that after a certain period of time with the company  becomes yours. Peak hours are rough but the pay is worth it. Most managers and supervisors care about their employees by pushing you to advance but in my department they played favorites. That isn't true for all departments but for mine it was. It made it hard to advance. They would only let certain people train for the next position. If you know somebody you're good but if someone doesn't like you you're screwed.
good,"Working with Amazon offers great job security. This job is definitely not for the lazy. The break areas are employee friendly with video games, multiple microwaves, a lot of refrigerator space, and a large selection of food (even healthy) to choose from during breaks. There's a daily huddle where you will be informed of things that you need to do or watch out for to make meeting your quota achievable. The warehouse is huge. When you're proficient in an area just let one of the supervisors know that you are ready for a different department. HR is available onsite for every shift for any questions or concerns."
good,"Working at Amazon was a good experience. Being able to learn how to work at a fast paced environment is pretty challenging at first, but then you start to get used to it and enjoy it more. The managers at Amazon were amazing. They were really helpful with any questions and the energy was so great."
good,Amazon was a really fun work place. It had numerous great co-workers. All the management were nice and they did everything fair.
good,It was really fun dealing with different customers. It always kept me on my feet. Had to make lot of executive decisions.
good,"HR and Managers need to be more supportive of their workers. But was an overall good experience with coworkers."
good,tutto era un lavoro accettabile orari pausa e un modo buono parlare con i colleghi e responsabile di azienda
good,sucha good place if you looking to get hired as soon as possible as they hiring process is fast. sometimes you have to work over time
good,Nous sommes amenés à être a l'heure dans ce travail. Nous devons être rigoureux et concentré respecter les lieux et être attentif.
good,"Engaging and always something to do. Hardest part is walking the warehouse in a day to day's work, although you get used to it. Learnt how to well under pressure."
good,Amazon is a highly physical job with four 10 hour work days and with management that is a hit or miss with experience. Lots of different people with different personalities.
good,"A very technically minded organization with a view to proactively engage with new prospects. "
good,"good company to work for. fun place to work and the people are great. the money is good to as it is weekly pay which is a great help."
good,"This work place is for top workers, because even the work is demanding and some times extensive demanding, is also rewarding and you know if performing, you will achieve the best. I feel as home when going to work, not a joke."
good,Good work ethics but very strict. Very friendly people to work with lots of training given. Seems hard to become permanent as an agency worker as they get rid of a lot of people without giving them chances.
good,Ultra competetive atmosphere but the hours are good and the management is upbeat. I work on the line so my job is just scanning boxes. They keep track of how many boxes you do per hour and post them in the break room. This makes a very competetive atmosphere
good,"The work load seemed very unrealistic.  Wanting numbers that most cannot reach, and most cannot keep doing repeatedly from day to day,  standing, ladders, scanning for ten hours a day, four days a week.  The repeated motions lead to aches, pains and stiffness in joints and back, that would cause one not to not perform their job proficiently."
good,"Amazon is a great company to work with..."
good,"A typical day at work would be loading trucks, wrangling boxes and packing the daily shipment . I learned how to load trucks properly, and to make sure the shipment label was correctly placed. My co workers were great and made it a friendly environment. The hardest part of my job was getting the heavy boxes to stack properly, and the most enjoyable part of my job was wrangling the boxes off the conveyor"
good,Straight forward job role which involved me having to receive goods and label them. Involved good attention to detail and having to be able to meet targets in a very fast paced environment.
good,Day to day work changed since I was trained in a few different areas. The managers and other employees  were nice. They had races with pizes to see who could pick the most in a set amount of time.
good,I took the job for the holiday season and had no complaints about it. I enjoyed the hours and the scheduled breaks every two hours. It was a pretty cool first job.
good,"Very organized place to work, great management and coworkers. Everything gets done in a timely manner and the hours and overtime is great, so is the pay!"
good,while working for amazon I got plenty of exercise. would walk 15+ miles on a single shift. the work was very fast paced. yet I would have to commute often the wages made it worth while
good,I enjoyed working with amazon. i learnt how to deal with clients and different type of people from different background culture. The most difficult time is the day it was raining and i have to deliver package on a must condition. working under the rain
good,This place is a great place to meet people and experience and develop skills. The company through the hiring agency was a bit difficult to understand because the policy is different to Amazon.
good,Down to earth type of employment. Everyone was so quick to help if you did not know how to do something. If you got backed up someone was always there to help.
good,Overall it wasnt a bad place to work at. There are few things that bothered me but sometimes i even felt good in the team. The working hours are very lon tho.
good,"10-12 hour days 4-6 days a week. Friendly people, friendly management, all around good place to work, decent pay. I suggest living close so you don't have an hour drive there just to drive a cherry picker around for 10-12 hours and then drive another hour home, that wears you out quick!"
good,Working environment is so pleasant and u will enjoy your work.You can meet different people and can learn a lot from each and every one. Totally nice place to work..
good,Very busy and fast paced company. Lots of very smart and very nice people. Great place to learn and gain great experience.
good,"Amazing working atmosphere, friendy ...attractive package.really likesd the energy here.freshers with good communication and positive attitude can work here with ease"
good,"Pros:"
good,its like a big family everyones the pace is fast and hard you just have to stay on task I love working there and would go back anytime
good,"Amazon is an okay company to work for with all benefits, but managers were very disrespectful. The work they had us doing was very easy and simple sometimes the work was slow coming in which gave us not much to work with."
good,"Amazon carries any and every product imaginable, and as a Picker, I was in charge of gathering up the incredible variety of orders that any and everyone in the area were snatching up.  Every night, I would end up walking over 10 miles across the incredible aisles of merchandise, traveling from one end to another for each portion of my assignment.  I greatly enjoyed the fast nature of my work, and all the curious wares that Amazon provides its shoppers."
good,It is a great company to launch one's career. Amazon gives one a great opportunity to develop skills and gain experience that will benefit he or she greatly as they go throughout their career.
good,"There's very little work life balance for most people who want to move up, and the managers are constantly changed around between buildings and departments. In order to move up there's a huge barrier to entry level advancement as Amazon needs base labor, so the majority of folks who start at T1 end at T1. That said, there's a lot of opportunity to grow within your area, and if you're seen as a leader you can become an Ambassador."
good,"Le plus dure dans ce travail, c'est de garder une très bonne cadence!"
good,Guter sicherer Arbeitsplatz mit zukunftsorientierten Marketing
good,Peak season rewards amazon bucks to purchase merchandise .The standing is really ruff on your legs and feet. Be prepared for 10 hr shifts at all times not 8.
good,Working at amazon was great. The team was supportive and each team member helped another team member. The fun part was that I had the opportunity to learn about customer service culture and how to communicate with people. That built my confidence.
good,"The only good thing about this job was the benefits that we received . the warehouse was unorganized, they could NEVER get orders correct. the management was lazy and unprofessional (customers were not first as stated)"
good,"This place is fun and an safe environment . The coworkers are nice, and they have good benefits. Working at this amazon is better than any other place I've worked , its an easy and stable place to work."
good,Its a really nice place to work. Everyone works together to get the job done. Its a fast pace job which I am comfortable with. I like to keep to myself sometimes but I do work well with others. Usually im not there at work to make friends im there to work and stay focused. Im willing to be with a company for at least a year and somewhere down the road to go back to school.
good,There was never a dull or unproductive moment. It's a great place to meet new people. It is very fast pace and you have to keep up with their rate system.
good,It's not the best place  but for a first job it's a good place to be the people there are respectable  enough I do also recommend Amazon as a first job
good,"I found my experience at Amazon to be a team effort workplace, very friendly and helpful associates that I've ever came across in any job. Anytime I had an issue with anything, the managers were always around and willing to help and resolve a problem in a fashionable manner."
good,The company has taken a lot of flack recently but its not that much different than any other tech company. You'll put in some long hours but it is also very rewarding.
good,"Its good job to see different area and people every day. But in down town, its hard job because of traffic and parking problems."
good,"Amazon is Safe for working and two dayoff in a week is nice, but hard working. But here fun all times with all employes working systematically"
good,This is a good job to work for. They treat you fair. The  pay is good &  holidays are catered for your lunch meal by a professional catering company. I think that's really nice don't you?
good,its very hard job. very big company every week new people. if you working in agency you did-int know wen they fired  you   but if you working for amazon its good and good money
good,"Very challenging and fast growing environment. Complex problem solving in a limited time to keep up with the pace. Very smart and nice co-workers, Can learn a lot in a very short time frame."
good,It was a productive workplace and it served its purpose for where I was in my life. The work environment was ok. That is all that I have to say about the company.
good,We take phone calls all day. Either customers or drivers needing help on their deliveries. Management is good. I enjoy helping the customers and the drivers to get the deliveries done. I enjoy my co workers. They are awesome.
good,"Hardest part of job mis communication."
good,"Come in, do your morning stretches, get to work. Wait until lunch and then do your after lunch stretches. Wait until you get to clock out, Come in again the next day, rinse and repeat."
good,Was a great company as far as letting me acquire skills that can help me in another warehouse environment later in life. It was fast paced and very challenging at times. The people were very nice and willing to help. Management was always changing so that was a disappointment.
good,"Adequate place to work. Needed job I could start quick. Management is friendly, hours are horrible, money is average for a hourly position. No job is too difficult in the whole warehouse, pretty easy going"
good,"Generally, is a fun working environment but management is very unorganized and too much favoritism is in effect. I would recommend other people but they will be aware of the unfair treatment of all."
good,The people at amazon are wonderful to work with minus the management. The long hours however are no fun when your called for mandatory overtime due to lack of planning.
good,It is a nice place to work at they have some communication skills that need work. Everytime you come into work you will stay busy the entire day. If you don't like to work this is not the place for you.
good,good place to work for your adults just starting to work. benefits are ok. some long hours on your feet. lots of overtime during peak months. not for people that can't handle stress.
good,"Personally, I liked working for Amazon. They do have a few issues when it came to management. I don't think many of the people in those positions had much experience in the field."
good,"Great company"
good,Everyday is very busy. They are willing to cross train you in different area's for you to be a well rounded person in the facilities. Management is great.
good,Amazon is always growing and making new changes for the better. It's a very fast paced environment with plenty of new things to learn if your the type of person who likes a challenge. I've learned a lot about the in's and outs of how to run a successful business in my short time with the company.
good,It was a good experience and variety of culture. Good communication between management and co-workers. The hardest part of job was going to pick at level 4.
good,"Every Day is First Day "
good,"went to work all the time and did the same thing, there was no challenge. literally everything was the same every day. the people were very nice. there was no real security At the job, watched many people come and go."
good,"Fast pace work place....good place to learn e-commerce and retail...overall poor training, training is completed on the job no formal training structure..."
good,"Great job, fun environment, needs better pay and better benefits. Make the schedules more flexible with people's life and improve management."
good,"Amazon is a fast paced working environment that requires long hours, short breaks, and consistency. The job itself wasn't hard it was the long standing for 10 hours."
good,"Amazon trains you for whatever job you are placed in. I was a warehouse forklift operator. Many different schedules to choose from. Great second job or retirement. You do have to make a quota of the products you are picking, Shipping, or stowing. I needed a little more pay. Large give away at Christmas, such as complete computer systems, LGE screen TV. and Tablets."
good,Amazon is a great place to work. They really take care of their employees. Great benefits and room of promotions. Love the four days on and three days off.
good,there alright I wish there was a little bit more room for improvement in company and more communication between sr. leardership and HR when I comes to promotions
good,"Amazon is a great company with a vibrant, fast-paced culture. Compared to many companies, the level of responsibility and freedom to make decisions, is higher than it would be for equivalent positions elsewhere. Management tends to be an area of weakness, where many times leadership and team-building is de-prioritized over a highly competitive results-driven mindset. This can burn some people out pretty quickly."
good,it overall was a good company. Didn't like how they controlled everything. Mangers wasn't really helping the workers when something bad happen.
good,Always guaranteed 40 hour work week.  Decent Pay.  Steady Income.  You get a good workout working here.  Good employee relationships.
good,Very good company when it comes to customer focus. Intelligent driven people.  Management lacking soft skills to be a great place to work.
good,A typical day consisted of making sure that all trailers are safe and secure for associates to enter and load. It also consisted of making sure that all paperwork is accurate and that the correct load is picked up by the correct carrier.
good,Amazon is extremely hard on any of their managers. Turn over is very high due to the hours taking a big toll on work/life balance.
good,I loved working at the company even though your on feet for 10 hours. They gave out 40+ hours a week and paid well. The managers were cool sometimes but sometimes demanded too much like we are robots. but overall I liked the experience and the employees were pretty cool and glad I got to work there.
good,Very demanding and challenging workplace. If you are prepare to work under pressure most of the time this is company to work for.
good,Everyday you worked hard but also enjoyed the day. Anytime you had a problem they fixed it with no problem.
good,Working for Amazon was a fun but demanding job espically during peak season. Enjoyed the job & the people. The hardest part of the job was being inside all day.
good,A typical day at work requires managers to run their departments and address productivity issues throughout a 10 hour shift.  You need to stay on your game all shift and also think about the future and improvements that you can make across all shifts.
good,Amazon is not for the faint of heart but it is a good company to work for if you can physically keep up with the demands of the job and the length of the the days. The benefits are really good and the comany does offer really good additional perks.  What helps you really push through the shifts are the people you work with. It is worth the experience to work there.
good,I love the fact we get to compete for prizes such as best work performance throughout the day. The free pizza appreciation days are cool also
good,"My job consists in :"
good,"You have to structure you're role yourself and have to have very good time keeping in order to remain on top of it. Adhoc activities appear daily an need attention. "
good,"As I done nightshift, I didn't have much of a social life so I was solely involved in my work. they were usually 40 hour weeks yet sometimes it was 60. the most enjoyable part of my work was the people they were all well natured and fun, they made the hard work easier. The hardest part though was the long hours but I got past it and got on with the job."
good,Amazon is a great place to work if you are looking for stability in a work place. The management is really good at making everyone feel appreciated for what they do for Amazon. They also provide you with  simple ways to find help if you aren't getting grasping something. I enjoyed my time at Amazon and appreciate the way that I have grown since working there.
good,"Amazon was a great job for the amount of money we made. It was a very busy job, so the days went by fast. Amazon taught me how to balance out my work life with my personal life."
good,I love working for a company that is always changing and blowing the competition away. the people are great to work with especially the Hr department.
good,"Not good at clear direction nor at letting one know about permanent opportunities.  Once  you understand the process it is alright. There is a disconnect between who work for and the HR department. Your work ethic is not as important as you are lead to believe, as long as you meet their numbers. Which I did however once they reached an designated date all seasonal associates were let go, with nothing other than ""if we need you we will email you"""
good,It's okay as long as we have good products shippped in which allows us to meet out quota.  When it's large items it reduces the quota and allows for productivity to appear better.  We are trying to pull other boxes so that we can make sure to get our numbers right.  Good benefits.  It is very fast-paced and sometimes you don't even have time to use the bathroom or take your break when you know you need to get your numbers up.
good,This position was very physical and strenuous. I learned teamwork and time management. Management was very helpful and understanding. The hardest part of the job was getting used to the long hours and being on your feet all day. The most enjoyable part of the job was the diversity of employees.
good,"It was my first job, I had no experience prior to joining. I was trained in every field I worked for including professional ethics. It was a nice place to work. Unfortunately, I had to quit to continue my higher education."
good,Everyday was the same thing but we got rewarded for our hard work and the management team helped out a lot. Mostly all the workers there are friendly and very willing to help out with anything someone needs. The worst part about the day was the second half of our shift when didn't have all the items we needed to ship out but the success felt great once we got everything shipped out.
good,i drive an hour away and work my head off for me not to advance and be disrespected. The place is a nice place to work but the management is not the best
good,amazon was good place to work honeslty. the job had it flaws but it wasnt bad the hardest task of the job was being there because of the walking and the long hours you had to work sometimes the co workers would be rude and some would be nice it just all depends on what kind of mood they were in.
good,"Working in amazon was always great, the people were great to work with, fun and friendly. there was plenty of opportunity to grow and progress which was a great bonus for me and lots of other people I knew."
good,Working at this company I gained experience in warehouse and learned how and why shipping in a high pace environment effects customers reviews and experience with the company.
good,The hardest part about working in Amazon was meeting a goal because of the large amount of inventory but the easiest part was to follow the instructions and training of the more experienced. I learned that this line of work is for anyone who is very goal oriented and or accurate.
good,"having worked at amazon for 4 years, I enjoyed my time there and was able to work in most areas of the company and progress through the departments. amazon also job security and great benefits for full time employee's."
good,Great place to start if your a first time writer. I've used Amazon Publishing through Kindle. Its a slow start as a no name so don't quit your day job to quick.
good,"Having Amazon as a client has helped me prepare for any future employment I may have. It has taught me the true value of caring for not only the customers, but the associates as well."
good,"Working at amazon last summer was good. As a shower i would take items that were coming in to the facility and ""stow"" them in areas that they belonged to in the warehouse. The hardest part of the job would have to be that you are on your feet for the entire ten hour shift. It can get exhausting if you are not used to it. Although, there were two fifteen minutes breaks and a thirty minute lunch throughout the day. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people. I got along well with my co workers whenever I would speak with them."
good,a typical day would have involved walking around fifteen miles around the warehouse and plenty of squatting. There are two brakes consisting of half an hour and a forty five minute lunch. Everyone was treated fairly and the work was very fast pace.
good,A typical day at work scan package. Some co-workers help. Day go fast. Get training before performing any job. Good part time job
good,"A typical day consist of scanning items from the truck to go into the racks, I don't have a problem with management, I am always on task. I consider myself to be a team leader and help out where help is needed. As we enter into the slow season, the hardest part of my job is not getting my full weekly hours, but I sincerely enjoy working with my co-workers to get production"
good,This company should show some desire to have those that work hard get promotions throughout the organization. They would rather hire someone off of the street than to promote those within the company to higher positions.
good,"Excellent pay, flexible hours and decent benefits is what attracted me to this job. However the plant is huge and I felt very much like a small cog in a giant machine."
good,"If you are keen to learn then company will provide you ample opportunities to learn and explore."
good,"I had a wonderful job at Amazon. Then I got a new manager. Things went downhill from there until I was recently terminated with malice. So, don't try to do too much, go with the flow and don't be female if you want to be in management."
good,The most enjoyable part of this job was meeting new customers everyday. The hardest part was to satisfy unhappy customers. The management was great and flexible with scheduling.
good,I've worked with Amazon for 3 1/2 years. I've received 4 promotions during my employment  There are a number of routes to take within company as far as advancing. I've learned a number of traits anywhere from being able to teach and become a learning coordinator to being a full time mechanic. The hardest part of the job is the turn over of management. One would leave and employees would have to learn a new manager all over again. One of the many good things about Amazon is it was only a 4-day work week. That is convenient for people with families as well as for people who had  second jobs. Overall experience is a pleasant one in my book.
good,The managerial staff was very unorganized and very demeaning. They were indecisive on the process that they would want completed but in turn harp on you if you were not doing it correctly. The atmosphere as far as other employees was hospitable and easy to work around because you could keep to yourself if necessary. The hardest part was the unorganized atmosphere making it hard to know what to do from one day to the next. But on a good day you will find it very easy to work and not stressful at all.
good,"The average day at consist of me leading a sort line in the fulfillment center. I have to close, pull, wrap and stage pallets all while maintaining a productive sort line team. In this position I have learned to manage multiple tasks at once and maintain on time volume needs."
good,"Busy, fast paced and physically demanding work environment. Long working days but goes by quickly because of the work pace. Co-workers are great and lots of people with the same work mentality. The hardest part of the job is achieving your rate goals, once you become acclimated to the environment, achieving those goals becomes easy."
good,"You always learning something new or finding ways to grow or improve on the things that you already have become accustomed to."
good,"As a picker you work alone, you want to meet your pick times on each of the items that you have on your scan gun. Always stretch as a group before you shift starts which is great because you're on your feet walking and reaching for things high up for long hours at a time."
good,"A typical day at work would be started by stretching at Stand-Up while managers involved the associates with updates, achievements, goals and upcoming events. After, I would go to my packing station and make sure my station is completely stocked and set up, and i log into the system to begin packing out orders. Co-workers were just as busy but still very friendly and helpful. Hardest part of the job would have to be standing for 10 hours while continuing a repetitive process and making a rate of 100 units per hour. The most enjoyable part would be the environment and feeling part of a team when participating in power hours and everyone tried their best to do their jobs as fast as they could, my highest rate reached was around 160 units per hour. I loved to challenge myself and always try to pack faster then i ever had before and faster then most of my fellow packers on my line. Surpassing my goals was always the best reward."
good,"I was in the picking department, it was very fast paced environment and not long enough breaks. I just wished they would consider how far the break rooms are from the work stations. Some Managers were great and really knew what they were doing. But others were far too young and didn't have leadership skills."
good,"I worked 8 hours per day in amazon in packing, picking and return area that was very exciting work. The atmosphere was very nice."
good,always fun and something new. exciting. constantly learning new things. set schedules. plenty of time off. fun place to work.
good,"Being in packing at amazon is the best job ever because your one step closer to getting customers their products. a typical day in packing at amazon is just getting a tote and scanning the products to place in boxes, envelops , or wrapping, once that's done it is sent down the line to be placed on the correct truck to be shipped out."
good,"Operated at the one of the world's largest e-commernce businesses. Did a lot of inbound/outbound operations.Good management, hardest part was the variety of work that was given. Enjoyable part was the machinery used."
good,"A typical day when I was working as Ops Admin was conducting reports, attending to associates' concerning, and general progress throughout the warehouse. My manager was very personable and cared for those people working for him. Hardest part in the job is when it gets extremely busy! Most enjoyable is the ability to help people daily."
good,easy going job nice pay good chance to elevate. friend environment good place for work bonds an friendships to start. I enjoyed it.
good,An overall day working would go by fairly smooth. Before the shift starts we would gather and discuss the goals for the day for 5 mins and than head to our stations. I decided to unload trucks since it was a task I was comfortable with. My supervisor was very helpful and guided me with any questions that I had. The 15 min breaks were the only downside I would say but overall it was a good environment to work in.
good,"*Typical work day is call center work. "
good,please don't give your company to contractors and take man power from universities. and because it is useful for a lot of people it means it is specifically unemployment also to get the benfits from you.when ever your taking directly.
good,"Amazon is great! The people are kind and genuine for the most part. What I love about Amazon is that it is very culturally diverse. However, my time over at Amazon Lab 126, I guess you can say I am not like most workers there. I dress differently and my physical appearance portrays to most people as me looking a lot younger than usual. "
good,The only thing I really did not like about working there was the walking. Had to walk 3-5 miles a night. Other than that the job is good pay is o.k.
good,"Benefits are great and starting pay is decent, but after some time you hit a dead end. Your raises stop, promotions are nearly impossible if you dont know the right people. They dont seem to care about the people who have been there for several years. Seniority means absolutely nothing"
good,"It has been fast pace production line work. You cant stay away for moment."
good,fun high energy atmosphere. co-workers and management would always be more than willing to go out of there way to help in any way they could .i enjoyed the the time i spent there.amazon Phx#3
good,"A great opportunity to work in a large well known Distribution with,"
good,"I like working with Amazon mainly because you have various shifts to choose from, not much overtime except during peak, and the option of working overtime if you need the extra cash. You're also given a few days worth of time off, which I've never been given with any other temp agency. However, Amazon doesn't provide much job security. Once you get there, if you don't make rate you have the option of resigning or being let go and you have no idea if you'll be good at the position before hand so you have a 50/50 shot. I like working here for a short period of time but not long term."
good,"At Amazon they make you work hard, environment can be tough and they expect you to overcome your limits by setting hard goals. Especially peak demand times are hard ones. At the same time you can meet really smart people there."
good,"Managing the business for 2 footwear brands."
good,"Overall rating*"
good,"No two days are the same, a very organised place to work and the management seemed approachable."
good,"Bon boulot mais difficile"
good,Job is as they tell you a warehouse job if can learn the job within the four week grace period and get adjusted skys the limit
good,A typical day at work for me would be lifting heavy tote from a conveyor and placing them onto a cart. When the batch would complete i would take the cart over to the packing area. After a long 11 hour shift i would go home and sleep.
good,Amazon is a solid organization with lots of different avenue to explore for your career. If career advancement is what you are looking for as well as learning new skills and working with very intelligent competitive people - this is for you. Great for someone who is fresh out of college and has the time and energy to invest.
good,loved that they gave overtime alot. My co-worker were great and very cool to work with. The hardest part was that it was seasonal.
good,The work was repetitive for the most part. They help you learn quick and get right to it. I had a great experience working there.
good,"Very energetic and productive work environment"
good,Days at Amazon were long and fast paced. The management at Amazon is very good and they treat you very well. Co-workers at Amazon are fun and well rounded and make the days go by quickly.
good,"The pay in this company was good, but I that was about it. I never knew how long I was going to be working there since it was a seasonal position. No one seemed to know anything and everyone has something different to say, including management. They would change the schedule last minute."
good,"During the months I have worked at Amazon, I have participated in the company's three major inside tasks: stowing - stocking, icqa - stock counting/correcting, and picking - picking stored items off of the storage shelves, placing them onto a basket and then sending them off in conveyor belts to be packed; all of which had a time limit fixed to them to achieve a set target goal per day (the most challenging part of the tasks) and then feedback of the productivity level recorded for each week - this had in fact spurred me on to take charge of my role and as a result led me to achieving over the 100% mark consistently on a weekly basis."
good,"gathering requirements,work life balance,training team members,gud work life balance,good co workers,great learning,friendly company for dogs"
good,well and i can best from my side for working in your  company and at present our compan rating in my college is about 67%percentage
good,"In quanto picker, ho imparato a essere veloce nel mio lavoro e di sviluppare memoria e precisione."
good,Amazon has been a great place to work. Very fast paced environment where they push their employees above and beyond in a good way!
good,Fun to be a part of team each year that consistently sets new records for the network.  IND1 is the highest volume facility in the NA network and is the backbone for the company.
good,"Fast paced,"
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job-"
good,"A typical day would be to be sat at your desk, answering emails, chat messages and phonecalls. The atmosphere is very fun and relaxed despite sometimes getting angry customers. Amazon really looks after their customer service advisers very well."
good,"I would like to get full training in all area ,place people where they can keep up and get more work out. In-ducking is very hard if the two people don't keep up with each other."
good,"Good work place for the hard workers. The company has talented co workers. The hardest part of the job is ""On call"". The most enjoyable part of this job was working with my colleagues and learning from them."
good,Great place to work for. Always fun and a very casual work style. Wonderful company with benefits and perks. The office started to get crowded as the company grew. Helpful leads and colleagues.
good,"A empresa vêm buscando o mercado  de sandálias , porém não busca melhoria no processo fabril."
good,"I found Amazon to very aggressive, fast paced, quick to change, good salary, innovative, accelerated growth, multifaceted, global, company with boundless resources and many skilled people all pulling to make Amazon bigger, better, and the best."
good,the job is what you would expect being a sales rep a coke. Get your job done and sell and no one bothers you. Very little input from managers.
good,"- Research and write effective mail is my typical day at work"
good,"you walk about 20-30 miles a day  but it is a great place you learn a lot from them, they are super nice and its a great place to work"
good,Very good overall experience in terms of learning but the amount of work can be seen everywhere and it eats up most of your weekends.
good,"fast days , great pay . Good hours and amazing benefits . A lot of overtime available when needed . Smx paychecks every week. Amazon every 2 weeks ."
good,"Working there more than once, I have been working in three different work stations. You have to learn to work as an individual because you are rated on how fast and how well you got your work cleared for the night. Co-workers were easily made due to the family like atmosphere but that was also the hardest part. I your co-workers got behind you individually would be assigned to pick up their work as they were dismissed for the shift. Most enjoyable part would be the checks you receive every week, feeling like you have earned that money for the hard work."
good,"The pace was very fast at this company.Consistanly on the move.Had to always be aware of surroundings so you did not get run into or over by forklifts and carts,Head was always on a swivel."
good,Very hard work. Strict management but the employee to employee relationship is very good. very big on maintaining rate.
good,"I worked there for 8 months, I started in the UK Retail department 11am-10pm then later I moved to NA retail which was night shift 10pm-9am great thing was free transport to and from work night shift, very casual working environment one can wear anything to work, there are showers too, free parking if you use your car."
good,"The work is easy in all departments, the longer you're there the more responsibility you may inherit, easy to move up, the standards change too much as consistent as about 3 times a month"
good,"A typical day involves a quick stretch to get everyone loose and ready to work. After a quick pep talk everyone reports to their assigned positions and performs their assigned task.  What I learned while working at Amazon is how to work as a team to get the job done. The hardest part of my job is the amount of physical effort is needed to get the job done.  Since Amazon is an online retailer, a lot of packages are shipped to and from each location which requires a lot of manual labor.  The managers at Amazon promote a fun yet handwork driven environment to promote productivity."
good,"Great temporary employment. Can be physically demanding depending on your fit level so most people dont stay long. Also, at this location at least, they ""Flex up"" randomly; this requires all workers to stay until a specified time after the shift has ended. Management is cool but can be a bit too ambitious lol. Overall, I came in contact with some great people and even made a lifelong friend. Everyone here seems to enjoy it to some extent, which made me enjoy it as well."
good,This is an alright company to work for.  The company is one that does not care for its workers.  My coworkers are very nice people
good,"Has a hectic schedule, but you get to learn a lot too."
good,Overall Amazon was a good job. Picking at Amazon during the peak season is by far the hardest job in the warehouse. I say this because walking at least 13 miles a shift is a requirement.
good,"Hardest part of the job was keeping my goal rates high. Other co workers would pick through the orders and leave me and others with less work to pack, leaving me with a lower rate then normal."
good,"As a Customer Care Specialist, I answered questions regarding customers account, orders and company devices via incoming calls and chats. I've learned to diffuse sensitive and complicated situations by staying objective and focus on the solution. Management were everyday people with a common goal of customer satisfaction. My co workers were genuine good people who strived to make an honorable living. The hardest part of my job was convincing some customer's policies apply to all but created situations for me to build on my professionalism.  The most enjoyable part of working for Amazon is that Jeff Bezo is a leader who is focused on the big picture while keeping in mind of the process."
good,"I learned about various jobs. As this was my first job I looked forward to learning about the shipping and receiving, using RF scanners."
good,"Amazon is good for needing a paycheck. There is no room for growth or development to expand your experiences or even make it up to management. If they see that your ar good place and doing well there, they keep you there and that hinders a lot of potential."
good,"Ho imparato ad essre veloce ,attiva,precisa a collaborare con gli atri (inclusi I superiori).Un po' stressante."
good,My contract with Amazon was through SMX. Amazon was a good job but not very much room to grow. I was responsible for quality control of products as well as maintaining a high rate of scanning. The job was enjoyable but I would like to get into an industry that I have more room to grow.
good,"At Amazon, I had an opportunity to experience, first hand, the efficiencies of ""The Toyota Way"" production system. "
good,"Easy to do tasks but have room to grow and learn more skills and positions. Rapidly evolving work place, management does their best to help with any issues you have."
good,"On a typical day at Amazon, i work as a team with 5 other co workers in my station. We get visits from our managers, questioning if we need any help or to see how our progress is going.Each day work i become familiar with the box sizes whig allows me to move much faster when i have to pack the item. My co workers and I talk throughout the time to make the time go faster. The hardest part of the job is the amount of time i have to stand on my feet. For 12 hours i have to stand in one place packing as much items as i can. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting quota for the day and getting to list to music as I work."
good,"trabajo muy independiente posible"
good,One of the best places to start of a smooth career for a fresher. A work environment with a limitless boundary of imagination and drive.
good,"This Company is good for freshers to start their career."
good,"Started working here with Smx, got converted to Amazon Associate. Really relaxed environment. During peak there is a lot of internal theft of personal items from other co-workers. There is also a lot of favoritism  from manager on who to cross train."
good,"Management was very supportive about helping their directs ""Raise the bar"". They did this by presenting workshops that helped us learn how to work as a team by improving our communication skills."
good,"good place to work, good pay, learned a lot about how the company works, hardest part is keeping up with the quotas at first"
good,Wendy's was a great place to work. It was my first job so I learned a lot about how to carry myself in a work environment. It was a great oppurtunity
good,"Clean place to work, a lot of people to associate with and well managed. Its a well rounded distribution center with excellent logistics."
good,"In Amazon i have been working in Accounts Receivable team as an AR Analyst, processing Billing Imports, GC's, Advertising & liquidation's. Played significant role in testing the projects for process improvements."
good,I really enjoyed working here. Everyone was helpful towards each other. I learned a lot from working here. I was usually working alone everyday.
good,"Keeps the wolf from the door."
good,"This is a great place to work. The amazon staff if very helpful and you can learn a lot. However, the Smx Staffing agency needs to learn to get their facts straight and not change the story later and blame Amazon for their mistakes and their miscommunication."
good,"It is a fine place to work. Good hours, nice compensation, flexible hours, friendly management, and a lot of freedom to move around as long as you get your work done."
good,"I have been with the company for nearly five years from college. It has been a great learning experience. I have participated in many process improvement events, and worked in several roles supporting the operation."
good,"A typical day at Amazon consists of gathering productivity and quality reports and researching negative feedback, working with associates to mean team and company goals, and providing feedback. The hardest part of working at Amazon is the amount of walking required. The associates, management, and the fun atmosphere are the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"Was excited a Amazon gave me my first job opportunity and it was thrilling and a great place to kick start you career."
good,"Nice place to work, improved my confidence and communication skills. It also helped me to learn different cultures and interact with different people."
good,"all co workers were friendly and supportive, every day was a different challenge, fast pace hitting and surpassing targets. management were approachable and helpful, meeting targets knowing deliveries were on way for birthdays, xmas etc was very fullfilling."
good,"During peak season which is from the begining of November until about mid January the work is great you can work anywhere from 4 to 10 hours daily. The work is there you can choose to leave at the end of your shift or pickup an additional shift. The work seems to continous therefore the time flys by quickly, however post peak sean the work is slow and most days your sent home early."
good,The job was very good and had its benefits. But you would work so long you wouldnt have any free time. But the pay was excellent.
good,"A typical day at work started with a ""huddle"" which let us know what we were expected to do that day for production. We went to our spots on assembly line and started packing."
good,"I work in the most stressful part of the amazon process. The dock is loud, fast paced, and very demanding of a person. Most coworkers are ready to go home if they know that they are being sent to the dock . Mostly because there is a lack of work ethic in this country."
good,"I learned how to do other things such as tape, slam, and a dock work while already with an understanding on packing. Start the day off with a group talk, begin our exercise routines and go straight to work."
good,The work day goes smooth. Theres no fulltime for certain positions at the davenport warehouse so its a quick and easy day for the most part. Employees come from everywhere and its not a job to live off but a job to get by. The management is pretty cool when they communicate but theres not much hard work to the job.
good,I really did love working at speedway. I was able to build a bond with a lot of my customers. The only issue I had was when I was robbed at gun point I was not able to switch shifts.
good,"ICQA (Inventory Control and Quality Assurance)"
good,"Meeting with your manager before you start working. Then you know where you will working. Packing, picking or something else. 10 hours per day, three breaks. One 30 min, next two for 15 min."
good,Worked as an intern at Lab126. The assigned project was one of the most challenging one. Learnt a lot of new things but had to put in the hours.
good,fast pace work environment with multitudes of managerial personnel about to give direction. lots of people to help get the job done.
good,"Enjoyed job. Used to meet lots of people. Meeting targets on day to day. able to do overtime. communication of each day was good and everyone knew what they were doing."
good,"It can be a good job for a while, but they use a abuse their managers.  They will get as much as they can from you until you burn out and then get someone else to do the same thing."
good,"Amazon has great incentives for their employees. Their is no probation period so your vacation, sick time and paid time off start the day you begin working. I had a personal issue and they worked with me until I was able to return back to work."
good,Other than some of the customers the job was good the people I worked with were nice and the managers did everything they could to make it a good environment to work in.
good,"For the most part this is good company to work for. Most of the people there really do care about what is going in. The management staff is for the most understanding and the people are fun to work with. The hardest part of the job is the walking, but you get used to it. The most enjoyable part of my job is the time spent with friends."
good,"Enjoyed meeting new people and working in a fun environment."
good,"met good people when I was working at Amazon, also gaining the work experience which is valuable for future employment. The atmosphere was great, the hardest part when working there was the Christmas period"

good,"I enjoyed working here a lot of great people and managers very well organized. The benefits are great they really treat you with respect. The hardest part would have to be the walking, you will walk about two miles a day in there."
good,"This phrase ""Work hard, Have Fun and Make History"" always motivated me work hard at the same time have fun and make a history. Amazon is also a very good company with a friendly environment and lot of learning."
good,"it` verry good company, co-workers are nice ,the management is super, nice and friendly"

good,"Clock in 30 minutes early, have a meeting with management, and staff the problem solve board for the day. I run a stand up meeting with the associates on problem solve about the goals for the day, any information they need to know and their rates for the previous day. Through out my day I print and engage associates with feedback for any quality errors they have made and help them find a way to not create the same mistakes. I also assist the problem solve associates with I.O.L, Sherlock and problem solve. I have learned to be a better leader and advance in my leadership skills. In management, some work well with others and some do not but enjoy the ones that do. The hardest part of my job is the diversity of personalities. The most enjoyable part of the job is the diversity of personalities."
good,"Overall, I have enjoyed my experience at Amazon.  I work hard, and I am rewarded for my achievements.  The work-life balance is good, and I appreciate the autonomy I am given.

It was a good job with good pay, ideal working hours (day shifts) and it was within an acceptable distance to and from.

good,it is a great company to work for with great great opportunities.
good,"Fast Paced Environment"
good,I enjoyed my time at amazon because I was able to contribute to other peoples happiness by making sure they received the correct order. It was also a great way to get exercise due to the amount of walking you did each day.
good,Aprendi muito com os gestores... q não importa o funcionário estar presente no espaço fisico.. para q ele possa desenvolver seu trabalho... q trabalho em equipe e essencial para o crescimento de uma empresa.. e que salario não e o mais importante... Mas sim o Ambiente. A valorização das capacidades de cada funcionário devem ser sempre enaltecidas.

good,24/7 Operation with a large amount of employees coming from temporary staffing agencies which makes day to day operations challenging due to training needs and ensuring overall operational safety
good,"I think that Amazon is an amazing company. My work day was pretty simple, come in, clock-in, meet up and get to work. Management wasn't nearly as professional as to what I am used to and the communication was at a lower level then what I would have expected with the company being so big. My co-workers were really cool people who I enjoyed working with. The hardest part of my job was actually being able to maintain my personal life on the outside of my job. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to know different people."

good,"co-workers very nice and kind."
good,"My experience at amazon was very enjoyable, but very sour at the same time.

good,Fun place to work and brilliant work culture. Also provides you a good oppertunity to grow within the company.
good,"Jobs are quite manual labor intensive. Depending on your work schedule, you can feel that you have plenty of time to yourself on off days and a nice balance of work along side it. Although certain work schedules can leave you feeling less social and working too much. Really begins to diminish spirits after awhile. Making rate can also be a drag as not every day is the same with work available, but you make due best you can. The people you work with are some of the friendliest people you'll meet at times, making a return back to work each day easy to do. With multiple shifts, you get to see new faces in the building quite often too. Other then that, it's a safe workplace with challenging jobs that keep your attention and make you want to do better each day."

I've become particularly good at querying as a result, and learned much about Amazon's method of operation and business culture. It was a very insightful year of hard work. The most difficult part for me, not particularly a company-wide issue, was growth. My direct manager was inexperienced, as I was his first direct worker, and had difficulty fully utilizing me and my coworker effectively. However, as a result of my employment, I met many wonderful and talented individuals, many of whom I still keep in contact with. I truly enjoyed the challenging work and contacts I've met in my time at this company."

I feel like the hardest part was not making my individual quota. The most enjoyable part was the work environment as a whole."

good,"Amazon has a friendly work environment.  In this environment it is possible to learn and work at your best.  My typical day at work was walking around the east side of the warehouse picking the items that were ordered by the customers.  Management was supportive and tried to help you whenever you had any problem.  My co-workers where respectful, helpful and friendly.  The hardest part of the job was having to walk for ten hours a day, but being able to move around was also enjoyable."
good,"Worked 12 hour shifts answering incoming calls from Amazon customers that had questions or concerns about products and their accounts.  Very pro active learning environment on the floor.  The initial training was not comprehensive but after going to the floor there was support from all co-workers new and old.  Loved helping the customers and finding the information they requested.  Researching and comparing products for the customer was also part of the job."
good,Fun place to work but had to stand way to long. learned how to pack boxes efficiently and accurately. the best part about the job was leaving.
good,alot of moving you keep very buisy which makes the time go fast alot of oppertunities working for this company
good,long time to be on your feet but good for fun and laughter.good training and good prospects for the right person.
good,"Good place to work. People are great, and management is always very encouraging."
good,"good"
good,Great company to work with. Work culture was really good. Great people. Profile was not career oriented.
good,"Things i became accustomed to were, being aware of health and safety, a diverse knowledge of machinery and equipment, ablility to work as part of a team or alone, excellent communication skills, Content to work in variable conditions, working within a safe environment. The hardest aspect of the job was the weather conditions in winter outside. The most enjoyable part of the job was interracting with customer and co-workers."
good,"A typical day at work is to enter the building, clock in, and head over to the stand up meeting. At the stand up meeting we perform stretches to get ready for the day, we discuss group stats for the previous night and what our goals are for the day. We also name one safety and one quality tips to constantly keep up to date on process. Then the area manager will call out the names of employees who did exceptionally well the previous night, after that we huddle up in a circle around whoever has volunteered to lead us that night, then we count down and shout a phrase before heading off to work. To get started we grab an RF gun and a cart, we place two totes on the cart (one on top and one on bottom), then we log into the scanners and scan the tote. At that point the scanners will tell us the location of what bin we need to pull from, and after that it's a simple matter of locating the bin and the particular item within the bin and adding it to the tote. When the tote is full we place it on a conveyor and refresh our totes and head back out to repeat the process. There's not very much variation in my current job and does not offer many chances to stand out or use my critical thinking skills to the extent that i would like. But the people are very nice, the manager is very open with us and welcomes us to come to him with anything. The team dynamic is very good as well, with stand ups before work and after lunch, as well as a group rate, we really must work together to reach our goals every night."
good,Packing and Shipping Products from warehouse to customers
good,Excellent place to work. Provides growth for any individual to become a more developed leader.
good,Fun workplace that allows for innovative ideas. I learned how to write SQL and use other programs.
good,"A typical work day at amazon is very fast paced. You are always on your feet and standing most of the day. When coming into amazon in the morning, we start off with stretches such as lunges, bending over to loosen up the back, and reaching from side to side to stretch the arms. Once finished we talk about safety tips and quality tips and then we proceed to our stations or lines, in which we are assigned by our managers. Once on the line boxes start to come down the belt are we are to put them in the correct location according to the scan number on the box. We then stack the boxes on pallets and scan the pallet after the box is placed."
good,"long "
good,Very fast paced working environment where customer expectation goals are top priority. Great opportunity
good,"I was responsible for updating the weekly business reports and innovating them to be more efficient and easier to use. As a result, my skills with Microsoft Excel are extensive and I also learned a lot about using Oracle SQL to extract data. "
good,we do have ping ball table ive never seen it used love my coworker they are great cant say to much still got a job
good,"I don't think Amazon does a good job of harnessing the full talent of its employees, although it has many good qualities and encourages a professional atmosphere."
good,"There is so much political playing within the warehouses and the company itself that you cannot make it unless you know someone high up on the ladder. Each day is a physical and mental struggle to meet the every increasing requirements set on you by the management team. There is little social interaction between co-workers. What interaction there is must be work related. "
good,i loved working there but it was a long hours and i was pregnant and wasn't a good envronment for me
good,"Lavoravo come magazziniere 8 ore al giorno su 3 turni, mi occupavo a prelevare le merci dagli scaffali oppure all'impaccamento dei prodotti. "
good,"A typical day of work consisted of receiving full shipments to be counted, quality checked, and then transported to areas of the warehouse to be picked for shipping out to customers.  I learned how to efficiently manage time during busy hours, and to meet quotas.  My co-workers operated as a team to meet goals speedily while still maintaining a level of safety and quality.  The most challenging part of this job was the amount of physical work involved and the level of attention required when operating the fork lift and other powered machinery.  The most enjoyable part was the fact that I had great people to work with, so the 12 hour shifts seemed to fly by."
good,"I was taken by the moto Work hard , have fun make history , "
good,"Arrivo al posto di lavoro con alcuni colleghi, e subito attenzione al posto di lavoro con riordino di tutto il materiale disponibile per poter affrontare la giornata."
good,This was a very decent job. It kept me busy all the time. It was a full time job working Sun-Wed. 6pm-430am. My job was to pack boxes and make rate each day (easier said than done). Keeping up with rate was extremely difficult for me.
good,Very fast paced and hectic at times. Good leadership but unrealistic production goals sometimes
good,"I worked in the singles department, packing single items in boxes. The hardest part is learning to pack really fast. The one thing i likes about his department is the stations were close enough for me to talk to co-workers."
good,good working enviroment enjoyed the picking and the free exercise 
good,A typical day at work was 10 hours long. I had a lot of time to learn new things such as driving a fork lift. The job itself was different because its the only place I know of that makes what it does. Management was great and everyone worked together. We all pushed each other to get what needed to be done done. The hardest part of the job was the hours. For me the most enjoyable part was the fork lift driving.
good,"Amazon was a friendly place, i liked working there as i have gained a lot of expirience and met a lot of new people, it was good that you had to reach the limit everday packing singles and multie's . "
good,it was a very good experience working with that team and management.
good,Meeting a quota at Amazon was a challenge. I like working more with a group of people but found working by myself wasnt bad. I barely worked with other people. Hardest part was the physical extent of the job but it became easier. I enjoyed seeing how much stuff Amazon has to offer.
good,"Not a bad job work long hours but the pay is good, They do work you haha, management isnt bad hardest part of the job, if you smoke.. this job makes it difficult to do that."
good,"I would pack individual items and group items into boxes to be dispatched to customers allover country, i made sure the items were secure in the boxes and that nothing was damaged. I also learned how to giftwrap presents for people for christmas. management were very demanding to get the work out. Working with people was great got to know them and it made the job more enjoyable. the hardest part of the job was certain items had to be dispatched out for a certain time. I enjoyed it because got to meet some interesting people."
good,"I enjoyed my time working for Amazon.com, I received an exceptional amount of training which would help me in similar positions in the future."
good,a typical day at work always stretch before work we have a meeting on what we are to do for the day I learned how to ship and receive items from the front line and put info into the computer ant scan items before putting on cart for the picking Department Management wasn't to great always grouchy. The co-workers were good we all got along The hardest part of the job was 12hours a day on your feet. The most enjoyable was the free gifts we got from the company .Over all rating I give them 5stars compensation/Benefits 5 stars Culture/Values 6 stars Job Security 5 stars management 5 stars Work Balance 5 Stars
good,"préparer les commandes dans un temps record, tout en faisant attention à l'aspect du produit (aucun défaut). avoir un bon sens de l'orientation afin d'optimiser les déplacements dans l'entrepot."
good,Amazon is a great company. The focus is to ensure the customer is always taken care of and in todays world that is hard to find.
good,"Hard work required, but a lot of things going on at once."
good,There were always new incidents to deal with
good,very fast paced
good,My fun part was working with the team and achieving the goals of the company.And
good,A typical work day consists of standing in the same place doing the same thing over and over again.
good,management is very tight at amazon and the hardest part of the job was trying to please your manager. co-workers were great they help you out alot and the most enjoyable part of the job is just the enviroment
good,"Working at amazon was easy. Everyone is nice and very helpful. They liked to see you succeed. The hardest part of the job was probably the amount of time spent standing. But with having your job be at a fast pace, it made the day go by fast."
good,"start the day with a briefing, find out what you was doing that day. management were strict but fair.co-workers were friendly."
good,I worked many different jobs duties tasks at the fulfillment facility I was rated on my accuracy speed of performance standard operation procedure the job is very physically demanding so I was in great fitness shape I got a lot of experience at Amazon I also had really good benefits the best of any job I`ve had to this date.
good,"It's all about who you know, however the pay is ok if you're only using company as a stepping stone to bigger and better things."
good,Just not a place for a people person. No one really talks to each other. Co- workers are always friendly tho. Management is alright a little more improvement is needed to not be unfair. I enjoyed streaching everyday.
good,"It was a good job while it lasted, I liked it a lot but it was only seasonal"
good,"I loved working for Amazon through SMX. However, there was no guarantee on job security."
good,it was a nice place to work air conditioned building friendly people managers are helpful at times
good,"My typical night at work would be competitive the first few ours,because of our rate policy.I learned how to use a RF Scanner,the workplace was friendly & helpful.Sometimes the hardest part of my position could be to make rate depending on the objects your stowing away.My most enjoyable part was meeting a diversted group of people & being able to work with them."
good,The West Columbia warehouse is so focused on hitting numbers that they completely ignore quality and concern for safety. The company as a whole claims to promote advancement but seem to be only interested in hiring past military personnel (nothing against the military--thank you for your service) and recent college graduates. This puts the rest of us at a disadvantage.
good,Recieving allocated items ready for other workers to pack.
good,It is a good company to work for. It is very busy and a fun work environment
good,A typical day would star off with team building meeting then off to station where you would receive items into warehouse from inbound dock. I learned the workings of the warehouse and trained to do problem solving if order numbers didnt match up also trained as an ambassador which means that i trained newcomers when they started in amazon.Amazon management good and would listen to you. Agency management wouldnt. Got on with everyone on shift really good bunch of workers. Learing to do the problem solving was hard at first but once you got used to it it also became an enjoyable job.
good,nice amount of stable payment but job security is terrible. its not guaranteed you will be there no longer than christmas eve nice work enviroment but needs alot of dusting its a nightmare for people with allergies
good,"Very good working environment,"
good,"Innovation, Creativity and Process Improvement are essential to success at Amazon."
good,"Um dia de trabalho na Amazon Aço é muito perigoso, mas aprendi que sempre temos que honrar a função que exercemos com responsabilidade e decicaçao para fazer sempre melhor do esperam de nós, a direção está em ascensão. Meus colegas de trabalho foram companheiros e afetivos, por outro lado, a parte mais dificil do trabalho, era conviver com muitos acidentes sabendo que poderia acontecer a qualquer momento comigo, mas vale destacar a parte mais agradável também, que era o reconhecimento por parte de meus líderes pelo meu esforço e pela minha dedicação de cumprir o meu horário e por exercer minha função com eficácia."
good,"A typical day at Amazon would be just ordering stuff for customers, cancelling orders if they didn't want it anymore, and responding back to customers emails. I learned to be very patient at this job. Management was great, everything was very organized. My co-workers were very nice, everyone got along even though it is a very big company. The hardest part of the job was when customers would call upset wanting to know why their orders had been cancelled or where was their stuff and why wasn't it there on time. The most enjoyable part of this job was just always having fun at work. There would be days were we would get free food from restaurants. We would also have days were we would dress up and and friendly competitions."
good,"Typical day consisted of opening, scanning, sorting & packing products and sending them down the line."
good,a typical day at work was hectic and required a lot of exercise. By working here i received a good workout. i learned how to do general warehouse work and was my first job were i was a supervisor. i absolutely loved management there. They did not make the job any harder and were very friendly which always make the job easier. the hardest part of the job was the lifting because some things were pretty heavy.
good,My days at Amazon were always fast paced. I always had something to do or learn. I am a fast learner so i took in a lot of information in a short time span on my way to becoming a problem solver. The management team was ok i felt like communication could have been better but they were fair. I got along great with all of my co-workers and never had any problems. I enjoyed the beginning of the shift more because i viewed it as the start of something new. The hardest part of my job was that feeling everyday that this is not permanent.
good,"enjoyed working with others and the company, very fast paced, productive company, clean enviroment. I Really liked the job just too far and had car problems"
good,"Worked in the product photography division as a stylist. Learned how things get uploaded to the web site, most of the management staff was very helpful, great coworkers. Hardest part was meeting some deadlines and styling items that were unusual."
good,"Manage the Web Analytic Tools, Guide Feature Development, Interact with customers via focus group, survey, UI testing etc."
good,It's a great place to pick up a quick job. It's a great way to build experience in areas I was unfamiliar.
good,With this company it's feast or famine. Made good money with all the overtime
good,"I worked as seasonal help during Christmas. Long days, lots of hours, but the pay is decent. Its a big plant so there is lots of walking involved. If your in packing expect to do a LOT of lifting. In picking your running all over the plant. They are a good company to work for if you can get on permanent."
good,"• As a Senior Technician required to project manage, as well as be involved in all Remedy projects/ trouble tickets in the department. Lead our Jr. techs to the project successful completion."
good,loaded trucks and secured trailers for shipment. Learned several things for working loading docks and stacking pallets. had to leave due to lay-offs
good,"*A typical day was 10 hours, 6pm-4:30am."
good,Mostly full time temp. jobs. if you are into walking you'll love it. we average fifteen to as much as twenty miles a day. they really push the hydration always pushing for you to drink plenty of water. my co workers were great most all of which were temps. wear sturdy and comfortable shoes!! great company over all always felt welcome and appericated.
good,Fast paced working environment. Great benefits and management.
good,"easy work, ok pay, good hours, care about safety, benefits are good, like the idea of controlling time off, they do things for their employees, and acknowledge them"
good,The pay is low but time goes fast if your working hard. Overall a good experience so far with great people. the biggest drawback is the lack of full time.
good,The jobs are easy. The benefits are great. If you can get past the favoritism and verbal harassment from people who assign themselves the supervisor’s responsibilities then your time there should be fairly tolerable. There’s boards placed to communicate your opinions and concerns but neither management nor HR do anything besides write responses that hand the responsibility of addressing the employees concerns back and forth between each other
good,un ambiente costituito prevalentemente da giovani con ritmi di lavoro sostenuti ma piacevoli.
good,"Would recommend for those who need earn some money fast as there is a lot overtimes and good pay, but no big chance to stay permanently. On peak times 50h a week minimum"
good,"Amazon is a great place to work at for a lot of reasons. The pay is very well, their system for hours regarding not being able to come in for work or vacation, etc is a good system that more companies should do. The employees and management are all so kind and helpful. Amazon’s all about working as a team and communication is key."
good,"Rispetto e attenzione verso il sottoposto, importanza alle sue opinioni o suggerimenti; propensione a coinvolgere il dipendente ad attività lavorative ed extra;"
good,Would drive to work to find out there was no work and sent home after only an hour or two. The pay was good and the benefits were good.  Learned to drive a forck lift.
good,Flexible job with great hours and pay. I enjoyed my experience. A laptop was provided as well as five weeks of training. All the resources are available to succeed.
good,"I worker for this company while I went to college, it has a lot of pros such as taking time off to finish school, which came in really handy for me my last couple of months of finishing up school. It's not the best paying for the amount of work being asked of us, but I liked its reliability and personal time Management option."
good,Azienda nata in America ma arrivati in Italia si adegua alla grande con il Solito sistema all'italiana contratto 3 mesi poi a casa la maggior parte delle persone
good,"One of the best jobs I've ever had! Absolutely loved working in the Amazon warehouse and would love to go back! If you don't like being on your feet for 10 hours or more then this job probably isn't for you! Most positions at Amazon, no matter what, involve standing or walking the entire time and they aren't kidding about how many miles you'll walk in a day! They have awesome pay, benefits & time off etc."
good,It can be hard at times but that's expected if you work at a warehouse. It's a very fast pace sometimes but you'll get the swing of things when you work there for a while.
good,Very good environment to work. Managers are very friendly.
good,"I enjoyed working for Amazon."
good,"Une entreprise très agréable, de nuit l’équipe et formidable"
good,Not to bad although do treat agency diffrent when comes to opportunities for advancement. Worked nite shift did a lot of incentives over Christmas to boost moral.
good,"As CSA, the work environment in Amazon is relaxing. The working hours and benefits are reasonable. During peak seasons the work can be stressful. There is chance for in job opportunities and promotion."
good,"You get to plan your time at work and play as long as you finish the work."
good,"Can be great at times I drove flex for Amazon for almost 4 years  it was great thinking about driving  more blocks are becoming  a thing "
good,stressful poornot worth the pay for the things u have to do kinda sucks u might have a way harder job than someone else but y'all get paid the same amount
good,Ok bien orienté bon poste recommandé si besoin de argent
good,Very physical work and not very flexible. If you work hard you'll move up. Make sure you make friends because Amazon is all about who you know and not what you know
good,"Bonne ambiance de travail , aide présente , bonne direction ,"
good,"J'ai aimer travailler chez Amazon pour le professionnalisme de nos chefs d'équipe, bonne ambiance en générale. Travaillant diversifiant et polyvalent."
good,"Amazon is a great company with great benefits and pay. The work is relatively simple. Just make sure you stretch properly. The 10hr shifts can become a bit much especially working 3rd shift while having a family, however you do get 3 days off. The only thing I would change is management. They're unprofessional and can be nit-picky at times over small things Wich could be aggravating. But overall, a great company."
good,"Rates can't be met ALL the time. Loved the pay, benefits,perks. Would love to go back. Learned how to operate various equipment. Work environment was good."
good,"Okay, Good company with good working culture. Staffs well compensated. Work life balance minimal. Pay isn’t bad but the organization can do more. Bliss"
good,"Enjoyed my work in Amazon, the work culture was good and people in Amazon were very open and helping in nature. I would certainly recommend Amazon to other folks."
good,"trabajar  con ganas ,todo el mundo te ayuda en lo que necesitas"
good,Amazon gives you the room to grow in any field. The bigger the company the more possibilities you receive to explore the job market. Amazon is a great place to network.
good,"It really depends on which FC that you work for. The Amazon FC in Chester, VA was awesome, one of the best places I have worked, everyone was very kind, helpful, and hardworking; BUT, the Amazon FC in OKC, Oklahoma is terrible, no one knows anything, everyone tells you something different, co workers are rude, most of management sucks, HR is terrible, no organization, just a complete "
good,"THe pay was great here but the mandatory overtime will suck you dry.  Otherwise the staff is pretty friendly, the work is not hard as long as you know how to operate and equipment."
good,you do the same thing most days. i learned how to pick and stow packages. the management are very friendly and are willing to help. the workplace culture is amazing. there is not really a hard part of the job it is all quite straight forward. the most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and picking the parcels.
good,"(staten island warehouse) It's an overall easy job at the warehouse. A lot of manual labor and long shifts. Some view it as worth it while others do not. For me it's not bad, just far from where I reside. Some managers are easy to get along with while others not so much; just as anywhere else. The break rooms have like a minimart you can shop from since there are no stores near this warehouse."
good,They are very helpful if you have any doubts about the job function. And will surely assist you in whatever way possible according to there duties and management.
good,Love my team and work environment. Very fast pace. Some growth opportunities. Company travel opportunities. Great insurance and benefits. Stock options if job eligible.
good,"Good Overall. Management need to improve and bring Good Work on Table."
good,This is a good job if you just got out of high school and need some money.  If your going for long term  some of the managers are fresh out of college with no experience in the warehouse side
good,Job is very easy flexible hours only thing is management feels like you are below them they don't really have your back they just want the job done. They want you to be a manager and do their work while they get the pay
good,Amazon is a very good and stable company that focuses on customer satisfaction. They do encourage a happy work place and embrace other cultures so everyone feels welcomed.
good,"everything had to be excactly correct, no damages on items if there being sent to customers, the hardest part of the job was being able to go at a fast pace all shift."
good,"easy to delivery, very low stress, everybody is super cool great to work with. but if your seasonal, they will not know when your last day is, and that's the part about this job that's difficult because you'll end up jobless looking for a new job."
good,Its a good place to work at. It's just a seasonal job for me if it was perm I would be ok but I want a good perm job that I can rely on and be there for years and years
good,"Fast paced environment, need to keep up with the daily metric for success. Management is supportive and open to suggestions. HR also responsive to needs of the employees."
good,"Job is fast paced, but the work is not hard. It allows you to challenge yourself. The managers and leads could speak more respectfully to associates we are all adults not children. It's a way to talk to people."
good,Overall it is a good place to work part time and earn some money. The management is good and they have a very systematic environment everything is collabrative and depends on team work
good,I enjoyed working for Amazon. I was busy and fast pace .I enjoyed putting the warehouse together. I found this job through a temp agency  What I didn't like was gossip and flirting. It was uncomfortable.
good,Day to day at this job is always nice with people all around the world interacting with each other and the hardest part of being here is the long hours during peak season.
good,"Je recommande si c'est un CDI  sinon  avec  les intérims on vous  fait  passer  le test  test et on vous  oublie  , moi  j'ai  travaillé  un mois  avec Adecco onsite  chez Amazon Saran  on m'avait  promis  un contrat  etudiant  après  mais  jamais ils ont  tenus  parole et j'ai  aussi  été  appelé par  Amazon  Douai  j'ai  passé  l'entretien et même reçu   un message de félicitations  mais  rien  après  je  rappelle  Adecco  onsite   il me  dit  que  Amazon  m'a  mis  en  attente  qu'il  ne peuvent  pas  me prendre tant  que  ce ne pas  levé  ça  4 mois  comme  ça  je suis  en attente  et San  emploi"
good,"productive job, everyone has personal targets dependant on department of work. Friendly management teams and co workers although no chance of permanent vacancies is the only down side."
good,Seasonal work is shorter than expected and communication was not up to par than I expected. The pay is good if we did get our full 40hrs and safety issues need to be addressed
good,My time at amazon was enjoyable and informative because of the amazing management staff and positive working atmosphere. The only problems that I had with amazon was its strict scheduling and repetitive work.
good,I've been working here a few months now as a warehouse Operative. For me I like it because you are always busy so the days fly by and nothing is too hard once you've been trained.
good,"Good job with good benefits and competitive pay, 4 day work week."
good,"J'aime l'horaire de travaille, tres accomodale pour la famille, je peux passer du temps avec la famille."
good,The works. Just okay just standing on your feet the whole time.when working there you just have to make sure whatever station that you were on that you take your time and process the information correctly because if you messed up that can mess up everybody else in the production line behind you
good,"If you are a hard worker with a strong backbone and willingness to keep your head down and get the work down you will be successful. You can’t beat the stock, health insurance, benefits, and pay. Be willing to make work life sacrifices and work extreme hours."
good,"Ritmo lavorativo elevato, lavoro di gruppo. Anche se stancante mi sono trovata bene. Dopo un anno a mezzo speravo in un assunzione mai arrivata, purtroppo"
good,It was a fun seasonal job I enjoyed my time there met a lot of cool people it could get a lil hectic when you were backed up with a lot of boxes on your chutes but overall it was fun
good,"The overall atmosphere is good but needs better management, it changed while I was working there and the place has gone downhill since unfortunately. Benefits are good but the lack of care or concern from managers really kills the job."
good,"You'll be lifting, walking, stooping, carrying, and sorting packages at almost inhuman speeds in order to reach customer promise at all times n many weather conditions."
good,"The whole environment they have created to work and have fun activities are awesome, more then that they care fort each employee from security to harasment for everything they have a legal action and they follow that, Although I left company because my education is different from that field, Otherwise I always suggest for that place to work."
good,"Amazon it's a very good and positive workplace. Somethings, like communication though, is kind of misunderstood in the field. But, overall I love my job with it, comes a lot of time and space to grow. I love that Amazon gives EVERYONE an opportunity to grow."
good,As a seasonal employee it was what I needed at the time and allowed me to gain some updated training in different areas. I enjoyed the pace of work but there were too many people in one area trying to accomplish the same task due to lack of communication.
good,"I enjoyed working there overall, but as an employee, I felt like everything was rushed. The job is way too fast-paced. They want you to be fast with everything you do 24/7. They do not give you time to grow as an employee. I absolutely hated the points system."
good,I love working alone. The 4 days a week are perfect for me. Just wish this wasn't a seasonal job.  The hardest part is probably making sure everyone gets their packages on time when you have a huge load and a small window of time. Management is always easy to talk to and willing to help.
good,I really enjoyed the work at amazon .Good atmosphere.There was a sense of team work and the managers noted potential.They were encouraging proposing supervisor jobs if and when they arose
good,"Your goals are readily set and with little to no difficulty to achieve on a nightly basis.  Accuracy is as important as speed here, and job satisfaction is largely internal."
good,"Good place to Work I learn a lot from this company. Respectful job, Time to time get the salary  on your account, Most important thing is that company provide you 2 days week off."
good,Great learning step . Gain knowledge gain leadership cross train . Benefits of all types meat different people. Transfer opportunities almost across all Amazon locations .
good,This job requires a lot of physical action. Stretching and proper water intake is very important. They are very pushy about safety as it can be dangerous.
good,Everyone was customer obsessed and striving for the best at all times. The work place culture is somewhat toxic and lack of work life balance. Felt like a number and did not feel valued. Very monotonous HR job
good,"Amazon is a good company to work for regarding health insurance, hardships and flexibility.  The facilities themselves need better management and employee support."
good,Pretty decent company to work for. Pay rate and benefits are good compare to the other industries in that area. Flexible hours that you can choose from.
good,"no room for growth at Amazon and slow paced environment"
good,"Good company to work with but the job security is realy low. Work life balance is good"
good,"My experience with Amazon has been very positive. Great opportunities to grow within the company and the benefits are great!"
good,"This place is amazing, I hardly know where to start.  I was hired on as a picker through Integrity staffing solutions. My shift was nights 6:30am - 5am.  "
good,travail simple et répétitif bonne ambiance mais sous pression des plus haut gradés
good,"Job not for everyone. If you start as tier 1 have plans to move up or move out. Excellent schedules for going to school, especially their RFT (reduced full time) shift."
good,"The Ability to Gather Feedback and Provide Innovative Insight."
good,Amazon was a great environment to work but the management didn't really control workloads to allow for a work/life balance.  That responsibility fell on the employee to determine how much workload they can handle.
good,Working in amazon is amazing. No one will get working culture like this company in any other organization or company. There are so many good things you will experience while working in AMAZON.
good,"Located in the heart of booming Seattle, this company is growing to a peak.  The weather is incredible there.  Those looking for a rush should quest for the bleeding edge technological monopoly."
good,"Bonne ambiance, travail faisable sans trop de pénibilité."
good,"fast, busy, messy, but good pay"
good,6 months of the years are seriously stressful due to seasonality. Attention to doc writing on granular data shifts I believe takes away from the actual efforts to make improvements. In such a fast paced industry need to be more reactive in the front line.
good,"buen ambiente, hay parquing, cafe gratis. en horario de nocturnidad se cobra bien."
good,"working at amazon was a experience, was fun.i learned to be fast . dealing with peoples.friendly environment. very tiring sometime.But exciting. Management is open."
good,ho trovato una realtà diversa da quello che avevo letto prima di iniziare la mia esperienza lavorativa
good,"Work at amazon is fast paced and you will be required to work in different departments as the need arises. However, you will be trained for it. In all it was a good experience."
good,"You can work super-hard but if you don't make the numbers/matrix then you're let go but some people cheat the system by cherry picking charts & if you know the right person, they'll let you. No room for movement in positions which bites."
good,"i am only a white badge employee, meaning i only work when there is VET available. I don't have a set schedule. I get paid for the days i work and they vary."
good,"Ambiente competitivo, stimolante e molto demanding, si è rivelata una delle esperienze più formative della mia vita."
good,They will make you work hard. You will be treat accordingly to your performance. Your attendance is a big thing you manage your time off as you will but if you run out of PTO. You better show or you'll be out of the door. No excuses accepted.
good,"You run into problems but that’s with any job, it’s a fast pace but also comfortable environment to work in. I’ve learn team building, and I’ve become a better leader working with amazon."
good,aucun avis particulier sur Amazon. Ma mission d'interim s'est très bien passer.
good,the routes you given can be overwhelming sometimes parking is a problem its a 10 to 12 hour shift not all multi drop drivers belong to amazon . the mornings when loading can be stressfull
good,"Easy job, but sometimes the need to keep up rates gets in the way of quality.  Good communication from managers to associates, but bad communication between shifts."
good,To many turnovers within management and everyone tries to pass the buck to the next guy. No rewards for hard working individuals. Be slow or a slouch and you get the easy jobs and be good at your job and you stuck there.
good,"The management of work flow and Man power management is not good. Changes are very quick and most important, choices are not there. We do not get freedom to select or change shifts/weekoff"
good,The job was what it was.  I was in kindle refurbishing.  The music they played during shift was awful.  I am now typing 48 more characters as required
good,"Good starting job, opportunity to transfer work locations internally and job site locations is nice. Management is a little rough around the edges but working on improvement which is good sign."
good,"Very little work life balance for managers, most days I would go 6-8 hours without sitting down and having a break. Consistently adding more to managers plates without taking anything else away. Overall, I enjoyed the actual work I did for Amazon but the general expectations and lack of care about managers was too much to handle"
good,"I worked as a contractor. I trying to get a FTE role. Getting conversion from a contractor to FTE is not easy. They some how do not select contractors who are already do a excellent job. Maximum term for a contractor is 9 months which is too short, they let the contractors go after 9 months and bring a new contractor and start training him."
good,"Need to put the work in-  I spend a lot of time researching, watching videos and online tutorials to ensure I am completing these task properly.    "
good,"You will be judge by the numbers, end of they all they need is how well did you performed and how many feedbacks you received by the client."
good,Great company to join after graduating from college. Provides the opportunity to learn and grow with a awesome company. Management is constantly changing which dampens the culture and create a redundant work environment.
good,"Amazon is known to have a high pace environment, and it really doesn't matter what role or where in the org you're at. "
good,The company is highly demanding and likes to hire externally instead of promoting from within. Some teams are more demanding than others. That's the main issue
good,Pay could have been better but environment and working conditions are good management could do with being a lot better and they could also improve there organisation
good,It was nice to be able to change your shift when needed. Air conditioned building and convenient parking. Training was okay. Lots of college students that seemed committed to company.
good,"Amazon was a good pale to work for the time being. I endured a full-time position.I worked 10 hour days, sometimes 11. After the tenth hour, it was considered overtime. I played basketball, and the job did require an intense amount of walking."
good,Its was very stressful. Lots of MANDATORY overtime. Poor management. Benefits were great. 40 hours a week guaranteed. A great career choice program after 1 year of service
good,"The day to day activities were a bit strenuous at times,to add the shifts were twelve hours. However the supervisors were not overbearing. The job was geared towards just ""getting the work done"" then going home."
good,Working for Amazon wasnt to bad. You just don't want to be a picker they work you to death. Any other job at Amazon is good I prefer the rebin position but wasnt there long before they moved me to picker
good,"I love my coworkers, but I get tired of the constant revolving door of managers and I get tired of not being heard by upper management when we bring valid concerns to them."
good,"I am currently a Flex driver and i am torn about whether i love my job or not. The freedom to choose when you work is absolutely amazing especially since i have 2 small kids. If a school thing comes up or one of them is sick you are able to drop your shift by a click of a button with no penalty if its an hr before your shift.. or you just dont click the button that day to pick up a shift. On the other hand in order to get a shift you usually have to be glued to your phone all day ""tapping away"" since it is so over saturated here its impossible to get a shift without being attached to your phone. We are usually paid $20 an hour for the normal deliveries (its different for whole foods or prime now) which the pay would typically be pretty nice but they dont pay you for any gas, mileage or wear and tear on your car while you are working... in about 3 weeks i put over 10,000 miles on my car. So in all honesty its good for some quick money but in the long run im not sure if it balances out,"
good,Travailler chez Amazon c'est très bien. L'environnement de travail est agréable.
good,"That’s literally the only problem, everything else is actually great & the environment is great as well. It’s just management like I said it needs major work."
good,"No requirements except for a diploma , honestly it was a pretty good job. The offer alot of development programs aswell so it's a great starter job. The money is there with lots of VTO"
good,"Seasonal position, pay is pretty good for an entry level job with mandatory training. No sick days during this which makes it hard if you have children."
good,my experience was overall okay.  It was my first long term job and initially I enjoyed it but it became very difficult as we were required to work many hours without many breaks and there were not enough staff to handle the workload as there was a large turnover rate.
good,I enjoy working from home but not given enough hours. You do recieve some time off but no other benefits. I would say it is for a stay at home mom or someone on disability to supplement their income.
good,They make you work hard. Show how the way to do the work. They also make sure you understand the rules of Amazon. Do put the products in the right bins when restocking shelves.
good,"Good to gain skills. The company's culture is amazing. Pay is in the decent-good range, it is a lot of work and responsibility.  Being far from corporate office is a little challenging but we have the support to help us manage in the distance without sacrificing the culture.  there is a very strong and effective hiring process."
good,The lower level positions are entry level and the pay reflects that.  You are properly trained for your position.  The pace is fast because everything hinges on production and meeting the customers needs.  Advancement is hard for older workers because Amazon's culture is geared toward the younger male workers.
good,Going over the days plan. Meeting to exceed daily goals and keeping informed of changes that are going on. Always keeping in mind that what we do is all about our customer obsession.
good,"The job itself is super easy, varies by shift but they are all somewhat easy, but the managers are kind of obnoxious for lack of a better word. Corporate always comes to ""improve things"" but make everything more of a hassle. Managers act like power hungry robots and they treat you like children"
good,"The pay is good but they only offered part time. It wasn't my favorite job . I prefer a fast paced, stay busy type of job. If you like a job that isnt to stressful I would suggest it. The travel time to work was 45min."
good,Overall it was a really nice work place with just about everyone who was really nice and always in a good mood I learned a lot from them but at the time was only seasonal I would recommend to work for amazon to anyone
good,The warehouse is well kept and organized. The managers are easy to work with and accommodating to any problem. The warehouse workers escort you efficiently.
good,it was a fun and exciting place to work. the people was awesome and funny to work with. driving the forklifts was fun to drive and going 30 ft in the air was fun
good,"A good place to work, but to stay on you need to be able to make or exceed a weekly quota. They value accuracy with speed. Management is good and willing to work with you most of the time."
good,"Easy work but if you don't make your rate then you will be written up. I started my shift at 6:30pm and got off at 5am so needless to say I didn't care much for the hours. They have great benefits there, full medical, dental and vision plus 401k."
good,I enjoyed my job. Learned things about this type job I didn't know. It's a demanding job. If you don't want to work hard don't apply. People get and attitude because they don't want to follow protocol
good,"Nothing to special about the work done at the fulfillment centers. It’s a job with positions that demand you work, as expected. Although I will admit, they are very organized, and take care of their employees."
good,"Fast paced very motivating job. Each day begins with team meeting and stretches. Get to your stations and perform your duties until break, back to work until lunch time, stretches again & back to your work activities, two hours later another break, and this process repeats until shift end. I enjoyed this job, however it was a temporary position. I thought the fast pace was great and I lost a few pounds while working at Amazon!"
good,"buona occupazione lavorativa, ben organizzata e ambiente positivo"
good,"It all depends on what your job is and where you work. They have pretty loose standards for lower end jobs. As long as you aren't high or drunk, you can get a job and keep it."
good,"It's been pretty good experience. The work culture challenges enough to build new skills, be on toes always, and grow as a professional. It helps you to develop professionally."
good,"Title says it all, it's a decent company with great benefits although the shifts can be pretty rough depending on which shift you are assigned. Other than that, it's fairly easy to understand the work cycle and I would recommend working with them if you are able to do warehouse positions."
good,Work from home is excellent for people with great customer service skills and self discipline.  Flexible hours make it easy to set your own schedule & hours
good,Amazon was my first job and therefore I didn't know what to expect. Decent pay with decent benefits for only 4-8hr shifts. Their time-off system could use some refinements.
good,"Negative: You'll be one of many workers engaging in highly repetitive tasks. Don't expect to have a boss so much as a leadership structure above you; there are too many workers for them to get to know every worker personally. Also, expect to put in 50-60 hour weeks from time to time."
good,Very fast paced. Must be able to keep up. I dont recommend working here if you have a family as the work-job balance is not very good. Great benefits if thats what you need.
good,Mostly organized... Team environment. Warehouses automated. Most co-workers cool. Respectable salary. Great Benefits. Upper & mid-level management cool. Team Leads... Not so much.
good,"Arrive, at work, and check the pass downs.  Have the morning meeting, and discuss the events of the day. "
good,The hardest part of the job: standing all day or night 10 and 12 hrs.  If the holidays day requires must good quality and faster work than regular day or night.
good,"Fast paced, stressful. Very fast paced to get products stowed properly in bins. Stowing products was a bit of a challenge because warehouse was at 110% capacity."
good,"It is a good job, quite active and a lot of pressure during working hours . Good benefits, and good managers.  during my work I have never had any problems ."
good,"Time usually goes by rather quick, Management does a great job helping those who need help and interacting with their workers. Work flow is great and during busy months you really work for what they pay. Not a lot of standing around."
good,"Very face paced environment and big bulk furniture that,had to hand picked and loaded in trucks . Never know how late or early,you will,get off day to day."
good,You need to have an independent spirit. Willing to work consistently and carefully in the different weather. The most enjoyable part of the job is the satisfaction one gets from all the thank you that are received throughout the day.
good,Great working there it's was hard work but we had fun nice environment it was great working with the people made a lot of new friends and a lot of memories
good,Buen ambiente laboral con muchas posibilidades que si bien son muy limitadas se las sabes aprovechar sirven
good,I personally couldn't do that all over again. Its their way or no way at all and sometimes that doesn't work if you have kids or you have appointments to keep in that day.
good,Great pay good job nice people. It was a great experience and you will definitely get a work out doing the delivery position. The managers were nice and understanding
good,Good company. Need to be able to shift jobs after a certain work length. Need to have a system in place where the balance of items packed is average to all packers.
good,"they have provided games and other recreation."
good,"Amazon is a great place to work for, I have worked with the company for almost 10 years now and don’t really have much to complain about. One thing I will say is if you are wanting a place to move up at and are open to relocating then this is your job. Amazing is a fast growing company and there are thousands of jobs and opportunities but you have to be willing to relocate to get into those areas. Right now that’s not me and I’m stuck where I’m with their currently not being any open positions."
good,Un dia tipico recoger y entregar eficazmente los paquetes asignados. Aprendi a categorizar y priorizar areas. La parte mas difícil del trabajo pasar tanto tiempo manejando. Me gusto conocer diferentes areas de orlando.
good,Working their during peak season is hectic and fun and a good work out I would do it again ..I got laid off after peak season  I was upset ..you only get a 10min break for 5 hrs that's a con pros the pay and its weekly
good,"Given it was a new facility, it became very hectic but wouldn’t stray you away from applying and enjoying it for yourself they do expect a reasonable rate from their employees but if your focused you will prevail"
good,I like working at amazon. The work is a little hard & it is a very fast pace environment but once you get your rhythm you get used to it. I love my schedule as it fits my family dynamic. I was treated well when I was pregnant & went on maternity leave.
good,Amazon is one of the best organizations to work for given it's agile working environment and a strong blend for solving customer needs. Work culture is flexible and benefits are decent if not the best in the industry.
good,"Not enough advancement opportunities for the amount of people that are employed. Pay scale has a cap that is reached in 3 years, so if you do not move up you are stuck at same pay. The best employees do not always get the advancement that they deserve."
good,Not a field that I would continuously work in. Very stressful on the body and mentally exhausting. Constant changes that make adapting difficult and cause aches and pains. Not enough pay for Ship Dock.
good,I'm able to go back to work driving reach truck and I can do maintenance building scrubbing the floor shampoo carpet cleaning the bathroom sweeping fix anything in the building exed machine
good,"The good thing about amazon is that there are rooms for growth, however,  the method by which talents are being acquired  needs more attention. I suggest looking at individuals with education to be given serious attention."
good,"Amazon hires only the best, and you get to work with super smart folks. Need to recognize it's a marathon, not a sprint and ruthlessly prioritize your work as you'll continue to be handed more."
good,I had a great team who just came in and got the work done. It took a while but I eventually got some really great managers that cared about improving the department as opposed to just yelling at everyone and demanding respect.
good,Loved working there and didn't mind a little sweat for the money but the quota was reachable only by the elite. Not even an above-average person can stay there. Fired before you can obtain it. BUT I still enjoyed it.
good,I was hired a s peak time seasonal worker.  Great PT job during the holidays.  Was a little frustrating at times when the company didn't have enough employees to complete the shifts work and management would require employees to remain after our required shifts to complete the work and would be given negative points.
good,"I worked for amazon as a contractor (3P). At times it was very enjoyable but the stress was typically high and a lot is demanded of you. Typically the 3P has no work life balance for management team members but for hourly Amazon requires the 3P to maintain 40 hour work schedule during off peak months."
good,the work flow is what matters most to them besides safety. they are strict on schedule and time but that goes back to work flow. you will not be as confused when first starting they give you onsite examples and coworkers that can assist you or that you can shadow at the moment. overall not a bad place to start as a first job or last job.
good,Job is decent with the exception of a few individuals. Hard to advance to higher paying position. Very competitive but still a relaxed environment. A good job to have as long as you show up to work
good,"No more full time, all part time. Production oriented. Make the numbers, get the hours. Can't make your rate, move along. Worked for Fresh: controlled environment for food. Clean sight. The fast paced repetition is a strain on muscles. Now that they're no longer hiring full time, nobody will get benefits of paid time off."
good,"As a Customer Service Associate every day brings a new challenge. You manage yourself keeping in mind that the main objective is to keep all Amazon customers happy by any means necessary. Like the logo, do whatever it takes to make every customer's interaction end in a smile."
good,Work place is good and have fun on between doing work but the expectation of work salary is little low as per the work load otherwise management was good .
good,"Amazon was ok to work with.  They have quotas that can be hard to reach without going nonstop.  Management were mostly recent college grads who had a lot to learn on leading people.  Promotions were difficult to get, although I did get one promotion during my time."
good,"Amazon was decent the pay was cool it’s just a lot of work. You have to be fast and you only get a 10min break if your working 4 hour shifts. With the right manager things can be great but with the wrong manager it can be unorganized. I feel like they don’t give you enough time to learn the rules or taking time off I got fired for something that shouldn’t have even been approved but it was and it was put on me in the end. They’re lacking in the benefit area but this is a great second job it’s not enough to live on, that’s what is was for me a second jobs but be ready to get a workout in!"
good,"Personally I didn't like the rediculously fast paced work and CONSTANT mandatory ot and the fact it takes 5 minutes to get through security, that's 10 minutes of your already short break being wasted"
good,"A good organization for freshers to understand and develop. Mandatory rotational shifts and sometimes work volume increases exponentially. "
good,"I love working here for the most part. Advancing is quite difficult and all position changes are temporary to start so they can shuttle you back without much warning. It's competitive, fun, stressful but not what it used to be when I started years ago. It's getting to be about the all mighty dollar and the agents are paying for it. The amount of work you have isn't offset by the perks or pay by any means. When something is taken away, it's not replaced with something equitable in terms of compensation. However, when you find your groove, get a good team or some good friends, it becomes your family, whether you're in a PSC, FC or virtual."
good,"bonne opportunité pour apprendre et découvrir"
good,"Amazon is a nice place, but very competitive and stressful.People have to invent and follow continuous improvements lest falling back."
good,Amazon is a great place to work for younger individuals. It is a fast paced environment and lots of lifting bending and moving products. Long shifts...during holiday season you work up to 60 hours a week with mandatory overtime which inn theory is great until you don't even have time to do your own family Christmas shopping without ordering online from Amazon.
good,"Long hours, long drive, had great benefits!  Company match up to 8% of employee 401K investments.  Real stickler about time management and making sure individual is on tasks."
good,"argreable, bonne ambiance, avantage, horraire, paye"
good,"I actually really enjoyed the job but Amazon is able to pay employees higher than most companies by only allowing employees to work 20 hours a week or less. They also changed shifts often, meaning in a few months a shift that you were working would no longer be available either because it would be shifted earlier or later or removed entirely. I was on my way to becoming a manager while also going to school full-time before one of these schedule shifts made my employment impossible. None of the available shift options would work as they began or ended during the class schedule that I had created around my previous work schedule."
good,It alright it's a laid back job if your starting your first job this is a job for you company discounts pizza once a month raffle once in a while if your in college this is a job for you
good,Starting a new job was exciting and the environment to work in was fast and fun in the beginning but then later became more stressful and the drive to work that was once there was lost due to management
good,"If you have a degree or don't want to move up within the company its a great place to work! If you don't have a degree and would like to move up you have to be employed for 2+ years. They would rather hire someone they don't know anything about and has no clue how to do the job, but has a degree than to hire someone who understands and can perform the job at a high level already with no degree."
good,"Amazon is a strong company. You will work with bright people with strong aspirations. While Amazon believes it is still ""Day 1,"" it clearly is not. You can get mired in redundant work and red tape depending on what part of the org you work in."
good,"mainly working in packing "
good,"You get there and all employees stretch. Then management will update us and critique us on the work we've done. We then look at a whiteboard and see where we will be working. We load up vans with bags of products to get delivered. You do that for four hours with a break after two hours and two more hours and then you go home. "
good,"It is great to make extra money especially weekends, and they work with you to be able to go to school. Although some Amazonians were super lazy and Management did not care about them somehow, so others have to take the hardest part of job, so working there with no team work will kill you!"
good,"Worked at over 4 locations, love the culture, lot of work but it goes by quickly. Never transfer to a new location like i did because that when upper management starts to make too many changes. Had problems with payroll, time-sheets, parking, HR. Personally worked 88 hours and had 66 hours missing. Long On-Boarding Process (Had to perform work made for 22 associates, with 8 numerous times)"
good,Only thing is lifting heavy boxes or  pallet building. Other than that it was a cool job. The managers were cool for the most part. Very fast pace job. My co-workers we all nice. There is no air conditioning there only fans.
good,"Fast paced and good people. I work a short week and it fits my current life and work balance. I wish there to be better comunnication and that Mngmt not only reward the fastest Stower. It takes a team to to get 65+K sorted, pulled and stowed."
good,It was a good job to have but Personally I don’t really like driving a truck around all day and also I wanted to look for a job that payed better and had better benefits.
good,"Amazon is a good starter job for millennials who don’t know any better yet, LOL.. Here in AZ it’s also good for those in between jobs/careers, students or people only looking for part time work. Warehouses are where you find the most physically hard jobs, but basically they’re easy but monotonous. Lots of shifts available and as you get closer to Peak and holiday lots of opportunity for extra hours if desired.  Management overall is great but it’s easy to become one of the heard because of just the sheer number of employees.. Lita of turnover but it’s gotten better with the pay increase to $15/Hour. "
good,"Everyday was something new at amazon whether that be new experiances with customers of fun new things management had for us, such as holiday partys or even just fun days where they hand out candy or drinks"
good,"I got this job through internet. The warehouse is good place to work because they provide a proper area to work from. Also the management of the entire warehouse is very organised.In addition to this,entire team focus a lot on the safety of their workers. They never consider any thing as a small issue when it comes to safety."
good,"Love the company but they struggle to stay true to their principles with their rate of growth.  They need to ensure the front line managers coming from IBM, Oracle, HP ect are appropriately taught about our culture before they area allowed to shape teams."
good,"It was a temporary job for before I started school"
good,This job is okay. Its weekly pay but not enough hours. Sometimes you have to fix problems from shifts prior to yours.. Have to dress according to weather.
good,"The atmosphere at Amazon was fantastic for a self-professed nerd like myself. I loved that they provided us with free coffee, hot tea, popcorn, fresh fruit, etc,. At the time that I worked there, pay was not what it is today, that was what made it so difficult. For a job that was HIGHLY stressful, making $600 every two weeks just was not enough. I would definitely go back there, now that the pay has increased."
good,"Pays good. Not enough work of language seen. Pressure created on and off basically unnecessarry one. "
good,"It'll feel like your home."
good,"What a typical day at work look like is you clock in, meet at the front, the person that's ahead of the shift assign people their aisle and their duties and what each shift should look like, then we began stretching for about 10 minutes, once everyone is done stretching every grab what is needed to do their task, then everyone help set up each aisle and begin in their position."
good,Great job to have. Nice place to work . Very big warehouse. Multiple cultures. Very fast pace job. If your interested in working for them just make sure your a quick learner
good,very fast paced environment with room to grow. multiple overtime hours were offered and good pay as well. I learned to sort items and store them in a timely manner
good,"Amazon is a good place to start your british carreer. is very hard at the beginning but after few months you will be part of a team, and the managers are very respectfull"
good,"They need better management, above everything else the job itself was ok. I liked my shift from Sunday to Wednesday 6:00 am til 5:30pm. I enjoyed my job"
good,You learn a lot of problem solving skills while working. Many new projects come up and you need to learn quickly. Working in a changing environment is very enjoyable.
good,"a typical day at work is the start of my shift, my mangers go over the safety tips for today, the goal we need to meet, and any accomplishments we have made. Then we will stretch and labor tracked."
good,"Understand one thing; you're gonna work your tuchus off. Unless you're working in Non Inventory, that's the case across the board. As a picker, for example, its rather common to walk upwards of fifteen miles a day. Understand and accept that, and you should be smooth sailing from there. I was paid fairly well for the amount of work that was provided ($15 an hour, plus an extra $0.65 for working nights), along with full benifits and time off options. The culture (at least the employee culture anyway) is absolutely phenomenal. Rude co-workers are something of a rarity, and generally they don't stick around for very long. On top of that, I was also provided with very comprehensive time off options, including PTO, VTO, Unpaid Time Off, and vacation hours that'll give you time to rest up for the next day's shift. My biggest gripe with the company is how they hire their managers. Rather then hiring from within and cultivating a proper culture and standard of work, they will hire candidates from a management college, many of which have no prior management experience, or in my case with my previous manager, no previous work experience at all to speak of. That being said, when going into work remember what my Amazon Ambassador (an AA designated to train new hires) told me; If your AM isn't approaching you and isn't talking about your work all that much, you're doing something right. Keep your head down and your nose to the grindstone, and you'll succeed"
good,"You are wowed by the aspect of working at one of the most inventive and innovative companies', with almost something new being developed every day. On the flip side this at times results in lack of stability that comes from working in a less dynamic company. "
good,"only only one 15 minute break during shift, but very fast pace days fly by. the floors are hard on your back.  Met a lot of wonderful people there and the bosses were extremely nice."
good,"I worked for Amazon in a couple of different departments. Stow, pack, and sort. All of them were rate-driven and strenuous/standing positions, but they were all really laid back at the same time. You have to be independent and self-motivated. The managers don't stand over you and make sure you're doing your job. The compensation is amazing."
good,"si quieres un trabajo que las horas te pasen rapido este es el indicado, ya que con el volumen de cajas que hay no tendras tiempo ni para pensar."
good,"It is fast paced"
good,helpful to improve communication skills and leadership qualities also gain knowledge of how to interact with people with different mentalities overall nice to work
good,enjoyed the work also the pay was more than perfect. I liked the space of the break room/lunch room. The organization of duties was clear and concise. Productive environment. Stay busy .
good,The team worked well with each other. Enjoyed the challenge of the company's fast paced environment daily. I would surpass my time record on most days as I generally try to break my own record of stowing.
good,"Non è sicuramente un posto dove imboscarsi. Il lavoro in se è elementare, bisogna darsi da fare. Ottima la paga rispetto alle ore lavorate, con in più i buoni pasto e diverse agevolazioni extra-lavoro"
good,Innovative culture with many opportunities to learn as well as the ability to work remotely.  The most challenging part of the job is managing work life balance.
good,It was fast pace and hard working.  You have to be able to work quick and meet a quota.  The job isn't for everyone but if you work hard then it shouldn't be a problem.
good,"Amazon is a great work place, But for single parents is hard to hand with school hours and appointments. It pays well but very little time with family and or friends."
good,The job itself is not hard. Just tedious and very repetitive. Some people can work there for years with no issues. It just wasn't the right fit for me.
good,"As an associate starting out at Amazon Logistics, the work is a grind. It's fast paced, tiring, and brutally unrelenting. As you progress up the management chain things get better."
good,"Typical day at work doing the same thing. Workplace is boring minimum interactions. Hardest park of the job is 10 hour shift doing the same thing over and over. Enjoyable part of the job, is 3 day weekend and different holiday games and rewards."
good,"Shifts usually last about between 3-5 hours, depends on the volume of packages. It's competitive because you have to keep up a certain performance scanning packages with other people."
good,I love the duties and job itself however the survey that the representatives are graded by are unfair and hurt the agent even if you did a great job and the reason the survey was bad was that it was a product review rather. Being written up but the managers holding onto it and not telling you until the next time around and they give you multiple at once so that the consequences are harsher.
good,A very competitive place to work with a demanding time schedule to accomplish the daily tasks. Various departments inside per building. Great associates to work with.
good,"Let me just say that working at this specific location, everyone was very professional from the hiring event to officially working there (off-site & on site). The managers were always energetic & communicating with the employees. The first week and a half on the job was very hard for me, I’ve never worked 10-12 hour shifts let alone a full time job and it was hard labor as a package handler. It took time for me to adjust but by the second week I was making rates (they focus a lot on rates and that’s what made me give a 3.5/4 star). I worked night shift so I was sleeping through the entire day until my next shift, and on my off days I’d try to rest and relax as much as I could or possibly go out and have fun to reward myself for the week’s hard work. One other thing I did struggle with aside from balancing my life and work was that during a certain period I would get very sleepy and that would slow me down drastically which slows down the rate."
good,Amazon was a great job under the right management. You definitely have to work with the time given to complete everyday routes. Great job to get in shape
good,"It was really interesting at Amazon because the job culture was one that I’ve never been through before. It was very very rigid when it came to scanner times and I started off as a water spider but eventually found my way scan box to put on pallettes, getting the big box and arranging them by letter and also getting the smaller boxes and just organizing them on pallettes. It seemed as though the manangement was really overseeing everything you were doing and break times were also seemed very quick in comparison to how much we’d be on the floor. It became a somewhat challenging routine until people started to realize the scanner rates didn’t matter as much as suggested initially."
good,"Great benefits, Management up and down or indecisive at times,favoritism..Only feels good to work there when you got your paycheck or stock options they use to give you"
good,"The pay is great and the jobs there, are easy enough, though hours change drastically and quite often. There were no time off options and no way to change your shift."
good,"You work 11hrs a day 3 days one week 4 day the next."
good,"Clock in with a 5 minute grace period."
good,"things are always changing as far as schedules, high employee turn over, but the money was raised to $15/hourly so that was nice... they changed out schedules twice and said if we didn't comply we would have to resign... I asked about transferring and they gave me the run around, or answer that was inconsistent and changed as time went by. the atmosphere was pleasant and i enjoyed my co-workers, environment was relaxed. They let me comeback after having left the year prior without notice. so it's good for making some short term money in between jobs or college, and there's room for advancement also if you're looking for longterm. overall a good location, i worked as sort associate at two locations, lawrenceville and lithia springs dat2 and atl6 i think...  id work there again if i couldnt find better."
good,The workers and managers where over all very nice and helpful. You would have to put packages and boxes on a roller rack and pull the rack to the van and load it.
good,"Amazon was a great company to work for. A typical day included scanning packages into pallets, sorting packages according to zip codes, and wrapping packages on pallets."
good,"The work environment can be fun and exciting and does occasional require creative and intelligent thinking. "
good,"On a typical day as a stower, you're assigned to a stow station were you stow items into shelves and you're expected to meet your daily goals in productivity and quality."
good,Great Compensation but the requirements to achieve a high performance rating and promotion are extremely difficult. Group approval for promotions limits advancement.
good,Expect to work many hours as a finance professional at Amazon. You will learn and sharpen many skills in a fast-paced environment. It is definitely a resume builder as well.
good,its a ok job. only downside is i wish it made more. they did give me a cdl so that was cool. job wasnt hard at all and the break room had all the snack one could ask for
good,Because of the winter they merged to buildings together and it wasn't the best merge. So we had different uniforms based off the buildings and the people who originally worked at the building got more hours which was unfair.
good,"The job was okay, but had some challenges, for which I had to leave on my own and take care of.So I left. I think it is time to return but from a different setting."
good,"Work starts at 7:30 am and ends at 6:00 pm at my department. When you arrive at work, you go for morning meetings and you get updates and assigned stations. Management is good, a friendly working environment. There are two 30minutes breaks. One is paid for. We have people from different backgrounds. The hardest part of the job is doing the busy time where you have to work 60hrs a week, 10hrs per day for 6days in roll. The enjoyable part of the job is taking on new roles, learning in other departments and the people that are there. Also, the music and benefits."
good,Never enough hours for everyone and it was difficult to reach any managers for help. The pay and benefits are good though if you are able to get hours.
good,The environment in the warehouse was pretty relaxed and managers wouldn't bother you as long as you did your job and were not violating any safety regulations.
good,"It's exciting working for Amazon, and there is a great deal of autonomy. The difficulty, like any workplace is that there are a few bad eggs who don't live the culture that can make things difficult."
good,You work non stop until break times. it is very fast paced. You are continuously moving. You need to be able to bend and squat continuously through out the night
good,We encounter different situations everyday and how we take decisions makes the difference. The day or the work that would be assigned to you wont be known until u reach the place.
good,"Certain managers are cool to work with. Job is tedious & the goal rates are high considering the factors that can affect it (no pods/work, station down)"
good,"Travail propre, bonne ambiance pour ceux qui aime le travail"
good,"The time I was working with Amazon I feel they were professional in there outlook. They were very fair and there was inclusion. "
good,I enjoyed working there met interesting ppl. Fast paced work environment. Just wasn't given the schedule I needed to perform at my absolute best. Learned  almost all working departments of the facility in a few months.
good,Typical day work is standard with not much change.  I learned about how logistics operate.  The culture is negative overall.  Hardest part is the work and the rate and quality standards are a bit too strict.  If you are not detailed oriented then this job wouldn't be for you long term.  If you are detail oriented you can be successful here.  If you aren't and focus on the process of being an amazon employee you can be successful.
good,"Working for Amazon has been great but its very high stress and fast pace. I have enjoyed all the responsibility. Working for amazon has its benefits. I have worked in UK for almost 3 year. But with all the OT and hard work i put in here i have seen no more room for advancement here for me. I am a chief Engineer now looking for advancement and more opportunity. also i want to come back to America and be with my family."
good,the place is cool but they are strict. If you think you'll mess around then don't work here cause they will fire  you without a problem. But it pay well
good,"I would have to say Amazon was one of my best jobs, the pay was decent, your on the road, you get to see new scenery. The managers are un-organized. Some of the warehouse employees as well. But besides that they are a good company to work for."
good,"What most corporate employees miss is that you make your own experience at Amazon; i.e., if you always say yes, then your boss will give you 90 hours of work per week. Make of it what you want. There are opportunities to learn through various talks (Amazonian, vendors, and guests) as well as projects -- always something new to do."
good,Very productive job and competitivity . non stop job make fell the hours like minute. The manager is great never forget to talk about how much our safety is important. Very helpfull staff they encourage us to always ask questions about job issues.
good,Overall it is a good place to work if you are needing a job and also need to get in better shape. Little to no room for advancement to a management position
good,"make any mistake and they will let you go and not care, in my opinion if you just go in and do your job and not care about anything else you will do fine but if you have a family then it should be your last resort"
good,"Strenuous work hours, The challenging nature of the business never bores you out, but at the same time , this is not the best place to earn high bucks."
good,"Worked overtime alot ( 12 hours , 6 days a week )"
good,"you will work hard, meet friends, and very few managers understand  production, good environment for work a little warm in Summer  but they do have A/C."
good,"My sort time at Amazon before I had to relocate was very positive. Management was helpful with questions, the environment was fast-paced, and the work hours were great."
good,"V Amazonu se mi celkem líbilo, jen kdyby se změnil přístup vedení ke starším lidem, kdy se 25 letej vedoucí chová k 50 letému člověku jako k malému děcku."
good,"Had an awesome time working for Amazon.   In this job, I covered many routes along Hillsborough, Polk and Pasco counties.    Delivered hundreds of packages to customers and made many friends at work."
good,"Fady paced environment, on you feet for 10+ hours you are timed from scan to scan with a manager review each week. They occasionally provide lunch on special occasion"
good,"come mia prima esperienza lavorativa mi sono trovato bene perche ti da modo di crescere come persona, la parte molto negativa per me è stata la distanza, infatti questo è il fattore principale che rendeva il lavoro abbastanza pesante."
good,"Working for Amazon is extremely focused on their customer.  They are fast paced and have high expectations from their leaders.  With that being said, sometimes it can be extremely stressful which in return can cause a high turnover rate for leadership positions.  Amazon creates a very good culture for their associates always getting them involved with floor activities with their managers and receiving recognition when it's due.  Overall, Amazon is a face-paced, highly motivating, driven company."
good,The job was relatively easy but the available hours varied from day to day. The atmosphere was pretty casual and management was approachable and helpful.
good,"Ambiente di lavoro buono e giovanile, purtroppo non hai stabilita del lavoro e quindi poche chance di fare carriera"
good,"No complaints other then managers being poor leaders. Benefits were great, pay was okay, work was steady and hours were plenty. Better leadership would make the company and better place to work."
good,"Im großen und ganzen war ich mit meinem Job bei Amazon in  Werne zufrieden ."
good,"Good company run.by young inexperienced individuals..Very nice but still learning.there are a lot of inconsistent rules. Every supervisor tells you something different. The totes are overweight , the scanners half work and safety is an issue, not being followed or practiced when you are lifting totes from conveyor belt and putting them back on the belt. I was injured by a flying tote and fell into the person who saved me from other injuries."
good,"Long hours and good pay are excellent. "
good,It was fast pace work and required more than most people could do. They had a limit when I worked there that everyone had to meet and it was almost imposable at the time to get close to it.
good,They say work hard and it can be hard. Don't forget to take care of yourself. Be competitive as needed. And remember it is temporary so have fun and don't be to serious.
good,They hired too many employees both permanent and temporary causing lack of work after the holidays to give us our 40 hours.  We are often sent home with voluntary time off.  Although it is voluntary if you stay the work is just here and there.
good,"Amazon can be a really challenging place to work, but challenges force you to adapt and improve. I learned a lot working with the company in regards to research, learning new processes, and developing people around me."
good,"it was a fun work environment. I enjoyed my co workers a lot. dress code was very relaxed. it is a challenge for some people, but I found the physical part easy."
good,ottimo ambiente lavorativo scarsa crescita interna
good,"Checking all power from switch gear to UPSs to the distribution bays every 2 hours, to verify no change in voltage. Learning the ins and outs of Crac units. I worked with a good group of guys that all enjoyed there jobs. The hardest part of the job was being away from home. The best part was the ability to learn about different parts of a Central office I didn't know about."
good,"Amazon does a lot of things right, and they have to in order to be at the scale that they operate. However, if you are in a role spanning multiple disciplines, be prepared to be drinking from a fire hose."
good,"The place is good a place to work and very big they give you enough time to rest and relax and also they pay you while you are on lunch, the workers are nice"
good,"you only get to work 6 days out of the week. and most of the time, you do not get your full 4 hours out of the day. working in this company, was not fair to some."
good,"Working in a large company like Amazon that has a fairly transient workforce can lead to developing shallow relationships with coworkers. Regularly I have felt like a bit of a code monkey, where I just receive tasks to implement and don't question the source or reasoning behind them. I think that's intended within the company."
good,"There were no set times of work. Every Thursday night, we were required to login to their app. and try to get hours for the next 2 week period. As there were over 60 part-time employees, the result often ended with less than 30 hours per week per employee."
good,"I have worked at Amazon for about six months. The environment there was amazing and work pace was pretty much based on which shift you were placed. "
good,"read that ^"
good,"Overall a good place to work if you can handle the long hours and constant moving all day. You are not just standing, but walking a huge warehouse for 95 percent of your shift. On average you will walk 8 to 10 miles per  day. Meet great people and learn new things."
good,"Good workplace culture and great coworkers, but managers are hired externally and know less about processes than current employees. Pays well and is a busy environment"
good,"Working grave yard shift at amazon made me get back into shape a bit from all the  heavy lifting and pulling with the fast paced belts and working on the big iron ."
good,Just make sure to keep your rate up. It's not that hard of a place to work it's just the long shifts that kept the door revolving at that place.......
good,Every job has perks and drawbacks. Overall it was okay for a seasonal position. Its fine temp or you can do well and try for permanent position. It wasnt outstanding but not terrible. They did try and help me succeed.
good,"Positive but repetitive work place. "
good,"There were a lot of exciting employees, but somehow I didn't find someone to connect with. I did not take enough initiative to consult team members when I ran into challenges; remember, don't bug your boss too much!"
good,"- A typical day of work is fast paced and goal oriented "
good,"The workload you are expected to handle is immense. You have a high quota you need to meet, such as number of packages sent per hour, or number of items picked per minute. If you consistently don't meet the quota, you are terminated."
good,"I worked at AVP1, and I really liked it. The work was hard, but I had no negative experiences with the people. I would recommend anyone trying to work there to aim for a direct hire, the staffing agency they insist on using makes a lot of mistakes, I had a terrible time getting onboard with them."
good,Amazon is good company to work for if you are willing to work hard and put in the time. Can be stressful at times.Good benefits and salary if you have worked for Amazon for a few years however a lot of employees can not make it with Amazon for a few years.
good,I didnt really like working there not enough good pay at all i personally wouldnt recommend anyone to work there. Really have nothing more to say about the company.
good,Dans l'ensemble ce fut une expérience sans regret.
good,"It's a great place to work, especially starting out. There is a lot to do and a lot to learn so you ware always busy. "
good,In a typical day is a headache were you can be five early or late otherwise a penalty the work is not consistent an had to make friends to get good carts and shared space t part the stuff
good,"Fast paced, job performance is rated and reviewed. Overtime is available. Holiday season is the busiest and can be exhausting. You could possibly work 12-16 hours a day."
good,"made good money during peak but once it ended... so did the money.."
good,very nice company in point of work culture but management is not that good. no matter how good you are doing if your manager doesn't like you there is no personal growth for you
good,"Amazon is a wonderful place filled with smart, passionate, and dedicated workers.  This is a great place for folks who thrive executing day-to-day, not a place for thinkers.  Fitting into their culture is critical to one's success.  If you are unsure if you fit in after 6 months, best to start looking for a new role outside the company."
good,This was a contract delivery position requiring deliveries from 3 to 4 hours on shifts that were selected.  Blocks were available 7 days a week and it was up to the individual driver to select their own schedule.
good,Il y a un bonne ambiance et un bon esprit d'équipe
good,Good place to work..very time manageable. Have to be able to keep up with the pace.Great overtime and hours! Especially during peak season! Great pay.
good,"The job was okay, however work/life balance could be hard depending on your shift. "
good,the days went long because you have to stand in one spot for 10 hours. but if you have good knees and a strong back i recommend working here. my co workers where typically nice people. i enjoyed working 4 days and having 3 days off
good,"Lifting an average of 28 pound boxes all day"
good,"really fast paced, takes a toll on the body. its 1 milloin sq foot  3 story warehouse , you will get a work out .. if you work more than hr away might no be woth it for you to dive home .. very very tired especially during peak holidays 55-60 hrs a week"
good,Amazon is a fun place to work at. The management is friendly and very helpful. Lots of growth opportunities. I learnt leadership and organisational skills.
good,"Every workplace will have some kind of pros and cons."
good,"Excellent place to work."
good,"The Amazon culture isn't as awful as some people say.  The job is great if you are comfortable in a warehouse and are willing to come in everyday to do your job.  If you aren't able to keep up in a fast paced career, Amazon will not be for you.  The job is all about the customer, as it should be.  It's hard work, but the benefits and incentives make it all worth it."
good,Good work place but needs work as far as management and the third party leave of absence company. Overall if these things get fixed the job is outstanding
good,"Basic Warehouse at Amazon FC. When I was there it was very cut-throat. Worked at inbound as picker and stower.  Eventually moved up to being a Problem Solver. They really focus on rate,rate,rate..."
good,"buen ambiente de trabajo"
good,"As a process assistant, the job can vary throughout warehouses. Ideally trained to back fill any floor manager with the objective to keep providing work to fulfill the FC process. Everything was learned through situational training and experiences as there was not a formal description of what day to day job duties are like in each department; fill in the role type of deal. Growth can be difficult especially as other departments are favored than others and tenure can overshadow talent."
good,it is a fast pace environment. the culture is diverse yet with some flaws. the majority of the people are very nice. they are respectful and fun to work with. the management is good except for few people who treat their employees unfairly.
good,My experience with amazon was a great experience that really connected me with a lot of positive co workers and it expanded my employment experience and to be honest the only reason I stopped working there is because I had to relocate to Georgia but if I had the chance to get a nother amazon job I would jump at the opportunity
good,"A typical day consisted of showing up, clocking in, doing a brief recap meeting to go over protocols, new details for the shift, and establishing the training already given. "
good,It was an okay job but hours weren't very flexible and the job could get stressful at times. Lots of opportunity for overtime during holidays especially. Pay was great.
good,Byl jsem tam spokojen celkem ale po čase už to chtělo nějakou změnu prostředí.
good,"Overall, Amazon is always looking to get better at everything including work with its corporate employees to find the work life harmony.  I have learned a lot working here and would encourage anyone that wants to be in an environment where its fast paced, working with smart people, and is thirsty to develop."
good,The atmosphere was conducive to a well balanced production line. I would have like to work for AMAZON full-time and not for a temp service. Amazon is a company that a person can grow.
good,"Amazon has too many areas of opportunity to rate them all.  I was involved in a few and the one take-away was and remains:  "
good,Great opportunity for your first job out of college. you will be molded by leadership principles that will transfer to outside amazon if you so choose.
good,"Amazon is a good place to work, the pay should be more , it's like once you hit that certain amount of years that's your pay not unless they give you a cost of living raise or something."
good,Job was stressful and not enough movement for me. im more of a hands on tpye of person i rather work with cars or walking around with other people learning new things
good,"Base of what we have send in social"
good,Productivity changes daily. Manager often can’t make decisions on their own for as placement of employees. My place as a floater I never what I’m doing throw out the day.
good,Good company but fast paced.... if you can’t handle being on your feet for long periods of time and keeping up with the fast paced environments this job isn’t for you.
good,Its a productive place to work. even as a part time employee you have some benefits but the hours could use a increase. I think the building i work at would be better if it was full-time.
good,Was a fun job but fast paced and required a lot of strenuous activity. on your feet most the day. management sits around most the day and just talks. frustrating but not as big a deal. overall a fun job.
good,"It was long hours but they went by fast. Its a fast pace job but it is easy, fun and safe. I could not stay anymore. I was pregnant and the sickness was really kicking my butt. But besides that, I enjoyed working there and the people."
good,They demand a lot the work is easy but can provide great experiences. Got to travel to various states to help start new FC's and make a lot of new friends and connections.
good,Managers are the only Amazon associates who get paid appropriately everyone has to break their back for little wages.  It is very difficult to make a living even with combined incomes while working as a grunt at Amazon but the benefits are great.
good,"A typical day at work was extremely interactive.  There was a lot of stimulation, and you never get bored.  Management could have been better, but overall wasn't terrible.  The hardest part of the job was working in the heat of the summer.  I enjoyed  the people and am still in contact with a lot of my previous coworkers."
good,"My experience was terrible, but I know it was fully due to management who have since been released of their positions. I think it is a massive company that tries very hard to be as fair as it can on such a large scale."
good,"Amazon has a flexible and relaxed work structure. Learnt a lot about operational procedures and work ethics in America."
good,This is a goal driven organization. The culture in the warehouse world is dog eat dog. You must have goals and be driven to succeed. There is no one to hold your hand. I watch many managers and supervisors cry in bathrooms because of the stress. Many reports in newspapers a wrong about working conditions. Stress is about delivering results and staying on task.
good,"Employees are monitored closely to review their productivity. Whichever function being performed, a thing rate of productivity is expected. Managers typically have no personal experience with many of the tasks being performed by associates."
good,"Amazon is a peculiar place to work. Company focuses on short term gains putting an incredible amount of pressure on associates. Personnel turnover is incredible, no one lasts more than 3 years."
good,working at amazon has been a learning experience when it comes to working in a warehouse fulfilling orders for customers. You must be motivated and be able to work quickly since Amazon requires orders to be done quickly and accurately. They apply rates for your performance and expect nothing but the best. Management has regular stand-up meetings with their associates and updates them on new changes and there expectations on their associates. Safety is always expressed and customer satisfaction is always the desired goal.
good,"Work at home generally pays pretty poorly.  There are some obvious advantages but they do not out way the low pay.  Training is pretty good, work is high paced and can be stressful."
good,"Usually very straining and stressful for the body, walking up to 50 miles a day for 10 hours straight. The GMs are nice and fair people. I didn't have a good experience with office workers though."
good,"Guter Arbeitsgeber. "
good,"The work was tough and the warehouse was poorly heated and cooled, but the job was easy to learn and they pay fairly as well. Plenty of opportunisties to advance."
good,it was a good job but they need to organise things properly by helping staff. need to stop bumping people around different departs in a week as it doesnt help the staff at all keep up their targets
good,the hardest part of the job would be getting converted from a seasonal employee to a full time employee and reap the benefits that you should be given regardless if youre an seasonal employee or not.
good,"Amazon training is really good, they are flexible with hours. It can be a fun environment. The hardest part of the job is when the work is slow. Also comfortable shoes is required."
good,Had a great experience with Amazon. Great time in my role and picker.Picker would receive orders of items and pick from warehouse in order to complete that online order.
good,This is a fun fast company to work at. i been here for six years and they are many ways to move up. i have done my best and exceeded my best at this company its time for a new challenge
good,"Amazon was amazing, there were so many options for career advancement, and they would place you in programs to develop your career in almost any field and industry that aided America. "
good,"good camaraderie among colleagues is present during the time I was working here. The TL's are very accommodating. However, an issue with the issue about the environment has soon arouse as somethings change at the middle of my stay with them."
good,Work with people and listening to the music on the radio. Sorting and wrapping up all the product or supplies being sent out to customers to fulfill their needs
good,"flexible hours, well paid  contract job.  no real management or anyone to support the flex drivers. good as a suplemental income. but no job securities or benefits"
good,"I worked 5 different contracts for 3 different teams. All of my managers were devoted to the company and focused on meeting goals. Some were also devoted to the well being of their teams and, therefore, the well being of their team members."
good,"Job is good way to earn warehouse experience and gather skills that you can use later in other jobs. Great benefits, easy going job, poor work life balance"
good,If you want to stay part time at a sort center great otherwise good luck finding a full time job with them and the management is nuts.  They are very inconsistent and only care about operations and every other function is irrelevant.
good,Every Amazon warehouse is different. Overall they are not a bad company to work for with decent benefits however the pay is lower than industry standards compared to others in the same role.
good,"If I did not have school/work schedule conflicts then I would still work there. Fast-paced work environment, fun at times, but mostly serious due to time sensitive work assignments. Typically worked 10-12 hours per day, 4 days on and 3 days off, but this was not always the case. The Atlanta area culture is very insecure and obsessed with image, which has nothing to do with Amazon, but filters over into workplace. A lot of petty issues between employees because of those types of insecurities. Management would do well to check these problems to avoid hostility and undo tension within the workplace. Being proactive with more assertiveness would immensely improve the culture with the command and control center."
good,"Amazon overall is good. The company is always watching competing warehouses to ensure that Amazon is keeping up with trending pay. HR is helpful. They allow you to be apart of career advancement opportunities such as obtaining a CDL, medical assisting, and paralegal assistant classes."
good,"Exceptionally challenging and fast paced environment in most of its facilities, but faces tremendous challenges going forward in the maintenance of its distribution network. For this reason, the company has outsourced the maintenance of all of its distribution facilities as it lacks the internal resources to recruit the requisite technical talent. This has closed off many opportunities to many older Amazon employees in the maintenance and maintenance management fields. Compensation is outstanding, but the turnover is exceptionally high, further complicating the problem of maintaining a well trained and experienced workforce."
good,This is a growing company. The work is fast paced and you will work hard. The schedules are not as flexible as I would like them to be. The management is understanding when you need to get things done.
good,"It was a fun and relaxed pace at work, training happens right away and not much time for it. Learned Linux command and minimum config repair for server hosts. Long shifts and lots of walking. Best part was playing in the office with Nerf guns."
good,"If you are friendly hard working person that likes good environment its place for you. Vending machines, free coffee/tea drink machines, cold drinking water stations, lockers, fridges, parking space, conditioners, all P.P.E. provided by employer, clean warehouse. Overtime above 40 hours is payed 1.5 times your rate. "
good,Amazon has alot of rules but i tend to understand why. Its a fast pace job and i like that. Time usually goes faster when you are busy getting things done.
good,"the role is stress free role. I would start by picking up my deliveries from the amazon depot and scan them using the amazon app, I would then follow the optimal route directed by the app to make the drop offs."
good,"•	Inspect packages for defects "
good,"Picking and stowing items on an hourly basis."
good,"The warehouse is a medium-fast pace, although its not too stressful. It can get a bit much if you're not used to the type of work, but with the safety and management, it can be a fun and rewarding place to work."
good,"you clock in and work until all trucks are done. sometimes it may be 3 hrs sometimes longer. the building is hot and not alot of restrooms."
good,"It’s was okay,fast paced environment I liked the people I was working whit, its a cool job,I would tell everyone to work ther, and good cardio and physical activity."
good,This job is great for a younger person and you have to have a positive attitude! Lots of fun under those circumstances. Be prepared to work and give it your all.
good,"You work hard everyday and the bar is always rising. The people you work with are generally nice. Be prepared for a lot of happy hours. There are high expectations and not much guidance, so one must rely on their resourcefulness to get things done."
good,"It can be overwhelming for people who are nit used to working in a fast paced environment, but once you get used to it it is very manageable. They paid well even for the seasonal people, you did have to wok some 11 hour shifts during the holidays due to the massive influx of orders."
good,Amazon is a great place to work for a short period of time. It is very stressful and demanding physically so it's best to get in and make your money and get out.
good,Great company but the schedules are terrible for an everyday life i work weekend nights 10 or 12 hour shifts which are killer!!! The job isn’t too hard depending on the department but the Schedules defianietly catch up to you health wise and personal life the pay isn’t too bad but not enough to make a living
good,"a typical day at work consists of waiting for delivery requests via app"
good,"Delivery is hard work, but well paid and with plenty of variety. Daily duties included collecting and loading your van with the days deliveries. Organising your route and making sure that the parcels were delivered to the correct address."
good,"Buena motivación por parte de la empresa,buena relación con los compañeros de trabajo pero con contratos laborales temporales con ampliaciones mensuales del mismo."
good,"Work experience at Amazon was good but management of time difficult along with studies. Learning was also good at Amazon, however they have very much structured system to follow rules and regulations during work. Sometimes these obligations reduce the productivity. Whenever, someone has creative skills to finish tasks in an excellent way."
good,I was just moving product through the warehouse. This was not my money making job was doing it more just to stay in shape. Now would I ever go back maybe for the holiday rush just to put a little extra in the pocket.
good,It was a fast paced job but a good enviroment to work in. One of the things that i didnt like is that they did not allow you to work very many hours witch meant very low pay per week.
good,"It's pretty laid back as long as you get your work done. And be wary of your available time off so you don't run out. Four day work weeks are a plus, occasional mandatory overtime is a con."
good,"I've been working here for almost two years now and there is a major problem with proper training and cross training. Most roles are defined as Direct or Indirect. Direct means everything you process is tagged to you and you will be held responsible if something happens. Indirect tends to be support roles or jobs that require more advanced thinking than ""scan a billion things and put them away"". "
good,"I enjoyed the opportunity to learn various roles within the facility. This has allowed me to travel to launch another Amazon facility."
good,Working with this company has taught me a lot not just about the workplace but also other cultures. I feel like at RIC2 management can do a lot better helping associates other than being very unprofessional to associates.
good,"It was always hectic, competitive, they made sure you were able to do your job and talked to you if your daily numbers were low. There were opportunities to advance forwards but it was difficult."
good,"workload too high, metrics too high to achieve for most."
good,Amazon was a fun place for me to work that offered alot of experience in a short amount of time. I enjoyed my time there and the people I met along the way.
good,Management could have made better decisions rarely steady environment. Hours flunchuates Greatest thing was being payed weekly.One day things may be fixed but may take years without the right workers & management.
good,"this place has great benefits, but the pay is 13 and hour. you do a lot of work, they dont want you to talk to employees while working. you have to wait until break time. Peak is where you make money and prime day really. place gets really boring and stressful due you have to make a certain mount of number to not get fired."
good,"The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the rate for me anyways because you have to constantly go, but if you make it you'll be good. The managers were nice and cared for your needs. I learned about how most things work in the warehouse and what happens."
good,"Very fast pace, requires a lot of high energy and always on your feet. Only drawback is they do a lot of seasonal hiring but don't have many permanent long-term positions available to offer."
good,"In most cases you could pick your shifts according to your own preferences, In this way, I was able to schedule around my sons school and when I had baby sitters."
good,"Its a good temporary job. Usually it was the holiday season that had plenty of opportunities for over time, but it felt like you were slaving your whole day to have little to no time to yourself."
good,"Its a nice place to work, but very inconsistent with the operational hours, usually if you end up your shift early, you have to stay to help others, sometimes it doesn't matter but not everyday."
good,The job was easy and training was fast. The warehouse is very busy and there's a lot of delivery drivers. You have to know how to work with a large group of people and move fast.
good,"docela dobře placené pracovní místo, podnikem dotované obědy, svozová doprava, tři přestávky, měsíc ranní, měsíc noční"
good,"Amazon would always be marked as one of the amazing companies to work in this world. everyday is a first day in Amazon, the work culture, the world class amenities they provide for the fellow employees, and the top class style of management where every voice is heard with utmost preference. i would love to work with Amazon again."
good,"Learn to work fast without supervision, I learned how a fulfillment Center works, I met lots of new people. The best part of the job is that no one is all over you all day."
good,"Working there is fun, they people you meet are amazing. It’s even better when you get an amazing manager. The work was repetitive but the day goes by fast."
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with"
good,"Competitive setting, Management is pretty much good. You travel throughout the warehouse either on forklift, Segway, or by foot. You will definately be on your feet majority of the day with most positions. Some positions require knowledge of reading a barcode scanner. You will be lifting and placing products throughout the warehouse. Everything from dvds,cds,books,games,electronics,shoes,purses,sex novelty items, food, & toys."
good,"Clock in for ten hours a day with two fifteen minute breaks and one unpaid lunch break. On feet all day, primarily on hard concrete. Simple work but made to hit a high work rate ( a chunk of people get fired for simply not being able to reach this standard)"
good,"At first the job was great and all but then, we soon realized that they didn't care about their employees. One of my coworkers were sick for the whole time we worked at Amazon. We had two favorite supervisors, others were rude."
good,"Fast paced, must meet unit quota per hour, offers incentives and contests during peak season, does various things throughout the year to show employee appreciation, decent pay, great benefits, tuition reimbursement offered, scheduled accommodations offered for those in school, many managers are very ""green"" and are constantly moved to different departments/facilities so you don't get to know them too well, must have a bachelors degree to really ""get"" anywhere in the company"
good,Very competitive and cut throat company. Push associates to their breaking points. Favoritism is a huge problem. Very inconsistent workloads some weeks you’ll be slammed and some weeks or months their will be no work at all and they try to force their associates to voluntary go home.
good,"would work here again as good people, wages were also good company could be better it feels like no one cares as if you are just another number and I don't feel help is offered as much as should be."
good,"Its hard work, however its not secure as agency workers do not have the job security,"
good,"A day consists of 3-4 hour shifts."
good,"High turnover rate.  Very fast paced company.  You either keep up, or you fall behind.  The managers appear bored and tend to scrutinize their employees if they don't like them."
good,Better benefits could be made available for the temporary workers since they work equal hours as the permanent workers. Also some free lunches could motivate the employees
good,"To each is own working at Amazon warehouse. The position I had was fast paced compared to other positions. If your ever a picker, I suggest you be a man that is average to tall in height and in good shape."
good,"Safety was always number 1 at Amazon.  Great team spirit and management was awesome! "
good,"on your feet all the time, quick lunch break, good part time job. I didn't really learn much. A lot of the factory workers are lazy. The management tracks your productivity on your scan rate, but sometimes I would try to improve the conditions of the pallets which does not show up on your scan rate, so management would accuse me of not working. This creates an incentive to scan as many packages as possible without putting in quality work. The people in charge of wrapping the pallets also complained about the quality of the pallets because the scanners do not have time to fix the pallets."
good,"Working from home being an Amazon.com CSA was awesome once you take a few calls and get a rhythm, but certain departments, like for me, CAP, had a lack of organization and things got to hectic at times. The procedures were in place, but who is supposed to do what was always a different answer depending on who you spoke to. Also, for Amazon.com, the biggest company in the world, priding themselves on their customer service, $10/hourly is just ridiculous. Bonuses were quarterly and performance based, so you could miss out, and being it is just a YES/NO system in an e-mail, it can get ignored, or based on policy there would be nothing you could do for the customer and still you can get a no and then goodbye any type of bonus. Great job for a housewife for extra money but not someone looking for a career or trying to build their life."
good,"Working at Amazon is a great opportunity for growth, but you will be busy."
good,Relaxed fast paced work place that gives warnings before terminating their workers. Time manageable hours. Flexible hours that’s workable. Easy work...
good,"It is what you make it. Very fast paced and challenging. never the less, I enjoyed working there and being part of the team. I learned a lot about shipping and receiving. I have a new look on the company that is impressive"
good,"Easy work. The layout of the building is easy to get used to. Training provided. There are occasionally opportunities to be trained within another job, such as stowing or packing. Overtime is usually available. Only work 4 days per week (10 hour shifts) unless they need you for overtime. Great pay rates."
good,fast paced workplace they made it fun and relaxing at times but u have to pay attention and work safe daily goals and training is given to establish a string work history
good,Amazon is a great place to work if you like a challenge and don't mind being on your feet for 10 hours. They have great benefits. Also get to meet and talk to new people all the time .
good,"Management tells you that the average work span for a amazon employee is 1-2 years. So unless you plan on standing on concrete for 10 hours a day for the rest of your life, find a plan and allow amazon to give you what you need until you can get out."
good,I started entry level and paid decent.Peak is pretty crazy five twelve hour days mandatory but pay was pretty good. If you do not make quota you get a write up. After 3 your retrained and then the next write up is termination.
good,Good place to work. Great pay. It’s not climate controlled so dress accordingly. Ten hour work shift. You get your own locker. Short lunch. You get two fifteen minute paid breaks.
good,"A typical day at work includes minimal expectations for a manager to show on time, conduct early shift preparations and follow-through with conduct of shift."
good,The day is very fast paced and you are constantly learning. You work directly with your department  manager. Remember you are there to work. The hardest part of the job is being on your feet for 10 hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with.
good,comme l'entrepôt est très grand il faut avoir une bonne condition physique
good,Very high pace environment. Non stop work you have to meet a quota. I was one of the top packers in my department. If you are not in shape this is the place to be.
good,"My job was pretty simple. Time and attendance, employee occurrences, productivity spreadsheets. High paced environment."
good,My experience was stressful because it was my first warehouse job and it took me a while to get use to the pace and I struggled to meet the quality control. But after about a month I got into a grove but if you miss too many days you will be fired. Overall not a bad job just long shifts
good,My experience was a relaxed environment with well defined exceptions of the employees. Aside from Prime Week most weeks were quick paced and usually 40 hours. I never had an issue with any management or other employees and everyone was more than willing to help answer a question or solve a problem.
good,It is a good place to work. I enjoy training in IT and problem solve. I also enjoy corresponding with all of our international and overseas representatives.
good,Fast pace from the time you clock on to off.  Must exceed rates to have any advancement. Al lway looking for ways to go faster and safer.Looking to make dollars VCP.
good,"You need to constantly improve to raise your skills.  Don't get complacent.  If you stay at your job for a couple years and know most of it, move to another team or be suggested to move."
good,Fun place to work at.Downfall no benefits and my position was seasonal only. Did work 40 hours a week. Flexible hours were available if needed. Fun meetings.
good,"Great company but very physically demanding "
good,"They preach how safety is number one, but actually it is productivity. One of their leader principles is about hiring the best, but they choose to consistently hire managers straight out of college with no job experience or people skills. While people who actually know how to do their job get stuck and cannot move up. The benefits are great and I can see it as a great job for most, but not a career."
good,"Being the bottom feeder at Amazon, is like a war zone. You come in get what you need and go about your business. The managers make you feel like a bottom feeder, like they are better than you."
good,"very time consuming, i believe associates should be paid more,fast paste, not a career just a temporary job, hard on your body hard hours but youn can pick your day to work"
good,"fast pace, have to be accurate, love the co workers but didn't like management that much. hardest art was being in stow. i have learned to be more organized."
good,Enjoyed working at amazon the years I had the coworkers and supervisors were respectful and also fun.Very clean and nice place to work.Security officers are always there to greet you.
good,"Mi valoración es buena aun que trabaje por ETT, todo muy controlado en un ambiente bueno de trabajo y seguro."
good,Great place to work if you like to make money 12 hour shifts working 4 days with the option of over time all ways.The shifts were too long and they are'nt so flexible with you taking days off. Very strict with point system which allows them to get rid of very good workers.
good,"Stay productive and it a be a great day at Amazon "
good,Working at Amazon they truly overwork their employees. Some of the people you are trained by can’t even train properly and no one cares. I wouldn’t recommend this job.
good,It was an good experience. I would not do it again.Learning experience first overnight position so it was a challenge. Only a seasonal position. Good place for the hoilidays.
good,If you are hard working you might get frustrated with the fact that not everyone works as hard and doesn't get reprimanded for it. However it is an easy place to work.
good,Amazon is a great place to job. This is a e commerce company & well maintained relation ship to the customer. My experience about this company is very good.
good,"My shift started at 5 am and lasted for approximately 5 hours. My duty was to unload the truck bed full of packages and place them on the conveyor belt. Really fast paced. Management is great and comprehensible. Everyone gets along with everyone, and work together to get the job done. Raffles took place every now and then. A break was provided half way through the shift. Food was provided in holidays and it was paid shift and a half."
good,Not the job for someone that is not highly motivated to advance. Constant pressure to do more. Great compensation package. Management is very focused on being the top performing facility.
good,10 to 12 hour shifts. Physical fast paced work environment. Plenty of opportunity for overtime. Also you can earn monthly bonuses for attendance and productivity.  Great benefits. Metric based company
good,"1. The Team is very close knit"
good,Amazon was a great place to work. It was very fast paced and structured. As long as you were there to do your required tasks it was a very busy shift. There were lots of opportunities to learn different skills and do different jobs.
good,"It's ok to work there but, management is very unprofessional. All in all it is a good company to work for. I would recommend it to other people without a doubt."
good,"You had a badge that allowed you to enter the facility through turnstile type doors. You used your badge to swipe in. At the time I was working the day shift which began at 7:30am and ended at 6:00 pm, a 10 hour shift. You reported to your assigned area, for me was packing. You used a scanner to scan items and then packaged them using automated tape machine and computerized information for the box size. That is pretty much what you did the whole shift, standing pretty much in one place."
good,"A lot of errors generated falsely when you have one item in a bin that you count and somehow it was wrong, most likely because the item fell out of the bin after you counted it."
good,great people to work for sometimes to many chiefs gets workers confused but other than that everything about Integrity staffing is great. great benefits and wages fast paced environment lets time go buy quickly and you can dress comfortably with a few limitations.
good,Amazon is a great company to work for. They have great benefits for the employees. I just wouldn't recommend anyone working at the return center its feel like your working on a slave ship and the leadership team sucks there is no good communication.
good,"La prima cosa che ho imparato  e  il rispetto de i tempi di lavoro la puntualità nelle consegne  in 1h , lavoravo nel settore alimentare  dovevo  prendere gli ordini del cliente  inbustare i prodotti  verificare sempre la qualità e  spedirli.Ottima organizzazione del lavoro da parte dei responsabili, la parte più difficile del lavoro  non ne ho trovato, la parte più piacevole si lavora  insieme a tanti giovani."
good,"The people who work in management at Amazon never complex technical stuff. They focus way too much on bias for action and delivering results at the expense of quality and depth. As a result, they expect engineers to do the same."
good,Great team and great people but could sometimes overstretch but in all its a fun place to work but lack of career advancement is a major minus and should be worked upon so as to motivate employees and to encourage staffs serving for a long term
good,Cool learning experience  fun people to be around stressful hard on your back and knees off sleep schedule long hours not enough break time a lot of walking cold
good,"long days, with lost of walking or standing still"
good,"long hours quick pace work gotta make rate, on your feel alot of heavy lifting and walking, hours of constant work with a thirty minute lunch and two fifteen minute breaks"
good,"The enviorment wasnt to bad , managment overall was not that great,but at the end of the the job i had was pretty easy going and laid back which made it easy on me."
good,"Amazon is a god place to work. when it comes to benefits At the same time, amazon is also stressful before you can work at amazon, yo have to be strong."
good,Require constant attention. No letting up to easing.You are always at the job. Management wants a quota per hour and got to meet  your target. however there is camaraderie
good,"It was an ok place to work. If you are looking for a job with benefits and you don't have a lot of experience or mid doing the same mindless tasks every day, this would be right for you."
good,"Great place to work as a young single person.  There is not much work life balance, and you will be working 12 hours a day, however the work is innovative and the people are typically smart and collaborative."
good,"Wellness programs , benefits , sick time  room for improvement after college, shares in the company , paid lunch time , and vacation time 2 weeks ( this is for part timers )  they work hard 20 - 35 hours a week ."
good,"Fast paced.  Quota driven.  Physically demanding.  You are required to stand for the 10-11 hour days.  No sitting at all.  You will walk quite a distance every day also.  However, there is room for advancement if you can stick with it and meet the quota."
good,"Worked for Amazon as a Lead Fullfillment Associate. My job was to help out the managers with running the department. The management at Amazon was always very understanding and open to hearing opinions on how to improve, had multiple avenues for associates at all levels to voice complaints, and were very sincere in trying to make the workplace enjoyable. Amazon also gave associates many opportunities for advancement. One of the downsides for working there was that there was very poor work-life balance. Often working 60 hours a week to keep up with demand, even outside of holiday season."
good,"Fun fast paced environment, If you are a fast learner and are self motivated it is a fun job. Great benefits and great schedule options. Also allows you the option of relocating if need be."
good,I would recommend working at Amazon. I've been there for 5 plus years and wouldn't change a thing about working there. The only issues I see is the managers are young and lack the professionalism.
good,Very easy labor job. I only worked at the PT facility so I didn't get very many hours during non-peak seasons. Management was nice and friendly. Not a lot of room for advancement at the Sort Hub though.
good,"For anyone interviewing at Amazon - three things:  Leadership Principles, Leadership Principles, Leadership Principles!  Get to know these inside and out, along with examples of how you've applied them in your career successes and challenges."
good,"good benefits, bad place for advancement, friends, pay, and environment. I've been there for six years between two buildings. It is draining, mindnumb."
good,Cool place to work at. Break rooms are a plus. Vibe from management and co-workers are blah. Training could be much better if they just put some effort into it.
good,"the warehouse was a part of diapers.com and was later bought out by amazon while i was currently working there.  It was quite the transformation.  it was a 10 hour night shirt with the optional overtime.  lunch at midnight, home by 5am.  once a person adjusts to the lifestyle shift its a good career opportunity"
good,Days are long and how much you like or dislike really depends on the department you get into. If you end up doing something you like there its great but if not it can be hard to hang around till you get the chances to try other things you may be better at/enjoy more.
good,A typical day at work was when i did all my work and it was time to leave. The hardest part was standing up for so long and having short breaks. the most enjoyable part was learning how to do new things.
good,"This is only a temporary job, I don't think I'm able to provide a fair/detailed review for this company. It's high paced for sure, very challenging working specs."
good,"amazon is a fast paced job but there is also a lot of down time. some days i felt like i was working extremely fast all day, other days it felt like there was no work to be done and people were being sent home without pay."
good,It's a good peak position. The work is very fast paced and can be tedious. They do give you an opportunity to cross-train in other areas. There's a lot of lifting and walking involved and can be very demanding physically.
good,"Enjoyable part of the job, is when we get our break we all have fun together playing bingos, and after our break finish, we come together and exercise"
good,long hours but secured if you can keep up. They care but only about the numbers you are putting out for them. Management isn't the greatest but also not the worse.
good,amazon is a good place to be im only disagreement was i wanted to work at a closer location which is new castle but the refused and told me i could only stay at the middletown location i was catching a bus there from wilmington i was always late because of that
good,"Amazon is a really big company, as people said different team has different culture, like a different company. It all depends on what your manager's working style"
good,"The pay at amazon is very good, they pay on time but the working hours are not much of a benefit. the work is tiring and you only ever get 15 minutes break. If you are desperate for money a Christmas role will do you good."
good,Dá se pochopit jednoduchá práce. Vše je dobře uspořádáno.
good,"learned to keep up with productivity rate, fun working with staff members and co-workers, fast paced environment that keeps you working, stand on your feet all day but get used to it"
good,The hardest of the job is being alone for most of your shift but they try to make the time fly by hosting interdepartmental competitions. Management really care and try to get you involved.
good,Amazon is an amazing company to work for. The sort center is a stressful place to work as is the distribution center. During Christmas and black Friday sales you work close to 40 hours a week as opposed to the 20 you are originally hired for. Almost all employees at the sort center are hired part time and you are considered full time at the distribution centers. I recommend this job if you want to spend your life with the major corporation.
good,This is a good stable place to work once you become an amazon employee. As long as you don't mind being on your feet all day. The only problem is their management team are all people straight out of college or they are just their to have the position on their resume. Which means they don't really care or know how to do the jobs they are managing.
good,Working here is a little stressful. The environment is fast-paced. The only perks is that you receive the discounts and prizes. Management is also always worried about the numbers.
good,"So many good things to say about Amazon.  Great start pay, excellent benefitrs.  They try to keep you motivated in the busy holiday season with games, scratchers, treats and free stuff like jacket and t-shirt for all employees.  Free coffee in the break room.  The managers at my site are great.  The senior ops manager at 3 is great.  "
good,Amazon is a fast- paced  environment that allows you to learn new skills on a daily basis. The atmosphere is friendly with everyone willing to help make the ultimate goal happen by the end of the day...to make sure everyone gets there order on time.
good,Amazon is a great place work if you’re looking for an career and not a job. The hours sometimes are long but they do pay good and they have great benefits to offer
good,"pay is okay, management needs an upgrade, met a lot of cool down to earth people. benefits are great. peak hours are dreadful sometimes can be hard on your feet"
good,"Fast paced, long hours. Good benefits though. You have a chance to advance once you’ve worked there for a year. It’s a good place to work at. The pay is decent as well."
good,it was fun working there its just stress full. The managers there are great some of them are not so great.. after while of working at amazon you will hate it depends of the job you get.
good,Overall the company can be a great place to work for someone.  Having an excellent benefit package is a real bonus.  The day is long and busy.  In my opinion 30 min lunch is too short for 10 shifts.
good,"hours are crazy , stand upon feet 10 hrs straight . feet kill you at the end of day . you get two breaks one unpaid one paid . they have a shuttle bus to take you to work and from work ."
good,"It is a good place to learn and grow but the only con is the work life balance, in fact it can also depend on the team. They do pay well. Can be considered to work."
good,"Pour une première expérience professionelle, cela m'a permis de vraiment mettre un pied dans le monde du travail."
good,Work closely with employees and drivers on shipping dock. Manage  day to day outbound dock. Help stack packages in trailers. Give daily reports to upper management.
good,Hard hard work but pays off.  If you get hired and leave after taking the free education DONT TAKE THE BUY OUT.  Amazon will rule the world someday lol.
good,"Prep Receive, rate, Problem Solve, Safety, Customer Obsession, is our #1 goal; meet our productivity goals nightly, friendly atmosphere, work hard, have fun, make history"
good,"I am satisfied with my job at Amazon. While it is a rather boring and slow-paced job, it is really nice having a flexible schedule where I can pick my own shifts. Pay is fair for the nature of the work, and coworkers are so-so. Some are very nice but many have a bad attitude and some have even been let go for stealing merchandise from the company."
good,"This is a ok job, I left for a better opportunity in management at another job. I was only working for Amazon warehouse for about 6 months.  I left the job on a 2 week notice"
good,It is fun to work with good culture and support. Colleagues are supportive and have good positive vibes in and around the campus. Learned about dealing with different customers.
good,"safety first, until it impedes production was the unwritten motto; most of the managers are good, but Amazon like many others place more emphasis on the degree than the actual ability to lead people"
good,Amazon is a great company to work for. It can be stressful sometimes but overall it may be worth it. The benefits are awesome. The time off that they give you is great and there are alot of different options .
good,Amazon was a customer focused facility and safety was a big part of the job. The manager did a sufficient job at keeping the facility and the workers inside safe. The shared good communication about any changes or concerns within the facility. They rewarded top performing employees each week for their handwork and dedication. Amazon offered great benefits and a chance to grow and work your way up within the company.
good,"Good growth and perks"
good,"My managers and coworkers at Amazon are fun and helpful. The job itself is very physical and fast-paced, which I personally enjoy. The hardest part of the job other than getting used to the physical labor, is that it is sometimes repetitive which can get boring. You can always ask to switch to another work station if you want to try something new."
good,"If you can handle the stress and looooong hours, this job can take you out of poverty. You are a number. The pay is decent and livable. The hours make it hard to plan anything at all on your work days."
good,"I was hired as a Delivery Driver in July of this year.  After about the third week of working I was bitten by a tentants dog, I reported it to my supervisor but he was not helpful in assisting me with a claim. I contacted CERNX with no help from them either.  I had to go to hospital for 6 days because i got a infection.  I kept trying to contact them to no avail.  So I ended up with a hospital bill and no job."
good,"I have adapted well to the job at Amazon. Training is sufficient. There is no conclusive answer about transitioning from temporary seasonal to permanent even though I have exceeded expectations there. I would take a permanent position but nothing has been offered, the season is winding down, so I’ll look elsewhere."
good,Mostly working no room to fool around. Amazons millions of customers depended on us to get everything to them safely and quickly. Work days were long but they made it fun as much as possible
good,"although the pay is nice it has long hours and a lot is expected from new recruits."
good,"Doing my job was simple but the stress placed on everyone doing their best was rough, no appreciation. I was a hard worker always made top charts and building performance but not a day went by when they didn't expect more from me and everyone. Becoming overwhelmed by managers and pa's makes everyone uncomfortable and forces them to give up and leave."
good,"overall it was a good experience."
good,"Overall it was a good work in environment. Some of the co workers had mouths worse than salaries but that comes with the territory I guess. At Amazon I had paid time off that would acquire every month, paid vacation and unpaid time off. The good part about it was I didn't have to ask my manager to use paid time, I could just use it and leave work."
good,love holiday time. gave out christmas prizes threw peak. (busy time of year) working. rebin sorting work come down line into wall for packers to pack orders have to be hard working/every department has daily rate
good,"No frills job. They are honest and upfront about what you will do.  I did enjoy working there because I knew what to expect, but the super-human quick pace of walking around the warehouse is not for everyone so choose wisely."
good,It was a nice place to work. People were friendly and plenty of opportunity to learn new skills. I would recommend the working for them if you get the chance. I liked how I was always included with team activities.
good,Ok to be honest if you like to walk and be alone its great. be warned what i would really like to say they wont let me post so ill say this you get what your paid for
good,"great benefits great company ICQA inventory control , counting merchandise piece by piece for accuracy. Hardest part of the job is standing in one spot for 10 hours"
good,Fue bueno pero a mi no me gustaba el turno. Soy una persona. Que me gusta hacer diferentes cosas.
good,"I really enjoyed this job, but it contains a lack of communication between management and team leads."
good,"Clock into work at 7 am, complete your fast-start at 7:10, work until your first break at 9:30. Once you come back from break at 9:45 you work until lunch at 12:30. You get a half hour for your lunch break and your last break is at 3 pm. Your day is over at 5:30. If you interact during the day your shift goes by at a decent pace."
good,"Good company, but excessively strict with policy. No room for error or willingness to consider extenuating circumstances. Work environment is fast paced, but not unreasonable. Better than many other jobs in similar fields."
good,"Amazon makes you work like a slave,, but they provide you with a  good meal and drinks,, which are free, not free but its cheap enough to buy,, the longer hrs and the targets for picking your items are the worse because you have to climb stairs everywhere to pick the item "
good,"this is a place for people who consider themselves hard workers. you can work as many hours as you can (until you hit 60) they offer plenty of great benefits like health plans, company stocks, paid vacation days and paid time off,  but also you will be asked to work a lot of hours (10-12 hours day) with a very minimum crew..in general not a bad place to learn the business and to make some money, hard to make it a career..to move up you either have to relocate or just get the graveyard shifts"
good,"Die Arbeit an sich ist angemessen an die eigenen Fähigkeiten angepasst. Dazulernen geht schnell und kompetent."
good,Very good place to grow in a career move to management. Worked with really smart people. Would recommend to someone from college. Learned many things under decent leadership
good,"Constantly shifting, very unorganized management. Overall it was a great environment, there was a strong sense of community among the coworkers. Too many changes became confusing."
good,"Amazon is a great place to be. While the perks are not as great as some of the other FAANG companies, the work you do will revolutionize the world. "
good,"The day starts early typically about 7am you go to your station and you start pulling material from conveyer. the packages you are getting you are opening, inspecting, sorting, sometimes repacking, sending, and scanning the different items. "
good,One of the cool places to work with. One would get a lot of things to learn here.Apart from this if somebody wants to build the career in Customer Service has good number of opportunities.
good,Really good place to work just get used to being on your feet 10 hours a day. Walk between 2-15 miles a day depending on your position. Amazing benefits. The team you land in is what will make your amazon experience good or bad.
good,"The company overall was well developed, people friendly, plenty of breaks to compensate for the work. Management wise it was okay, needed some work but overall it was ok."
good,this job requires you to be or will make you become very lean and physically fit.. lots of walking at Amazon. you'll meet a lot of people so there's always something going on.
good,"Working for Amazon is good , however there is no job security , the targets are very high , and if you dont meet them will will be sacked. Very long hours."
good,"Working in Amazon gives a good exposure to a great work culture and positive environment to work. Best part is, you work wherever you fit. Skills and abilities are used to the core for your self-development."
good,"I enjoy what I do at amazon, at 1st it was a little obstacle but over the months I blossomed. I’ve been there for little over a year now an I plan on staying longer. I would recommend amazon to anyone."
good,"Amazon was very fast paced and fun, your always moving no time for slacking! "
good,Paid well work was incredibly fast pace and very competitive and could be very physically straining but had great benefits and all employees we treated fairly
good,I do love amazon but my biggest thing is that their pay is not competitive. I applied for a different job at amazon and was given the opportunity but the amount that they were offering was not enough for the type of job i was going to do and it wasn't cost effective for me to take it considering the distance. It is definitely fast paced. There is opportunity for overtime. It has benefits that start from day one. You also get stock in the company.
good,Almost 3 years stocks were great and all benefits were excellent. The transfer and promotion processes were very targeted toward younger associates and was not given enough opportunities or management coaching unless errors or time/rate
good,"Buena empresa, ambiente muy bueno, buen trabajo en grupo."
good,Picking items on a VNA going up on the vehicle up to 11 metres to hand pick customer orders. Using reach to truck stack or destack items and using all safefy measures.
good,If you like working in fast paced work place this is the job for you if don't like that i do not recommend this job too you but the job is nice you get to meet all different types of people and you can learn a bunch of different stuff working there.
good,"It's a good place to work for. It's slow and gives good work life balance. Leadership at top level is great. Mid level leadership tries to emulate top level, but often falls short."
good,"I've been employed at Amazon since July 2017 working part time."
good,It involves a lot of walking and the mangement is not concerned with your health. Plenty of people have passed out due to the horrific conditions they ask you to work under.
good,"The working area was a pretty decent one, the people easy to get along with, the management well and working. Only downside is if you don't fit in with their hierarchy they will get rid of you."
good,It was a pretty simple forward job. All I had to do was move boxes and put them where they were suppose to go. The boxes where put on a convery built and I would just take them of and tape them up.
good,"i worked in Amazon for one year ,it's fun to work there but don't expect it will be easy. it's long hours shifts and they check your productivity every day,so if your not catching up with your rate don't expect to last there for long time, they pay really really good with amazing benefit  and stocks."
good,"The job was very physically demanding and would not be fit for someone who can not continuously bend, squat, or walk for a long period of time. You were not allowed to keep your electronics with you in the inner lunch room."
good,"It was a work out for me , I like the environment and the position I was assigned. I learned how to communicate better and  never give up on yourself no matter how hard it is."
good,"I like that I can choose what shifts to work and there is usually plenty of shifts to choose from if you have availability. I think there is a good work life balance because choosing your shifts allows to to work around a full time job or family obligations. I also love the 10% discount. (The discount caps out at $1,000 per year)"
good,Great company to work for but is poorly managed. Great benefits and 401k and stock options. I would definitely suggest Amazon to a friend or family member. Hard to balance work and home life.
good,"Équipe encadrante motivante et dynamique "
good,Associates are allowed a lot of freedom to manage their own time. It's imperative that associates come focused and prepared to work. Proper hydration and attention to quality is essential to a successful tenure.
good,"Great company to work for provided you are a self starter and know how to prioritize a work load to deliver value quickly.  Given the opportunity to drive and own products while driving results.  My downside, travel."
good,The environment was great especially when all motivated. Really a team atmosphere and loved working in the shipping department.  I was sad to leave my co-workers.
good,a typical day at work is fast paced and you do a lot of bending.i learned that you have to pay attention to detail doing this job.Management does rounds to ensure that everybody is doing ok at there station.
good,Its a big plus to know spanish because many of the drivers barely speak english. I would advise learning basic spanish before applying for a job at amazon.
good,Great place to work. Everyone is Nice and easy to get a long with. The work/life balance is great when it's not Peak Season. You never really have managers breathing down your neck when working.
good,"Lots of good benefits, pays decently, demands a lot of your time, rewards those who actively try to do well, learn more and move up.  If you work hard every day you succeed, all employee progress is tracked closely using information systems, those who don't meet minimum quotas usually don't stick around long, but you usually need to be actively trying not to work to do this."
good,"Scan packages to designated pallets. Build the pallets up got shipping. Shrink wrap pallet when packages reach a certain height. Close the pallet out, set aside to be placed in the truck to be shipped. It is fast-paced area. Its required to scan 3 per/minute which also requires a scan rate of at least 170% a day."
good,Very busy place to work for. As long as you remain on task and do your job there should be no problems. This job gives you good opportunities in advancement and career choice.
good,"You do have to meet a rate for your work but it's pretty reasonable. You work a LOT of overtime around Christmas, but it's pretty rare the rest of the year, so it's actually a pretty decent place to work if you have a family."
good,"I would love to work there again, with more pay and benifits and incentives would be nice. i would recomend my friends and children to work there one day"
good,"If you are looking for a workplace environment that promotes the success of the group over the individual, this is not the company for you. Great opportunities for young professionals to learn first hand about logistics and delivery systems in the real world."
good,"The job was fine, however, to many people walking around during the shift. There were people, who worked and were diligent of there job. Good people overall."
good,"The CHA-1 location of Amazon is not a good place to work. There are few managers that actually care and if you have to take leave, you have to watch carefully when coming back. This particular location has issues with inputting leave correctly, so it shows up as UPT and that usually gets you terminated."
good,"Amazon believes in the theory of Its Still Day 1. And it really feels as if it is day 1 at Amazon, there is a fresh new challenge everyday. There is something new to learn every day. But this every day change also means that the processes do change everyday which can be a bit irritating."
good,"Amazon is a fun place to work at, there are no mandatory formal dress codes and hence and has a cool and friendly environment. We are paid for the overtime here if we work for long hours."
good,"Long Days at work."
good,"Amazon is a great place to work. If you do research you'll see several negative reviews about working there. It's all about the department you work for. If you work for AMZL you may find it frustrating, but keep in mind that Amazon is still in its early years in developing that department. That not only means that there will be several changes in processes and procedures. There will be several changes in leadership and leadership styles."
good,"On your feet for 9 1/2 hours, pretty tedious and physical work. It's interesting to see how the process of ordering off of amazon works. Very little chance for advancement, unless you plan to stay there for several years."
good,Body aches at the end of every week from the long hours of standing but I had expected it to happen do to my back injury. Most people didn't mind the standing but were drained by the end of the week. Pay was decent but didn't have time to do anything outside of work other than sleep.
good,"Amazon is fast paced with a focus on metrics to meet and exceed weekly goals. It instills a competitive mindset that pushes you to consistently work hard. Management changes are frequent as shifting priorities often require new hands and attention put to them."
good,"As a whole, Amazon is a fine place for entry level work. They give you the tools to do well in your role, but a lack of options for advancement is a big issue for me personally.I feel like in another area, with more openings, this wouldn't be an issue. For a temporary, relatively easy to perform job, Amazon Sortation is fine. Outside of that, it depends on your luck and what you intend to get out of it."
good,"Working nights was not the best decision, your night goes by terribly slow. I will admit it is a job for a certain crowd. "
good,Fun place to work at.  Alot of people work there.  Gets real busy during thanksgiving for holiday.  The insurance is real good.  Hours are ok.  The people are real nice
good,Basic factory work. I operated an order picker. The train the employees really well. Lots of room for advancement. The pay was more than reasonable. Very welcoming and fun working environment.
good,"The pace is fast and the work-load is overwhelming at times.  However, you work around some of the greatest talent in the world and their are a lot of opportunities for personal growth."
good,Amazon was my favorite job. The pay is amazing and so are some of the employees. Some were extremely messy though alongside management who took wearing that leadership vest too far and continued to pick with people until they got them fired
good,Company has a lot of  benefits which make up as a compensation for hourly pay they work with school schedules as well as very active in the community.
good,Great place to work if you are actually willing to work.  It's demanding and can be very rewarding. It's almost like a paid vacation when you get hired on from something more stressful.
good,"It was an overall fun environment, but it was also a tedious and cutthroat place of work. I enjoyed the long hours, but did not appreciate the working conditions."
good,"Very productive, the staff is pretty o.k with helping you wish question. Your days off however are a little iffy. For instance we were suspose to be off the upcoming holiday but were called in and told it was mandatory and could result in termination if we dont comply."
good,amazon overall was a good place to work if it is temporary. Great pay during holiday hours with over 20 hours of overtime a week. Managers can be very friendly and most of the time very positive and motivating. My main issue with amazon was that I really did not have a social life I worked days from 7:30 am to 6 pm so by the time I would get off I would be so exhausted from running around all day all around the warehouse that I could not meet up with friends. also if you weren't best friends with the head ops there really wasn't a way for you to move up.
good,"The best part of Amazon is every day is a day 1 in Amazon and along with work, Amazon also focus on Employee work life harmony which makes Amazon different from other employers."
good,"For the most part, I enjoyed working for Amazon.com. They had a great culture there. A very diverse group of people. I was promoted to be a Trainer and at the end of the hiring ramp up I was rolled back to customer service. I re-applied to be a trainer and didn't get the position but was told everyone enjoyed me as a trainer and didn't have a reason to not bringing me back on as a trainer. I left the company as it was time for me to pursue a job in the IT industry as that was what my schooling was in. Great company, there were great company parties and fun activities at the site. Many BBQs. We were well taken care of as we worked holidays. The major downfall was that micro managing was huge there and not necessary."
good,easy job just a lot of walking. typical day at the job would be unloading u boats into the queue and returning them to do the same thing. factory can get messy at times.
good,"Loved the fast pace of the job.  Had a lot of fun, but worked really hard.  This job isn't for lazy people.  Wanted to excel in the company but the commute wasn't worth the pay."
good,Buen trato hacia los empleados lo único las 10 horas son un poco intensa..Todo lo demás súper..
good,Working in the cafeteria school is fan because is for the children interacting with them not all day only at the time they come to the cafeteria for the mails.
good,"- Management is not great."
good,"Standing on a line stocking it was very straining on the body. A man collapsed from standing so long with no place to sit when you had a break he was a young man that I later heard died of a heart attack, very stressful environment the management team was always pushing to produce more in a 10 hour shift for $10 @ hr."
good,"I have learned to work in fast pace."
good,"no medical/dental, just a $100 a year discount on amazon.com. "
good,"A weekly pay schedule where all employees work part-time. This is the perfect non-customer contact job for college students, stay at home parents, retirees or basically anyone looking to supplement their income. The shifts normally run four hours five days a week and will require you to pull packages (boxes and envelopes) from a conveyor belt and place them on various designated pallets throughout the shift. You’ll work for two hours straight, then everyone at the same time will be required to take a fifteen-minute break and at the end of the break you will work another two hours straight. It’s a fast-paced simple task oriented job but it can also be physically demanding.  You are expected to stand for an extended period of time, be able to lift up to 50 pounds, squat and bend so you will need to be in a decent amount of shape. If you are grossly overweight, have a bad back, bad knees or bad feet I don’t believe this will be the job for you.  "
good,Depending on manager trying to sundown team can be a very difficult place to be.  First 2 years were incredible with chances fir improvement but when new manager came that all changed
good,You work long hours on your feet but the company tries to find fun ways to get through such longs shifts. It is hard to move up in this company but there is job security.
good,"Not a bad place to work for, work can be repetitive. Was a good job to have until I found another one. canteen was ok, not great though. loads of people work there, east to talk to people"
good,"good company to work for but strict on keeping your average up when receiving items; they give you snacks, recognize good job you are doing, They give VTO when slow and allow promotions"
good,Amazon is a very good place to work for people who like working on a line or doing repetitive motions. Benefits are great and the management always welcomes new employees with open arms.
good,"Obviously Amazon is doing something right. They take excellent care of their employees and run a great business. If it weren't for the fact that I no longer wanted to work 7pm to 5:30am anymore, I would be there."
good,Bon cadre de travail avec une bonne ambiance qui favorise le bon deroulement au travail
good,Work started with a pre shift meeting of the days expectation. Management was available to assist with the role if needed. The job was well diverse and it was fair as long as you did your job.
good,"I worked over nights, Work was easy. training was fast. was let go because I was seasonal and there was a lack of work 2 weeks before christmas. It kind of sucked."
good,Ambiente di lavoro giovane proprio per questo non fa pesare gli stressanti lavori specialmente negli orari notturni .
good,"Overall I would say working at Amazon isn't bad. I work 10 hour shifts, 4 days a week. Management can vary within departments. There is room for improvement if you want to move up. They have someone on site for safety or medical use if anything ever happens. They keep cold water, ice, and coffee onsite at all times to keep you hydrated and awake. The coffee comes in handy for the people that work the graveyard shift. I learned that in order to have a good working experience at Amazon, you have to invest in a good pair of shoes."
good,"standing for straight 10 hours or more, it fun working with different people from diverse works of life..the management is excellent and i learned being my first job in USA"
good,"Musique "
good,I enjoyed waking up to go to work. Going into work we stretched every morning in a group and talked about the work at hand. Picking is extremely easy and kept the day going. The worst part about the job was that most of the equipment we used to do our work was in need of repairs and you may have to travel to look for a descent cart to work with.
good,"Good workplace, great compensation as to benefits . fun employee environment. Hardest part of the job is making sure to always hit rate. Hitting rate can be hard when in stow. but overall a pretty easy place to be"
good,"Travail simple, ne nécessitant pas de qualifications particulières, si ce n'est une assez bonne condition physique."
good,"Not only was this place great work it was also a great j0b and you always had people willing to teach you, reach out outside of work, it was more of a family than a job."
good,"As for my experience, I, for the most part, enjoyed my time at Amazon. If you are looking for a good warehouse job, Amazon is not too shabby. The work days are long and somewhat drag on but the pay is good for the work expected from you."
good,The work place is very productive and fast past environment. They have great benefits and they even offer you stocks. They pay is very competitive and fair.
good,"Great place to work if you are enrolled in school.  "
good,Amazon has great benefits but very hard place to work. Very strict on breaks & meeting work goals. Employees are very friendly & willing to help. Great support & management.
good,I like to be a part of Amazon it is a big company though. But i like to experience new jobs new places. As I need saving to achive my goals. And i love to get together with new people to learn and experience new things in life.
good,"A day at work should consider everyone working together as a team and working to uplift everyone every day bases. it should also consider working hard so people build leadership skills. Management skills is patience working with others that work at a different pace The environment should be respectful towards other people. The hardest part about work is people keeping up with your work pace. The enjoyable day at work is when everyone is happy and works towards their best everyday, no excuses."
good,you have to decide to work hard in order to be here. the pay is encouraging. the long time of about 11 hours you have to be on your feet is quite challenging. though it depends on the shift you applied for. my manager is good. i resigned because of relocation. LGA7/8 is a good place to work.
good,"To work at Amazon is a pretty decent work experience. The pay is pretty good compared to other places, and you get benefits right off the back. The nagging points are that the shift can be boring, and there are some questionable management, but again is a pretty good work experience."
good,Amazon to me is a great company that I hope I can move up in and be apart of something great. Im an Ambassador at my site and just think the sky is the limit
good,"Amazon is a great place to work. There work culture is upbeat, and the facilities are usually great. The only drawbacks are the frequent mandatory overtime hours, and the amount of workers on the floor at the same time."
good,"Gets hectic but still manageable. Usually 4 to 5 hour works days and reliable set schedule days. They offer extra shifts when busy, or even voluntary time off your shift if not busy."
good,"Lazy Leadership team, and expendable associates. Money is great and the other associates are awesome. Work can be repetitive and the hours can seem very long."
good,A job people take up because it was what was available at the time of job requirement. Very stressful and with a lot of inexperienced first line managers.
good,"Come in every morning to do my route and it got harder as time went on. Management can be better, but overall it was a real good company to make money for."
good,"To make a long story short, its a great place and environment to work and make new friends. Great place to experience new and beneficial work ways and nice place to start off if wanting to make a living."
good,"Amazon was a great community, however working through the agency provided no job security and no benefits. We were constantly threatened with ""points"" going towards being let go, including requesting a sick day or going to a doctor."
good,They really care about their employees. The work can be a little hard sometimes but they do a good job of keeping the momentum. There is many opportunities to grow and move up in the company.
good,The pay at Amazon is very good .. The thing is that you will walk a lot.  Also the breaks are so small. If you get a fiftheen minute break it's actually like a 5 minute break since there is so much people in a rush.
good,Amazon expect you to work for your money which is not a bad thing. You work hard and the benefits are good with shares and full medical benefits. Pay is above the average for the roles
good,"Show up to warehouse and entry may be somewhat sluggish, after that it's simply going on your route as needed. Very difficult to pick up shifts but they are rolling out more reserved blocks for employees."
good,At Amazon the primary focus is to pump out as much product as possible and they have developed systems in which they maximize output. The job task is designed to be as efficient and as productive as possible and it succeseds in doing so.
good,A typical day at work you see a bunch of people learn everything fast everyones helpful most of the time. Learned how to become a leader and work at a faster pace than others. Hardest part of the job is probably lifting or moving the over weight things. The most enjoyable part is working as a team and achieving your goal
good,"I started out as a PT Prime Now associate at a new warehouse back in 2015 & honestly, it was a cake walk. The weekly pay, the family atmospehere. Unfortunately with this company certain locations do not offer part timers any benefits but others do. They all will specify beforehand. Also, it takes FOREVER (about 2 months) to hear back but I can guarantee that you will. So definitely not an option if you're looking to be hired soon. I eventually got promoted to full time and was transferred to a new warehouse and was eligible for benefits my first day. That is where reality hit. I was working overnight 10-hour shifts instead of 4 or 6 hours. The breaks were unrealistic (two ""30"" minute breaks throughout the night) but they would factor in your walk time so they were more like 20-minutes. A lot of walking so get at least 3 different pairs of comfortable shoes. Also, extremely strict about unpaid time and paid time off hours. If your upt fell below a certain number and you didn't have enough pto to cover it, bye bye. The full time pay is decent ($13-$16 depending on your role and the time of your shift) and you've got room to move up if you have some form of forklift training. Management is okay, just come in and do the job and you should be fine."
good,Working at Amazon for me was pretty cool. It can be stressful since its a production job. Rest and proper diet is a must. Stay hydrated and remain focus one mistake can cause a customers package not getting to them on time.
good,Amazon Logistics gave me the exposure to work with people from very diverse regions. The company was fast paced. They had proprietary systems that enable dthem to maintain order.
good,"Some people may argue with me about this but I believe that as hard as amazon employees are required to work they get pretty well compensated. It is why I will be applying again soon. They give people plenty of chances. The work is hard, it is not for the faint of heart, especially if you start on or near the holiday season. DO NOT expect an easy work day when the holidays hit, you will be sore and will likely feel sleep deprived if you have a family and work the night shift, personal experience. Again, it is good pay."
good,Weekly pay steady work week plenty of overtime large facility football fields​ long some area's three stories high. 15 minute breaks travel time included​ and half an hour lunches you get two 15 minute breaks!  Your production is carefully monitored can't slack off!
good,"Boa pra trabalhar,pagamentos sempre em dia."
good,"Hard work, long hours, diverse culture."
good,Amazon is a good business to get into if you have it in you to work hard then the money is there to be made. Only bad thing is you may not be guaranteed a permanent position.
good,"used a gun to scan items and then ship them. I also worked for the shipping department at AMAZON as well. Picking was great, it kept you in shape and you never stopped moving."
good,The customer care environment is very challenging to the core. You are to deliver accordingly in order to solve customer problems. I was always up on my toes and this was great experience
good,This was a contract job for Amazon through a creative agent. The Amazon clients that I worked with were both pleasant and helpful with any questions and requests from my end.
good,Fast pace and you have to make rate or you will be canned. Overall if you do what your are suppose to you will succeed at Amazon. there is potential for growth within. 10 to 12 hours of standing.
good,Amazon is a good place to work only issue is the fluctuation of management every couple months and the unorganized transitions. Majority of the associates are easy to work with even though some of them are young minded
good,nice job good environment I spend the season with them and I really enjoyed working with many different people and many different cultures and many different backgrounds.
good,Work place environment is very fast pace and you will need to keep up. The hardest part of the job is walking or standing very long periods of time. You learn to create friendships and rely on communication throughout the warehouse.
good,"Entreprise innovante focalisé sur la satisfaction client."
good,uwazam ze praca w amazon jest nawet ok ale szukam lepszych pieniedzy w innej firmie za granica
good,"amazon is a fun place to work, good hours, good benefits. you meet a lot of interesting people in the work place and peak season is very fast paced and fun to work."
good,Amazon was a good choice as I was in a bind and was getting overlooked by other employers. The work isn't terrible and you pretty much get what you put into it. Good for anyone who likes building blocks or legos.
good,"Strong sink or swim environment, need to be comfortable seeking help and advice as there is very little training. You are given a lot of responsibility from day one which can be very overwhelming but allows for a lot of growth to."
good,Some leads helped and others were too critical about speed over accuracy. The ones helpful would do their best to coach both expectations profeciantely while others far but few would continue to discourage employees that they manage about errors leading to termination.
good,"They pay management very well"
good,It is a good job in general. Just with balancing college and a fulltime night shift it is a bit hard. I find it quite challenging to be a full time student and work night shift. If it was day shift it would be a lot easier due to the fact that waking up at 5 a.m. Is a lot better than waking up at 3 p.m. Sleeping in that late just messes with your whole schedule.
good,"I came in at 5am every morning, left at 4:30pm. It's a lot of walking, which is fine, but I believe we should have either one more 10 minute break, or change both of the 10s to 15s. I was trained in every function, so it was nice to be able to do a different job every day. It keeps you motivated."
good,teammate is able to learn new things everyday however unable to advance if teammate doesn't have education. able to travel within the DHs and get massive training in all fields.
good,"Top many hours of work concentrated in a few days, espacially in the business peak period. Anyway, young work environment with skilled and trained people."
good,It's a cool job I liked my co workers very funny and easy to get along with managers are friendly wish they had better benefits I would go back if they raised the pay
good,"This job was great if you could keep up the pace and didn't mind working with 300 other employees. I picked and sorted orders, operated a wrapping machine, a baling machine and overall enjoyed it most days."
good,Needs more staff to fulfil promises. There are some really attractive benefits for working at Amazon. Jobs are easy in some departments and harder in others.
good,"No work stress manageable targets."
good,"Its a wonderful experience working here and it help you build yourself, the management structure is perfect, there is no discrimination in the culture and the hardest part of is none, the enjoyable part of the job is weekly paid"
good,good place to work is normally a lot of work and overtime available and they give you opportunities to learn different machinery and different jobs around the warehouse.
good,"Amazon Prime Now Associates in San Diego, Ca are all part-time and limited to 24 hours a week max unless there is need & specified by management. Management is intent on keeping Amazon Prime Now Associates on part-time schedules and have been very clear about this."
good,Overall the work here is fine but a little pressure and work load .. Salary is less than the load and pressure is in the control room operator job.....
good,Nothing about the job is difficult and it is not much to meet the scan rate goal they ask for. Shift starts off with A short briefing of the work load followed by stretches. The work is not difficult to do but the hours are short only four hours a day on average for part time. On occasions there are opportunities for extra work but they a far and few between. The dental and vision is great for only about 20 hours a week and the pay is decent at $12/h. The management could be better and a little more open when they decide to change things on the fly. Overall a pretty good work plaace. My only complaint or the few hours outside of holiday.
good,Good place to work within the area. Lots of opportunities to progress. Every day can be different depending on what you do.
good,"Have to constantly be working to meet ""goal"". Hardest part of the job was the constant work rate although did make time go by faster."
good,Was a very fast paced environment. A lot of people complain about keeping up with rates and the miles of walking. I didn't mind it. As long as you're not lazy and keep a steady pace you're fine. Easy job just ridiculously long hours and short breaks.
good,"It is a great place to work as the work culture is really good. "
good,"I worked for Amazon from my home, once a week we had a conference call and connected as a team. "
good,worked there for about 6 weeks for Christmas. enjoyed the work wasn't that bad just had issues with other things that is too much to go into on here. although not amazons fault more the company I worked under.
good,"I enjoy working at Amazon but they are frequently demanding and management can at times be unprofessional. I enjoy what I do at work, I'm usually a packer with a rate between 230 units per hour and 270 per hour which is above the goal of 230. I also enjoy my fellow coworkers they often make my day enjoyable."
good,"Good place to work especially for new comers, and people who want to work for short times. its hard for people with family due to the working schedulle"
good,"It was a internship that ran on. there was no raises hours where first come first serve. Amazon had no benefits, but you get a discount ."
good,"The job is great, with plenty of hours in the week to work. However, the job became very repetitive, and boring after a while. I was always performing well in all the jobs that I performed, but there is no real room for raises or promotions."
good,Over all this is a good job especially if you have no skills and are seeking to learn something about big business and management. This was a job where you only got what you put into it.
good,"travail physique avec peu de pause. "
good,"If you are lazy, no career goals, or just looking for a pay check Amazon is not for you. I personally enjoy the daily challenges and for the most part look forward to working with the employees. It is rewarding when you play a part in someone being promoted due to your mentoring."
good,"I always thought the advertisements for warehouse jobs at amazon should be loose weight, get paid, work at amazon. They sincerely want you to have fun but its no fun. Its a job. A physically demanding job but they are nicer than most employers and they sincerely appreciate your hard work. Pay is competitive for non union jobs. You have to be able to not sit for 10 hours except for 2 fifteen minute breaks travel time included with means your sit down time is about 4 minuts and a 30  minute lunch break is more like 20. Dont eat heavy and get used to cold type foods. There are not near enough microwaves for 6000 people even though there are 2 lunch shifts. Dont plan on eating every day in the snack area, its expensive. And the refrigerators get cleaned out if your on overtime they(the janitor contractor does not care). they through away lunch kit and all. I lost a debit card and a transit card that way. And no cell phones and no time to go to your locker. Why did I do it? I am 62 years old. Amazon does not ask for the year of your birth on the first application. I was successful till i was injured. If you can do better do so but for us that have to do manual labor to eat. If you can push your boots that hard its the best you are going to be able to do. So plan on staying in school. Oh and the health insurance is fabulous."
good,"Amazon is good place to work.If you plan on being there for a while to become one of the big bosses & want to move up in the company, then get ready to travel."
good,"Good morale, employees are treated well, management is very approachable and engages with employees. Work is very fast pace and work output is closely tracked, consequences for not meeting output goals."
good,"Clock in, do your job effectively, clock out, get paid weekly. You must keep a fast pace & be accurate in order to not get written up. Once let go you will have to wait 90 days before you can get rehired."
good,Nice job. Good pay. Friendly staff. Nice work tempertures. Nice benefits. Oppurtunities for advancement. Extra money.
good,"10 Hour days with guaranteed 40 hour weeks, not to mention starting out at $12.00 an hour. I honestly had a pretty positive experience with Amazon. The only problem really was lack of communication between HR and Management. Also the physical strain that comes with the job."
good,"We should working more than 10hr , This is so long time to working on place. "
good,"Belle expérience, j'ai beaucoup appris."
good,Fun and engaging place to work at! Very diverse aswell with many positions to apply for!! Although in my honest opinion some policies within the facilitie seems a little to harsh or strict in some way it still stands out from many other places(positive way)
good,"Fairly good pay, opportunities to advance your carrier. "
good,This isn't a bad job but it is slow paced and there isn't any room for growth in the company. My job is to count bins all day and its just tedious. The people are nice and friendly. I just want to find something where I can move around more.
good,"On a typical work day we are assigned a place to go by management. Management will listen to you if you tell them that you need to take a break, but keep in mind that every position has rate that needs to be met."
good,It was fast paste and sometimes very demanding but it paid off the notebooks you did. Good benefits killdeer meals and drinks. Paid holidays and double overtime pay.
good,A good place to work with your friends and socialize. You can get away with doing nothing and the managers are pretty relaxed.
good,learned to managed the time and hard working spirit with new customers specialisation in communication skills with new peoples
good,"Productive work environment that has a good balance between fun and work. Would recommend a level 4 job and above. Amazon will also pay for school, how cool."
good,"Trabajo organizado y bien estructurado. "
good,Amazon was a great place to work the only hard thing was that hours got messed up and complications arose from that. I think that it would be a great job for someone with flexible hours.
good,"fun work place,meeting new people from all backgrounds and culters .learnig how to use hand held scanners also getting to know how a warehouse operates from receiving goods,picking,packing,and shipping to the customer"
good,amazon warehouse was pretty simple job that moved in fast pace. management was fair the where always around to help. Just long work hours and not enough break time or time off.
good,Aside from the slave hours that they demand you work its actually not a bad job to have. The benefits are worth it. The pay is good and its really relax there.
good,"The pay was above average, but the hours were long and short term basis. The other employees were great to work with.  The drive to and from work was long."
good,"Company was a great start for someone getting into the tech field.  However, advancing beyond desktop support to network engineer is very difficult.  Amazon requires certificates, but fails to provide any training to assist in growth.  Most have to use their own time to go to school and often school schedule exceptions get denied for ""customer demand""."
good,"pros:"
good,Very hard work and difficult to stay in the job. Because work distribution is not proper you get tired and simply leave the job.
good,Great fast paced job. Always need to be alert and focused. Nice management team and room for growth. Tuition reimbursement programs and a diverse environment
good,Everyday was pretty much the same and simple. I've learned how to use scanners and work with inventory. Management and coworkers were all really friendly and fun. Easy to talk to when needed. There wasn't really anything hard for me because everything was self explanatory. Maybe just lifting anything over 30-40 lbs. The most enjoyable part about the job was making sure every order was correct and making the customers happy.
good,"Amazon, is a decent company to work for. There isn't really any opportunity for advancement though. I would recommend this job to someone just starting out of high school."
good,You have to work hard to move up here at Amazon and may take longer than most people realize but everybody is very friendly which makes the job worthwhile.
good,"It was quite a diverse work place where many different people with completely different personalities could come together. For some it was a stepping stone before something else for others it was gainful employment. The hours were long and at insane times of the day, well rather at night and early morning. Days off would fall on days you would not want them to fall on since in the week you couldnt spend it with anyone. The work was beautiful at some times at others it was satans butt hole and made you want to crawl under your desk and die or even kill someone. However the experience was enough for me, for as long as it lasted and it is not something I regret doing."
good,"Aprende-se a trabalhar de forma eficiente, a pensar no longo prazo mas a atuar no curto prazo tendo sempre o consumidor em mente. Os dias são intensos em reuniões, e todos os colaboradores são muito inteligentes, mas as ações são efetivas e há um ambiente de ambição e de melhorar os processos existentes muito acentuado."
good,Work week was comprised of four ten hour work days with three days off. During the holiday seasons normal work days increase varying based on demand between five to six days with twelve hour shifts. Physically the job was very demanding.
good,"Una volta dentro e fatta la formazione iniziale avrete una mansione, sta a voi vedere di imparare altro che vi interessa, avranno poco tempo per insegnarvi altro quindi se non lo fate probabilmente avrete la stessa mansione ogni giorno."
good,"I enjoyed working for Amazon they are a amazing company in general and to work for. I really had a experience, the fast pace work always kept you busy which made the 10 hours shifts not seam so strenuous."
good,I love working for this company even thou the position was seasonal makes it a short team assignment. You get to meet great people and even have customers that you can help over the phone. The best part about this job is that you work from home and get you do not have to deal with traffic and you can even work in your pajamas lol. I learned so much from this company especially how to deal with situations with customers and how to multi-task in different challenges that you face.
good,"This a great place to work for hourly employees. Management not so much. UPT policy, that is given to hourlies, definitely affects scheduling and bottom line production"
good,"nice place to work but you can`t plan your own time as you never know where you gona go and what time you will finish job"
good,"It is a Huge turn over company. I enjoyed working there but when you find your niche to stay in that area"
good,"As an intern, I had a wonderful mentor who walked me through the design process for creating a product concept that I got to pitch to Amazon leadership at the end of my internship. Alongside working on my main project, I also got to contribute to my team's current in-flight projects. While the intern culture wasn't as strong as other corporations I interned at, the work experience was very valuable and I had a lot of support from my team."
good,"The job is tolerable, they send people home even when they don't want to randomly, which is one the most disappointing part.  The supervisors keep telling you to do things that you are already doing, like just to be bossy.  So instead of encouraging them to work faster they instead gives you a tone that dictates them to go faster.  There are certain jobs that inherently taken by older workers there that are not that physically demanding, which is unfair because we all work there with similar job positions yet they always get the same position.  There are a lot of complaints inside the work from all other workers, and other than that, the job is monotonous most of the time."
good,"I worked at Amazon during peak time. Therefore, the job was very physically and mentally demanding. Overall, an easy job if strong willed in being continuously active."
good,I was really a nice time at my workplace. I was the top performer in my department and the only thing which I did not like about the company is that they hire employees for short time only like for 3 to 4 months. No one can join again once you are fired without any reason. Future is not safe in Amazon Company of anyone.
good,"Starts with mind set. Mentally, difficulty level low, physically can be demanding. Entry level pay low. Benefits are outstanding. Typically a 4 day work week @ 40 hrs. PTO, Vacation AND Unpaid time (UPT) available. Managers and employees are a revolving door, turnover is extremely high. Communication failures constantly. Lunches are only 30 minutes for a 10 hr work day. Two 15 minute breaks are included, but you really only get a third or half of that due to the distance it takes to walk to breakrooms, outside, etc. People are generally friendly."
good,"worked hard reached  personal work goals"
good,"I enjoyed getting to work in the warehouse, I met a lot of awesome people. I learned so much of the processing and problem solving for the inbound department. I provided support for the new hires and the current associates as I fixed problems in the warehouse."
good,Its a good place to work if you dont mind running your feet off for 10 hours a day. Just be careful about rate. It can be hard work or easy depending on what department you work in.
good,Working for Amazon was a great experience for me. The job offered lots of overtime and the people were fantastic. I would recommend anyone to seek employment with the company. I would definitely return.
good,"I onboard new vendor in Amazon. We buy products to resell on our platform. People are nice. We have medical insurance, and meal voucher. There is a Stock option plan for managers. Unfortunately, shares are given very rarely."
good,"Working for Amazon taught me to be very proactive, as tasks can overlapped, so its best to anticipate what will happen down the road."
good,"Everyday begins with a group stretch for each department which has the manager announcing the amount of freight, its quality, and work expectations for the day. There you learn how to maintain a steady pace and a high quality performance. Managers expect the best from their employees for the quality can grant incentives and rewards. Employees range in various ways from ethnicity, age, and location. People commute from all over the state to work. It's difficult to move, pick orders, and maintain a high quality rate for the job duty. Employees are constantly on their feet and moving quickly. The most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that employees actually gain friends and are able to be social while accomplishing the daily goals set by management."
good,"Work 10 hour shift , that consist of walk and doing other activities. I work four days a week and i travel about 20 miles daily to get back and forth to work. It can get hot in the warehouse ."
good,"Steady employment with excellent benefits. I held steady employment both full time and part time for 10 years. Departed "
good,"it was a job. Good pay, awesome healthcare. Also, really liked the diversity of people that work there. Diversity is great"
good,good learning in field for e-commerce.Overall it was good to be a part of company.Management needs to be moere effective.
good,"Amazon is a great place to learn about process improvements and develop a diverse portfolio of experiences. As a long term career, definitely a tough job. Work life balance is poor and would be ideal for a person starting out without a family."
good,amazon is a hard working fast pace environment with good benefits. and them training you to do your specific job is actually really good you will be doing hands on activities your very first day of orientation. also your co-workers are awesome people who help you without hesitation if you have any questions at all. furthermore management is good but not excellent they help only when times are rough but other than that they have other things to worry about other that there employees. and through my training and experience on what I've learned is that they do take time to show u the next step in becoming certified in specific areas. they even take u to a class to teach u the material and even give u tests on the material and if u pass then you get certified and if u don't they re teach you I rather enjoyed that part of the job learning something new always motivated me to be better and push higher. but the hardest part about the job is its fast pace environment and demand to meet dead lines within a time frame. but all in all not a bad place to work.
good,"Amazon is a wonderful company to work for benefits-wise, but the shifts can be extremely overwhelming at time. There is little room for personal growth and eventually you begin to feel like a drone."
good,"A typical day at Amazon was to follow zoned work assigned thoroughly and stay on task, no short cuts. Management and co-workers were good. The hardest part about this job was physically adjusting to the late hours. The most enjoyable characteristics of this job was interviewing, hiring, training and having daily meeting with the team. I enjoyed working under Nick Carlson."
good,"Management is good, work life balance depends on your manager though. Fast paced exciting environment. Co-workers are all great people and hard workers. Typical day at work is a lot of emails and meetings mixed with small chunks of time to get work done."
good,"nice staff and coworkers"
good,work day is 10 hours shift with two short breaks and a launch break that help increase productivity. Team spirit in performing our task was fun
good,"buen ambiente de trabajo."
good,"This place of employment is not bad for those who are looking for a resume booster. There are my skills that can be learned within this organization. There is limited room for growth, and management is not up to par. Changes can be made."
good,"A typical day at work was very busy and most of the time productive for most but also very tiring."
good,"The work was fairly monotonous from a day to day perspective, there was very little variation in duties and little opportunity to advance in pay or position while also extreme continuous stress on the body so i was forced to quit do to and injury that reoccurred due to the strenuous activity. The co workers were friendly but temporary and the job was ultimately undesirable."
good,good staff to work with.good hours.job security not garunteed and can be very harsh with hiring and firing policies.typical day is long but work is repetative and day goes very quick.i enjoyed this job
good,Le poste que j'ai exercé a Amazon consistais a preparer les commandes des client. C'étais très physique mais plutot  agréable.
good,I only worked there for the Christmas period. I found them a reasonable employer. The work was demanding but satisfying. I would work there again if there was a fulfilment centre closer to me.
good,I am a very harder working go hard or go home I put both my feet on the floor and provide you have to get it your all when your working I have never let down boss while im at work
good,I like Amazon it just be slow nights and not  alot of work overnight that can get a little frustrating and we only get a 30 min lunch and we work 10 hr shifts.
good,"Amazon is a great company to work for.   It is challenging, it is demanding, but it is very rewarding in the end.  You will become a better Leader if you join the Amazon team."
good,I would still be there if amazon would have kept things the same as zappos when they took over.  with zappos things were more laid back and you didn't feel like you were walking on egg shells all the time.  with amazon you were also afraid they were going to fire you if you didn't hit production for a day.
good,"This company is great, working your way up is why Amazon looses so many amazing people. I do feel it is a great work life balance, but even if I worked harder my efforts wouldn't be recognized or appreciated from a fiscal perspective."
good,loading van sorting out paper work delivering parcels.i also was dsp there sorting routes out solving problems out with drivers helping drivers load van
good,The hardest part of the job were the short breaks we received. The schedules were great depending on what best suit your week
good,Working at amazon was okay. It was hard maintain because I never worked at a warehouse before but I got used to it. I learned how too multitask more and how to work in a fast-pace environment
good,The job is decent it just seems to be more suitable for high school/ college students that rent responsible for families.
good,It was a very simple job i was able to work on my own and interact with other team members. the hours were long and your feet would ache from all the walking but it was manageable .
good,At times the work load is immense. Rather than splitting it they employ less people and give a day off to the rest hence the workers find it very difficult to cope with it.
good,Very productive place to work for. A lot of over time available. Also may be given the opportunity to travel. Overall it was a good company to work for.
good,"At Amazon, learnt many things about e-commerce, how customers buy and sell online. And how important customers are for the company. Learnt the full meaning of Customer is the King. Cool company to work with. "
good,"Long hours, i learned a lot of new skills, my co-workers were always there to help, the hardest part of the job probably was trying to carry heavy boxes whilst doing long hours, i enjoyed meeting new people and picking from the boxes and variety of other things."
good,"i really disliked the company and how they treated employees , it was not a good work enviorment"
good,"Ci sono tante cosa da imparare dal primo giorno, la efficenza e la automazione e presente da per tutto, i colleghi di lavoro sono molto bravi questo genera una piccola competizione al lavoro, che senza renderti conto finisci per lavorare di piu."
good,The job consisted of alot of getting use to standing for 12 hours a night 5 days a week. The lunch room was nice because it had alot of vending machines and the people were nice
good,"Agradavel sempre,mas exigia mais do que aquilo que nos ali poderiamos fazer faltava um pouco mais da gerencia em olhar mais para as coisas do que exigir ,valorizar faltou"
good,"I was a seasonal employee and never really had a chance to stay on longer than a month or two, but I look back on my time there fondly."
good,"This company offers a good salary for an easy work which can seem sometimes too monoton, depending on the position one has."
good,"I have worked for Amazon three times. I was a temp twice, and an Amazonian once. I've had 5 different managers throughout those 3 times and my current manager  is the best. Amazon's turn over rate for hiring and terminating employees is extremely high. The work environment and work ethic all depends on which department you are in. The building has a system and if one department lacks then the whole building lacks and the flow is hindered and disrupted. Its a very difficult and time consuming  job, but if the great effort and hard work is implied by an employee, then there is room to move up and grow in the company. The saying at Amazon is ""The harder you work, the easier your job becomes."""
good,Great environment for managers to start their careers.  The pay is good but the ask for time is high so be prepared.  Good growth opportunities and the stock is exploding.
good,A very welcoming and friendly work environment. A continuous healthy push to always be reaching above our personal and group targets. Very supportive management with monthly catch ups to personally push ourselves. Can be a bit harder to get a distant amount of hours when not working fulltime or in a managers position. Overall an enjoyable work environment.
good,The work is easy. The long hours with short short short breaks. it provides decent pay. strict strict time schedule. honestly not a bad company to work for there are worse places to work for.
good,A good job for someone young and not sure what they want to do with their life.  It'll give you some perspective on what work is and hopefully encourage you to want to go back to school.
good,"very fast pace job but some people wouldn't take it seriously and would procrastinate a lot, had 2 15 mins breaks and one 30 minute lunch break"
good,"has stable hours and fast paced."
good,"praca w niektóre dni bardzo odpowiedzialna, niestety szybka, w wielu miejscach, wiele ludzi wokół, bywają stresy, ale poprzez kontakt z dobrym managerem możliwość rozwiązywania problemów jak najszybciej oraz rozplanowanie obowiązków na wiele osób by wszystko sprawnie funkcjonowało."
good,Its a fun place to work at but has no full time opportunities and no health benefits. I am looking for full time hours. I love working with my co workers and the managers are pretty cool to work for. The work is pretty easy and not too difficult.
good,Was good to work with. Not a great career if you have a partner and you work on night shift. Work 40 - 60 hours a week.  It was good times even though the job sucked. It is an all or nothing environment so you either love it or you hate it
good,Good and excellent and I have enjoyed working there and it was a good experience learning things.great job culture. Wonderful working atmosphere.
good,Nice place to work. Just didn't have enough work available to maintain employment. People are nice. It's better to work the night shift. Days is available but the money is less. I prefer to work days.
good,I worked the night shift here it was kind of slow at first the drivers would come in get weighed fuel there trucks get there receipt then shower ticket and then they would leave I had plenty of time to straighten the shelves and clean the bathrooms wipe everything down
good,happy to work in amazon (ATS) but the sad point is i'm not a on roll payee and i'm from third party so these is the main disappointing thing from myside
good,"I sure like Amazon as it has a good work/life balance. I sure like the place of work, and would only leave it for a better place, meaning pay. "
good,"Typical day at amazon is a day full of high speed demand, coupled with fast paced learning and high expectation that can be rewarding for those individuals willing to commit themselves to their and their companies success.  The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the highest standards in one of the most fast paced companies in the world.  The most enjoyable part of the job is that in an environment that moves so quickly, so does advancement and opportunities as well."
good,"positive place to work, if you want to have fun and be around positive lively people, its for you. If you have a life outside of work, this might not be for you."
good,rotational shifts with good work environment and shift allowances. Fun while working to eliminate the stress of 9 hours long shift.
good,"Very high paced environment, especially around peak season. Expect to work 55-65 hours off peak and up to 95 hours during peak from thanksgiving until christmas."
good,"Amazon is a fast-paced, exciting place to work. I highly recommend anyone to apply. Management was strong and colleagues were great."
good,"Atypical day at work was very busy. At a constant rapid pace, you needed to pick up an order paper and get a cart, follow your scanner to the desired aisle in the warehouse and get the product. After retrieving the items on the sheet, you take your full cart and return it to the drop zone.  After you drop it off, you get an empty cart and start all over. I learned how to better manage my time to keep up with my rate. For the most part, management was nice.  They listened if you had any problems or suggestions, and tried their best to help. There were so many coworkers in the warehouse with me.  I didn't get to meet most of them, but the few friends I made were very great and helpful.  The hardest part of the job was being on my feet all day long.  You are constantly moving all over the warehouse, wherever the scanner told you to go.  The warehouse was very dusty and dirty as well.  A lot of coughing at times but the cleaning crew tried to keep up with it.  The most enjoyable part was having three days off in a row and making good money so I could do fun things on those days."
good,"Amazon teaches a diverse range of skills, everything from inventory control, packing and shipping, to driving heavy machinery. However, managers worry only about their own advancement and bonuses, not caring much about employees. The hours are only good if you manage to get a day shift of 4 10's, otherwise you have no chance of having a 'life', especially if you work nights; your entire world will revolve around Amazon and sleeping. The pay, however, is pretty good."
good,Not Bad at all.  Just some of the management only thought for themselves and not for the good of the group or the company.  I worked there for a little over 6 months but for whatever reason I was never offered an opportunity for advancement or any chance at a pay raise.  Other than that I liked my job there at Amazon.
good,"It is my first job in UK, I like it but It is a bit difficult for a woman."
good,Its a ok company to work for but is not a job for everybody there is some good things about this company an there is some bad there is nothing more to say about this company thank u
good,"I'd like working in Amazon first of all because of the Multicultural place, that gave the opportunity to joint with people with different cultures and skills, origin and experiences."
good,"I worked the night shift. You go in. Do the assembly line in about 10-12 hour day. Get around 3 breaks, two short ones and 30 minute lunch one. Do what they required then clock out."
good,"The work was hard, but there was always something new you'd learn each day. I learned a lot about different people, their cultures, the processes of each department and about the management."
good,"lots of encouragement from management, hours are long but if you enjoy your job and team, it will be worth it. Management is easaily approachable."
good,"I learned communication skill, and I adjust to work in night shift also, co-workers also good and supporting me.but week-off,and leaves is not available."
good,"Every day is a new day at Amazon.We have to support US employees as a part of our job.I have learned many things like how to behave in corporate,how to move with people,how to prioritize work,delegate work,Time management.Most important thing is to satisfy our customer."
good,i think amazon is great for seasonal work cause they treat their employess like trash and lett the vets that been there go but they reward everybody even the temps not just the hired on folks but the managment team iss bad the breaks are terrible stand all day on hard concrete and u only get two 10min breaks and 30min lunches but when its slow they will let you leave if you would like too but they treat you like you a kid tell you you cant talk and the medical issues is terrible how they do to do when the dr gives u days off cause of an injury i was fired due to a misunderstanding between HR and managemnt team and FMLA
good,I did a variety of jobs during the week. It is a great place to work and a lot of different job functions. Management was good communication could be better. The hardest part of the job was the constant standing and commuting back and forth to breaks.
good,"Amazon is one of those jobs that you don't need much to do to get through the day. Only some good running shoes and subject that will keep your mind busy for the day since electronics are banned. not much to be trained on. Biggest downside is the no electronic rule and that your best bet on taking break is at your station or whatever your position is, but your checks are always nice."
good,"Good paymaster in the market, emplyee centric, provides transport, food, allowances."
good,A typical day was that I had to pick things off shelves. I learned how to work in a fast paste. It was a job that you had to work alone on. The hardest part of my day was having to walk in a fast paste. I enjoyable part of the job was getting to work fast.
good,typical day was 8 oclock until 6-30 I was mainly receiving goods counting them and scanning them into system  also stowing goods onto shelved there was targets that had to be met so you were keep busy all day which was good. Supervisors were good with me and co workers were fine as well. The hardest part of job was making targets but I met them no problem.
good,A very intense place to work and also very hard. It is a job for younger people to thrive at because of the fast pace. I was there only about 2 months but when peak season started it just about killed me because it was 5 days a week for 11 hour days. The best part was the meetings before we went back to work after each break.
good,"I worked at amazon fresh inside a climate controlled warehouse. Picking and restocking products for online orders of Amazon Fresh I learned how an online store works from within. Management wise is ok. They are pretty much hands on, checking how your rate of production, going with yesterdays or the weeks performance. hardest part would be the cold, it was still hard to get used to how cold the place is. Enjoyed how they play music throughout the day."
good,Fun to work for but lunches are only 30 minutes and your there from 7:30 a.m to 6:30 p.m and you get two 15 minute breaks but you are walking from 4th floor to outside. Once you reach outside it is time to go back in. 15 minutes is including your walk time and you can not run.
good,"Unload trucks, scan items into totes, prep items"
good,a regular day for me at amazon consisted of walking about ten to twelve miles a night picking up the items that were to be delivered to the pack department packaged then shipped to customers.
good,"ambassador at amazon  lead at claridge . at amazon tell folks we got 30 min to clean  line H off , pushing positive out  telling folks your you all are awesome . now lets move to line J  an help them out ,we got 7 min an wow! its was done , you all done a great job , you are awesome  there is a way to talk to folks to make them work harder. management pulls all ambassadors aside to find out how things are going.  co workers love my positive  feedback  then other ambassadors. hardest thing is nothing (can do attitude ) . enjoy working with folks"
good,"They provide additional training for employees seeking additional training, who are doing well within their current role."
good,"picking, packing and sorting orders.  Its hard to gain any kind of advancement.  The management is good and are easy to talk to.  The co-workers are hard workers."
good,journée de poste soit matin soit après midi soit nuit un travail fatiguant car la possition debout et fatigante mais une ambiance dans l'entreprise qui nous fait oublier les points négatif. les managers très a l'écoute.
good,"- Routinearbeit"
good,seasonal work only worke though the holidays. was not able to get the shift i needed to work.
good,A goal for how much is needed to get done is set at the beginning of every night. Each person is assigned a job which is displayed on a white board at the start up area. The people are fun to work with and most have a positive attitude. The hardest part of the job is trying to stay busy. the most enjoyable part is getting to know new people. Management is ok. I feel they could be more of a part of the team and walk around more to see how things are going.
good,"The environment is good to learn new things and a great place to start carrer."
good,It was one of the best jobs I had it was a Productive place with a lot of nice people but the only own fall was there unrealistic expectations are far as production.
good,Not enough time with family. Fast Pace job with little time to miss around.
good,"Friendly people, Physically easy job, various job places every day (you dont have to work all the time in the same place ) , nice canteen. Although you have to meet tight deadlines, and the breakfast menu in the canteen all the time is the same :/"
good,"A busy 10 hour day in which you do various duties.A lot of walking.Your job security depends on your accuracy and the speed at which you do you job.Amazon BNA2 stocks more than 18,000 items when it is at full capacity.Everyone works to achieve what makes Amazon famous,Customer Satisfaction.It is in a warehouse atmosphere but the facilities are well kept and well lighted.A good place to start into the workforce."
good,"El trabajo es duro y mas en el momento que participé yo,la gente superior y gente de la ett fué muy buena para que nos fuesemos adaptando al trabajo."
good,"A typical day at work would be clocking in, checking in with your managers to see where you will be stationed, and doing daily stretches. When your a picker you basically are in the same spot the whole day other than breaks and lunch. Amazon is a fun place to work. The holiday season they have a lot of employee incentives. Your constantly reminded of what a great job your doing."
good,"in a typical day i would normally be picking orders to ship to customers. management is good to its employees. some of the coworkers on order pickers shouldn't really be on one. there is not really a hard part about the job, except being on your feet for 10 or more hours a day."
good,"Good Company."
good,"I currently work as a Safety Coordinator. My typical day consist of reviewing policy's, investigating incidents to determine a root cause, coaching associates on at risk behaviors. I help management with any safety concerns they may have with a process. I get to work with some great people. I coordinate service and issues with our fleet vehicles as well as maintain DOT compliance for 3 buildings."
good,"Es una buena empresa con muy buen ambiente de trabajo y muy buen trato a los trabajadores. Como punto negativo resaltaría la conciliación familiar/laboral para los que tenemos hijos y el poco tiempo de descanso que te queda libre pero no me importó demasiado ya que tener trabajo es lo principal. Respecto al sueldo, está muy bien pagado."
good,"A typical day at work is tiring from the 10 hour days to lifting boxes all day every day with minimal breaks. "
good,"•	Mentored 2 Human Resources Interns."
good,Fast paced physical and mental job. High expectations and goals. Customer focused and safe
good,"I would generally pick items for customers but i would also at times be n the packing lines or in the shipping department."
good,A typical day at work consist of walking at a fast pace and placing merchandise in correct area so that it can be loaded on the trucks. My position taught me how to work at a fast pace and in a timely manner. My overall experience with management was good. Most co-workers are friendly and willing to help when you are confused. There isnt anything hard about the job. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to meet new people.
good,"Amazon is a good place to work and the culture is very laid back, but it sometimes becomes hectic when you may have to stretch in order to meet the SLA's"
good,"I started this institute and since it was my own very first business i had too many responsibilities to be taken care of simultaneously, from administration to syllabus designing and scheduling teachers. I learnt a lot from this."
good,"Work was Work position where I can utilize my excellent customer service skills and  "
good,Amazon fulfillment center has provided an opportunity to further extend my warehouse skills my management team changes constantly and I adapt to there protocol and meet there demands daily. My co-workers range in age also ethnic backgrounds and it creates a diversified atmosphere which is enjoyable. So far there has been no hard challenges I drive 50 miles each way so the 15 freeway is always a challenge(LOL).My work conditions are presented with a very good coaching and training staff. I enjoy the employment opportunity and continue to thrive stay motivated while meeting my rates and requirements daily I maintain the safety and quality customer satisfaction which they require from myself and want to advance in the company when given a chance.
good,A typical day would be processing online orders. The management was sometime helpful. The coworkers worked grat as a team.
good,"Me trouxe grandes experiências profissionais. Bom entrosamento com os colegas de trabalho, trabalho Social com o público maravilhoso, pois não à nada melhor do que ajudar uns aos outros."
good,"Warehouse -good people- constant employment"
good,"I learned to pack item's ordered, to regulation, ready to be shipped out."
good,Learned a lot. Was able to help with a couple major projects.
good,People are nice but the way the warehouse is run is not human like!
good,"Employees valued on output and productivity is the key to upward mobility as well as taking on extra projects."
good,"Good job, poor HR.  Overall great company.  Enjoyed my job but need to move back to IN."
good,"A typical day is never the same.  Things change rapidly at Amazon that you are always discovering new challenges. "
good,I enjoyed my time working there because i learnt a lot for the short period of time i worked there.
good,Amazon was based on results. this meant we had to work hard and make sure we met targets. we worked in groups most of the time which was great for team bonding
good,c'est un travail agréable sans trop de difficulté particulière
good,"I enjoy working in this company but they are only hiring when it's on peak season, good as a seasonal job."
good,"At Amazon you are given a lot of responsibility. However,the roles are not very challenging.  Additionally, there are many layers so it takes a while to get things done."
good,Exciting work and great learning experience. Lots of freedom to think independently and execute. Visibility to higher management
good,"Everyday, I was greeted by the nicest people that I've ever had the pleasure of working with. The people who answer the phones, and write the emails are genuinely as professional and caring as their emails would suggest. "
good,The environment was very good. People are very friendly willing to work with you. They supplied all the equipment. This work place is good for people who are willing to learn and great for people who are starting off their career.  The draw back it is a small time frame that you have to learn a certain amount of materials and there is always changes in the work place good or bad.
good,"Typical work day in the big warehouse is interesting each time and also loud, I've learned how to pick, pack and sort at this facility. Management is awesome the like to help anyone they can in the best way they can to get the best results and answers to whatever questions you may have. Hardest part was picking, most important part was getting paid."
good,"A typical day for me is controlling the arrival of all vehicles coming on the site I am working at (be it Inbound Deliveries, Outbound Collections or deliveries for the indirect departments (Facilities, Stores))."
good,"If you want to play Survivor Island, while creating super innovative technologies, this is the place for you. That said, with great power comes great expectations. Perform at the highest level, or GTFO."
good,"Amazon is a very high paced, metric driven business.  During non-Holiday periods most positions work four days per week.  The company is still growing and very open to new ideas to increase efficiency and customer satisfaction"
good,"Boxes being built, production lines moving everywhere, boxes being filled and sealed, its all apart of company and quite fascinating"
good,There are a lot of different positions for one person at a time that he can do and that's the fun part of it.
good,Co-workers are enjoyable to work with. A typical work day consist of arriving to work for a 10 hour shift. Basically this is a job where you work for your money.
good,"Every morning starts with a meeting about our day targets and other all day tasks, what department need to do. Very good and friendly staff but very short breaks."
good,"Great place to work with many opportunities to solve unique problems that you often won't see in other environments.  Across the board the strongest team of engineers that I've worked with.  There is no problem unsolvable at Amazon!  "
good,"My wife and I would get to work get our normal work stations right across from one another, go sit and wait till it was time to clock in eat free food they provided, then got to the start up meeting where we would here how much product we had coming in and I would here where I would be placed whether it was being the yard dog (CDL driving), receiving or both, the hardest part was making rate when work was slow. The best part was the family culture, free lunch and free gym. They paid for my Class A CDL licenses."
good,"My day at work is doing the same thing over and over.  I have learned how to use a scanning gun in as little as a few minutes and it is fairly easy to operate.  The management team does have morning and after lunch meetings with all the employees but other then that, I never see them around to ask questions.  The hardest part of my job is finding space for bigger items when there is not much room to place new items into the bins, but I get it done as quickly and with as best quality as I can.  The thing I enjoy the most about my job is working on transit,  I enjoy doing the cases more then the totes because Cases have a lot of the same items which makes it easier to stock."
good,"You where constantly on the go 10 hours a day sometimes 60 hours a week.Management was confusing, coworkers where easy to get along with."
good,"people are awesome to work with. The training really is not up to standards. the management plays to favorites and pass on people who are more qualified then they are themselves. What you learn on the job is all the training you get if you ask for more training from the management they themselves don't know how to do most of the jobs that they are supervising themselves. The hours are not that bad, and the benefits are great."
good,"Picked items for shipment during the Christmas Holiday season.  Amazon Is a very progressive and great company to work for, even if only on a temporary basis."
good,"Amazon fonctionne avec un systeme de production à respecter, c'est à dire l'atteinte d'un objectif à chaque heure."
good,"the job is simple dont require any specific skills."
good,"A typical day at Amazon consists of a ""start-up"" meeting, which occurs at the start of the shift every morning, and following lunch every afternoon. This meeting covers the main focus of the day - usually including information about work flow, any meetings, special events (like free catered lunches), etc. At the end of the meeting everyone stretches and then it's ""time on task"". Work ranges from relatively easy, to slightly difficult, to sweat-your-butt-off hard depending on what department you're in. The one thing that is consistent throughout the departments is that you must make your rate. If you make your rate every week, good for you. If you don't, expect coaches (verbal warnings) and write-ups. Amazon is my first warehouse job, and it is probably the best introduction to a warehouse environment. The training is very thorough, and on-going training is available at any time upon request. They teach you how to do everything, from making a box to driving an order picker. They also have a lot of safety regulations, but it is nice to know that you have a low chance of getting hurt by machinery or falling items and things of that nature. The management is so-so. There are some managers that really will care a lot about your concerns and needs, and some who won't care at all. And if you are one of the managers' favorites, you get placed on the easiest tasks most of the time and if you need any special accommodations, you get them. The Process Assistants are usually much better than the managers, but are under-paid and under-appreciated. The co-workers are typically the best part"
good,"Everyone there was very nice and polite. It is a clean and well kept warehouse.  The climate controal was perfect and very nice !!"
good,"Busy work day but I see that as a good thing because the harder you work the faster the day went by. I learned a lot about logistics and warehouse work from this job. one of my friends was in management and he also taugh me things about the managerial side of the company. "
good,"Launched and operated food vending business by negotiating deals with outside food vendors"
good,A day at Amazon you almost feels like a race. Everybody's on pins and needles to make rate and some aren't. I've learned not to get discourage when I know I'm doing my best and putting my all into it. Some of the managers there would talk to you and treat you as if your aren't an adult yourself. The hardest part was the continuous walking in the ICQA department. I enjoyed most working for a goal cause it helped me to become quicker with my hands.
good,very ethnic and a great place to learn self dicipline and determnation
good,"- Experienced worker of many skills and abilities in the beginning of their shift can make a choice, if they will do packing, sorting, gift wrapping or picking work for today, but later, if team leader or manager will find out, that some areas needs for support, some workers can be asked then to change their location for another one."
good,"Work here is an average of 9 hours per day. Great learning and insight into e-commerce. Understanding of the fraud and backend processing of e-commerce orders. Great work culture and Flat organization, informal work culture."
good,A typical day at Amazon is very tiring. I work from 6:45pm to 5:15 am and I am very achey and tired by the morning. Management is very nice and get the job done. They thank us for our hard work. The job itself is not hard but exhausting to do for 10 hours. The most enjoyable part of working at amazon is the people i have met that make my night so much better and keep a smile on my face.
good,"empresa com alta confiabilidade em seus compromissos, dinamica."
good,"Clock-in, walk over the to the work area manager(s) always has the stand up for example he/she would talk about how many unites we sold and how are rate is, then we would stretch out our muscles after that we start to work."
good,"- The typical day at work was always busy, I always came to work with something to do. There was every few times where i was sent home due to no work."
good,"very busy work place, kept on yr feet all day with half hour break"
good,"Low conversion rate, even though they promise most seasonal employees will be converted to permanent they only convert maybe 1/6 of those they hire for seasonal."
good,Management doesn't care about employees as much but the workload is their main concern.
good,Best people I worked with. Fun projects. Large impact to customers.
good,I managed 6 area managers and in charge of 200-500 associates. Have to manage all processes of the outgoing of shipping of customer orders. You must be very detailed and pro-active.
good,I learned a lot about meeting production numbers and working in a team environment.
good,The pay is great and the job is simpan enough. There is just not enough flexibility in the scheduling. Im no long with the company due to the fact I held a temporary seasonal position that has since been terminated.
good,Es hat mir Spaß gemacht. Ich habe gern dort gearbeitet.
good,"It was my first job here in ARIZONA, was amazing for me I want to work again overthere again I’m trying to apply again but I didn’t have a answer yet .."
good,"Great place to work and still have a sense of freedom,its is a very fast paced work environment and room for advancement. There are many different facilities around the world that you can transfer to once converted to a blue badge."
good,is a great job for someone who is self driven and likes to keep on the move. Good environment and awesome training systems in place always someone to help you find answers to any questions you might have
good,Amazon is a great work environment with an opportunity for growth within the company. Its work schedule allows time off for family and other activities.
good,Lot more working hours compared to other places. They expect you to clock in more hours. This can be seen from the senior management itself. Structured and organised work processes.  And good cafeteria
good,"It is a good place to work.  You just need to be on time, do your job and stay the entire shift.  If you are a little older, there may not be advancement opportunities."
good,Active work environment. Excellent internal opportunities with ability to move nationwide. High level of responsibility for the pay. Management tends to shake things up every 4-6 months. Must be very flexible to shift changes.
good,"My most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work close with a team of people on a project, which made the work fun and allowed time to go by faster."
good,"Great benefits and Salary, but targets are demanding and job satisfaction can get pretty low when working on the same thing for months at high production rates with tracked productivity."
good,Hired on as a seasonal employee and understood that termination was possible. I expressed interest in converting to permanent status multiple times. I was let go all the while they had a hiring expo that week. Why let people go that are working there already and doing good work just to spend more money on hiring and training new people?
good,Even though the salary is good but the work environment is not convenient to work in. Management body is too week in solving conflict and allocation and balancing of job load relatively among associates.
good,It's just ok. It's like any other job... Just a job. They pay a little better and require a little less to get hired but overall it's a job not a career
good,"Amazon is a place where you work hard and make money. "
good,"Its a fast paced position , with rates per hour, competitive, can be stressful if you do not take direction well. Full training on the job Fork lift, reach truck Whimis and saftey training"
good,Duties and responsibilities are clear and concise. Requires endurance because there is some physical labor necessary to move packages. Then focus is necessary to ensure that packages end up in correct place. Could be little taxing after hours of doing same task over and over.
good,I wait on standby for a order. After i receive an order. I try to find every item. If something is sold out i ask a Whole Foods worker to help me find an item to replace. After i package the order. And it’s ready for shipment.
good,"As an Amazon picker, your main responsibility will center around gathering products for order fulfillment from your supervisor. In addition to this core function, you will also be responsible for labeling certain types of merchandise and ensuring that adequate stock levels are being maintained."
good,"Amazon is a very fair and good company to work for they offer great bennifits and a good salary to start, very flexible hours and schedual , and even offer ride sharing"
good,"Enjoyable social work environment with fair opportunity for advancement. My facility happened to be temporary tent facility and the management was trying to get systems in place to conduct an efficient operation, but the process was messy and the workday frequently lacked solid structure."
good,"I worked for a Third Party Contractor performing maintenance work. I was there for a building startup and found that there were a lot of chemistry issues within staff. Through all of the problems inherent in a startup, I saw my mistakes magnified along with my successes. I felt as though I left proud of my accomplishments because they were recognized and the company respected me for it. Employees who fell behind ended up with a target on themselves. I had struggled to keep up for half of my time with the company and felt great pressure due to this. I am glad that I left but I can definitely see potential for hard workers."
good,Opportunities to learn new things. Efficient Training with decent management. The benefits are pretty slim until you worked with the company for a year
good,"Amazon.com is a good company to work for, but I am afraid that a parent can make a living out of just being a delivery driver when you don't have enough hours to cash on and take care of your family and pay bills."
good,"Good Place to learn ALOT.  Fast paced, measurement driven environment with a heavy emphasis towards customers satisfaction to build brand loyalty.  Your employee performance evaluation / value as an employee is HEAVILY weighted by ""like-ability"".  Similar to many organization's if you are ""liked"" you gain access to information which allows your performance to be deemed effective.  Effective performers in this organization are compensated well and rewarded with MORE opportunities to continue to pursue the career path's that suit the best interests of the company and the individual. Front line (customer facing) role in the organization are ""highly hierarchical"" in nature are tightly run via ""chain of command"" protocol.  ""No entrepreneurial spirit here""... Get it Done or Get GONE! The good news is that this is CLEAR from day 1 so its about one's perspective and ability to work in dynamic work environments where management can be HEAVY & Hand's off @ the same time.  The atmosphere is team driven and can be fun. Again a good place to DO and LEARN ALOT..."
good,"Amazon ist eine sehr schnelllebige Firma in der es sehr oft Erneuerungen gibt, die aber stets sofort an die Mitarbeiter weiter gegeben wird. "
good,Do what you have to do and follow  safety rules & poilcy or there will be trouble. Especially if you are a driver dont think of doing something wrong because your job is on the line.
good,"This company has a lot to offer if you have the time for it. Moving up is an option for those who stay with the company long enough. Most P.A.'s have been there for at least 2 years, and managers 5+. The company does give a fair pay for the amount of time and work you put in."
good,Good environment to work in. Helps engineers understand and develop scalable and stable applications. If you are smart at work and able to bloat about the impact you have on the team you can easily climb the ladder.
good,"Nice managers and drivers. Great workouts moving Amazon boxes and parcels, Difficulty getting correct information toward realistic career advancement."
good,"During my time at Amazon, productivity and customer satisfaction were the top priorities everyday. Management also pushed a positive balance between work and personal life, emphasizing workplace safety, and never shying away from jumping into the fray themselves when the workload required it."
good,I loved the company and the work was super easy but they won’t let anyone work over 25 hours while I was there and as a single mom of two young kids I found it difficult to continue working there
good,"Enjoyed working at Amazon. However, I wish we could have enough breaktime during the shift. The facility is so large and took long time walk to break room. Otherwise, good people to work with and good benefits available."
good,"Amazon is driven by customer satisfaction, not only ensuring the customers at home receive their orders correct and on time but the customers/employees with amazing pay and benefits."
good,Working as a picker ..u walk all day ..hardly any time for breaks ..the positive thing is u will lose weight ! The breaks go by so fast. Managers are rude.
good,"Love working at Amazon, need better pay. Good experience, love working with customers, and driving is fun.looking to challenge myself in a new area.would recommended Amazon to my peers. Like traveling to new areas serving customers needs. Is one of my favorite jobs ."
good,Delivery Amazon package and different locations homes and commercial. Load truck and unload vans and trucks. Separate by code numbers and scan items before delivery.
good,"The only reason I quit was my sister was really sick and needed help and they denied my leave for 2 weeks! Your on your feet for most of the day but once you got used to it, it wasn’t bad. The people I worked with were very nice and helpful. A very fast paced environment."
good,the job it self has many opportunities I was able to go back to school with the help from Amazon career choice it’s so many opportunities they have available the only flaw is it’s a big warehouse with a lot of different personalities some people can be very rude and disrespectful
good,Was an amazing learning experience. I was able to learn their amazing work culture and inculcate a lot of personal values.The managers were very helpful and would take care of personal factors of the employees.
good,"This job is one that people have made career's out of as i would see people who had worked there for 15+ years. It is a fairly boring and repetitive job, but has great benefits and decent pay which makes it a ideal job if you need one and have little education or work experience."
good,Work life balance is difficult base on the project or process is get into. Rotation shifts will be there and difficult to manage your personal life as I told earlier it all depends on the process.
good,i usually ran a team of anywhere between 20-50 AA to maintain the quality and correct inventory of the Fulfillment center. i would continually be engaging and available for the AA on any matter necessary.
good,Really great pay but can have terrible hours. They have a new hiring process which is a mess. They have you apply and say they have job offerings but once you go through the whole application process there are zero shifts available for you to pick up.
good,Good experiences but starting from bottom especially working overnight and extreme busy in July and in between October and December which will make you to work overtime
good,"The pay is real good but you really work hard for it, the staff is friendly , they help u if u don’t understand or meet your packing quote, the days are long"
good,"I am try to do better but rest of depends on HR, because they hired so many new people here. This is multinational company in Canada but they made like a little India."
good,"A good job for the salary and really good to make friends as you can not bring your phone with you in the work area."
good,Amazon hired me as a permanent employee and then laid me off saying I was hired as seasonal.  It was very dishonest. During my time there the Managers were very hit or miss.
good,I was working at AWS. The oncall was pretty heavy. So no much work life balance. And there is no much benefits for employee...But they do have great products.
good,"Good place to work, ability to work remotely. Work with smart people.  Use 3 systems to track candidates can slow down the process. Some recruiters don't follow the candidate ownership guidelines."
good,"Die Arbeit ist sehr gut zu bewältigen und und man kommt auch ins Schwitzen, aber man wird durch den Job auch Fitter. Die Einweisung und Sicherheitsschulung ist gut gemacht."
good,You are able to meet great people that are helpful. You are given many paid and unpaid hours that can be used in an emergency. You can also choose a schedule that fits your demands.
good,"A typical day of work was getting to the offsite to receive my route. Logging in to scan my route and complete it with no issues, then to come back and finish my day."
good,"Amazon offers a lot of flexibility with shifts.The pay is decent , since Georgia is known for having low wages. Amazon is so focused on getting things to the customers fast, I feel that management forgets about the safety of the employees."
good,I was able to work a full week consistently with very little schedule changes.  Management was friendly enough and try to be helpful in teaching you proper safety procedures.
good,Amazon has a great leader. If the management followed the rules.......well then I would probably still be working there. Work is sometimes physically challenging.
good,"Great Place for single people looking for growth opportunities and are able to:"
good,The company is great. However do not expect all the frills of a start up. There are few perks but the pay is good! The Interview process is very intense !
good,"It is a very fun place to work at during off seasons, it gets fast and somewhat hard and under pressure during peak time. watch your back and follow the instructions"
good,"Taking care of pt's is always rewarding. The politics can be very frustrating at times. If you work had and look to improve product lines and obsess over customer service, you will advance."
good,"always on the move, making a difference in other's day. 10-hour workdays typically from 11 to 9:30 pm.  You get one 30 minute unpaid lunch break and two 15 minute paid breaks."
good,Amazon is a nice place to work for if you're looking for a first job since anyone can get in but if you wanna have a good time there learn different areas of the company so you are not stuck in the same area every day.
good,I do enjoy what I do the only problem Is a lot of us get really exhausted when peak season hits and being exhausted doesn't seem to be a concern.  I do enjoy Met when available. Just wish more appreciation.
good,I had fun working with Amazon. I started during the holiday rush season as a temporary hire that year. The pay was good with many opportunities for advancement. I left because the fulfillment center was in another city and the commute there and back everyday was getting pretty costly and tiring.
good,It is a very fast pace work environment. There is no one that will come and help if you have an issue you can not solve. Too many people are on phones.
good,People like to help you out to get the job done. Although it's a lot of physical work due to heavy totes or boxes you have to carry you can always asked for help if you need it
good,"Everyone is a hard charger and everyone is trying to make a difference, it's part of the culture at the company at a high level. But how they do that is very dependent on what org you're in. I was in two different orgs and had two very different experiences."
good,"Pay is good, hours were good, unlike other seasonal places I’ve applied for that kept some of their employees after the season amazon does not so that"
good,Great Health Care Benefits.  Very fast paced.  Hours are very long.  Very strenuous job.  Benefits are good.  Mandatory overtime should not be mandatory.  60 hour work week during holidays sometimes.
good,"It’s a good place to work, I’m in a different department from the Fulfillment Center, and they are not that nice to our department although we are both Amazon companies. Other than that it’s a good place to work."
good,"Amazon is setup professionally with hours and shifts. The job benefits are great! medical, vision, dental, 401k, and even pet insurance. Amazon is very labor intensive, fast paced, and assembly like production."
good,"Nice place to work and have a great work culture nice environment have many things to learn every day.Daily difficulties and satisfaction of solving them, learn may thing while solving the problem"
good,"A typical day at work, working in a amazon fullment center consisted of me clocking in at a specified time and stowing 2000 items in pods which are amazons inventory."
good,Amazon is strongly committed to diversity within its community and especially welcomes applications from South African citizens who are members of designated groups who may contribute to Employment Equity within the workplace and the further diversification of ideas. The relevant laws and principles associated with Employment Equity will be considered when appointing potential candidates.
good,Great people.  Fun to work with.  Management improved by the end.  Unfortunately some of old school management ways drove people away in the end.  Overall a great company.
good,in azienda al inizio era molto stressante per via de la premura che mettevo addosso poi imparato il metodo migliore per lavorare e' andata meglio ho avuto la fortuna di avere un manager molto comprensivo e capace e anche il mio instractor e' stato molto capace i coleghi non erano male ma poi la tempistica per la pausa e per altre lavorazioni era veramente stressanti e lo stipendio era molto misero vista la mole di lavoro richiesta
good,"Alot of expectation from the company for the workers to do, poor management skills and low pay. You have alot of time off if it's not there busy time of the year."
good,A typical day was a 10 hour shift standing and packaging orders for customers.  We had goals to meet every night and I enjoyed pushing myself meeting and exceeding those goals every night  Our managers where there to encourage us and to  make sure we were completing our jobs safely. The workplace culture was made up of a teamwork attitude and safety first environment.  The hardest part of the job was the standing in one spot for ten hours a night.  It took a toll on my knees.  I really enjoyed the physicality of the work and the challenging pace of the work flow .
good,Great place to work at and learn from everyone is kind and you can grow here and become as best you can be and have a lot of paid benefits you can receive
good,"Taking time off or be off due to medical reasons. Learning how things work, always asking the questions on what to do and maybe get some kind of writing on what to do, for certain procedure."
good,Alles in allem super. Ich komm wieder.  Vielleicht übernehmt ich ja ma.
good,a typical day is working 11 hour shifts and also having to do over time. There is also no phones or electronics on the floor. so through your whole 11 to 14 hour shift you are forced to listen to nothing or what ever music they play.
good,The job it self is a good job. There are long hours 10 hour shifts if you deliver fast you can get done fast. Great opportunity The staff is great and friendly
good,Wharehouse work not for the faint at heart 11.5 - 12 shift's depending on the time of year it is be prepared to be moved around a lot from department to department depending on your training plenty of overtime depending on the time of year as well overall decent company to work for
good,It was a good place to work if that the only job you have and the schedule didn’t work for my work and life balance was tough I didn’t have time to see my family
good,Amazon demande beaucoup d'effort alors si t'es dynamique courageux et motivé alors ce tra ail est fait pour toi
good,Good place to work with a very chilled environment. Good job security. Not too much work pressure. Allowances are good. Salary is a little on the lower side with respect to the market.
good,"Contract role. Well defined processes. Good candidate feedback. Highly engaged hiring managers. Excellent systems. Very high volume. Top tier employee referral program. Limited training, but good resources"
good,"The constant changing of schedules is undesirable, inconvenient and stressful. Otherwise it’s a pretty easy straightforward job. Always something for someone."
good,"I loved working on my team.  My boss was amazing.  It was hard work, but I got really strong and confident in myself and my abilities.  I know I was a valued team member."
good,"Das Unternehmen entwickelt sich jeden Tag weiter, wer Beständigkeit sucht ist hier Falsch! "
good,"There are a lot of pros/cons that come with working here.  First you have to go through an onsite temp service, I've noticed within the first month of working here the HR for the temp service had went through probably 5 or 6 different HR reps, the temp service reps have no idea w"
good,"a seasonal job, do your work and they generally leave you alone, good clean quiet place , work is not hard just long hours on your feet. management leaves you alone as long as you do your work .Always paid on time at a fair rate"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of production and meeting the requirements. I learned a great deal about team work. Management was fair and stood by there employees. The workplace culture was of all different nationalities/diversity. The hardest part of the job was having to have to take breaks. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people, meeting people from different backgrounds and life."
good,"more people that come in day and night, but not enough work to go around. at times there was no work to be done so people stood around till more work was issued."
good,I enjoyed it while it lasted but it was exhausting and stressful but also good for temporary work pay was only really worth it in the Christmas period
good,"A good company and good work with some stress full work and team "
good,"A typcal day includes checking out email at 10, standup, plan for today's work, meeting, and coding. Learned some new cloud computing skills during normal day. The hardest part is finding out how to develop the work during the day."
good,"One of the most organised company !! however does have its own issues, very rude security service !!, almost impossible to achieve their working target  !!!"
good,"Demanding in terms of reaching set target. Ethical workplace culture, everyone was treated fairly. The management team was good at motivating workers to reach goals. Easy to communicate in the hierarchical organisational structure between different chains of command"
good,"- Friendly company"
good,The job is hard work but with good support from friends and managers you can make it through the day. Can be hard for some because it basically requires you to be a robot
good,"large lunch/break area , many spaces for parking, organization of work place very well designed. The employee training is top notch. The friendly atmosphere in the warehouse is satisfying"
good,"Great as a temporary/part-time job for people going to school; great benefits, good pay and flexible schedule, but for during peak seasons; work is too monotonous too me, but not bad for people who like to do the same thing over and over again; quick-paced and can be stressful and tough for people who are out of shape"
good,It is a very flexible job you pick your hours the only difficulty is getting hours other then that it’s a awesome job for a part time job and what’s even better is you make your own hours
good,"Met alot of great people,learned alot of leadership skills,problem solving. Lots of room for advancements and overtime,slot of benefits. Great educational programs available."
good,"A great company to work with. Where one can learn and grow in the domain they are, It provides a very friendly environment for its employers. And you get a secured job."
good,"On a normal day, I will packed boxes, picked items from shelves to be shipped out, and “stowed,” which means scanning products and placing them on shelves to be picked later over and over again. What I've experienced is to know the basics of the supply chain. To be a pro at knowing how the warehouse functions most efficiently and where there are hidden gaps that could befixed to make the supply chain system run more smoothly."
good,Working at Amazon was good great pay and 60 hour weeks during peak that brought in alot of money. Managment was terrible and treats you like your nothing and they are mostly all new. Other than that it was good
good,I had a really good time working at Amazon. I gained great work experience and met a lot of great people in my time at this company. I would recommend Amazon to any job seeker.
good,Great job for staying active. Fun people. If your looking to get in better shape this job can help. Be ready to strive for excellence and making new friends.
good,"Great company to work for."
good,Easy and good money. Interview was really quick. I Got the job in no time. Like two weeks. Pay good. Management terrible but pay is worth it to be honest.
good,Working for Amazon was a great experience for the only problem I had was was for the contractor slt was very unprofessional to they wasn’t trustworthy they played with employees money and didn’t wanna pay for pto
good,Job was pretty easy. Fast paced but not overworked. People were friendly. I made friends there I am still in contact with today. I worked the overnight shift so the work/life balance was a little bit skewed. It was nice that they offered optional overtime.
good,Every Friday fun at work makes us feel stress free weekend and drives us to start a fresh Monday. Learned to get job done through juniors and learning how to keep them motivated.
good,"Worked at Amazon for a little over three years. The first year had a fairly incompetent manager. That manager moved on and I moved to a completely different team. Great manager who was all about building employees up and getting the most out of them. In less than a year received a promotion. After about two years with the company was moved to another team. Good people, but management was scattered and not interested in development or growth. After over three years was managed out of the company, less than a year past receiving a promotion."
good,"Amazon has great benefits that start day 1. 401k, Health, vision and dental benefits that are reasonably priced.  There is room for advancement and salary raises are okay. HR has some opportunities due to the company constantly changing things. Transferring departments and facilities can be difficult but not unachievable."
good,What I like about this job is the flexibility. I get to travel more often . I work when if I want to.   What I don’t like is the fact that we can’t work over 29 hours a week(off peak)
good,Rough start experience with little vision or direction.  Amazon hired great talent but didn't have the leaders to support the development.  It is a great place to work as your first place of employment after college.
good,Good work culture and platform to develop your skills. You have to put your own effort to move forward. There are many opportunities provided by the company. Make sure you use that wisely.
good,We worked 4 hours a day for 5 days a week. I learned how to use a scanner to scan packages on to a paled after placing the package on the right paled we then wrap the paled for shipping. Management was very helpful. There were all types of people working on the line everyone got along. The hardest part was making sure the paled was stacked properly for shipping. The most enjoyable part was interacting with other people
good,"Productive plac, learned many new things in the logistic side of business. Management was not the best but made it something good out of it. Good place for growth"
good,"Sometimes the expectations are not rational! Some of the managers are not all that nice and work on break time, bathroom time! Because too much time could and will have you out the door quick"
good,"Very fast paced but when it’s slow, oh boy! Strict about rates. Some process guides are micro managing you more then the actual people who’s in charge. Other then that I have no real big issues. I will update again after a few months"
good,"They were a hard working place that required you to keep up to pace at all times, I always had to be on my feet and ready to work, I met good people but I failed to maintain a work to social life balance whilst there"
good,You have day were you work very hard and other days were you kinda do nothing. Sometimes there can be a lot of favoritism but as long as you do your work they shouldn’t tell you much.
good,"Four day, ten hour shifts, night shifts get paid .25 cents more (at the time of working there). The hardest part of the job was the constant moving and always having something to do whether or not your line was not producing items into the trays or just getting some boxes ready. Workplace is really nice, people always willing to help out with getting something for you if it's too heavy to lift."
good,Ich bin sehr gerne dort. Habe viele Bereiche in der zeit wo ich dort bin gelernt. Die Kollegen sind sehr nett und hilfsbereit. Selbst die Chefs in den Bereichen wo ich war waren sehr freundlich
good,"Lavoro totalizzante, sotto tutti i punti di vista,fisico e mentale"
good,"Amazon is a great place to work as a part-time job. When I started at Amazon, I was fresh to the warehouse scene but the managers really made working there interesting, inclusive, and overall fun. If you're looking to gain experience in warehouses, I highly encourage you to gain experience at Amazon. There's always something to do throughout the day and you're always on your feet moving around."
good,Enjoyed the independence of the position and running my route to make it more efficient. Time schedule worked out perfectly for my personal life.  Great place to work.
good,Figures work professionnal manager safety points during stand up. Team work. Training and safety review during shift. Short breaks long way to the break room.
good,"Have to stay on top of scan rate. the hours are never set, you kind of just go along until your shift has reached the certain amount of scans and built pallets."
good,We have our good days and bad good days we get things done early and every body happy I love working with people who wants to work and learn more things like coworkers come up to me to ask me a question about how something should go and I always have a answer to it if not I’ll ask a pa for a lil help.
good,"Over all the hours were the hardest part of the job, on average I worked 13 hour days, 4 days a week. The management in my building also did not have a good idea as to what they were supposed to do with me."
good,"Day could start at any hour."
good,"It's one of the fastest growing companies in the world, so naturally it's a good place to be in if you're looking for long term growth. Work culture is great provided you're working with the right people."
good,This is not a hard place to work. There is just alot of walking and you have to walk up and down the stairs. There really isn't any drama because you want have any time for that.
good,"It's a Job, Amazon does take care of it's employees well in my opinion. The work in the warehouse is mind numbing and fast paced but not ""Hard"". The pay for the work is ok and I like most of my co-workers"
good,"Great company although very unorganized in opening a new center.  Human resources was very difficult to communicate with. Also, no way to call management on the telephone. Other than that, not a bad place to work."
good,"If you are looking for a place, where you could balance your work and personal life - Amazon is Not it. It is more like Work-Work balance. They will work you out and spit you out when you done. Compensation is good though."
good,I love how busy the work day is; also it is very flexible for people with second jobs and children. I do not agree with the times we were let out in which managers failed to update us on.
good,Je conseille cette entreprise pour un débit de carrière dans une entreprise
good,"When you pick up your route, they are distributed randomly so you won't know where you'll be delivering but it allows you to have a diverse experience and gives you an opportunity to have a flexible schedule."
good,"una buona esperienza, ti gestisci da solo, porta i pacchi a destinazione, non fare danni, vedi gente, sei sempre in giro, la giornata vola"
good,"Definitely, had fun working there. There was always a bit of a challenge but you tend to work way better in a challenging situation especially when you have so many great clerks and supervisors encouraging you to meet today's rates."
good,The rules didn't seem to apply to a number of individuals. And management seemed to ignore the remedies.. Extreme cherry picking was permitted by certain individuals.
good,"it requires a lot of balance inside out. Way beyond just delivering packages. You have to be ready daily. The first two weeks might be rough but trust me your body system adjusts to the plan and you become use to it. The pay is good but you got to work in order to get paid lol. IN general, its not a bad job but you just have to understand how its been done."
good,"Ottimo ambiente per iniziare  a capire, dal basso, le potenzialità del colosso Amazon."
good,The day started off by clocking in with a key card when hired. We had a shift meeting before starting it off by getting loose up since we are always moving around. They asked us safety tips before hand.
good,"Was a good place to work, i worked warehouse/delivery driver position i liked the job 4 day 10 hour shifts, lots of overtime. Very chill as long as you stay on pace"
good,Pretty straight forward job that involves a whole lot of walking. It tends to get repetitive after a while. But other than that made pretty good money while working there
good,I've really enjoyed the opportunity to learn how to use cloud technology to do semiconductor development. Amazon leadership principles are heavily emphasized. The principles are good but many conflict with each other and can allow a manager to downgrade your adherence to one or more principle pretty no matter what you do.
good,"If you're relatively fit, this job will be fun for you. If you struggle physically you may not enjoy the shifts. The average person should have no issue completing the work."
good,I worked for a contract company for Amazon. Poor Management with the company. Amazon have contract companies to deliver there freight. I was a Lead Dispatcher and Supervior.
good,But the above mentioned is slowly changing. Still comparatively it is very good compared to others out there. I guess I should mention cost cutting is majorly impacting the work culture.
good,"Good job very flexible bad benefits. Everything is managed very well during the sortation, the HR department isn’t very helpful when it comes to most things though. Easy to get overworked."
good,"Fast-paced,  a lot of metrics, hard work, strict standards, long hours, good benefits, revolving senior leadership, college hires need management courses"
good,Always busy and challenging at times but my coworkers make it fun. A great place for anyone that enjoys photography. Prepping items for photographers is challenging at times but satisfying.
good,Great company with great compensation and big picture stuff. You have the opportunity to make things change in Amazon. Management is very focused on there own personal development and can leave other people in the dust
good,"I’d say just be prepared to work a longer shift than scheduled. Ex.) I worked a 2am-6am shift and had to stay over at least an hour every day, if I didn’t it was point added to my discipline points, to many points and you’ll be terminated. Other than that it’s pretty simple get in do your job and get out."
good,After training for 2 weekes then you are put in a temp set up where your skills are tested and the trainer can determine which department you are best for. After getting assigned then you have 2 more weeks to adjust once your adjustment period ends then starts warnings for slow pick times and trainer meetings.
good,"Challenging task , lot of opportunity to learn , poor work life balance , good chances of growth. Very different work culture in comparison with other companies"
good,Benefits very great full time employees. Being a Prime Associate at Clt 1 you have flexibility to pick up shift. We do 1 or 2 hr delivery which the driver will pick up.
good,"It was stressful, busy and you have to work to targets but the people are great to work with and easy to get along with. The pay is good but they do not give any notice to temp staff as to when they will be laid off, they just come around on the day, ask you to go with them and then let you know that was your last day and you wouldn't be coming back."
good,"fast paced, challenging, chance to advance, processed customer returns, graded items on quality standards, to see it items can be resold at a discount,"
good,Work politics is the thing and exist in Amazon work place. always exciting and great experience working. always learn something new and excel from there.
good,"General work day you went in and help sort packages until trucks were empty and everything was in bags. Once packages were scanned and sorted you delivered them to the delivery truck. Once this was done, you were done. Easy day."
good,Amazon is the best place to learn leadership principles. You'll be given top class training on leadership behavior. The only problem here is the benefits & pay is less compared to other companies on same platform.
good,"I loved the job. Got in packaging my first time applying. The energy was great and inspired positive changes to my home life. The seasonal mandatory 12hour day schedule was rough because I had been out of work for a couple years prior to starting there but after a week and a half, I got used to it. My only true issue with the job is the level of miscommunication between trainers, shift leads, floor leads, quality and Integrity. In my first week, I had been told by every one of them that ""I'm the only one in charge so this is how I need this packed."" And each one gave me different instructions. Eventually, I ended up just listening to quality control."
good,Amazon is a decent place to work. It's 50/50 like every other job in las vegas. It works for some people & others it can be too much or not enough. I don't want Amazon to be my career & that's why I am looking for a new job.
good,A typical day at work consists of performing your process path all day.You get two 30 minute breaks every shift. One is paid and one is not. Work is very easy
good,Job wasn't bad just be prepared to work hard. Staff was always friendly. If you aren't for this job may be a challenge because there is alot of walking .
good,With Amazon constantly growing and developing as a whole that gives their associates some great opportunities to experience a new way to work. I have been able to grow so much as a person and a worker through Amazon! I have learned a bunch more skills working with this company than most other jobs even make available for you to learn.
good,Pay is reasonable and at Coalville people were friendly. Work was not too demanding and managers were approachable and understanding. Long and tiring shifts but 3 days off was nice
good,I loved the job! When I made it and was being converted to beinga full time employ I was let go because I got my G.E.D online. Overall it's a great place to work the people are friendly and there's never really a dull moment.
good,"met good people at this place, hard work, heavy boxes but in the end it was fun place to work. I've learned making most of your situation and keep up the hard work."
good,"you need to be @ work by 5 am to receive your route"
good,The work is okay. You will walk an average of 9 miles in a shift. Wear your most comfortable shoes. They have contests for best pickers. I won but never got my gift card. It is monotonous work but you feel glad that you did your best picking for customers waiting on their orders. There is high pressure to perform.
good,Very easy and accommodating company to work for.  Good pay and overtime is usually available.  Time off is always available when you become a white badge rep.
good,"Working at Amazon was a great learning experience, until a typical work day became a competition for management to over work employees. Where alot employee passing out for being hot and exhausted."
good,"confermo ambiente operativo stimolante e flessibile"
good,"Everyday is a new day. It has its challenges, but  it also have it rewards. Fun place to work, very innovative company that always evolving to greater things."
good,"I work the hours I prefer.  Shifts become available each evening but they are grabbed up quickly so you have to be fast in taking them.  "
good,The job was okay. It was difficult to get good hours if you worked part time. I was working once every other week which was a little difficult. If you work full time you might get more hours.
good,"Amazon prends en compte la santé de ses salariés. Les journées de travail sont assez lourdes, mais il y a des poses, et l'ambiance est agréable, on y retrouve toutes les générations."
good,"Always pros and cons to every job."
good,It's very rewarding to feel accomplished and knowing you've successfully instruct the new hires about the job procedure and giving them the tools to be successful in their duties.
good,Benefits were great. Rates were hard to get sometimes. Standing for 10 hours a day wasn't pleasant. But overall it was an okay place to work for. I enjoyed working with some of the people there.
good,"Pay is good but the hours are 10/12hr days. Sometimes we delivery well into 9pm. It’s a new location so things are always being changed constantly. Sometimes when the warehouse is behind, we begin late on deliveries which is very annoying when you are ready to get your day started. All in all, this is a independent delivery job that can have is challenges and it’s benefits."
good,"Benefits are top notch but, there is no job security if you're just an associate. It's an injury prone job too and with the amount of production they ask for the chances are higher."
good,There were plenty of growth opportunities. The work really kept you busy trying to meet your quotas. I didn't like being pushed to do more and feeling disrespected when I was doing my best.
good,The opportunity to advance was not an easy process. Work hours weren’t flexible for the employees it was more conducive for the company. No benefits were provided for ft flex employees
good,"While at Amazon, they will work with you to advance within the company in any area you’re interested in. Work environment is extremely laid back and i leatned more working for this company than any other job ive had. Because of my time with Amazon, I feel I am equipped to take on any role."
good,These words are true.  I worked hard had a lot of fun and made history while being very fairly compensated.  It was a challenging workplace but no different that any forward leaning company.
good,"Amazing HR and management. The people were mostly unfriendly however, and it was not a fun place to be. The hardest part of the job was not talking to another person all day."
good,Fast growing with the pains that go along with such an organization. They can be stressful and expect a fast pace. It's a great place if you're young and energetic.
good,"The people that work there are nice, but some management are not that great some don't have people's skills. There's not a lot of communication between management and former employees."
good,Respected associates in a light hearted team building environment. Collect feedback and would assist with completing tickets. Set up room equipment for Amazon employees.
good,"I really like working at Amazon. It’s very relaxed but challenging at the same time. What I don’t like about the job is that management are all young people that really doesn’t know how to run the place, their just given the position based on how long they’ve been there opposed to who actually qualifies. "
good,My biggest complaint would be the hours and 10 hour shifts... I can't realistically work these hours being a mom with school aged kids. This is why I only work part time. But I have no real complaints!!
good,A company just starting out is always stressful but they needed more work. I would had stayed if I didn't live so far and if it was full time not just 4 hours they make up for it though because you can add extra shifts to make it 8 hours. Just speak to your manager be honest with them they really are trying. If you work with them they will try their best to work with you.
good,It was ok.  Just not for me.  Warehouse was part time and driving was way too many hours.  Got some really rough routes and some bad areas.  had to wait till everyone got a route to get mine.
good,"In the 7 years I spent at amazon I was promoting on a semi-regular basis. I was almost always given feedback for promotions I didn't get with challenges I could apply to help solve the gaps. Though the company is clear in the direction they want things to go with their open door policies and open collaborative management styles; Some poor decision still find ways to get management positions there. Once I discovered my biggest barrier for advancement was the manager I reported to, my work started to decline as I was getting more focused on finding that next step in career growth outside the company. I recommend Amazon as a company to work for but, warn anyone that finds themselves in a position of being micromanaged. Micromanagement is not what amazon is about and unfortunately the only way for these types of managers to get noticed is when those working under them began leaving. The risks people (self included) take when dropping under a poor manager are not worth it. As was my case: I was readying my resignation and was focused on trying to make everything appear correctly, this distraction caused me to error on a LOTO procedure that made my resignation irrelevant. Prior to that final manager, I had a lot of great experiences with a long list of managers that are still with the company. Every building is different but, if you get to know those closer to the top you will start to see the message is clear and the same. Everyone is expected to work safely at all times and your managers are their to help you get the equipment necessary for you to be successful. Their promotions"
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I met and worked with. I made many friends. "
good,"Its a fun place to work, must have high energy, must be able to multi task, very stressful environment. Capable to take directions from multiple leaders & ready to make fast & last minute changes."
good,Amazon is a great company to work at for anyone who is a self starter and thrives in an extremely fast paced environment that affords great opportunities for learning and growth
good,"Amazon, as one of the fastest growing companies in history, has a lot of work to be done, more than there's time or people to do it. This means you will likely have a much larger scope there than in a similar role at another company. It also means that while they respect you having a work/life balance, you'll have to make it a point to communicate what that balance is to your manager and not compromise what's agreed on. The to-do list will never be done and no one else will be watching your balance for you. "
good,Good job but physically demanding and repetitive. Pretty depressing. There’s not a lot of room to move up. Turnover rate is high. If you don’t get bored easily and are in shape it may be a good job.
good,I was able to advance once but felt limited by discrimination. The work culture there is fact paced and became easier in the Transportation Department versus inside in the other departments.
good,"I like that the job at this warehouse specifically could be very fast paced but managers were also understanding if there was ever a hold up or reason for delay. I have heard many things about working for amazon but as I said, this warehouse specifically is pretty easy going."
good,"I enjoyed working at Amazon,  I do think some improvements need to made to show they value their employees, because the employees Ive encountered are tired and exhausted and not given enough praise.  Amazon is a retail giant and have a lot of perks and benefits."
good,"This is hard work, non stop. 3 breaks per shift. Wear comfortable clothes and drink a lot of water. Ask question if you’re unsure, open door policy here"
good,Many new opportunities. Must manage your own growth. Must learn how to research for answers by yourself. Maintain your composure. Sometimes things can get chaotic and it is important that you will help others.
good,Not a bad place to work. Good benefits at a decent starting wage. There seem to be opportunities for advancement. There are many good people working there which makes the experience more enjoyable.
good,"A fun, productive but pressurised environment where tight deadlines need to be met "
good,"A typical day at Amazon would be your managers always reminding you that everyday is day one. "
good,"Would definitely recommend this job for anyone between jobs. Not much room for advancement if you don’t have a degree as that’s required to any type of management position. "
good,"There is alot you can do at Amazon, you can work for pack or pick or inbound which is bringing stuff into the facilty, it was nice there because the lounge was huge, and they had everything you needed, plus a ping pong table, and other games, my experience was good, and working with people there was great"
good,"Amazon believes in relying on the core leadership principles which define effective & efficiency of an employee. Although a combination on all the principles in each employee is seldom found, knowing about them and making a conscious effort to inculcate them into your work life definitely creates better leaders. The management assess everyone based on the leadership principles. The work culture is friendly however as the need to outperform kicks in, it makes change management a real challenge."
good,"Good overall company to work for, benefits are fantastic, but extremely difficult to try to progress you career within Amazon. You typically have to leave Amazon and come back to move up in levels."
good,Amazon was a tough place to work but had a unique culture that I never saw at any other work place it made the job more fun and less stressful. I would work for them again in a heart beat.
good,"The job is decent. I could complain but I know what the expectations are. As long as the work is being done, you have no problems.Unless you need help, there is no one to keep watch over you, so its a good job for people who dont like being watched over their shoulder."
good,"Amazon is very fast pace and can require heavy lifting. You will not have time to get to know your co-workers and you will generally be treated as a number. They pay well, and have decent benefits, but the job is very taxing mentally and emotionally."
good,"very ""machine like"" run atmosphere. very fast paced. be sure you can lift heavy objects multiple times a day. Job security is not a thing with Amazon. As a fulfillment associate anyway."
good,"Amazon Logistics is an amazing work place. You have the corporate feel in an industrial environment. The corporate ladder is very elaborate and as long as you stay driven you'll succeed. Amazon for so long has been strictly metric driven and every thing else was secondary but as of recent months they culture is changing to a balance of metric and people driven. People's safety , people's happiness and that people are real people and have lives outside of amazon."
good,"As a Process Assistant, there is always a lot to work on, whether it is engaging Tier 1 Associates to try and get their productivity up to what is expected or looking for ways to improve a process. The base work load isn't too demanding once you get the hang of it, but if you're looking to advance, overloading yourself seems like the only way to do it."
good,Management at times was no where to be found but otherwise the atmosphere created was relaxed and truly customer centric. I would work there again without question.
good,Stressful but pays. Many promotional opportunities if you know how to deliver results and interview. Fast-paced and stressful. Not great work life balance.
good,"Culture is better suited for individual contributors vs building strong teams and encouraging collaboration.  Significant number of departments and organizations that are a bit disjointed.  However, overall it is a challenging and can be rewarding environment to work in.  Senior Management is extremely talented and are excellent at understanding customers and taking new products and services to market quickly and successfully."
good,"Good environment, relaxed atmosphere.  Not a bad place to work.  I would recommend it to a friend and would not mind working there again.  I worked contract work that was seasonal."
good,"I think the hardest part of the job was the working environment.  It was sitting at desk a long time, and interpersonal seemed largely focused on business success, i.e. coworkers just wanting to get their jobs done and get out of the office to enjoy some personal time.  The workplace environment seemed to celebrate the entrepreneurial roots, but the downside is that entrepreneurial environments are a bit toxic and should be short-term.  Surely Jeff Bezos doesn't sit at a ""door-desk"", but if he does, it seems silly to have such high-caliber staff jammed in tight spaces using doors from Lowes for desks, even if it seems like a fun way to memorialize the company roots.  I've seen this a lot in corporate, where employers celebrate the money they are saving, but there's a lot to be said about making the workplace somewhere employees look forward to spending their day.  I was once asked to describe my work environment to a doctor, who asked ""where is this, a startup?"" and when I said Amazon, they were in disbelief - how can a company with such great treatment of customers not have the best work environment?  It was not awful - it just was not anything to praise.  The coworkers were excellent, then resources were excellent, and the promise of success was alluring, but it was not in my opinion an ideal work environment."
good,It's a busy environment but is a fun experience. The people are upbeat and helpful.  Your safety is important at the company.  Would like little more chances to sit down for a few minutes.
good,"I was recruited by Amazon to Temp with them over the 2017-18 holiday season for about 5 months. The pay was pretty good but not amazing, however I definitely enjoyed the job. Basically you are a human customer service resource for customers to interact with. Most Amazon customers rarely have the chance to talk to an Amazon employee in person and the Retail Sales Consultant (RSC)position provides that service. You answer questions about Amazon products and give out general Tech advice. While there are items that you can sell this will not be something you are judged by your bosses. Amazon emphasizes that sales are not the priority of the position. They want customers to trust the RSC's advice and therefore build trust with Amazon's brand. Pushing sales and products a customer doesn't need are not what this position is about. If you have a fun team to work with the days will fly by. This job is for you if you like Tech, and interacting with strangers."
good,"Easy going atmosphere however, still needing to hit deadlines. Management I believe could of been better. Possibly, making a more in depth interview process or considering work experience and Personality as tools to pick your staff."
good,"Great place to work if you are career oriented and are looking to move up fast. Pay and other benefits are amazing, but come at a cost. The job is extremely fast paced and high stress. As a whole amazon is always asking for more. Every year you’re expected to top your previous years work which over time leads to drone like life that revolves around amazon; even when you’re off the clock."
good,"Ambiente de trabajo dinamico, que requiere de mucha actividad fisica. El cafe, el te, el chocolate y el agua son gratis."
good,Amazon was fun and frustrating. It’s really great when everybody is on board with giving a team effort. Also when the managers and leads are super helpful. It’s hard when other associates have bad attitudes. Then the work feels stressful.
good,Overall the job was decent for the compensation & benefits given.  Looking to advance internally can be a bit of a challenge.  I would recommend a T1 position for any person looking to get their feet wet.
good,work is great. the moral has gone done the past few years. The benefits are still great and that is a reason why im still here after 7 years. They rotate managers about every 6 months
good,Always doing and moving around trying to get as much items out of the location. Attending to those who needed help on how to pack items and if they weren’t allowed to be sent out
good,non ti senti sicuro del lavoro.dal tipo di contratto
good,Great co-workers and management team. Good working equipment and amazing support staff.  I loved working out on the road.  It was an amazing and very enjoyable  work experience.
good,"Lavoro stimolante e molto professionale che si accede dopo un corso di preparazione con esame, ambiente collaborativo. Peccato che fanno contratti di lavoro a tempo determinato molto corti e nonostante la precisione del lavoro svolto raramente vengono prolungati o rinnovati."
good,"Everyone's experience will be different. Some may like  it, some may not. Congratulations on the pay increase. Can't leave the review because they want you to put all positive stuff ."
good,Good part time job. Picked up job in between semester. Interview and starting process took less than a week. Friendly staff members. Opportunity for growth for long term employees.
good,"Wages are fair, benefits are amazing, hours are long but fast paste environment makes the time go by quickly. The only downfall of working here had to be the ruthless non-stop work, would have you continue working even after being hurt or while being sick."
good,"My typical work day would be simple, I would go in and grab a cup of coffee (i worked in the mornings) and clock in and check my emails. I was nice, but until they decided to change the management structure"
good,Some expectations are a little hard to obtain. The paid time off could be more.  They do seem willing to work with you on expectations. The health benefits are nice.
good,"I Can't complain. 10 hours in this workplace would fly by, if you don't catch yourself checking the time every chance you get. Also, very safety-oriented."
good,Not a friendly environment and u will be out of social life as the work hours are very fluctuating....not easy to work as the customer are very frustrated all the time because of poor delivery service of amazon.
good,The job was highly demanding and required efficient thinking to meet deadlines however I also found the job to be quite rewarding as it's is a very social job where you can meet new people.
good,Fast pace and you stand up the whole 10 hour shift. We get 2 30min breaks the first one is paid the 2nd you have to punch out. Even though your working in a fast pace area you still have fun as long as you don't get TOT meaning time off task.
good,"I worked part-time for 3 years for amazon, i had to leave due to them cutting my hours into half. But overall it was a good place to work and the benefits are great."
good,"The job was very fast paced, boring, and repetitive. Pay for how skilled it is is good, and the building is air conditioned and at my location management made attempts to ensure associate comfortableness"
good,"Mangers provide feedback, and you try you best to meet the productivity and quality minimum. You get two break. One of which is paid. They give you mutliple benefits and a surplus of pto."
good,The days are 10 hour days; there is opportunity for overtime pay.  Lunch room with refrigerator and microwaves along with some vending machines.  It's warehouse packing.
good,worked there on graveyard was good place to work but tough schedule 4 nights at ten hours. Fast paced and have to keep up or there are consequences. Good employment for going to school
good,"Ich bin, sehr schnell aufgefallen und wurde direkt zum Liebling. Ein sehr herzlicher aber dennoch struktuierter Arbeitsaltag. Dadurch das dass Unternehmen sehr auf erfolg bedacht ist kann man dort in vielen sachen sich einbringen bis zur Perfektion"
good,"At Amazon, I think most of the teams are good ones- teams that are well-managed, have a good workflow, and whose members help each other and get along well. I was able to work with a team like this for my internship, and benefited from having a team mentor, a peer mentor from outside the team, and helpful team members that I could turn to if I had questions. We were all encouraged to leave work at a reasonable hour (though non-interns had regularly-scheduled on-call rotations). "
good,I believe working at amazon should be only 8 hours days. 10 hours of constant moving is very hard on the body.  Depending on where your work stations ( changes daily) it can take 3 minutes to get to break room and that time getting there and back is part of your break.
good,"If you are looking for a place to make money, have great benefits, and work really hard. Then this is the place for you. Work and life balance is hard and tiring at times but overall is ok. I get 3 days off a week and work 4 10 hour days."
good,"Many changes went on as I worked there. Went from very autonomous to more structured, but without the necessary structure to do our jobs efficiently. It was getting better when I left. LOTS of driving, lots of rinse and repeat hands on work. Long hours + lots of driving + summer was what made me move on. People were awesome, couldn't have asked for a better team. Pay was really good for the job, work was not hard. No real progression system at the position I was at. Restricted Stock Units that vested in 2 years from my start date, but the position I was in didn't feel like it would be around in 2 years."
good,"Strict timelines and a competitive environment."
good,"I honestly love working for Amazon! Only dislike is that all associates, are part timers so no healthcare benefits:( The ONLY way you can become a full timer is to move up in the company. Which would mean you have to be a permanent associate, apply when they have new job openings and then go through 3 interviews. These part time positions are perfect for college students, for older folks who are retired or people who are just looking to make some extra money."
good,"Straightforward process, Shopper support, easy access to manager, friendly and supportive staff at Whole Foods, good morale, management is helpful, great overall experience"
good,Worked on a fast paced speed.  Meeting targets it's quite fun when you get used to the task given . If you are not used to the job first times could be stressful. Time keeping is important as almost every task deals with time .
good,"the worst part of amazon is working with the people, because they won't listen to proper instructions, some people have no respect for their, some will take all their sick-days and not so up at all or late, and some that do show up are rude and inconsiderate."
good,Working for Amazon was a pleasure. Management was structured and always willing to assist. The job itself can become stressful but we had our breaks where we would be able to breath. Team building was great to interact with colleagues. Overall great place to work.
good,"The management is very supportive and encouraging. "
good,"Fast pace,outrageous production, fun, good management, easy going work environment, paid lunch, no uniforms, friendly staff, knowledgeable staff, clean building."
good,"Lavorando in Amazon mi sono trovato bene su quasi tutto."
good,It's a good job for outside work life balance and they do their best to accomidate to family and education needs. You get to pick your schedule for the most part. The days are long but 4 days on and 3 days off are easier to get more done in your off time.
good,"La giornata di lavoro era solitamente quasi sempre in linea, in quanto svolgevo la mansione di sorter, ma alle volte venivo spostato per svolgere altre mansioni, questo lavoro mi ha permesso anche se purtroppo per poco tempo di crescere in un ambiente giovane e dinamico, è vero che il lavoro non è sicuramente leggero o da prendere alla leggera, però mi ha permesso comunque di fare delle conoscenze e imparare nuove mansioni, i leadership erano sempre disponibili e attenti al lavoro che si svolgeva, la sicurezza è sicuramente un fattore che è stato preso molto sul serio in questa azienda, certo è che bisogna sempre fare attenzione a ciò che si fa, ci sono state delle giornate piene in tutti i sensi ma nonostante tutto ci sono stati comunque dei momenti piacevoli. Purtroppo questa esperienza è stata troppo breve, infatti come me anche altri hanno lavorato solo per tre mesi per poi non ricevere alcun rinnovo. Nonostante la voglia e la buona volontà di continuare a svolgere quelle mansioni."
good,You need to work hard and be able to maintain a fast pace. Watch your time because you can lose your job if you miss too much. There are opportunities to learn new things at times if you are willing and prove to be able to handle your first position.
good,I really hated to leave Amazon. The pay and benefits were really great but the drive was getting to be too much for me. You get to meet people from all over the world. The work is not too strenuous but you are on your feet all day.
good,"Great place to work if you manage to secure a role within the company. Once your role is deemed unnecessary, good luck finding something within the company."
good,Good pay for warehouse work. Mandatory overtime sucks but if you need it it's nice. Just save your time for Sept through Dec if you don't want to work 12hrs with one day off a week for 2-3 months.
good,They never give raises unless you get promoted. They are flexible for being a extra job or if you go to school. They also pay better than most places for not requiring any type of skill. Very hard to get fired. That can be good and bad. bad workers will always have a job there.
good,"have to be very quick reminder they pay you to work not stand around, I enjoy working for amazon I have nothing bad to say aboit the company I just need more pay!"
good,I simply feel neutral toward the experience. It was a fine place to work in that you are provided every opportunity to thrive. The job itself leaves a small hole in productivity where many customers are bounced between departments to avoid taking a hit to your statistics.
good,The day was never dull there was always so much to do each and everyday the supervisors always made sure things were organized and ready for a productive shift.
good,"fulfillment center, fast paced. you're constantly learning."
good,"L'azienda è precisa, affidabile. La contatti facilmente per qualsiasi dubbio o esigenza."
good,"Much emphasis is placed on safety and productions rate, while very little emphasis is placed on quality of work.  I believe people should be productive and safe, but quality of work is essential and it does not exist at any level at Amazon.  If work is to be done it should be done right and to the best of ones ability!"
good,Amazon is a comopany that is always on the go and full of energy to service its customers. Offers great pay but has become very large where the individual is not as thought of as it was several years ago. Very long hours especially during the holiday season.
good,"Amazon is a good place to work. It is a fast paced environment. There is no time to waste as Prime deliveries and regular deliveries are the main focus. I am a Flex Associate. Being Flex is cool if you want to come in whenever, but is not great if you need it as a main source of income. I'd say the hardest part of the job would be walking A LOT until you get use to it. So wear your comfortable shoes when you start and invest in good quality walking shoes later on down the line."
good,I enjoy working for Amazon. The management is great. I like working nights. I just wish they offered more full time opportunities. I need more hours and benefits. I would love to work full time. Also I have been a seasonal employee for 5 months now was told I would have the opportunity to convert to regular employee after 90 days and the conversion process has not been offered.
good,"Travail de nuit proposé"
good,"If your looking for a summer job, Amazon is a good place to work. I worked as a part time picker during the summer and it was nice. I worked early in the day so i has the whole rest of my day after work."
good,"Productive and fun work place "
good,"Was there for two and a half years. Very difficult to move up in the area I was in. Even with the knowledge and even better thinking than some management, I was stuck. Seems the STAR process interview is made for certain ones to fail. Great pay though and they do offer career options like the healthcare field, CDL, HVAC, etc., and they pay 95% of that which is awesome. Just saying if that is not the place for you, don't just quit immediately. Can apply for career choice at the one year mark I believe. I am now a Phlebotomist and Medical Assistant Nationally thanks to that opportunity from Amazon. :)"
good,"It was nice being able to work at home, at any hours of my choosing. But i want to get back into a social workplace. I learned how to pay attention to details and to have patience in the work place."
good,"Good company to start your carrer with. "
good,"A great first job, though exhausting, and a  40 hour work-week is completed ion 4 days.  "
good,Some people gets the easy job some people get physical but the qualification and paid hours are same.All of worker should treat same.People should treat same
good,Had a few issues with management and had a difficult time proceeding through a busy day. Other than that great employer.I would work for Amazon again if I had the opportunity.
good,"Cool workplace. Multicultural. Excellent food. Friendly supervisors. Cab pick and drop facility. "
good,Not feeling challenged and there are cultural and management issues. It is a very employee friendly company with good benefits and compensation. The work is also very easy because of all of the streamlined programs. I would recommend to entry level EHS professionals.
good,The hours can be long and work never ending. Amazon did however afford me the opportunity to work with larger teams than my previous employers. Overall it helped me see how logistics operations works.
good,"A typical day at work involves concentrated work on your expected job responsibilities. But it also involves positive collaboration and communication with one's coworkers. I learned a lot during my time at Amazon, including the above work style as well as managing my workload in a deadline-driven environment. Management varied from person to person. The hardest part of the job was competing deadlines, but I learned to handle that through shrewd prioritization. The most enjoyable part of my job was my coworkers, the nature of my work (media, primarily), and access to my coworkers' dogs."
good,"I work 8 hours Mondays to Fridays"
good,"The workplace culture is very challenging and does not guarantee advancement in career. However, employees learn a lot from cross-training. It is also a very diverse work environment."
good,This was a seasonal job for me and an in between job. Very fast paced. A lot of favoritism. Managers need to be trained better.Too many egos.  I'm not a fan of working in a warehouse.
good,"AMAZON is very competitive.  They expect you to meet ""goals"" everyday with no expectations. As takes forever to get to your goal units per hour.. but drops dramatically when you stop. Even if your stoping is not your fault.  ie: the conveyor stoping or computer failure."
good,"Work is fast paced and hard on the body. Rates are high. However, liberal time off policies allow for unpaid as well as paid time off. Management is hit or miss depending on the manager. I am a fan of the Voluntary Time Off that can appear from time to time in the off season."
good,"Get to work on time, get to work on time, get to work on time. "
good,I have nothing good or bad to say about Amazon. It helps pay the bills but it takes 2 incomes to do that. Long 10 hour days. No matter what your doing all jobs there are monotonous.
good,"Just keep to yourself & work hard, some area managers may give you a hard time but keep moving & don't pay them attention because as long as you're working hard you're fine!!"
good,"very good place to develop you career.                    It gives work life balance.work from home option was also available which is very helpful .   Its still day 1 was our mantra during work ,which drives daily energy and gives us thrust to carry out the work effectively."
good,"My time working at Amazon was overall a nice place to work at. The working environment had good management. There are choices of jobs to choose from, being a scanner, puller, small sorts, etc. My choice of working was being a scanner most of the time as it was challenging."
good,Great fast-paced environment and love the ability to develop others. Spend a lot of time troubleshooting and trying to implement new practices to better service our customers. No day is the same
good,"I happen to like the way Amazon operates, but it is far from typical. There are no guaranteed hours, so if you need to depend on a job to make a certain amount of money each week, this is not for you. Shifts are posted online each night around dinnertime. It's first come, first served. You may pick up a shift and you may not. It really depends on how many shifts are posted, and this is controlled by a computer. The computer doesn't take things like snowstorms into account, so very often we are under-staffed. We are sometimes over-staffed as well. I'm told they are trying to iron the bugs out. Algorithms, etc."
good,the way of amazon is simple. Keep at 100 percent productivity which is simple and follow the rules or get out. The only way to get into trouble is to not follow the policies.
good,"ambiente di lavoro stimolante, diversità di mansioni, turni bene organizzati con rispettive pause"
good,"i worked as a picker, you would show up get your scanner and your cart get a list of assigned items you would have to get fill up totes and send them down a conveyor belt, not much to it youre on your own for a majority of the night no one is standing over your shoulder watching you work, VTO is offered almost every night. the pay is awesome and the work isnt that difficult"
good,"A typical work day for me includes processing customers orders. orders can range from groceries (food), household items, baby, pets etc. Orders typically come in from the time you clock in until it's time to clock out. Good walking shoes is highly recommended. Work hours ranges from an earl 6AM start until 8PM. Work Hours are posted 3 days out the week, where it's first come first serve."
good,"Fast paced during holidays. Always busy and no phones allowed on you. Only downside is that if you want to call in sick, you never actually talk to a person just a machine."
good,"I was in a bery bad car accident as to why i had to leave. I was unable to perform they basic task askes of me. Like standing,  lifting, or z 1walking for long distances"
good,it can be a lot on you but the benefits are great and depending on your manager you'll have fun. its a very fast pace and competitive work environment.
good,I worked here for few months for the winter season. I learn so much. Fun environment the people are great. Management is very helpful. I would go back in the future.
good,Sometimes heavy lifting but they never ask you to over work yourself just try to do the best you can. Management is very nice and they are open for new and better ways to do things
good,"Amazon is a good place to work, has competitive pay and benefits. Management can be better, but it isn't the worst I've experienced. Love the healthcare provided."
good,"If you're not a hard-worker or a workaholic like me, this isn't the job for you. The job itself is amazing but it takes a toll on your body. I lost 70 lbs in my first seven months because, as an amnesty associate, I was walking up to ten miles a night."
good,I really working here the people are great management is great I'm just in need of a fulltime position. The work here isn't hard at all and there is a lot of collaboration and togetherness.
good,"The people at Amazon workpalce are great if you do your job. It is hard to move up within Amazon, you have to move to a new state to do so. Hardest part of working at Amazon is getting used to the hard labor the workers are put through. For the first six months it's quite the adjustment on the body but afterwards you are used to it. Many people take this job at a temp job while others stay for years. "
good,"daily tasks as an Amazon warehouse associate included preparing orders for customers as well as packing them and placing them in the delivery area ready for the drivers to collect.  additionally, the job heavily involved the stowing as well as receiving of items as soon as they are unloaded from the trucks. daily tasks also included keeping the warehouse neat, which was done by keeping the shelves and dock area neat and stacking up all the pallets in order. Furthermore, unloading trucks was a daily routine, as well as carrying out the necessary TDR paperwork for safety."
good,I enjoyed my job and wish things had worked out differently in my personal life to allow me to stay with the company. I will probably go back when I am eligible for rehire
good,"you start off with a managers meeting and stretching, you grab your scanner and all your information is on the scanner. you go to work picking your items Amazon walk is 2 steps a second. you will walk 10-12 miles a day. the scanner will tell you where to go what to get and if your taking too long the manager will send a message to your scanner. you will get a 15 min break at 2 1/2 hours but it starts from your last scan and ends with your new scan after break. then youll do the same till lunch. after lunch you have another meeting with a different manager and it starts all over. the shift is 10 hrs."
good,Extremely Fast Paced Environment with a tone of manager turnover. Emphasis on building relationships internally and cross network. Great for project management.
good,nel periodo in cui ho lavorato ad amazon ho imparato a gestire un carico maggiore di responsabilita rispetto ad altri lavori.
good,"I liked the fast pace environment, the setting is a huge warehouse, but not crowded. Plenty of interesting things to see in the warehouse. Pay is decent."
good,Working at Amazon Fashion was a great experience. The workplace was very friendly and they took good care of people who they worked with. The management was really helpful and made sure that we had everything we needed.
good,work is work stay 5S though. Keep comfy sneaks...umm let me hit 150 characters please. Job is simple you clock in work hard make history and go home paid.
good,No job security whatsoever. If I could I'd still be working there but unfortunately they laid us all off rather unceremoniously after the holidays were done.
good,Bad management and leadership. Great infrastructure and ambience to work. Nocturnal animals do apply. Rotation of shifts is contagious. Overall decent company
good,Management could be better.Pay and insurance is good.Hardest part is to work and not except the VTO that they send out. Coworkers are very friendly and helpful.
good,It might be a good job but it wasnt for me it was taking a toll on me physically and mentally but i am willing to still find what i love doing on this website
good,"Simple tasks such as picking orders and restocking, fast pace work environment but not too fast. Management is hit or miss when it comes down to it. The hours are very flexible and great as a side job. Employees aren't very watched which causes a lot of unnecessary drama and also not so safe work environment. Have to keep yourself in check and not much help from management. Great flexible hours."
good,"Amazon is a wonderful outstanding company to work for, but as for the fulfillment management team they believe that the red vest is a simple of power and they will use their ""power"" against you."
good,"It's a good company to work for but I wouldn't recommend no one to work there because of the stupid writes up they give out! I dont see how can someone work to get better and have to constantly look over their shoulder for when a manager walks up to you and give you your written warning! It's very stressful to work like that, they dont understand that people make mistakes. I been with the company for almost 3 years and I wish I never transferred to the new facility in Orlando. I work my butt off and somehow I still get written up!"
good,"A good place to work if you need money urgently. There are also many people that work there so you get to meet different ethnicity. There is also free coffee, tea and juice for your breaks."
good,Amazon is a good company. They provide there consumers with a variety of items to choose from. The pay could be more for the hours they want there employees to work
good,"Fast paced and stressful-worked 60 to 70 hours a week, 6 days a week due to Christmas holidays, which was busiest time of year. Very short personal and lunch breaks."
good,It was a fun learning environment. Everything you pretty much have to learn to learn on your self. They like constantly moving people. Can’t sit down for one minute
good,"Hard work is rewarded , but slackers need not apply. Fun items in the busy period to offset hard work expectations. Reasonable benefits to those who are actually Amazonians ( permanent employees) though agency staff tend to be excluded form some things ."
good,None. Not fun worked u to the bone didn't care about their employees at all. Fake managers never got appreciated and always told how bad you were. Never recognize you for the good things you did.
good,"Depending on whether you work days or nights, it can be challenging at times. It is very fast paced and you will walk at least 10 miles a night. You get to meet interesting people from all walks of life and learn new things to help you in your role. The benefits are really great."
good,"Ten hours shifts with one hour break split in 3, 2x15 min and a half hour. Treadmill type of work, not too much contact with management. Time IN - Time OUT and home."
good,Not sure why they are having me fill this out. I haven't worked for amazon since 2001. It was fun back then but I understand that Amazon is a completely different animal now
good,"ok working space, calm managers, nice coworkers, friendly hr staff. Working there is a team effort.  When people dont do what they are supposed to do it makes the work load harder on the rest of the people on the line."
good,Overall amazon it a gook company but it lacks career advancement and the pay isn’t enough for the labor you go through. They expect you to work like robots with the same pace or faster.
good,mi trovavo molto bene in questo lavoro ma ho dovuto lasciare per la distanza quando mi sono trasferita
good,Working at Amazon has it's perks just like any other warehouse. What mostly stood out was the flexibility of its hours. What i liked out of the whole experience was getting right to work without any interruptions.
good,"moved trailers around the yard most of the day, good environment, most enjoyable part was that I just enjoyed moving trailers around, it came easy to me."
good,"A typical day for me is just sitting in my chair, a call comes about every 3 minutes for me so it's not completely slow but also not incredibly fast, you have 15 minute breaks in between shifts. Depending on how many hours you work, you get an hour long lunch. This company is great to work from home because of the flexibility I have at my disposal. The job is very good, environment from home is very comfortable, and the pay id decent."
good,"A typical day was pretty straightforward. Sort, stack, wrap, and transfer pallets worth of packages. On occasion, you could be selected to help manage other duties around the site, however they were all within reason. Any questions were answered and if you needed assistance it wasn't difficult to get some."
good,It’s a good job if your looking to make some money real quick but I wouldn’t stay too long because you’ll be doing the same thing forever. Great environment and good management.
good,"The atmosphere was great, employees were fun, management was engaging. Their on site medical staff was excellent. It was hard on my body to work there."
good,"Work load is exceptional but easily managed, however it was expected to be 100% during the operating shift, with no alloted time frames for being off the floor or away from the team.  Nor was there oppurtunity to take minor projects at home.  Yet if not completed, it was still expected."
good,Peak season is rough hours will always be 55-60 hours per week. No option for vacation time to be used during peak season as it always  denied. Peak season can last anywhere from 2-3 months straight.
good,"I enjoyed being employed by Amazon.  Everyday brought a new challenge to learn something new about the company.  Training was extensive and very well presented, however there were times when I would have to figure it out on my own."
good,Must be able to handle heavy work load. Good pay. Good place to work. Mandatory overtime during holiday season. Breaks can be longer when working mandatory overtime.  Overall will recommend to work at Amazon.
good,"My shift was 9 hours. It was a 3 month rotating shift. SO timings changes every 3 months. I learned how to write formal emails and handled 150 emails a day. Other than this there was professionalism about the work. The workplace culture was good. I learnt how a company should be handling problems and got to see the inside of the largest e commerce giant in the world. The HR system was so perfect."
good,"The culture created by the away and stay teams was excellent.  A lot of that was lost once the new managers were hired off the street and not trained in the culture that was set up originally."
good,"Can be a bit hectic at times.  Rates are always going up, but are usually attainable.  Sometimes the work is hard, but if you are willing to work it is not that bad.  I have learned to drive several fork lifts and through the Career choice program, I have attained a commercial drivers license at a very reasonable cost,  Overall a very decent place to work if you are not afraid to work."
good,"A typical day was very busy, which I enjoy. I like the face paces and fun work environment. The culture of the workplace was good. There was nothing hard about the position unless you were out of shape. The most enjoyable part of the job is the holiday overtime and extra pay. Working 60 hours a week was great."
good,"Have worked for Amazon since spring of 2014 Management has changed hands, and site is managed differently than the previous managers. As soon as the sort is done, we are told to go home. The previous management let us get our hours in and vto people who were anxious to go for the day. This was very fair but now the hours are shorter (after Christmas) and before Christmas were only get three hours a day. There are many Amazon sites and most are ten hour days. It would be a great idea if Amazon offered more sites as an eight hour day. Those hours are more in keeping with the usual work schedule for most people. Friendly people, easy work, stressful and exhausting at times."
good,"Sorting was an ok position but job can be very stressful during holiday season. If you aren't a full time employee, you do not receive enough hours weekly. Pay isn't enough for the amount of work and pace you work at."
good,"Easy job , good money .  But can become easily comfortable and get stuck .    There are growth opportunities but it us based on who you know , they cover it up real good though."
good,You would be paid well but they will work you as hard as it gets. Turnover is high across the board as I had multiple managers during my time with the company.
good,"It's really not a bad review. In a typical day at work, we being with stretches, safety tips, and basic info about today volume. Management is awesome. The hardest part about the job is trying to stay motivated. It's a a lot of positions to take on in a shift; however, I was always scheduled as a scanner. I hated being a scanner, I wanted to do something a little more exciting. I also didn't like the mandatory flex up; that should be optional, in my opinion."
good,"I was working for Integrity Staffing supporting the Delaware fulfillment centers.  "
good,"Part time position that is very fast paced sorting packages and assemble on pallets.  Keep up or you will be buried under hundreds of packages.  Supervisors keep an eye on this, however, and send additional help when needed."
good,"Unload inbound trucks on the dock, scan and sort boxes coming off the line, An expected rate on how fast you open, scan, and sort product to be delivered to another Amazon warehouse that puts together customer's orders online."
good,"Amazon is a great company to work for.  If you are willing to committ most of your time to the company great opportunities, development, and compensation exist."
good,A day worth of work at amazon is busy which hels time go by quick. I learned to work well with others as a team. The management in the work environment maybe a bit hard on the workers but its also understandable cause of there job title being on the line if work isnt done properly. The work place and culture is amazing at amazon you meet great people and learn from one another working as a team. The hardest part of the job is making sure that none steals a package after its been delivered. The most enoyable part of the jobis everything you gotta love what you doing at your job in order to enjoy working there.
good,Typical day at work had very low stress. Easy work with help when needed. Coworkers were helpful. Pay was good but just needed raises to keep workers wanting to stay.
good,Loved working at Amazon. Great management. Very fast paced. Can be mentally and physically draining. Very diverse working environment. OT is usually available.
good,Excllent place to work but if you are able to devote 80 hours a week. Compensation is awesome and cultur is great. For me putting 80 hours a week is not a bid geal. Loving it!
good,travaille avec de la musique. entreprise trés agréable
good,"This job  gives challenges  everyday  ,"
good,Long Hours stressful work environment. Short breaks. Non-stop work from start of work to end of work day. The upside is day one benefits and the kind of benefits provided.
good,An evnvironment where it is fast-paced and need to learn the ropes quickly. Some friendly competition here and there to motivate yourself to do well..
good,"I didn't work for Amazon as long as I would've liked due to unforseen issues. However, when I was there, the environment was welcoming and fun with great benefits. Now the pay can be over $17 and hour!"
good,"Si lavora bene e sempre sotto stress."
good,"My first impression in the short time I've been here is that the managers are young and immature. It's kind of like being in high school. However, Amazon pay is pretty good, and I am able to work it around my schedule."
good,"Muchas cosas pesadas para alzar, por lo demás muy buena empresa."
good,A typical work day at amazon is okay you'll never know what your going to be doing or how many packaged your going to get until you get there and look at the board with your name on it
good,very easy work. managers can be entitled and play favorites and make your job more difficult if you don't comply with them changing the rules to their liking.
good,Worked as a temp in customer service for Amazon. I liked working for them and would have continued if permanent jobs were available. This was a temporary role for the Christmas orders period.
good,"I like that you can do different things, it is fast paced and able to move around. pay was not enough for work that was being done. benefits was good. very helpful employees and management."
good,"As mentioned previously, some of the leadership could use some courses in Human Relations. All people are not alike or the same, and should be treated and spoken to accordingly. Their seems to be a lack of discernment or even jealousy/resentment towards people who strive to be comfortable or accepting of the Amazon culture."
good,As Amazon as the first BPO experience that I tried.I can say that it's enjoyable.Competitiveness arises.I got to have a lot of friends and my Manager is very good.
good,It's for the young. Many older folks can't take the pace. You are expected to produce. I've seen many people fired because they couldn't keep up. You are trained by other workers.
good,"Working at amazon was a challenging job, as far as dealing with meeting their expected rates . But amazon was a good job to work at because they had an fair pay rate, and benefits."
good,It was a fun place to work at. Meet fun new people and it keeps you busy. Hours are tiring but its great pay. I would most definitely work there again.
good,"If you can get up early and provide a quiet home office, it's super easy. There's no script, you have the ability to make decisions without constant approval, and there's resources for how to navigate specific problems - if you need them."
good,"I started with benefits and decent pay from the first day. The job is very physically demanding and starts to wear on you after a while. They are very strict on taking time off, once you use all of your unpaid time it is an automatic termination, so when i started to have medical issues preventing me from hitting my rate, i started looking for another job."
good,"Fast paced, high volume warehouse position sorting customer packages for delivery the next day. Volume of packages rose over time adding stress to accomplish our task."
good,"very fast pace environment, Pay and benefits are alright. Not very understanding to you becoming sick so if you need to call out make sure to send your doctors note right away."
good,"Great compensation, good work life balance, challenging culture, but limited career growth options for people in non software or hardware engineering roles."
good,Lots of turnover within management creates job-related stress.  Company focuses on change for the sake of change.  Seattle frequently doesn't really understand what's going on in Indiana.
good,"The good things"
good,"Worked in the summer, very fast and busy at peak times. There will be times of forced overtime or going home early due to early or late shipments arriving."
good,People who go far in Amazon are the ones who do not stay in the position and job type for longer than a year and a half.  The culture encourages everyone to apply for other internal jobs and learn new skills or get the educational to apply for those jobs.  Once you reach Level 4 status it is easier to move around in the company and make connections.
good,"Amazon is overall a good company there are unfortunately a few minor adjustments that could be made. I have worked as a supervisor before of 3 departments and there are some things that I would do different."
good,"Loved this job, only left due to serious medical issue. Fun place to work. Fast paced and always busy. Opportunity for overtime. Would go back if I didn’t live so far away"
good,"They need to fix the parking situation or else be more forgiving of being late, little longer lunch and breaks for such a big warehouse and working 12 hours, you do't have much time once you walk to the front; besides that it was a good company"
good,"Amazon is a fantastic company to work for. Everyone is super nice and leadership actually cares about your well being. However, they use a third-party to set accommodations, and Amazon is not great at working to figure something out that suits both them and the accommodation need."
good,"The role was a very fast paced and repetitive environment. One of the many great things about Amazon was its diverse culture.  They hired all walks of life from veterans, the disabled to the retired."
good,"The work is easy, but physically demanding. You will walk 10+ miles a day. Peak season (Christmas) requires working 50+ hour weeks. You do not get holidays off."
good,"Ganz normal Lager Arbeit, Bei Amazon ist es so man kann niemals klar wiesen was der täglich zu tun habt"
good,"It's my first job.There i improved my communication skills,personality etc.The management of company is very nice. i won most prices at there such as for punctuality, hardworking, quick learner etc."
good,"Amazon overall is not a bad place to work, it can be a lot at times especially during peak. But overall its ok the benefits are good, the money is good and it can take a lot of things as far as your bills"
good,"The average work day goes by very fast, especially in the busy time periods."
good,"ups and downs, there where a few good workers, the others were slow or slacked up which puts more tress on the workers that work fast. The trailers are tremendously dusty and it can hurt the workers lungs in the long run."
good,Amazon is an excellent place to work if you are just now entering the work force or are in need of honest employment. I am more interested in a position that has more options in terms of growth and compensation.
good,"Team work is key in this division, and working with truly committed and talented people makes this a great growing experience.  It's challenging and hard driving.  But also rewarding."
good,"Fast paced environment that monitors your every move."
good,It was the co-workers that kept me going. It is a collaborative and fun atmosphere when you work along side hard working people that are there to work but are nice. There was minimal drama queens and kings in my section.
good,Never a boring day always something new going on fast pace and must be able to work alone and safely while working. The work volume changes as the day go on must be able to adopt and adjust to thru out the work day.
good,"Good company to work for, highly competitive and very fast paced. Amazon has extremely high standards. They try to set you up for success but poor management preventsystem this a lot of the time"
good,"I made it almost a year, but it just got to be too much for my body to handle. I am older and have a few small medical issues, so that played a part. My supervisors were very nice and I got the impression that they wanted everyone to succeed. They always tried to speak when they past by to make you feel included. I was a packer, so I stayed in one spot all day with my head down working quickly to make my rate, so there was no time to socialize. I always manage to make my rate, so if you focus and stay on task you wont have a problem. The days were long and the breaks are short, but you do get use to it. The hardest part was my body hurting every day. My first off day every week was always spent trying to recuperate and when I got home after working 10 hours it was hard to handle my family responsibilities as a wife and mother. Overall, I would still recommend working there, just not long term. The benefits are excellent and the people I worked with were nice and supportive."
good,I do like working at Amazon. I generally have less stress compare to other places I work before.  You come clean at work and go back home clean.  People work and have fun  at the same time. You can make new friend.
good,"stressful but very rewarding company to work for. lot of phone calls and prospecting needs to be done. lot of corporate meetings."
good,Days were long and very busy. You learn to work quickly and effectively very quickly. Management communication was good for the amount of associates vs managers.
good,"I applied for FT Morning shifts. They only called me when they had positions for OVERNIGHT. This is the 2nd time they've done this to me and many others. If you tell someone to choose the hours that best work for you, and then they give you the opposite, that's bad."
good,"Company gets a lot of negativity but i think its a good company to work for. They do care about staff. I work in the Prime now section and haven't had major issues with anything. Sometimes when it doesn't feel right Amazon has a principle to have backbone, disagree and commit. The then do listen to your thoughts and process changes and this can then be rolled out network wide."
good,Excellent place to work! Calls are back to back so time really flies They give you all the resources you need to excel at your job. Customers take advantage of Amazons refund policy.
good,"excellent learning of the e-commerce world . "
good,"It’s a good job but I think the problem was adults who didn’t want to work , so their work would fall on other workers shoulders . Some managers favors their workers also which is not fair ."
good,Was pleased with job for the time I was there. It was a great job opportunity and provided plenty of working hours which was much needed at that time in my life. Never really had any issues with the company. Would definitely work there again!
good,I would go there scan my badge ho to pre shift meeting which includes stretch it was amazing the good people you meet always help you and it makes you feel Loved. My Manager always helping us if we had any problem with work or having technical difficulties but hardest part is standing same spot for 10 hours
good,Learned a lot working at Amazon. It was just not possible to complete graduate school while working 100+ hour weeks on site. I look forward to returning to amazon after grad school
good,"Its a great company to work for, where the pace of changes is high. Gets you to be on your toes, inspires you to innovate and think forward/ahead. Promotions are a rigorous process here."
good,The work isn’t hard but yuh are expected to keep up and make your rate. The hardest part is standing in one place for to long and heavy boxes. You have to make rate for the week to be able to keep working.
good,Ich habe gerne bei Amazon gearbeitet. Sehr nette Kollegen
good,"They provide the equipment and you provide the awesome service.  Amazon is great in comparison to other companies.  However, they need to increase the pay by 50% for what they want you to do."
good,"Amazon offers lots of opportunity to virtually all of its employees. This is great, but the caveat is that many-most positions are designed as revolving ""ground floor"" positions, meaning that you are expected to move up or on. Advancement is expected in you if you stay with the company. There is no resting on your laurels here. When you get to the point in your career where you want to coast, it is time to move on. Overall it's a fair deal, but one that should be understood."
good,"Amazon operates a very fast-paced Work environment. I can get extremely repetitive, but the days go by fairly quickly. The compensation is generally on with other warehouses $12.50."
good,"Good place to work but they seem to take on non British peope to be diverse. 6 times worked there with 3 different agencies. Always layed off but non Brits taken on."
good,I would advise anyone working there to keep track of your clock ins and outs. Point are frequently given for no reason which can end up in being terminated . They make a lot if mistakes on your paycheck. Keep an eye out for yourself!
good,"The Job sucks, There managers and PAs all know this. They will help you stay off the radar but kiss you regular life goodbye because your sleeping when off. You get four days on and three off, which in all reality is two days cause day one is sleeping. your coworkers will be the best part of the job. It's its own little city"
good,"While working remotely is generally allowed at work, there is still a culture of it as being “frowned upon”. Amazon has a natural tendency to take up all of your precious time away from family/personal life."
good,The pnly complaint was the amount of work they needed consistently for 12hr shifts. 250 items per hour needed to be constant or else you are getting written up.
good,"A typical day at work would start at 7:00 in the morning with sorting out parcels and arranging them from low to high numbers. Next step would be to carry the parcels to the van loading them high numbers first. After that we would start driving to various destinations (stops). When all the parcels would have been delivered we would return back to the warehouse for debriefing and sign out for the day."
good,"On a typical day I clock in grab a scanner and then get ready for the pre warm up  that the manager and supervisors along with everyone in that department, perform stretching exercises to prevent on the job injuries as well as being giving updates of the productions numbers from the previous day.  Once pre-warm ups are done we go to our workstations to start our workday.  I properly inspect products for damages before scanning them and packaging the product to be shipped to the customers.  It is a very busy workplace and sometimes can be very loud and hot.  I would recommend this workplace to a friend who is in need of employment but if you are not a person who is used to working in the manufacturing or production industry it might not be so enjoyable to that person."
good,"Being employed has changed my outlook on life, yes, they are that positive and passionate, not only about their customers but staff alike. It was an honour and privilege to have met so many different individuals and cultures, and hats off to the managers for keeping their fingers on the pulse ensuring productivity levels are met at all times. Work hard and the rewards will take care of itself."
good,"I would come into work put my belongings away and immediately go scan my work badge to clock in once it was time to start my shift. The area that I clocked in was also the same area you figured out your job role/position you would work for that shift. I then walk over to what they call ""stand up"". At stand up you would stretch before working since the work can be intense at times, and you would see the amount of packages that would need to be processed for that day and what would have to be completed during your shift. Your shift could be anywhere between 3 hours to 5 hours and that is because, they call it flexing up/down, which would mean you could either lose an hour or gain an hour. Once your shift was done you would just leave the premises unless you had to work more than one shift."
good,"I didn't really like the management and politics, however it was a good paid job. I don't have a lit of complaints I just needed to further my education in order to grow at Amazon."
good,The pay at Amazon is a huge selling point but it does come at a cost of your home and work-life balance.  Amazon is expected to be put first in every scenario and if you are unable to do that you will have a hard time staying there for a long period of time.
good,The new fulfillment center in Romulus MI is a nice clean and new. You can see yourself growing with this company especially in the next few months night shift just started this week so there will be plenty of positions to be filled management and the launch team is good and helpful so far we all new and growing together. Which is good now it's a progression all together so far so good
good,No other company has given me the opportunity to take on as many challenges and grow as quickly as Amazon did. I wouldn't hesitate to go back for another longer stint.
good,Amazon has great benefits that are reasonably priced.  The only downfall is that it takes forever to move up the chain of command and the hourly pay is okay.
good,"They provide essential training for the job allocated.  They provide PPE for safely carrying out the job.  They give swag bucks for the performing associates.  Swag store has lots of options.  Other things like the contest, free snacks, free Pizza etc.,"
good,It is a average company where surviving is really tough. There is less opportunity of advancement in leadership and career. They don't give opportunity to deserving employees. Sometimes hard doesn't get recognized for indirect labors who really works hard. They have all the benefits which is a good thing.
good,"You have to work 10 or 11 hours a day 4 days a week.  They have mandatory overtime shifts which makes for a long week, especially during peak season.The rates are high so you have to move fast and they do not hesitate to fire anyone"
good,"Management is poor, benefits great, ppl working there great short breaks it takes 5 minutes to get to breakroom. I don’t think there is enough older ppl in management"
good,Various schedules to choose from and competitive pay. The work is very simple but is fast paced. No room for advancement. Shifts are often cut short. Good for short term work while in school or as a side job but not something you would want to do long-term.
good,"Fun, fast paced environment, where u can make friends, meet new people “, gain connections, all while working hard to ensure people receive their product on time"
good,"It pays the bills.Lots of different people from different places,cultures.Easy to get certificate or certified for anything...great program for college students."
good,"Fast paced, hard work. Not enough pay for all the work that is required. Takes too long for company advancement. Benefits are nice and able to use immediately which is nice."
good,"I really enjoyed my time with amazon, however, most of the managers there need to take a managerial training course to better fulfill their job description."
good,"You must be ready to work all day every day to work well with this company."
good,It is a job. You show up you work. You go home. It's not a hard job but you are expected to work. Different departments in every building. So if you dont like what you are doing you can transfer to another department or building.
good,"All in all, Amazon is a pretty good place to work. If you don't mind repetitive work, it has an amazing benefits and time off policies. Very easy work if you like driving around on PIT equipment."
good,"Bonne ambiance au sein de l'équipe de travail, les débrifs en début de prise de poste sont là pour nous motivé"
good,Working with the inbound ops management. Working with retail tickets with vendors. Complete an average of 80% or greater retail tickets during the shift.
good,My only issue with Amazon it's the incredibly high turnover and how they replace people like it's nothing. It's cheaper to higher seasonal employees and fire the ones who last longer.
good,If you enjoy a fast past job that involves hard wirk and derivation then I would suggest Amazon to you. Also the night shift us the best pay and most relaxed atmosphere compared to the other shuts so I highly suggest graveyard to anyone
good,"if your young very good place to work, if in your 40's it is hard. I tried to hang in there but hours are long, wish I was younger to hang in there..."
good,I enjoyed working at Amazon but it is very repititive and a lot of walking. You WILL lose weight working there. There does seem to be a high turnover rate and I feel that if management was better the turnover rate would decrease but you have to stay self motivated. There are great opportunities within the company. Most layed back Warehouse i have worked in.
good,"Good place to work I wish it would have been permanent. The company was very organized with solid management.Workplace culture is Fantastic, everyone was was treated equally and worked hard."
good,I enjoyed my experience with this fast paced company. I learned new methodologies that will only increase my knowledge in operations moving forward. I recommend developing managers to apply.
good,All and all a decent place to work but it depends on your managers more than anything some are easy to work for while others tend to go power mad and want to write you up for every little thing you do wrong
good,"Typical day at work:"
good,"It is a fast pace job, get 3 breaks two 15 and Lunch break  30min. I was able to choose my shift and work days, They have 3 shifts. And you might be able to choose your shift, workdays and days off. Most of all I enjoyed the people I worked with it made the day go by fast and fun. Some of management was good to work with. I really don't have a complaint but I will say the job is not for everyone."
good,"dia de trabalho com muita entrega."
good,"good canteen, good managers that listened to employees requests."
good,Amazon is not as bad of a place to work like people say. If you are ready to work hard & get paid good money amazon is the place for you simple as that
good,Overall good place to work I would recommend to others. Only downside was not enough hours certain months of the year and then to many hours during Christmas time.
good,"I have been 08 years of experience where i worked withCafe coffee day ,Pvr cinemas and Amazon as well but Amazon is the beat in all of this because here we got fixed working hours and 05 days working and also after finiah the office hours we never got calls from office which is missing in all my last Organization but yes here i am working on 3rd party payroll which is disadvantage and also lake pf job security because we are not the core employee of Amazon. "
good,"Tout est dit dans le slogan Amazon, culture d'entreprise géniale."
good,Bonne expérience mais travail avec un rythme soutenu
good,"Amazon is a great place to be in if you are looking for great learning and developing solution having great impact."
good,Good company to work for.  Great management. Clean facility. Benefits are not good. Very safety conscious company. Would recommend for someone who is just looking for part time employment.
good,great place to work. Great opportunity for growth and expansion in ones career. Made lots a great friends and connections while working here. Lots of great perks
good,Learned a lot about hard work and work ethic.  Standing on feet for long periods of time was challenging.  Management was fair and would listen to concerns/comments.
good,"A typical day of work was not a negative experience, however it wasn't overly positive either. Most of the entire time while on the clock you are selecting orders, which is not overly physically draining, however it can become extremely repetitive and boring with no change up and a long shift on the floor."
good,"I enjoyed my time at amazon for the most part. I was there for only the peak season so it was fast paced, but the job security was not very great. People could be hited one week and fired the next. It was times i didnt know if id still have my job there because of the workload/work force"
good,"Work is easy, just do your job. Very fun environment.As long as you focus on yourself and your work you will have a fun time. Don't apply if you aren't a diligent worker. Not for lazy workers"
good,Learned how to build walls out of packages of all sizes and weights onto semi-trailers in a diversified workplace where management noticed my work ethic was accepted.
good,"For a seasonal gig, this wasn't bad at all. You have to understand, going in, that you're going to be expected to work overtime and you will be scheduled to work on EVERY holiday. However, overtime was time-and-a-half and holidays were double-pay (equaling $26.00/hr for me). They even send a weird letter to your family saying how sorry they are about your not being able to spend the holidays with them (almost like you'd passed away).  But, with the challenges came rewards. I won a free HDX Kindle (which had only been released days before), free t-shirt, digital picture frame and a Visa gift card. There were hourly contests and give-away contests and incentive promotions. They have their own version of ""facebook"" on their Intranet, solely for Amazonians (employees).  Five years later, I am still friends with some of the people I worked with on my team, and we only met one time (at orientation) in person."
good,"The culture at Amazon has always been a fun, customer focused one that cared about the internal and external customers. But as time has gone by it's continued to change into a very corporate type setting that almost feels reminiscent of high school. You have certain groups of people who are in the know and if you're a more introverted person it can be harder to get up the ladder even when you do keep great numbers. Interviewing skills are more important than actually having the knowledge to back it up. If you don't phrase your answer to the question in a specific way you're never going to get that position. But's kind of cut throat but it's also one of the best places to work for if you can handle all of that. The pay isn't astounding but the benefits are some of the best around. If you drink the Kool-Aid and get into the Amazon spirit, you'll do great."
good,The shifts feel a little long at first but you adjust. Sadly you can easily get  written up and terminated. Turn over rate is ridiculous. Great benefits though.
good,"A very easy to get job but extremely physically demanding. However it's a fairly drama free work environment. They have 4, 10 hour shifts or 3, 12 hour shifts. I've worked both and I have to say that the 3, 12 hour days are preferred. Their break rooms are well stocked with food and drinks. Plenty of microwaves and refrigerators to use."
good,Très bonne ambiance de travail mais il faut être en pleine forme physique.
good,Overall a decent place to work if you're willing to work hard for long hours. You have a rate that you are expected to hit every week. Sometimes these can be difficult to achieve if you aren't feeling well.
good,Worked overnights for a short period of time. Management provided opportunities to meet and greet and often provided lunch. Good training experience. Give them a try
good,If you like flexible hours and if you look to be busy this is the job for you.  you will always have work to do and never be bored.  You will be on your feet.
good,working at amazon has really taught me alot  how to work in a competitive environment with others. How to operate a forklift and how to maintain my work at an steady pace.
good,"I work with a great team, They are a fun group and are respectful. I like working here but the commute for me is far. Cross Training is available . I just wished I lived closer."
good,This job is definitely easy and requires little to no past experience. If youre looking for a job for a few extra bucks on the side then I would say its for you.
good,"I've been at Amazon.com for almost a year now and have enjoyed many of the perks the company offers, such as many different forms of paid time off, an excellent retirement plan, and great medical/dental/vision coverage and life insurance.  However, the work tends to get extremely mindless after the first few weeks and time moves very slowly, given that associates are expected to perform the same motion thousands of times daily with little to no errors.  Certain managers can be very pretentious and will write associates up for struggling to make rate, taking too much time off task regardless of how caught up they are, or the quality of their work.  It's very hard to advance within the company, and hard to justify doing given that you will have 10x as much responsibility with very little extra pay compared to the base salary tier one associates make.  All in all, for certain people this can be a great occupation if mental stimulation isn't what they're after and don't mind 10 hours of extreme repition.  There is very high turnover however, and it's easy to see why based on the work associates are expected to perform and the management that makes the workplace less pleasant than it needs to be."
good,Loved working here.  My only complaint is that you fit a rate ceiling within 3 years and it hasn’t been raised since.  Started in 2008 haven’t received a raise since 2012
good,"I learned a side of working that I have never encountered here. Working in customer service and going to school for engineering, I got to see the procurement side of a business. I learned how to calculate net ROI and estimate the profitability of products when going for resale. I was able to learn how to maneuver through Amazon's website as a seller and understand the complexities behind the website."
good,working at Amazon has helped me improve my communication skills and advanced them. However the hardest part of the job was speaking to foreigners. The management at Amazon was very friendly also praised me for my time at the company.
good,Amazon has an infectious culture. You will either love it completely or suffer there. Evaluate your fit before joining properly. 'The Amazon Way' is a good book to read as you explore Amazon.
good,"Work hard, but its fun if one is willing to do their job.  Great management, Understanding supervisors and they give you the tools needed to complete the job"
good,The job is not difficult but the management pushes everyone too hard. The company insists on hiring children much too inexperienced to be managers. The experienced workers get overlooked often. Great opportunity if you have no family or are just graduating college.
good,"Long hours but time working at amazon had its good days and bad days but all In all good its a military operation at this depot but an impressive building to work at, and this Christmas period was so busy"
good,"- Work is challenging, in that you always need to innovate and understand your business"
good,"You would most likely work 4-6 days 4 being mandatory and the 2 days is looked as over time but there will be days when those days are mandatory. Full time is 40 hours and if you are 5 minutes late you get a point, if you get 5 points you are fired. If you let someone that didn't work there, use to work there, or even still work there with your badge, you was fired. If you steal, you was fired. Simple and right to the point warehouse job."
good,I learned to work with many different kinds of people. management was hard enough to get you to be productive but also lenient enough to listen to problems in the work environment and fix them
good,"working nights at Amazon was difficult.  many coworkers did not make it two weeks before quitting.  If you can hang on and work the way Amazon demands of you, you can work anywhere."
good,"I work as a part of the reserves team. We get to set our own hours from a pool of hours that are posted a month ahead ever Thursday. Its what you would expect for a customer service job. I work from home, a computer is provided but there are a lot of requirements for internet speed and desk set up."
good,My time spent as a warehouse associate was well spent and the money was well earned. While it was hard work for those who can stick it out it provides a great deal of compensation.
good,"le probleme se trouve pour les horaires de pause,"
good,the job was a good atmosphere but the work in the picker section was very tiring on the body and the hours conflicted with me wanting to go back to school
good,"Work hard culture, very successful business but that is due to the long hours the teams put in to delivery.  Aggressive work culture but I learnt a lot!"
good,"decent job, other employees are good to work with. Our building went through some physical issues in the past few weeks but is working to get the team back the top"
good,The management teams seem to have an issue with recognizing talent based off of skill and experience.  The hiring and advancement through management trend is someone with military background or young college graduates.  The company is poor at promoting within the ranks.
good,"Working at amazon is stressful and time taking but beneficial, the management and pay is good,the working environment is clean, the hardest part of the job is the fact that you have to be on your feet 9 hours a day and it fast paced."
good,Normal working environment with a few exceptions. Busy place to work. Easy to learn processes for job requirements for most anyone. Well paid for job and the work week is manageable as the hours provide time for other life functions.
good,"Working in management at the company level could be stressful and some lack of communication will happen. They are very fast paced and goal oriented. As a Customer Service Associate, they will train you in what you must do and they are performance based. If you want to succeed, you will do what you can to be the best. If you want to advance, do what you must."
good,"you have the chance to learn new things everyday in a dynamic environment."
good,"Long hours on poured concrete can lead to high stress on the body. This tended to result in repetitive stress injuries and impact injuries."
good,"Amazon is a good job for someone who is able to work hard. They offer a nice benefit package, and also a tuition voucher program for school. Good pay."
good,Excellent culture of customer service where this is not just something that is said or talked about. It is life. You feel proud to  be a part of such an organization where you want to be nice and participate in what is being done.
good,"Amazon fulfillment is very physically demanding, and long hours. Most enjoyable part of the job is the atmosphere. Main break rooms have pac-man, basket hoop game, and ping pong table."
good,Mi time on here it nearly ended cuz I'm on agency and mi contract will expire but Im glad I meet new people kind and great caracters I achieve also a lot of new skills and experience on warehousing.
good,Whether it was prizes for going above and beyond or VTO time there was always something to expect each day at amazon. Overall the work was easy and but still interesting.
good,"During the shift I work, 430am-830am, associates are expected to build delivery routes for drivers in a specified amount of time. The times to build these routes can range from 7 min to 45 min. If we do not meet certain time/route building requirements, we are given a verbal warning."
good,enjoyable and very fast paced work load. interesting place to work.
good,"Being an Order Picker is not a hard job. You are a glorified shopper. The hard part is the repetitiveness of it. Plus pay is sub-par for the amount of work they want out of you. My location has the lowest pay out of the warehouses surrounding the one I work at. Until you reach a manager position, you barely make any money."
good,Amazon is a decent place to work for if not only for the benefits. They can't be beat. I applaud them on their employee diversity. This is a great job to work if you are a student.
good,"Part time job offer a large amount of flexibility. Job is not particularly hard , but it is physical. I have  been working at Amazon part-time (Less than a year)"
good,The position was relatively easy repetitive work. There was not a lot of valuable skills taught or learned and not very opportunities for advancement.
good,"The work environment is great and the company seems to really care...once you're full time and if you want to be part of management someday. Once you've been there a few years, if you aren't interested in becoming part of the management team the feeling that you've outlived your usefulness is a heavy weight to carry."
good,"amazon is a customer obsessed company, focused on meeting customer promise. My position is a positive challenge as no one day is the same. Skills i have learn i want to now express in other places."
good,It is a great  place to work they just don't tell you what job position they are hiring you for until after you accept the the job and do orientation.
good,Fast paced company to work for. It is a real physical job. You have quotas to meet. They give great benefits and a discount. I would have stayed there but I could not keep up.
good,Long hours usually work 7pm to 5:30am for night shift and when I was days I worked 7am to 5:30pm. So yeah 10.5 hour shifts 4 days a week sometimes 5 because this job does require you to work mandatory overtime when they need it. You get your 40 hours a week but the work is very mind numbing. Very tedious. All in all its a good job that pays well if it fits into your life style. For me it never really has fit into my lifestyle.
good,"In Amazon's IT team, continuous improvement and expansion is what it's all about.  There always unusual projects and opportunities available, and you'll be working with a huge variety of technologies."
good,Very fast paced warehouse where we worked along side Amazon Flex drivers. Shifts were only 5 hours long but you could stay longer if asked and wanted to help the next shift.
good,I was satisfied at Amazon as the workers.  Managers moved around to much so was difficult to process in career.  PA's where very co operative.  Enjoyed the team work enviorment.
good,"The job opposition was very busy, and there was no time to talk. The hardest part of the job was that, you had to be very fast and accurate with scanning the merchandise."
good,I would recommend this as a second job as it is only part-time. The atmosphere is that of high-school. It is a lot of younger people who would rather stand around then actually work.
good,A typical day would start at 6 am and would work until 6 pm. 4 days on 3 days off. Fast paced Safety Conscious. Stowing Items in Bins accurate counts of all products.
good,"The job includes standing for 10 hour shifts.  Lots of walking is required, and breaks and short.  The pay is not sufficient for the work involved.  The work environment is extremely fast paced."
good,"Good environment and fun place and culture to be doing private security for. Limited to the location of breaks due to employees and contractors were very segregated at times, but not all the time. Overall company culture was great at Amazon and for security contractors to work for during the duration of being employed there. A lot of nice people at Amazon that I encountered were helpful and friendly when communicating with Amazon employees. Overall a humble atmosphere and Amazon employees sometimes offered you a smile if you were working really late shifts and were very compassionate also in the mornings about us being at their buildings overnight and during emergencies was an overall great experience for myself."
good,"Everything is measured, and there are metrics for metrics all meant to help improve and analyze fine details of every part of the operation. This can get grueling however there is value in it to help the company succeed."
good,great place to work but low wages at first. you get to pick your own hours and peak season has more hours available.  really fast paced work environment but a casual experience.
good,When people say that you can quit your gym membership if you work in the warehouse. it goes to show what a typical day at work is like always something to do and the atmosphere is very unique.
good,It was good work while it lasted. Plant closed due to poor city management skills in negotiating land lease contract to keep Amazon in the locality...
good,Amazon is a company that has a wide range of job opportunities in both the retail side and tech side of the business world.  The tech side is growing very quickly.  It looks for the best candidates and encourage career grow in a competitive  atmosphere.
good,"Tthis is a great place to work but is in no way the path to a permanent job. as a temporary worker you know through out your time in the factory that you could be paid off at any time. your are penalized if you clock in late or leave early, using a points system and have set breaks and lunch times that must be adhered to. you are well trained in your specific job when you start and are given 4 weeks before your work and numbers are looked at and used in your evaluation, you are evaluated on a daily bases and numbers are given at the end of the day with suggestions on how to improve if they are not up to scratch. the hardest part of the job is working to these numbers because if you do really well one day and have high numbers this is now your line in the sand and you are expected to keep these number up every day with is impossible. the people i worked with and the managers were great and couldn't do enough to help, there is room in the factory to train in other jobs but i wouldn't look for a full time job, they do happen but very rarely."
good,"If you have competitive personality and loves to win, this is a good company. There are tons of opportunities to improve your skills and advance your careers."
good,"im a hardworker reliable and truthful personel would like to have this role , my typical day of work was/is perfect, learned more,had good atmosphere culture, there werenot hardest  part but more things to enjoy like driving PIT/POP truck."
good,A good place to work for juniors and beginners. Most of the job are without career progression and employees turnover is too high. Job schedules and shifts are not flexible.
good,"Nice environment and friendly people.  The pay and hours is not bad.  However, the work is exhausting.  I needed a change.  I enjoyed my time there but I need a more stable career."
good,"Great benefits. 401k, paid time off, unpaid time off, and vacation time,also voluntary time off. Night shift can be very hard on the body. No home life really except on your days off. Need longer breaks 15 mins are not enough and need more variety of shifts. People you get to work with are great. they become like family and they make it all worth it."
good,"Pros-They are a team oriented company, they offer many incentives for excellent work. Offer low cost health insurance. Cons- You were in charge of your paid time off and unpaid time off, once you used all your time. You would be terminated. I'm sorry but I think that should be HR's job to monitor employees time. They offered voluntary time off, when they were slow you were asked to go home with out pay."
good,"A typical work day was to go in and be prepared to work. Not hard or dirty work, but work. I learned always pay attention to what you do. Management is cool. They interact with you only because that's what they are trained to do. The workplace culture is another positive. Its a melting pot of so many different people from different cultures. The hardest part of the job is becoming too comfortable on staying and the most enjoyable part of the job is the fun activities, working with great people and the pay isn't bad."
good,"Amazon is a good company for people to work at. With limited to no college education you can make good money and advance with initiative and persistence. I've learned to always look to improve what we do in every way. By looking at everything as a surmountable challenge not an impossible task has helped me in my transition to other buildings. My typical day is getting into work thirty minutes before associates to plan the day. I look at available work to pack and coordinate with what we are going to pick. By making sure SWIP is at the correct levels we maintain productivity while creating a handoff for night shift to continue strongly. Most associates at Amazon have been with the company for many years which creates a expectation of greatness. Keeping them productive and helping them throughout the day with anything, as well as maintaining no customer experience misses can be challenging. I learned I do best with more expected of me. The more pressure, the better I perform. The most challenging part of my job becomes the best when I perform over 100% in productivity, maintain 0 CE misses, and keep associates happy. I look to maintain a level of trust with associate by interacting with them as well as rewards and challenging them to beat my production numbers."
good,Amazon was a great place to work. I did customer service. I got to work from home so that was amazing. I worked long hours. About 10 hours a day five days a week.
good,Pay isn't as high as other places but building is clean with friendly atmosphere.  Job tasks are manageable and there is room for growth if you want are willing to progress.
good,Job was very easy to learn. Hours were very short if not working during peak season or during a holiday. Pretty fun environment to work in. Hours to choose from was okay as well.
good,"- the work started with analysis of the accounts under amazon.com"
good,"The job can be ok sometimes, a hard part of working there is being on your feet on concrete floors for 10 hour shifts and hardly being able to walk when you get off. Management is just out of college, no people skills and a lot of favoritism."
good,"I always new what to expect. I wold start my day like any other. Go to work, clock in and begin whatever task i was assigned. as long as you reached your required work quota, no one would bother you. safety is key at this job. they will fire you in a second if you are not being safe."
good,amazon is good company but we can't do long time in this company why because it is complete standing work.it was very effect for health.and moreover night work was very hard.
good,The job has a good salary and great benefits; however you earn it. I consider it entirely computer driven. Supervisors lack personality or team building skills.
good,"Amazon is a fun place to work. The culture is geared toward the goal of making history and having fun while doing it.  However, mandatory overtime during peak seasons and changing job descriptions made it less desirable."
good,"Enjoy working here, unfortunately they cannot provide enough working hours."
good,Each day I complete different tasks but most of the time I am working in the packing department. Some days I drive the order picker to complete case picks. Other days I work as an ambassador where I train the new employees as well as help existing employees improve. I am also a member of the safety committee that completes several projects around the building to ensure a safe environment.
good,Nous étions aider continuellement par nos supérieur
good,"Working in a warehouse setting was fun and different. There were many different titles and jobs there. I learned about shipping and receiving, and labeling."
good,Amazon est une grande entreprise mais qui gère un minimum ses employés et s'occupe de leur bien être.
good,"petty reasons can get you terminated.  competitive at times, but relaxed environment.  safety team is a bit too much.  can easily advance at least one step."
good,Be ready to move while working there. I was able to cross train in a few departments and every one of them you are rated based on the amount of work you can accomplish.
good,"Amazon is a good place to work, with an inquisitive mind and a good work ethic anyone can advance there. The pay is fairly low until you get into management. I recommend this job to anyone who dosent mind being on their feet 10 plus hours a day and has a willingness to go the extra mile."
good,"Tive a oportunidade de aprender os padrões Fiat o qual fui responsável pela parte do meio ambiente."
good,The work there starts as the shift comes in then the management lets you get directly to your designated job area. They do have expectations of how fast you should be working but for the most part allow you to work at your own pace.
good,It's a ok job. Helps pay the bills. The managers aren't really around and some of the human resource people don't really tried to help you when you need it. I recommend that you get good running shoes when you begin working here because you'll be on your feet all day.
good,This is a high productivity based job. You are expected to perform at an increasingly more efficient pace each day. You are on your feet for the entire shift.
good,"Fun place to work,  although they are very passionate about quality and productivity. You make a mistake they are quick to tell you about your errors. If you don't maintain a good score for 2weeks they boot  but at the same time you can allways come back in 8weeks and start fresh, I've been there twice so can't be that bad. "
good,A typical day is announcements and stretching.  Receive your assignment and report to your station and begin work. You are required to work at a pace necessary to meet the high standards.  You work till the first 20 min break and then return to work to do the same work til the second 20 min break and then back til the end of shift.
good,"The overall environment in the department i was in was ok as long as you stay busy. Since there are quata demands, it was hard for less motivated individuals to remain competative. To move up wasnt necessarily desirable because there was little compensation to do so.  Even if you didnt mind the pay, to get a postion in management seemed more like a popularity contest."
good,Got to learn things as Amazon operates globally. meet with different people. learned about leadership principles. It was fun and learning at the same time working with this company
good,"You are your own success. Amazon is a great platform, but you still have to fight to get to the position you desire. Great company. Great principles. One Team. One Fight."
good,"-jobul include multa rutina, limitare in creativitate si impunere de standarde."
good,"Working with Amazon causes you to think quick and on your feet. It has given me the skills I need right out of college to be a better, person, manager and overall worker in life. It is the greatest place to earn life and work experience all in one year."
good,"The hardest part of the job was the lifting of heavy items,without any help, the most enjoyable is you get to meet new people and the benefits are awesome in my opinion  compared to other places, they even offer one thousand dollars to associates  at the beginning of every year, if you choose to leave because you might want to try something new as far as a career, and don't forget they also offer education courses in the facility, so for me overall it's a great place to find yourself employed."
good,I liked to work this kind of place . All are performing their job in a good or polite way. Before start any work they provide training that’s good for everyone easy to move in new working environment.
good,"As stated, a good place to work as long as you dont take voluntary time off without checking at hr that it was coded correctly. Going into negative unpaid time off, even if it was because a manager didnt code you properly, is an automatic termination. I would love nothing more than to continue my work there, but that option has been taken from me."
good,"started at 730.left to deliver around 830. start actually delivering about 900. try to balance speed of delivery because the faster you are, the more packages ""they"" will give you to deliver. OR they will have you pick up packages from a ""slower"" driver. never know exactly when you'll be off. started from 100 packages with 75 total deliveries. working quick earned me 180 packages with 150 total deliveries. If I managed to get that done I would still have to ""help"" a slower driver. pro tip: work at your own pace, not too quick as to be overloaded by slackers or excess packages and not too slow to where you're always being helped and being at risk of being replaced!"
good,"You have to make a certain rate per week. The rates are sometimes unrealistic depending on the departments. The managers are hit and miss. You only get a certain amount of hours instead of days off to use each year, ALWAYS work holidays. They try and let everyone out early thanksgiving but christmas is the only holiday off. Accomodations for employees with kids are almost non existant. All of the coworkers are friendly and helpful."
good,"Amazon is a great company to work for as long as you are willing to work hard. The management turnover rate was high so it was sometimes hard to connect with your direct manager to get assistance with moving up. The pay was very competitive with other jobs in the area and the insurance was great. I have no complaints about working with Amazon, it was just meant as a temporary job for me though."
good,Easy job  with decent pay just gets tiring after awhile. depend on the amazon there is plenty of room to grow. Some down sides are thy always changing the roles
good,"They went above and beyond, maybe because it was a new facility, but I enjoyed my time. I moved up fast and the pay was amazing! I worked in Kansas City. They had ping-pong, foosball etc."
good,"Good job, sometimes a bit much with micromanaging everyone. Lots of changes with processes, sometimes not needed. Great benefits and great co workers."
good,Overall good job if I still lived in PA I would go back there. They offer alot of overtime. The company is really starting to grow. Happy with success they are having.
good,"Amazon is a very organized work place, a typical day is very busy because there are lots of orders to be processed. i learnt to work with speed, enjoy my job aand place customers needs first. The management are very friendly and organised thus making the job enjoyable. The most enjoyable part is having everything at your disposal during break period, the cafe and fee drinks and all given to staff everyday. its really fun working here during christmas season, everywhere is lively, music playing,, gifts everywhere"
good,"Amazon is a good place to work. You get 10 hour work shifts and you get your benefits straight in the door. You get PTO, UPT and vacation days. It can be very tiresome at times. You just have to have the drive."
good,"Amazon fresh has you as ""seasonal"" to keep from treating you as a real employee and to keep from giving you full hours. there are no benifits as seasonal, no pto, nothing. Also 10.75 is not nearly enough for working in -10 degrees. walmart pays you 24 and treats you like a real associate."
good,Good experience I was able to learn many things and Woud be willing to learn more . To become a worker you have to stay positive and that’s exactly what i did
good,"agréable, mais très fatiguant, il faut suivre le rythme"
good,"I enjoyed my time at Amazon Logistics. It was, different every day and I met a great bunch of friends. Left due to moving or if the area. Would highly recommend"
good,"i have worked for amazon for almost 2 years. In 6 months i went from a team member to an assistant manager. Love working there. My typical day would start by making sure all stations were ready to go, we had all the announcements ready to give, schedule and assignments were ready. through out the day made sure employee's were within the rate scope. gave feedback when needed. helped on floor when things were falling behind. Answered lights and questions. educated/ trained. set up classes for more training."
good,After Christmas it all slows down its good during the season but loses its routine by after the holidays. The pay was good but had many hours that didn't have flexibility with the employees demand.
good,"The work you will be doing will be fast paced and will not see the results of your actions later, but more in real time. This is a super fast paced company, and with such - requires your upmost attention and sometimes life. The work to life balance outside of the corporate headquarters is laughable - once you become a Process Assistant or above, getting calls, texts and having to handle issues off the clock will become every day. This is ""looked down upon"", but if you didn't do it, the business would not run like it does, or you'd come in the next day or after your last day off and get a face full of issues."
good,"After many years in the workforce across many different companies, Amazon.com has been the sole employer that I actually enjoyed being a part of. The company culture is amazing, they actually care about their customers and give you the tools to deliver the best service possible. "
good,"fast paced working conditions, good security great supervisors very safety and health conscious company keeps everyone informed and offers generous overtime if needed"
good,"Amazon has long hours don't allow you to have a well-balanced lifestyle. The hours can vary from 10 to 12-hour shifts base on company needs.  The job is fast pace and productivity is at a high standard very little margin for error. To be frank, if you are single and don't have a family then Amazon is the place for you but if you do have a family Amazon should be given a second look pending on each individual circumstances."
good,The type of work that I did for the company was work from home. It was a seasonal position that allowed you to choose the right time to work for you at the beginning. I would say that the hardest part of the job was to calm down the client enough to be able to help them. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I was able to resolve their issues.
good,"-Communicate with vendors and vendor managers"
good,I like working at Amazon but the danger of being fired is high and they don't give you advance warning. The managers are usually nice and understanding until it's time to let you go. But that's most places. They need to pay more for the amount of labor we put in and include a sense of security instead of always on the edge of termination.
good,"I worked at Amazon for a Summer job and I had fun. It was a fast paced environment, but never boring. I met some good friends too. But, I left because Amazon opened up a new facility in Chicago and we lost half of the package Volume. As a result, I couldn't get many hours and when I was working, there was not much to do."
good,Good place to work. Although a fast paced environment you're  always kept motivated and made to feel appreciated.  Everyone is friendly and gets along.
good,it was a decent job just wish they would have just hired me full time instead of making me wait a long time. nice job the hours are long. the people are nice
good,"A typical day at work involves a lot of manual handling, lifting or moving things from one place to another. Therefore, you have to be physically fit and have the strength and endurance for the job"
good,"during peak there was caos on the floor. Being a new building,there was no order or enough training for the supervisors. everyone was running around with no direction."
good,"Working at amazon was an interesting and fulfilling job. My only complain was the amounts of harassment that was never taken seriously. That managers would fraternize with the associates and try and get ""favors"" from them for promises of promotions and favorable indirect rolls. Other than that the job is perfect for those who love to stay busy and enjoy a positive challenge."
good,I worked in the huge warehouses in Redlands and it was very fast-paced. The employees were polite and helpful. Just wish they had full-time opportunities!
good,Me formaron como Problem Solve con personas a mi cargo
good,"I looked at this job like joining a gym but they pay you and you can’t get up and decide you don’t feel like going.  It was physically hard work and fast paced but less stressful than my day job.  I look forward to going back.  During peak season they had drawings for prizes and brought in food.  I got sweaty and got in approximately 10,000 steps (fit bit) in a 4- hour shift."
good,"Il turno inizia guardando uno schermo per capire in quale processo si è stati messi: es. Receive, stow, pick o pack, dopo di ché si va in postazione e si lavora per circa quattro ore per poi fermarsi per mezz'ora di pausa e dopo rientrare x finire le otto ore di lavoro"
good,"Amazon is a great company for a fast paced friendly competition type person. They claim to be extremely customer focused, and it's quite often true. The toughest part of working in a fulfillment center is the competitive ""rate"" that is expected of employees for completing amounts of work in their respective areas. That said, that ""rate"" is what can make the work fun and competitive, and that competition heats up when the management team offers up prizes for the top rates."
good,"Amazon is a cool friendly environment. clean workplace and friendly staff. they let you control your own vacation , paid time off, and unpaid time hours."
good,did learn allot and met some good people. management was a bit oblivious to some of the shananagines the employ's are doing out on the floor and even right in front of them.
good,"A typical day at an Amazon sort center is very fast paced. Management pushes and incentivizes you to perform your best in every position. You'll have to work hard but the pay and benefits makes it worth it. The management runs a very tight ship and everything is optimized to run as efficiently as possible. There's a limited workplace culture because the nature of the shifts has you working in different positions with different coworkers and managers so there isn't too much room to form a tight knit group. The hours are limited, only able to be assigned 20 hours and pick up 8 hours of extra shifts outside of your schedule which can be additionally difficult because with a two hour break between shifts taking a double shift can be a 10 hour commitment. However with such short hours it can be an excellent option for a second job. This isn't the type of place to build a career in though as there isn't much room for advancement above your basic part time pay. The only full time employees are the managers and a few other niche jobs."
good,"If you're a hard worker and can do the job take the position. Its a good job to have, benefits are good, time off is acceptable. During some weeks we are provided lunches!"
good,My experience was good I never having complain for a job but i suggest them to give full time opportunity and to give them growth in a job position based on their performance with full time and other benefits
good,"Amazon FCs are big and the work environment is fast paced, sometimes to the point where some people struggle to keep up. But, there are different areas and processes, and as long as you keep your chin up and work hard, you'll find yourself cross trained into a different path at some point. It's not for everyone, but the benefits are great, and if you're an Amazonian, you get a lot of perks. Just be prepared to work hard."
good,"management sucks, you had to keep a rating of 100 or more every week. hours were stressful since you only work 4 days it includes 10 hour shifts and for peak 12 hours other than that its a manageable job"
good,Need better shifts available for people with different schedules. I wish that they were a little more flexible with emergency situations. For working in the warehouse they should have better pay.
good,"excellent team work relationship, My position is co employment staffing with a contact agency assisting with temp to hire staffing with our business partnership to drives safety results and reporting."
good,Every department requires the employee to hit a certain rate. If that person does not hit rate they retrain them up to 3 times and if they don't hit rate still then they are fired. Once you get past the initial challenge of hitting rate then they offer other tasks for you to do. I did problem solving and training on top of what I was supposed to learn first.
good,"Typical day at work, for me it varies: sometimes it's slow other days it's fast and ends abruptly. Things are always changing so learning to adapt is important but for the most part you're pretty well equipped there and sometimes well trained.. I learned to expect the unexpected and prepare accordingly. Management is a very good example of adapting because every 2 months ago someone's added, moved, or deleted but one thing always stays constant they never stop striving to help us succeed despite the fact that it doesn't always seem that way. Even when they're constantly calling us to the manager desk to lecture us it's to push us forward. Hardest part is the unexpected overtime that's one thing that almost everyone has trouble adapting to because it's difficult to plan for. Most enjoyable thing about Amazon is the opportunities to learn new things and be trained in new departments. It's also a great feeling to be a part of a much larger machine and to get the chance to understand how each part works. Peace..."
good,"I love my managers, love my team and love going to work, but it does not use my degree, it is dangerous, and exhausting.  It is hard at first to meet expectations and there is a weird dynamic between departments that is hard to get used to."
good,il lavoro e tranquillo e anche bello niente da dire
good,"Very fast place facility and plenty of opportunity got advancement."
good,"As a yard transportation specialist safety was the number one thing. Yard audits were a daily function. Management was not necessarily always around, but easy to reach out to. The hardest part of the job was troubleshooting loads that would not pop up in the system."
good,Alot of hours but benfits are really good pay is fair.  benifits are good as far as paid time off and vactions it is really hard to advance to mangement postion company hires outside of company for that often.
good,"Working in Amazon was a good experience for me. I learn how to scanning packages to pallets, lifting boxes and reopening pallets. I really appreciate the job, if I have a opportunity to work again I will be very happy."
good,Amazon is a great place to work. You will always be challenge and guaranteed to work outside of your normal job scope. You will be challenged and gain valuable skills and professional experience.
good,A typical day of work was fast paced. The job was easy and fast paced. The managers were there to assist you with your job. The pay at the job was great.
good,Amazon is a great company to work for.  My only issue is that the hourly pay for part time employees plateaus at $13/hr at the sortation facility.  I am looking to work part time for a company that offers more advancement options.
good,"great benefits from day 1, a lot of over time during peak season. good company over all. Room to advance. Shifts go by quick.Always busy. would work there again"
good,L'échauffement et le discours du manager avant la prise de poste est agréable
good,"My only negative comment what that I couldn't schedule at 1 hour intervals, I had to schedule continuously at 30 min intervals, which when you are trying to schedule 40 hours a week a month in advance can be a total pain. But I totally loved the flex schedule bc it allowed to me work around my life, not my life revolve around my job."
good,it was awesome and the employers were awesome. i never had a problem working there only the janitors i sometime had a problem with because i always catch one of them just barely cleaning and would rather eat in the dark listening to the spanish radio.
good,Loved my job there.. i wish they hired permanent and not temporary. Nice lunch area..comfort rooms and resting area..relaxed atmosphere..you can eat at your desk..they feed you on occasions and they have group activities..
good,"Not many opportunities for advancement, very fast paced working environment. Not much down time at all, you are always working and if you have nothing left to do, you will be told to do something else."
good,"It is a solid hourly position and has good benefits.  The salary is a little lower than what it should be, but the pay differential for overnight shift is fair.  It is a very production oriented position and requires you to meet the production goals and they will hold you to those requirements or terminate you if you fail to meet the standards.  "
good,"Full-time is 10 hours per day in most cases and 40 hours at week for the most part, benefits are very good. Is a vey fun place to work, for the most part management is very understandable. The hardest part of the job is their wrong calculation in numbers that put workers stress level very high, and cause many injuries by overworking employees."
good,Amazon has a  Fast Pace environment. Jobs are repetitive. Diversity is what is driving the team at AMAZON. Managers always changing and most of them lack interpersonal skills. It's all about making the rates.
good,Amazon is a very diverse company with many different people of different backgrounds working there. It is a medium paced environment to make sure all goals are met or exceeded within the shifts.
good,Fulfillment center focused on operations side only. No visible track to easily transfer out of operations if wanting experience elsewhere. Can be difficult to balance work/life depending on shift assignment
good,The work environment is challenging and sometimes it is a good thing. The management team is poor with a few good ones out of the bunch. Work is supposed to be fun and challenging not stressful and challenging.
good,"constant work mostly "
good,I enjoyed working her although only for 4 months part time seasonal. You get plenty of hours and the option of personal time off on slow days but do not have to take it.  Takes most of your day. Plenty of benefits. Overall I was happy with this job.
good,"2011-2013 was a good time to work for the company, the artistic areas of the company was more lax in culture and the new amazon mindset hadn’t taken hold yet. I doubt it would be the same now."
good,"Typical warehouse grind everyday. You go in and give them your time, and then they pay you. not much is required in education or skills. just stay focused on what your task is either picking packing or loading and you will make your rate."
good,En Amazon trabajé 9 meses lo malo que estuve de los 9 meses 6 sin librar ningún finde semana mi vida familiar se me anuló y no había forma de librarlos
good,"hours are horrible, have to work weekends workers who have been there for a while don't do their fair part and they make the new hires do everything, some just walk around looking like their doing something but they are really not."
good,"Amazon is a great company to work for, but it is so big and competitive it is hard to make a mark or get promoted unless you are constantly lobbying and throwing elbows to get ahead. I enjoy the competitive style, but I am not naturally inclined to continuously toot my own horn, and that is required in order to be promoted at Amazon. Because it is such a large company, the scope of every role is narrow. You are expected to go deep, which I enjoy, but sometimes this becomes prohibitive to personal growth."
good,"Typical work days span 10.5 hours broken down into 4 quarters.  There are 3 breaks across the day that are spaced no more than 3 hours apart from each other.  It is a fast-paced and very productive work environment.  Its stressful to some people, but it really depends upon what you make of it.  Other people love doing it.  Its a very physically demanding job, whatever your assignment.  Aches and pains all the time are a normal thing.  Working with machinery, lifting heavy loads and operating product loading vehicles can present some safety hazards, that must be avoided everyday on the job.  If you're not careful there are plenty of situations that will come up across the day where you can injure yourself or possibly even others.  Given this aspect of the job, the hourly pay rate is not good enough.  Most Day Shift Warehouse Associate positions start at only $13.00 per hour.  It should really be closer to $20 per hour to accommodate this aspect of the job.  Possibilities for advancement seem to be pretty limited too unfortunately.  I'll never forget when I was just casually speaking to a coworker about their time with Amazon.  They'd been with the company longer than I have: about 4.5 years, they said.  And yet, they were still stuck at an entry-level position making only $15.25 per hour.  So now they're making an extra $2.25 per hour after working hard for 4.5 years?  Not good enough at all.  That was incredibly discouraging for me to find out, and completely changed my view of the company.  But the overall job culture feels very welcoming and positive.  The management teams"
good,I was a stower so if you like to stand in the same spot and be by yourself for at least 3 hour periods than this job is for you. I loved the paychecks but I didn't like peak season and prime week/month.
good,"Meeting w manager before shift starts everyday."
good,"11 hour days suck for some people. It was fun people to work with though and I like the managers, but the full time people have hard lives. They can’t work 11 hour days and still function normally."
good,Usually busy but there is a great mix of fun and productivity especially during peak periods when management put together various activities to motivate staffs to help fulfil customers' requirement.
good,"The peak season is extremely intense--requiring mandatory 12-hour days and 50-60 hour weeks from Thanksgiving through the New Year.  It is very stressful and tiring.  The money during that season is good, but all you do is work and sleep.  The warehouse during that time is clogged full of people stocking merchandise as well as picking orders, making it doubly hard to do a good job.  "
good,It is really not a bad place to work.  It is the perfect place for people who are just starting out in the working world and/or even for elder people who just want a little more income.  Overall I have enjoyed working there. I learn a lot about Amazon flow works. I got to finish some more of schooling that I wanted to take and took some refresher courses that go along with my associate and bachelor degrees.  Its just time for me to follow my dream of working in the Medical field. Amazon does support their associates to follow their dreams.
good,It’s a fun and productive work environment they always try their best to compensate their workers and will work with you because they understand that life happens
good,Not a bad place to work but sometimes the communication was bad between the workers and management . And the break are only 10 minutes not 15 minutes.
good,"clock in at 7 Pm "
good,Very good company.... I learned lot during my internship period.... Unforgettable experience..We can work for long hours if we wish to work.Have fun work hard make history.
good,"Must stay on Task."
good,"I've learned how to operate two types of warehouse machinery. The most enjoyable part of my job was the feeling of accomplishment while being recognized for my hard work, by my superiors."
good,So far so good. Great work environment.  Need to pay better. Great benefits though. Really need to find a better break system.  The warehouse is so big takes precious minutes away.
good,"From day one a lot of information will be given to you. It is strictly up to you to keep track of that information and ask questions when information is not clear. You will be held responsible for keeping up with various responsibilities. There are some fun moments like when we got peak and prime day shirts. Also raffles were drawn and prizes ranged from gift cards to kindle's. Overall, not the typical work place environment. Much independence is expected of you from management."
good,good for people without families. manage your time if you want to work here. people from all backgrounds work here. be prepared for hard work and many hours. best paid place to work in the kc area for new college grads
good,"Great job to know how metrics and continuous improvement process works, but lack of leadership from Senior Operations Manager was terrible.  Calling people liars when documents proved otherwise, no guidance or direction from leadership.  Two (2) Area Managers resigned their position because of lack of leadership.  Work overall was fun, most of the workers worked hard to get the job done and many were cross-trained into different areas, which is always a benefit."
good,after you work there for about a year they pay for you to go back to school. so that's one great benefit. they also have a lot of overtime so its really good pay
good,"Warehouse"
good,Management is always changing so don't get use to a specific manager for too long. Set schedule and set hours which helps if you are looking for something with structure. Do need to learn lift equipment which involves raising and lowering from heights of at least 25 feet.  Safety conscious environment and friendly coworkers
good,"You will learn a lot and work your tail off. Amazon culture is extremely demanding and full of smart, driven people doing really cool things. Highly recommend as a place to accelerate your career growth."
good,"The job it self isn't very hard, but when you are working, you are working hard and quick. The environment is actually very lively and fun to be in, no one discriminates and everyone is equal. The management actually adds to the fun and greatness of the job, they are hardworking people, but who know to have fun too. The hardest part of the job is to deal with the environment outside. In the Summer its the heat and in the Winter its the cold, but that is to be expected in a warehouse job, so if your able to deal with that then you should be fine."
good,"Relaxed work but sometimes to relaxed. Some people work really slow and stand around talking, while others work really well.  The work is easy and training is done well!"
good,"While working at Amazon I met great staff and learned a few new things in quality control for trade. However, I was extremely luck to get a more interesting job compared to loading a truck or packing a box. The job is 8 to 9 hours on your feet and can be really exhausting but overall worth the money due to the constant need for overtime."
good,"Though working as a picker is rather difficult for  the first couple of weeks, it really does become easier and mindless over time. If you can walk at a decent speed and skim quickly on a radio frequency scanner, its really an easy job. The pay is on par for the job you do, and the hours are great. Ten hours a day four days a week."
good,The work day was always fast paced. Everyone would arrive we would receive our pick list about six or seven sections per list. Then we would load all of our picks into a vehicle. this would be within the 4 hour work morning.
good,"It’s a fast paced job but for the most part it’s easy once you get use to it. You just have to keep up, make sure you listen to directions, and you will be fine."
good,"Safety meeting, begin shift pick orders at a fast pace to meet rate. Operate Pickers (PIV) to retrieve orders. The most difficult part of the job is keeping the rate quota met. It is very aggressive. I enjoy the fast pace and the work family. Wonderfully diverse group of coworkers."
good,"good company to work for no benefits though. not enough hours hard to support family on little hours, management was often not fair to the way they ran things."
good,"Although the job is fast-paced, there were moments when it could be relaxed and fun. The main motto was to ""have fun,"" so it's good that was possible."
good,"A GOOD COMPANY TO WORK WITH."
good,Decent job but your always on your feet and pay should be higher for forklift drivers there are great benefits some managers are laid back overall 3/5 stars
good,"I liked working from home, however it was just as demanding as being in the office physically. For a call center job the pay needs to be higher, home or not it was still high stress. They try to convince you of how much money you save not commuting or buying lunch at work. It's still high stress and needs to pay more equivalent to a call center outside of the home."
good,"Management is ok.  Things change the busier we get.  There was a positive culture, it has diminished a bit. I have learned how to operate different vehicles and machinery. My fellow associates are the best part about working there.  The hardest part of the job is when we don't have enough freight to process."
good,"When you start there is a team meeting every morning."
good,"Not too much complain about. "
good,i was a delivery driver. deliver packages at a timely manner processed paper working according to shipment. provided quality and good customer service.
good,"Amazon is a fun workplace, that provides great flexibility. But, if you are looking for advancement, it is hard to move up within the company. I have applied to three jobs and have not heard anything back. I have a 4-year degree from an accredited college. Benefits are good. I think vacation and personal time could be given more, but they accrue based on seniority."
good,"Working virtual, we work out of our homes. We get many, many calls to assist customers with anything they may need. Interacting with customers is the part I like most sabout this job"
good,"Work, work, work, no time for a break it takes 5mins to get to the lunch room, 5mins to swallow what your gonna eat and 5mins to get back to your area and if your late that work scan your id...and get a write up. If you need money and you haven't got the job you really want you can make money to help you out..."
good,Good job with a chance to stay permanent but pay could be higher. Work is good nothing complicated. Warehouse can be hot but that is due to Florida weather.
good,"Start with exercises, meetings for updates, learned picking, stowing, manual slam or audits and corrects packages before shipping out. Management were mostly professional. Culture easily blend in. Looking for space to stow items in the library. Fun workplace, there's basketball, hockey table, video games, remote car racing, free hot teas, also hot chocolate during cold seasons, free gatorade with 2 flavors during the hot seasons."
good,"I good place to work with decent pay, the environment is kind of loud and really fast paced but it’s usually 4 days work then 3 days off so it is ok, a lot of different culture."
good,"It’s a nice environment and the people you work with are the best. It’s a really physical job at the warehouse and I lost 10 lbs in the first month of working there. They expect a pretty high rate and sometimes it’s hard to meet, but they do their best to understand what you’re doing and how to improve. Honestly wouldn’t be looking to leave if there wasn’t conflict with my classes and it wasn’t so far away."
good,"Love working here. The days are long and challenging, but the rewards are so big it is all worth it. I work a full 40hrs/wk, but over 4 days. so every week I have a nice 3 day weekend."
good,"Maximum 11-month contract."
good,"The first step into an amazon building is overwhelming. Airport type security, conveyor belts everywhere and enough people to fill a city. That wears off. The training is decent. They have a three part class for each task. Associates are given ample time to see if their new job is the right fit. There are a lot of people working there, so advancement is very competitive. There could be a hundred people gunning for the same open position."
good,Good company to work for. One issue is they keep changing work hours. I work in one of the most challenging divisions that stops people from stealing from Amazon
good,Amazon is a lovely place to work but not a place to stay for too long. I did enjoy my time at amazon but wished I had given it more time. The most enjoyable part of the job is the downtime you get during the shift.
good,"picked product off a pallet and place in electronic bins, up to 50 lbs continues. wrapped items and placed labels on for shipping. used a pallet jack to move product around the warehouse. the hardest part was handling packages that were larger than I am tall. I enjoyed working with the small items."
good,great experience and we interacted a lot with each other on a daily basis to resolve issues and get the job done. there was also time for fun and showing appreciation to exemplary employees.Great team work experience
good,"Strong friendships and assistance from coworkers and Leads. They want you to be successful. "
good,"Very fast paced walking between 20-25 miles a night picking items out of numbered bins and placing said item into a tote onto your buggy. When said tote is full you place the tote onto a conveyor belt. Long nights working 12 hour shifts. The pay was good however, a social life was practically impossible."
good,Opportunity to work on different products. The culture is very dynamic.Lots of pressure to achieve targets. There is bit of bureaucracy which has not crept in.
good,Extremely competitive work environment with great community spirit.  Suffered from poor leadership on some levels.  Had lots of nitpicky HR rules.  Poor job security.
good,"Proven competent with quality and rate, as a result, given additional responsibilities "
good,Amazon is a great place to work and  meet all kinds of new people. They also pay very well. The only bad things is they want you to do so much in such little time.
good,"Only get about 4 hours per shift. So many people working per shift that it is hard to get recognized for your work. Not a bad job for someone looking for extra income, however not enough hours to live on."
good,"It was a nice place, albeit hectic with a strict quality and rate. One must maintain those things to achieve productivity. I learned how to use a hand scanner, as well as seek out ""defects"" (damages, ptential thefts, mislabeled items, etc.)"
good,Well my shift starts at 6:30 Sunday morning  and ends 6:00 PM There are a couple pros and cons to this schedule It is a 12 hour day but i do get at least three days off every week . There is a controlled climate enviroment that i think is awsome and i learned how to use a forklift and how to get along with all types of people the culture is very diverse which makes it a fun place to work .
good,This is the perfect job for students. If you have a every changing schedule simply pick shifts that fit your availability weekly during the weekly shift drops.
good,We were followed the 24*7 work culture there. basically its a logistic company so the responsibility on a higher side.everything is based on the timing.
good,"I worked on average 10 - 11 hours per night."
good,Very flexible working hours. Productivity is high but the lunch break is too short. The management is sometimes chaotic. Overall it is a great company to work for. The hardest part of the job is all tasks are performed standing. standing for 10 hours is sometimes too hard.
good,Fast-paced warehouse work in which you are packing up customer orders in a timely manner. Very physical with little to no down time. This would not be a job I would want to do long-term. This is certainly a job but not a career
good,"Amazon is what you make of it and a lot of people think that it is a  great place to work especially if you want to get good exercise and workout."
good,"Not a place to slack off"
good,Amazon keeps you moving with fast paced work. I like that my time flew by when working there 10 hours a day. You have to pay attention because rules and the structure can change daily.
good,I enjoyed working at Amazon! They were always willing to show yo9u new things that you wanted to learn. Mgmt. at Amazon was very friendly & made working there easy!
good,"Amazon is a decent place to work. The work is sparse and you are never in the same location but the environment is very laid back , accepting and allows you to work part time hours."
good,I liked working there except for the hours. The trainer though didn't train me and got rude when I asked questions. They need a longer lunch break with everyone having to go thru security.
good,"Good for colleges students, alternative money, good trainings."
good,"I'm a energetic and always willing to learn more things, and share ideas and when it comes to work in work hard I don't play games make sure my work is accurate."
good,I enjoyed helping to get the company established  and the environment.  It is a fastpace company and pride their selves off of the customer satisfaction
good,"Overall =it works. Everybody is friendly. The only downfall is the pay for the work you do, I think they should pay more. Everyday varies, some good, some bad. You have busy days and days that move slow in which they do provide VTO for."
good,"Everything is in order , calm environmental no suprises, Boring but work gets done , Your on your feet the whole time with two short breaks .managers are helpful and the work is simple They have a great training course"
good,I feel like employee should get paid more for all the work they do. The management is very demanding with the rate. Not enough time to get to break room by the time the employee get there break time is over. Management treat you poorly according to there preference. The benefits are great.
good,"Great company, great benefits, and extremely generous compensation plan to include RSUs with a vesting period designed to keep employees.  Very high turn over at the hourly ranks."
good,It's a little difficult to get on at first. Once you get in it'll be fast-paced and you'll have some assistance with performing your duties. The pay isn't the greatest due to the company being one of the top in the country but it'll get you by depending on your living situation. They have good benefits also that start immediately.
good,"Amazon it was like this :work hard, have fun, make history but actually it was just work hard and make history and that's it. Having the opportunity to work on your company as a driver it's something different I think."
good,"While working at Amazon, I learned a lot of different things. Such as learning from great people with great work experience. At times it was tiring, constantly moving. But they made sure you stayed hydrated. They also was there for you whenever you had an issue or did not understand something. Great company to work for. My time working there was short due to it being an seasonal position. Other than that I would've continued working for Amazon."
good,"Your experience will vary based on the team you are in.  Our Director and VP were poor as they would not let me move to another group even though being supportive prior to hire and throughout the year.  Both are now gone, so Amazon tries to improve."
good,"I worked there for two months. It's a rapid changing company and the warehouse is always improving, with the fast-paced work and the benefits that come with it."
good,"The job was good and so were the co workers, however there is no room for advancement and promotional opportunities for associates that strive to advance their career by climbing the ladder. But the wage was good."
good,"It doesn't get any easier than this. I loved the environment of the Jeffersonville, In, location. Unfortunately i had to quit due to personal issues. Would like to he hired again"
good,Amazon is a great place to work and is relatively easy. The work is not too demanding and supervisors are nice and friendly. A great option for a part-time job.
good,Not a bad place to work. Great hours and overtime pay is awesome. The only downside is they hire temp employees which screws up the whole system so they need to implement a certain rate. Failure to meet this rate after one week will get you fired.
good,"No negatives at all just the work life balance is the issue."
good,"Fast paced environment that will give you the opportunity to learn a lot and that has a lot of evolution opportunities."
good,This is a very nice place to work. I enjoyed my time working there. The management could be a lot better in how new employees are welcomed and trained.
good,Project was extremely interesting and challenging. High level of exposure was given with senior management. Team was supportive. I learned about Amazon's culture.
good,This is a good job. Managers are nice. Help out with what ever they can. They walk you through what needs to be done. And are always there to help out.
good,Amazon was a very fast pace job I would pull product and place it on conveyor to be packaged. I learned how important shipping out products was. Also having speed. Management was not too good at amazon just because of the warehouse having a max capacity of workers which made it hard for them to focus on daily situations. What I learned most was how to work at a very fast pace while also perfecting my assignment keeping mistakes at a minimum.
good,"Walk in, clock in, attend stand-up and perform your job for 10 hours, possibly 11 and get out and repeat the same next day for 4 days/5 days/6 days (Peak season). The best part of my job are the people. Very down to Earth and easy to get along with and are just as committed as I am."
good,I would recommend to anyone not a bad job at all they hire quick plus they always need people for peek seasons. Pay is not bad and they have multiple shifts to chose from. This is a great first job for anyone or if your looking for two this is a great second job because they have so many flexible shifts
good,This is a good job to work for someone with no experience to build up. They are pretty open with hiring and moving you up the ladder if you show you have what it takes.
good,It's wonderful experience within the company. I learn lot of thing with in the work place.Amazon is best company who provide full facility to his employee and it's celebrating birthday to all employees. I have just one month experience with this company but I tell that this company are the best company who are gives full banafites to its employees in job and also in salary
good,I loved mh job when I was first hired. Then they started switching roles so fast you could barely remember techniques before they changed them. Really unprofessional and unorganized.
good,"Ich kann nichts Schlechtes über das Unternehmen sagen!"
good,"Amazon was a job for workers, you need to be able to work your butt off just to get paid. There are some easy jobs there but if you are a picker you might as well find yourself another job."
good,Disadvantage is nothing to learn. Enjoyable work culture but no increment. Also their leave policy is the worst one. Managers will not help you at any circumstances. I'll noy suggest anyone to join in that company
good,its a good stepping stone to work for. it is very flexible if you are a student and it offers some good benefits right from the get go. and its  good work culture
good,Northern Ireland is pioneering territory for them where I am working and coming  along quite well . Have to cope with sailing times and matters and no stock centre ( fulfillment centre)  on the land so handicapped by relying on ferries but managing well
good,Très bel endroit pour débuter sa carrière professionnelle. Mais les perspectives d'évolution sont infimes.
good,"Hay buen ambiente y beneficios laborales, aunque algunas jefaturas no parecen respetar mucho."
good,A good place to work if you dont mind long hours and very fast paced enviorment... needs a little better leadership as far as management is concerned. Needs better cross-training scheduling for doublewalkie and forklift... but other then that great enviorment and company to work for.
good,"Great atmosphere to work in. First and second day did very well. I hit productivity goal my second day on the job. Shortly after that boss asked me politely to pick up the pace. Didn't think anything of it until my third day on the job. I was out of juice, so I had to resign from Amazon. If you can get passed production and meeting beyond their expectation of production your good. Couldn't see myself everyday busting butt like that to exceed their standard. Overall it was a good experience and recommend it to anyone. Their were older associates doing a good job their making productivity, it's not about age, it really is about whether you like your job there. But they do take care of their people."
good,"Amazon is a pretty cool place to work, with a lot of cool people. The problem is some of the managers never really learned HOW to be a manager or how to talk to people as people and not machines. The hardest part of the job is the constant standing for some, and the constant walking for others. I've done both and I've learned that you have to figure out how to get past it. If you can't, you just need to be honest with yourself and leave. The tasks and speeds that are asked of you are very demanding, BUT, able to be done. If you know how to get along with people, you'll be fine. But, if you are not a people person or you have a hard time connecting with people, you are going to hate this job even more solely because the interaction with the person next to you becomes vital to getting through your hours and not losing your mind! Most of the upper management is cool, but some are jerks."
good,"You work long hours at Amazon.com, but the pay and benefits are worth it! You will make long lasting friends and learn a great deal about the ins and outs of what Amazon does."
good,"Un poco agotador por las extensas horas (10) * dia, no muchas oportunidades de crecer para las personas que no somos completamente bilingües"
good,"I actually enjoy working here. You're always moving and you even break a sweat. It's a very simple job but it gets tedious. "
good,A great place for those that are just getting started in the workforce or college students. Employees should be paid according to their skills and departmental status knowledge.
good,Working at night shift was either very cold or very warm. But places were very cold you can even get sick. However free chocolate and free stuff on December. Some of the people were friendly someone of them didnt know about nothing about genders. Didnt trusted managers they will tell higher person everything you said bout everything. Just one young manager was really awesome.
good,"Cutting edge industry leader. Plenty of excitement. Very hard to advance. Monotonous work but very fulfilling being the real Santa Claus. Great Benefits. Young, inexperienced management make the job harder than it needs to be."
good,Good place to work. Good benefits.I enjoyed the job. Flexible Hours. Good training. Wide range of experience. Recommend this job as a good place to start working.
good,Needs to learn how to use associates and their ability. Alot of them are unhappy because they are not in the department they want to be in.  They could do better about advancing people and letting the people go where they are useful.
good,"Amazon fulfillment was a great place to work. Employees were very nice and management was very helpful and understanding. I didn't like the low wages or the fact that the shifts were on a competitive basis, meaning all the employees, had to compete for shifts which led to alot of people not getting promised hours for the pay period."
good,"managers are good"
good,"If your looking for a decent paying jib and have little experience or  lack a college degree this is a good place to work. You have to work hard, so slackers shouldn't apply."
good,"Work all day loading trucks with boxes (orders) that people purchased. When we would get our breaks we had to switch positions from loading to diverting. Loading the truck's was like playing tetris, we had to make sure that the boxes were stocked correctly and properly so the customers orders wouldn't get damaged or destroyed. Diverting was pretty cool , just had to push the boxes to the person that's loading the truck's in front of you. When it was the holidays , Amazon would get so busy and there would be so many orders that the trucks would get full immediately and sometimes there would be about 3 people working in trucks with you  to help out. What i liked about amazon was that i got to work alone sometimes , just when it was not busy."
good,"Collaborated with operations team to design and execute a comprehensive Health & Safety Program covering 1,000+ employees at a large-scale Fulfillment Center. Ensured compliance to all applicable local and regional regulations. Led a team of exempt and hourly safety team members."
good,"amazon warehouse is a great place to work if you love overtime and making money, if your looking for a career however they will make you wait a year to convert you and they wont convert you if you use more than 1 day off in the entire year."
good,"Make you work very hard but it's a good learning curve. You learn from the very best and hate it at times but it in the end, it will always be a great lesson learnt."
good,"typical day: clock in; make sure you are wearing gloves while your in facility. Team stretch; go to assign department. "
good,Enjoyed the fact the that job was fast paced and you were able to learn something new everyday. They take time to ensure everyone is given the proper training needed for each given task.
good,It has its good and bad.  Same as any employer. Physically demanding job. Encourages growth.  High focus on safety and environment control.  approachable management.
good,You are just a number. They don't care. Managers get the final say in everything even if they make false documents about your performance. They will write you up and say you refused to sign it even when you had no knowledge if it.
good,"Working for a company like Amazon is great if your looking for job and need to make money.  They have great benefits and other amenities to make you want to stay there.  The 4-days shifts they offer are pretty sweet.  A lot of people there are pretty awesome.  Its actually pretty difficult to move up pass assistant manager unless you dont currently work for Amazon.  A lot of employees will find themselves doing the same every single day. Constantly repeating the process with little to no change.  There seems to be a lot of disconnect between different building, shifts, and departments.  Wish the was more moving around and more teaching of skills inside the warehouse instead of doing one task everyday."
good,Dig in! Enjoy everyday with associates. Love the daily challenges. Would like to see more internal transfers and promotions. The company allows you to gain the knowledge to be an asset to any company especially Amazon. I love it!
good,"That's pretty much it. Life at amazon is a tough one. Most facilities will have you work a 4 day, 10 hour schedule. If you can devote the time to wrok for them, the pay and benefits will follow."
good,"Work closely with hiring teams to come up with strategies.  Very engaged and helpful relationship between recruiting and the business.  Systems are heavily modified and clunky - resort to good old spreadsheets for tracking activity.  Fun, 'change the world' culture."
good,"If you are looking for a place to sit down and do your work, this is not that employer. If you don't mind being in a fast paced and at times physically demanding job, then Amazon is for you. Invest in a pair of very good shoes/sneakers and compression socks."
good,"IT's not nearly as bad as everyone makes it out to be. You do work very hard and have to work at a quick pace, but management is kind and attempts to keep up moral in more ways than one."
good,"I enjoyed working at Amazon, mainly because of the people I worked with, until my last few months with the company. While I understand Amazon is a growing company, and changes are inevitable, the communication, in my opinion, from management, could have been a little more informative with updates with the business, more specifically, with our specific jobs in our location."
good,"Une journée de travaille typique est fatigante, le management dépendant des site est plus ou moins bon, les collaborateur sont tous de qualités et  il a une bonne entente au seins du groupe ""d'associates"" l'aspect le plus difficile est le faite de devoir restez debout pendant 7 heurs  avec seulement 20 mins de pause et des chaussures très peu agréable a portées.L'aspect agréable sont tout les conseilles et l'attention que l'on porte a la sécurité des employer"
good,"I had a good time working at Amazon although the hours were really long the breaks were not."
good,I've worked at two Amazon fulfillment centers the first one in Murfreesboro and the second one in Lebanon. I was first a contract worker and after peak season they let me go however I reapplied a couple years later and was hired as a full time team member I tell everyone that if they're looking for a job that will give you exercise while not being very hard then they are a great company to work for.
good,"Amazon is overall a good place to work.  The pay is average to above-average, depending on job role.  Benefits are better than most companies.  There is a decent amount of job security."
good,Working at Amazon was overall an exciting experience. It's amazing to be apart of such an innovating company that is always trying new things. Every day there was something new to explore.
good,"A diverse, fun & productive work place environment. The business tag line says it all. ""Work Hard, Have Fun and Make history"". The typical work day involves long hours of work and few moments of fun in-between. "
good,Rewarding job but expected to perform at robot like rates . Good pay. Lucky if you get a good schedule . Sometimes things seems unorganized when new managers is constantly brought in
good,"Working for Amazon is a pretty good experience, it definitely has its ups and downs like most companies. During your 10 hr work day you can definitely expect to work at a fast pace to maintain a pretty high rate. If your rate happens to drop to low than expected by the company, you will be written up and if you receive too many of these write ups you will be terminated ASAP. An up side to the company is you are surrounded by highly motivated managers and associates who have no problem helping you out with anything, all you have to do is ask, which I respect."
good,Amazon was a good work environment and the people were typically about their work and very ecofriendly. Had random conversations about life. I would recommend and refer a friend for work at Amazon because it has a good balance.
good,"Very good place to work, learnt the professional way of communication,  the management was strict and followed their rules."
good,"Its quite challenging to work with Amazon. And definitely to work with one of the best branded company, gives a feel of pride."
good,"A typical day working for amazon consists of either picking orders to send to packers or packing the orders themselves. I have learned how busy amazon can really be. Management can be helpful. Workplace culture is quite great and people seem to easily get along. The hardest part about the job is working for 10 hours without the ability to listen to music. Also having such limited amount of time for breaks and lunches. Since cell phones are not allowed on the production floor, employees scramble to get all the way to their lockers on the opposite side of the warehouse for maybe 5 minutes before having to walk all the way back to work. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to do a good job and meet rate if possible."
good,Fast paced but easy work great benefits giving exceptional hours with all the overtime I would like. Also with paid vacation time to earned I would say that Amazon would be a fantastic job opportunity.
good,"I worked during peak as a seasonal employee.  There were lots of incentives and rewards and free food on occasion.  There are water bottle station everywhere, (hydration is a big deal there) to, which is nice.  I recieved lots of great training before I even hit the floor.  However, I do wish they would have a follow up training or someone you could go to for clarification on things a few days after you are tossed onto the floor.  Its very much sink or swim once they let you go off on your own.  It was long hours (12 hour shifts) and a really long time on your feet.  I did like the autonomy of it though."
good,Worked in a fast pace sortation center getting packages to the correct location to be shipped out to the customer.  Here I was a lead and a trainer that taught all the new incoming employees the process at the building.
good,Good secure job but they will work you Hard and if you don't perform they will let you go unconsciously. good job though gives ways to grow through the company.
good,"Lovely shift, helps keep you fit and there are great people to work with. Learned to pay attention to detail in job role. Most difficult part in the job is sometimes the repetitive nature of some of the jobs, however with time you will learn excellent concentration and how to work effectively."
good,Calls; data base use; management presence; fun; hardest part-night work & no benefits; best-not having to work on hard surfaces as home & no commuting
good,Amazon Prime Now is a great 2-hour delivery service new to the Orlando Florida area. It's an exciting new service to the Orlando area that pays fairly well.
good,This is a very hard job that requires you to be on your feet 24/7. You schedule is set from day 1 and it does not change unless you request it. the pay is good as well.
good,Working here has been great. Awesome people and awesome pay make coming to work a lot easier. You are always going to have something to work on so boredom is not an option.
good,Learned the whole process that packages go through from start to finish. Learned how to problem solve on your own and keep up the pace that they called for.
good,"Amazon's typical day for me was hectic, challenging  and fast paced. I learned to be more patient at this job. Management was not always available to us due to what they were doing on company time. The hardest part of my job was trying to focus when everyone else was talking when they should not have been. The most enjoyable part of my job is that I had one."
good,Its a great company with alot to offer to better yourself and work life. If you a dedicated and hardworkeer and love a challenge then come and apply.. Why wait?
good,the work environment was amazing but unfortunately it was not stable enough for me. i was not making enough for the work i was doing.  when speaking with management i had always told them i wanted to move up in the company and i felt as if i was tossed aside.
good,"The worst thing about working here is the lack of job security if you're a picker/packer. Within a month, you have a limit of misplacing 3 items, then you get a warning and eventually fired. In a typical hour I was picking 60-80 items, in a day it was 540 items (10 hour days), and more than 10,000 in a month. The 3 item limit is stupid... "
good,"Scan packages to pallets, wrapping pallets, and moving boxes. It's an interesting place to work if you are trying to make ends meet but don't expect to advance too far."
good,Amazon everyone works together. I learned how to use my time wisely to sort packages and how to read if a package is good to be ship or not. Management time wise hard because its over nights and only over nights. You hardly see mangers around or someone to take to period but its worth the salary. Hardest part of the job there isn't a hard part warehouse is pretty easy but maybe coming in a 2 in the morning. Most enjoyable I would say working with groups.
good,If you need a side job to make ends meet or working your way through school this is perfect for you. If you like to work hard at a fast pace Amazon Prime is for you.
good,"I worked at an Amazon sort center which is a part time (3 to 4 hrs.) building. During peak season it is usually very busy. During the rest of the year it varies. Somedays it's busy other days it's slow and you have the option of not coming in or leaving early which is called VTO. Overall I found the job the be very repetitive and boring especially if you are scanning everyday. If you're working in other areas, like facing, inbound, sort slide, or problem solve the job may be more interesting and your day will feel like it's going by fast. For an entry level no experience job, it's a great way to gain experience and build your resume. In my area the starting wage was $12.50 an hour which is good for a warehouse worker."
good,"The pay is decent and the benefits are phenomenal, unfortunately the hours are long and schedules are not very great sometimes. Overall though its not a bad job."
good,Typical warehouse setting. Much easier than other warehouses. I haven't worked there in 3.5 years and a lot has changed; not sure how it is currently.
good,Amazon is a fast paced customer obsessed company that is growing leaps and bounds. The company is growing so fast I think they are loosing sight of their customers.
good,I believe it is a good job for some but if you can't handle high stress then it not the job or career for you. It has good benefits if you like working hard then it's a good job.
good,everythings fine but management could use ALOT of work. The environment is good and i like it alot but due to management i do not have interest in working there any more
good,I have worked for Amazon.com for nearly eighteen months. Amazon offers 60 hrs. per week during the busy/peak seasons. Part time Amazon associates receive vision and dental benefits as well as a 500 dollar siphon for medical insurance.
good,"Amazon is a good company to work for. The health insurance is very appealing, but as far as moving up of job security, then there are a few minor adjustments that need to be made."
good,"Was with Amazon for just over 6 years. In that time, I advanced from a temporary associate, to an Operations Manager, which in Amazon speak, means I went from temp, to Amazon Level 6. It afforded me wonderful opportunities, but work to life balance is awful. Some of that isn't the companies fault, it's that you become so wrapped up in all things Amazon, especially in management, that it's all you focus on. Culture depends on where you work. Some buildings are great, others not so much. Compensation is top notch."
good,I worked in Amazon in the warehouse I shrink wrap packages and did Warehouse duties I work part-time and got paid $10 per hour the managers worked well with the employees.
good,"its not the easiest job, but in this day and age, it is a job, with pretty good benefits, and for the most part it manages to keep you in shape, and its a company that's clearly not going anywhere"
good,"I did 10 hour days four days a week with occasional overtime.  The average day was very fast paced and you had quotas you had to meet.  If you fell behind, you got written up.  However, if you superseded the goals, then you were acknowledged for it.  For the most part, I was one of the honorary employees they had.  It is a great place to work, if you don't mind working hard."
good,"I would expect more from AMAZON.  Due to how far it has come in such a small period of time. Better equipment better management... They also need to extend the breaks by at least 5 mins. So that ppl won't have to worry about being TOT (TIME OFF TASK)... "
good,"You have to work about 12hr shifts for 4-5days straight "
good,I received great benefits and pay through Amazon. The management in my building was just not great and it lead me to quit my job. They have fun activities as well.
good,"It would help if they listened to employees although they have a suggestion box"
good,"plenty of overtime avable but usually not forced on you, work as a group but you are a cog and won't get in trouble for others not doing their job. also you have decent people to work with"
good,Alot of standing on your feet. That takes a lot of training and getting use to. Seeing the different things that amazon website offers was amazing. I really saw firsthand of how the business was ran.
good,"There is lots a room for advancement, they have great benefits and the people are wonderful. The job isn't hard pretty routine and the pay is competitive"
good,"A great environment to work. I enjoyed meeting new people, discover their cultures, costums. I`ve learned that I can move faster than I thought I can. I was fullfiling my targets."
good,I found this to be a great place for college students and young people to start a career. There is great opportunity over time to work your way to a higher position with one of the top companies in the world.
good,"Amazon has a great culture based on hard work, collaboration, and customer service.  As a supply chain major, I really learned a lot about the inner workings of the online retail industry and enjoyed the overall experience.  Management was concerned with the safety and well-being of its employees and encouraged everyone in a positive manner.  The hardest part of the job was the amount of physical activity that I had to endure during the shift, particularly during peak season.  However, I really enjoyed the people and being a part of a company that's on the cutting edge of supply chain management.  I would love the opportunity to work for Amazon again at some point."
good,"Working with excel, management of capacity and velocitron. Responsible for scheduling and ensuring business results. The ability to understand and implement capacity management."
good,Many thing happen high stress levels and alot of task and determination  is expected of you to succeed high ends job just a mental and physical strength is always expected of you to have to deal with the work conditions and people as well as pressure from management educational and some medical benefits  are available  after a period of time working and educational values are great
good,Long hours and repetitive work is normal for any factory job. The managers were great and so were the employees. If a job is needed and you are willing to have a factory job this one is highly recommended
good,"A day at Amazon consisted of packing shipments and problem solving if needed. I learned how to solve problems with shipments (damaged, correct labeling, corrected a problem and cancelled shipments), management was bit of a problem. They moved managers around all the time and once you thought you had a great manager they ended up moving out of the department or moving up with Amazon. The hardest part about the job was when we had to get thousands of shipments packed an hour before the deadline. The most enjoyable part of the company were people who cared about their work, getting packages sent out, and knowing we had great benefits."
good,I enjoyed my time at Amazon. Lots of smart people that are all very hard charging. This caused issues with worklife balance; teammates would want to meet up on weekends to work and if you didn't participate it could alienate you. Overall not bad though.
good,Hectic when it comes to work. Workplace culture is good. Management pushes you hard to finish the assigned work. Overachieving targets is what takes you ahead at Amazon.
good,"great company, great people, just didn't fit into my life at the time, a new baby and a wife that is active military caused some issues with her deployments. I was responsible for mentoring, and training new employees, however my main job was to discover and work to improve the processes that  amazon associates use to  pic, pack and ship products.  these duties includes   researching fixes to problems, and  communications between upper management and employees. i often gave presentations, either on power points or projectors. i often had t o me a jack of all trades at amazon, when shorthanded, or during the holiday rush. so i would pick, pack, or whatever was needed at the time. typical day was a lot of gathering of information, and or innovation related task. sometimes i would also help with safety."
good,"A typical day at work would start off with stretches then we were divided into packers/stowers, from there everything moved fast. Some days we would have to unpack pallets which made the day go by fast as well as the freezer and cooler which no one liked to go in unless it was hot in the warehouse. Management was cool they made work fun."
good,"Company has great benefits and pay but leadership and advancement is all about politics.  Some of the expectations are unrealistic, as far as the standards which change from time to time."
good,"The work is very easy and can be repetitive, but the people you work with can be fun and entertaining. Great benefits that start the first day of the job. Management is a fresh out of college. They are nice and friendly but sometimes they are caught out of their element."
good,Tres bonne ambiance au saint de l'entreprise travaille agreable !
good,A fast moving pace with long hours workers were friendly and helpful a place for advancement and a place with excellent benefits
good,other than that has a lot of great benefits and some good incentives when you show up for work everyday.  Also has some good management but you just have to show up and do the work and benefits will follow.
good,"Great company to work for, lots of benifits and potential for growth but you must be dedicated and be wiling to work flexible hours (shifts)"
good,"This is not a job for the unmotivated. Shifts are long, and you are standing, walking or lifting something the entire time. It's great if you wish to get in shape, but gets very monotonous fast."
good,Amazon is a fantastic company.  The corporate culture is not cohesive so the biggest factor in your experience will be your immediate manager.  The good news is transfer opportunities are fairly easy to come by.
good,Good company to work for but management is not that  great. The pay is ok the environment is ok but Amazon teaches their management to be mean and rude to the employees
good,"Fun and fast paced environment. Flexible shift selection. I personally worked four days a week, ten hours a day, left me with plenty of personal time."
good,"It's a decent job to get started in the law enforcement career field, the management is a joke, the pay is low for what you have to do, you get treated like garbage from the employees you serve."
good,Amazon.com was a awesome place to work. However i was there for a long time and the big thing i noticed was Favoritism. You want to work your way up and get promoted you had to be a Favorite. They wanted to keep the hard working individuals in the racks not give them the necessary credit they deserved!
good,"Overall it is a good company, there are just a few things they could change in the work place. I like to be able to interact with people through out the day instead of it just being me a computer and product stuck in my head."
good,"Need improvement in management and rewarding but overall good experience"
good,"For some reason, people really like to talk bad about this place.  It's really not horrible, just kind of monotonous.  I heard horror stories about how sore I would be, but the claims seem to be largely false.  Benefits have to be the high point of this job.  Be careful though, it's not difficult to get fired."
good,"I really liked working here because I was constantly going, and I always had something to do. I was never ever bored and never not had something to do"
good,"Came in stretched talked about the goal for that day and we got to work. You could communicate with others, it didn't feel like a jail house you actually enjoyed your work."
good,Sometimes fun and good money though.   The hours can be very long. But you do get alot of great benefits working there. Some of the manager's are nice.
good,Amazon is a great place to work with many opportunities. We are growing exponentially and we have no limits where we will go. We are always trying to innovate and become the best at any task set forward to be the most competitive and customer obsessed  company in the world.
good,Great place to work just think they need to work on communication and helping those that want to advance. They need to meep their word on when they say they will train you on things.
good,Work consisted of lots of moving and lifting. Not much contact with management. 20-30 hours per normal week (different during peak). Some people work hard while others do not work. Decent pay for the work that is asked to do.
good,it was hard work. but you will get used to it. i broke a record this weak season. the management was really cool. a lot of friendly people work there.
good,Having to walk all around and up and down stairs to find a certain shelf with certain items. The day goes by really fast because you never stop moving
good,"Overall, I enjoyed my time at amazon! I've advanced so much mechanically, I became a lot more detailed oriented, and well rounded in trouble shooting procedures and general protocol.  I was trained on 10 different pieces of power industrialized trucks and learned how to keep inventory of parts, and tools.  Management was not the greatest in my department specifically, however, i enjoyed my job and that was most important!"
good,Nice workplace environment. Can be fun some days and not fun other days. Management is hands on when need be. Can do better with communication at times.
good,intérim de 2 semaines avec salaire 9.94 mais passe à 11.02 en vu de + 5 mois consécutifs
good,"Only problem is you never know when your going to be working until last minute, and they tend to not care about dropping you so you earn no money at all. Also the routes are very big upto 200 parcels and 110 drops even after christmas."
good,I dont really have much to say about my time at amazon as i was only there six months.  What i can say about amazon is the pay is good and the hours are plenty. You just have to whatch how you manage your own time.
good,"Building 5 was great.  I made some friends, was encouraged to sign up for an ambassador position, was appreciated for good work ethic, and though staff members must reach a quota, the managers understood that I was a girl with some limitations and saw to it that I was given some leeway.  They put me where smaller boxes were being processed, and allowed me a smaller quota (as I wasn't the strongest member on the team)."
good,"You clock in, work, go to break then clock out."
good,"A typical day at Amazon would include roles like picking, stowing, batching, water-spider, running, and problem solving. These roles are pretty easy to learn with some help but it gets repetitive really quick. The job itself is very productive and fast paced and offers very flexible schedules. Hours are posted weekly and employees get to choose their days and hours they would want to work."
good,"You will grow. Un-achievable goals with unrealistic time frame. However, this pushes the company to be the best of the best. Very stressful, but the pay is great and opportunities for advancement come quick. Its easy to get into a cycle of 70+ hour work weeks."
good,In amazon sort centre we have knowledge about system and software process kowledge.here we have only 9000 pay in every month and 10 hours duty.in night
good,"I have a very pleasant experience working with Amazon.There is opportunities for growth , and compensation is better than the competitors."
good,"It was a pretty cool job, a bit repetitive (isn't every job) my only problem is the respect management gives, or doesn't give. At times they were rude."
good,"My honest opinion is that working at amazon was no biggie up till the point when management tells you you have a write up on your ""quality"" (which is a statistic they use to see how many defects you are putting out). Main reason why I say those things is because the management plays favorites, and there's this process called labor tracking they use when people aren't on computers; for example people taking boxes out of a truck, which sucks for the people that are on computers scanning things in for the warehouse cant really make that many mistakes. In all fairness the job isn't bad at all because you can switch departments and try to get promoted if possible, but you have to be willing to take your chances with the weekly criteria/rate they give you or the people that just walk around labor tracked and take there time without a care in the world."
good,"es una empresa que me ha dado la gran oportunidad de aprender desde cero, haciéndome crecer personal y profesionalmente, el ambiente de trabajo es muy muy bueno, me ha hecho aprender muchas cosas"
good,Ok job nice start up place some managers can be extremely rude or don't care on how they treat you so be careful with that good 4 days off work unless your I peak
good,"The hardest part of this job was dealing with the other employees who didn't do their part, and you had to do most of the work yourself. There was is a lot of favoritism among management and employees. other than that i enjoyed my job was good at it and it paid well."
good,The work is not bad compared to other warehouses. The hardest part is walking and being on your feet for so long. I have learned a number of things from shipping and handling to packaging. The most enjoyable part of the job is the incentives and prizes that you could win for job performance.
good,"management and hr was horrible, unfair treatment, i was in the stow department but I did love my job. I loved the benefits that were excellent for my family"
good,"there is definitely a lot of labor involved working at amazon, but i have come to appreciate the process it takes for my amazon orders to get  to me, as i am part of that process"
good,staffing was nice job placement very good management friendly and understanding. co workers helpful alot of room to advance and grow within company
good,Travail dur et physique mais l'entreprise sait nous motiver que ce soit en salaire qu'en avantage
good,its a very busy work place and always keep you on your feet. I fond amazon very fun to work for as it is a place for knowing that your a member of amazon and being a big part in a massive work place
good,Seasonal Job at Amazon shipping and receiving packages during the christmas season.We had a company feed lunch for Thanksgiving a couple days before Thanksgiving.
good,"I recently started as did a lot of people in a mass-hire, but so far it is really fun and productive. Days seem long but that's just because you stand for the entire 8 hours. Everyone works as a time and people who have been there for awhile are always helpful if you need them. The job itself is super easy but can be challenging if a problem arises. Other than that is straight-forward."
good,"People are friendly and work life is fun. "
good,"A typical day is a 10 hour shift where management is expected to arrive 1 hour early and leave 1 hour late - in order to prepare for the day and then report on the days results to upper management"
good,I like when everyone is in a good mood in the warehouse it makes it that much easier to work.It can become tedious if your not prepared other than that I had fun working with them
good,"During my internship, it's typical to work form 9 to 7 to get daily job done. But in general, it's a very productive environment and I got to develop very cool stuff with cutting-edge technology."
good,"I wanted to make permanent but has worked there during peak season. It seems like management should know a good worker to refer. "
good,"Everyday, I learned a new thing at work. The team helped with every doubt I asked them. Management was also quite good. The most enjoyable part was I had to figure out myself what to do if I got stuck in some problem. I had to brainstorm frequently for solving a problem. The problems were also quite challenging"
good,"Worked there for 3 years in all departments. Loved the job, loved the coworkers. Job got routine after a while, and its relatively difficult to get a promotion depending on who you are. But the environment is generally relaxed as long aas you can get your work done. They micromanage quite a bit which gets extremely annoying but you only work 4 days a week most of the time and the method for taking time off is the easiest of any job I've ever had. Overall, you get out of it what you put in. It's not meant to be a job that you stay at for the rest of your life unless you're one of the lucky ones to get that promotion. But if you use the tools that they offer you than you'll be just fine."
good,"Amazon is a fast pace environment where you are always moving, you can learn different areas of the warehouse very quickly and unlike other jobs they will always rehire you faster then most places. There very flexible with shifts and have a set schedule once you pick one."
good,"Much of the problem lies in that they write you up almost right off the bat. They want you to be able to identify which items do and do not go on the shelf, which is much more complex than the training describes. You get almost no hands on training until you have been written up a few times. The managers are very nice and helpful, its just the policy is very strict, and honestly, unrealistic."
good,"Being a Picker I would go around and collect items that are need to get ready to ship to the customer. The people that i worked with were all ready to help when needed, the hardest part was trying to keep up with the rate but i was able to manage it. I enjoyed being able to meet new people and to see what I accomplished in a days time."
good,"they had a cool lunch room with all kinds of snacks and tv's set to different channels to suit everyone on their breaks and lunches, everyone pretty much got along with everyone, but even in those times people didn't. everyone knew how to keep working and be positives. some the AM's were rude though."
good,"Having to work at amazon was an interesting work environment since there were multiple sections of the building that had different roles and there was always something to do."
good,"At the start of every day you must stretch, but the job is not very laborious. Water is always available. Management isn't too focused on each individual's progress unless they are impeding other people's work."
good,"For the most part Amazon is a great place to work for. The pay and benefits are good but there is hardly any work. There is a 4 day work week and you get 40 hour weeks, but there is no work coming in. and you stand around for 10 hours every day doing nothing, waiting for work that isn't coming. The managers are also rude and avoid contact with their employees at all costs."
good,A good place to work if you are ambitious and don't mind working long hours.  Amazon is a young company that is certainly going somewhere.  I have enjoyed my time at Amazon.
good,"Not a horrible place to work. Great hours and good pay. The thing I like most about amazon is the job security especially during the holidays."
good,Job pays good and they work with your schedule if you're in school which is a plus for me. Managers work with you if you have any concerns or problems. Only thing I disliked was just the traffic on my delivery route but hey what do you expect when you live in California right? the bay area at that.
good,A typical day at Amazon is always action packed and customer centered with peak hours of the day with expected rates to be met and safety always being a main priority.
good,This is a good place to work and can really develop you. Talent wise Amazon is the best place I have worked at and there are some great opportunities in the company.
good,"Very good job, always kept busy and dealing with new problems everyday."
good,"more "
good,It is a fine to work on a 10 hour shift in warehouse environment servicing internal customer with Co-workers attitude vary from day to day.
good,"It was a lot of people very speedy work mangers were a pain and your feet will hurt so bad ,I wouldn't want that to be anyones first job nor would I want to stay there for long periods of times"
good,"a way to meet alot of different culturesan background, fun place to work an very great benefits! i would definitely recommended to work there. a way to learn how to do very creative things"
good,"If you are willing to work hard, this is a fast paced environment rewarded with good pay and great benefits. Leadership has a willingness to feed in to and grow their associates who desire to grow themselves as leaders. Variety of people to learn from through a vast difference of life experiences. Great team to work with from all departments."
good,its 10 hours shifts. not a hard job and the only thing is in a warehouse job so i you don't like inside job i don't recommend it
good,good pay good work hours new bus line put in place a standing most of the time no real heavy lifting but you have to get use to the constant standing i didnt like the bells that go off for break time lunch time and back to work time i also did not like being constantly monitored by managers in their offices by computer if your productivity did not meet 2000 packages s shift a stiff warning was earned
good,Working with Amazon till date is so good but I like to explore more on My Job roll with new companies as an individual contributor. company.
good,"Job was extremely fast paced and hectic. Up and down, round and and round. Management was stressing speed and quotas to be met. Ambulances were present at the employee entrance on a daily basis because there was no AC. The hardest part of the job was the job itself. What I learned was ""don't work for amazon if you want to stay healthy!"""
good,Expect to walk around ten miles a day. You learn how to manage time and be productive in and out of work. The management could be difficult to cooperate with but they do try to communicate with you. Coworkers are mostly easy going but also push you to do your best. The hardest part of the job is trying to keep that high standard rate and follow some safety precautions. Overall you will enjoy meeting all the new people and especially getting two breaks plus a lunch throughout the day.
good,Amazon culture is great they teach a lot about leadership. They are always concern about safety first and that is the most important thing at the end of the day. make history and have fun and work hard.
good,"management needs upgraded and replaced, seems all over the place."
good,the warehouse is very hot and most people get angry and walk off the job.the pay is wonderful but like i mentioned it gets hot and it is an very crowded place.
good,I loved working here driving the stand up reach and the sit down forklift. it put my mind at ease and focused me on my task. nothing about this job was hard.
good,only issue is management not being trained properly creating a negative working environment. although management was not the best it was still a great working experience with a lot of great people. I learned fast and had many opportunities to advance within the company.
good,"Amazon is based more for the young intry level type, not for people with families and other jobs, the hours are long and feel very unproductive,I never feel a sence of acomplishment."
good,A typical work day is long and boring or fast and intensive depending on the position your are in that day. I learned my capabilities. Management was not good. Lot of young people that did not know what they were doing. Good co-workers. Hardest part of the job was the favoritism. Best part of the job was being alone.
good,"On your feet 10hrs. , get you some good shoes for support. I learned to respect others rolls or positions , and everyone really matters."
good,"After clocking in, you check the duty roster for your name and assignment.  You may be assigned to one area processing large packages. Before the day ends, you may find yourself working 5 or more different areas. There's no (i) in teamwork.  Management is fair.  You come in and do your job and no one bothers you. Co-workers are nice.  Majority do what their supposed to do.  Temperature in warehouse. The sense of fulfillment knowing that you've given 110% of yourself. Some days I'm so engrossed with the job at hand that I don't hear the end of shift bell."
good,"Clock in,do morning streches, look at board to see where you will be placed in job for that day. must be flexiable and willimg to cross train. numbers ae labor tracking are fairly east to get, as long as you stay busy."
good,Great place to work but the employer needs to work on better training the managers and employees. Great benefits but very costly.
good,"The company is a great start and a great place to work for young people trying to gain experience and/or build a career. You are given opportunities to learn, grow and advance your skills in the company and have a relatively good earning potential if you are a good employee with good attendance, stats and leadership qualities. To advance continuously though you need to dedicate yourself to the company and be well known for your work and involvement initiatives with their hardcore 'leadership principles'. Management varies from department to department but one thing is clear - your working hours and shifts are controlled by the company so you need to be able to be flexible with regards to your own personal and family life. Some managers are good and some not so good, Seller Support is probably a department to stay away from although the pay is good, the expectations are ridiculous, the rules draconian and always changing and increasing. AWS is probably one of the most sought after positions with a good reputation in management, working hours and general good office vibes. The building is situated in a nice quiet part of town, in Gardens with the gym and Wembley Square right next to the building and has nice views."
good,"Good supervision and management"
good,"The work was very difficult physically, but the pay made it worth it. A typical day at work was ten hours long, packaging a couple thousand shipments a day. Managers were very understanding of my physical limits, and worked with me to improve my daily numbers. Co-workers could either be a positive or a negative. Like in every business, there were those people who thought they could show up, do nothing and get paid. Those people made work more difficult, as they left more work for those of us who were actually working. However, those that worked hard, made the job competitive, and that made the atmosphere more fun and enjoyable for everyone. The most enjoyable part of the job was when all of us in the department were able to make our daily goal. The hardest part was the physical strain. I really learned how to balance work and a personal life. It was very important that when you came to work, you left all your baggage at the door. Bringing conflict from personal life could bring your numbers down."
good,"Amazon is a good place to work if you don't mind fast pace work and being by yourself you  get your work and you do it in a timely fashion as expected they treat there employees good with prices for doing well, gatorade cookies t shirts etc"
good,i love the different cultures that work there.  everyone was enjoyable.  Managers were easy to talk to. nothing hard about the job. typical day at work can be enjoyable.  They don't hover over you to do your job. grade items and make rate.  Not very hard. my co workers make my day enjoyable.
good,A typical day at my current job starts at 6:30 pm. We are assigned to a station in our department and must immediately begin to pack. the job is repetitive but not very difficult. Each employee must hit a certain rate every day.
good,"Working for amazon opened a lot of doors as far as my work skills. Not only did I train to learn a new skill but it was a dangerous skill and I was dependent on making sure work was available for the assembly workers. Getting my truck started, making sure all the horns and lights work to communicate when I'm passing through the warehouse. Making sure my co workers are safe and well aware of me when on my forklift. The hardest part of this job was turning corners because sometimes u can do 360s and its fun but dangerous, you have to make sure you can keep control. The most enjoyable part about this job is driving around all day. Talking to different people."
good,"depends upon how much time you spend in a day."
good,"a typical day would be as a stower just to stand for about 10hrs an place items inside an empty bin"
good,learned how to handle customers over a period of 9 months resolving their issues assisting the firm increase its sales margin and satisfying the customers which is the motto of the organization
good,I really enjoyed my job at SMX at Amazon. Unfortunately we did not have enough employees and I had to leave. I enjoyed everything I did. I learned so many new things during my time with this company. I moved up quickly in the company and developed many skills to help me throughout my professional and person life.
good,Hard work on shift. Complete 110%. Mostly just on one's ability concerning on one's ability of work; working smarter & not harder.
good,"Fun place to work"
good,They provide their associates dignity. The co-workers are helping one another. The management is good they care about their employees and always provide safety while at work on the floor.
good,The job was really easy and stress free.  The hardest part of the job was standing/walking on concrete floors for 10hrs a day.
good,"There are no benefits, no full time employment and it is only three to four hours a day. Sometimes, we were asked to go home at the door without even starting the shift."
good,No opportunity for advancement and the management makes poor decisions. The benefits go above and beyond. The culture is upbeat. I have met the best people at Amazon.
good,"The working envioroment was tense, the hardest part was that you are being close monitor for 24/7. I enjoyed when it time for shipping."
good,"was a great place to work with plenty of over time, got to meet alot of great people , definitely the co-workers made your day all the time , I worked in vendor returns very busy area ,but you could learn alot , the hardest part was collecting the damages , but other than that a awesome place to work"
good,"If you not mentally prepare to work at Amazon,it's a big challenge.It will put your mindset on a roller coaster ride.It will mess with you health wise ."
good,"A typical days work consists of clocking in, do the one task you were taught for 10 hours straight, then clock out. The management does not care about your problems unless it has something to do with them, otherwise they will just tell you to go back to work."
good,"This company is very challenging to work for but the opportunities are endless. There is no staying in a position for 10 years before promotion. If you are capable and qualify for a specific role, it is yours for the taking."
good,Good company to work for. They offer excellent benefits to their employees and there are plenty of advancement opportunities. The life/work balance is not so great at times.
good,"The compensation, insurance and time off is a great package that comes with working at Amazon. They make sure to take care of all associates and work really hard at providing opportunities."
good,"Working at Amazon requires alot of energy and dedication. Patients is the key. Everyday you have to put your customers first, but being a manger your employees have to be value also. Having a great balance between both employees and customers is my everyday focus, which may also be my hardest part. Making sure all customers orders are fulfilled while my employees are not over looked. I enjoy the rush everyday and the number run down at each shift that tells each unit we pushed out."
good,generally a good place to work with ease of promotion. physically quite a bit more than your average job but not to difficult. process paths in every department are easy to use and fast to learn. hardest part would be just standing on your feet for ten hours straight doing the same motion over and over.
good,"-Management is constantly changing."
good,I worked 10 hour shifts most of the time standing in one spot. Amazon is not a bad company to work for the pay is nice and so is the benefits the only down part was your working 10 hours but you only get a 30 minute lunch brake and there was nothing to keep you awake if you started falling asleep like music for examples.
good,What i have learned is from my previous work places is it is all about the customer service and being able to learn from management what I can do to do better for the company. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to meet new people.
good,I've worked there every summer and winter since attending Middle Tennessee and it is a great way for college students to make a lot of money in a little time.
good,"I live in Cookeville Tennessee and Amazon Fulfillment Center is in Lebanon Tennessee which is a long travel for employment. Other than the daily commute it is not a bad place to work.  The employees are focused and friendly, not mention a very diverse environment.  If it were closer I would probably not be applying with your company at this time."
good,I enjoyed going to work because u met new people everyday. The hardest part about the job was the long hours. The most enjoyable part of the job is the nice Breakrooms
good,A typical day at work. It can be a fun work environment some days and some days its unpleasant. Management is respectable and very caring of your feelings and how your work day flows.
good,"Depending on what area you are in, depends on how busy you are."
good,"The Transaction Risk Management Services (TRMS) team at Amazon safeguards all Amazon Marketplaces from Fraudulent and Abusive practices and in doing so ensures long-term buyer, seller and other stakeholders satisfaction and builds trust. TRMS Operations team works towards building Amazon the most safest place to transact online by researching and evaluating facts surrounding buyer and/or seller transactions and ensuring that legitimate customers at Amazon get their orders, and to have the best customer experience possible during the process."
good,You work hard because the money is worth it. The employees and supervisors are wonderful! I would work for this company again if they had a site in my current location.
good,"It was nice to be a part of such a nice company.I would like to join again if i get chance."
good,Amazon is productive place to work. Each day we set a new record of packages shipped out for delivery. The most enjoyable part about working at amazon is meeting new people. Meeting and talking to all different people is what keeps me going and what makes the job fun.
good,"High turn over rate, management changed constantly, no real feedback or direction offered. You feel over worked and there is no one to really discuss concerns with."
good,"Poste qui demande certaines aptitudes physiques, la première priorité au travail est la sécurité des salariés, pour les intérimaires le salaire reste proche de SMIC."
good,"temporary contract good place to work, would definitely return there again if i was out of work. Cordant people were a fair agency to work for and were considerate to any any problems that needed sorting."
good,receiving inbound calls to assist customers with items they have purchased. researching website to assist customers with product information. Maintaining team morale. Achieving team targets
good,"It was an easy going experience, but it was a tough job to do. Standing and walking for ten hours can get difficult but a hard days work is what got me through. Loved working there."
good,Learned alot from my position and liked most of the people I worked with .wish it had not been a contract position  I would still be there..Most of the management were really easy to work for and with
good,Amazon had many benefits however it was a slow paced temporary job in which was great for seasonal work and/or college students. I would work for amazon again if I was not a temporary associate.
good,This is a good place to work. Sometimes the managers are a little harder to get along with. Some of the quality rules are a little strict and unrealistic. I really enjoy most of the people that I work with is a friendly environment.
good,I liked Amazon.  It was my first time working in a warehouse. ...... To continue with the job.... I would have had to work Saturdays and Sundays.... only.  **  I enjoyed the other employees!
good,"My job doesn't have a lot of down time, or time to do much more than work. You are focused on the single goal of what ever your job is. When you talk to anyone they are always helpful, however its not an often occurrence."
good,Le travail étais un travail d'usine mais tout de même une très bonne ambiance et les manager très présent pour les employés
good,"fast paced,motivating job to have,but a bit repetitive,management seems to be logical in most cases in my opinion infact Amazon is very clean.."
good,"Good work place . flexible working hours , getting experience in e commerce domain . work not very systematic . patchwork solutions are more than systematic approach . HR not very resposive."
good,"Never a dull moment, and time flies with the work that has to be done. It's a day of honest work. Management is very involved, and the opportunities at this establishment are endless"
good,"Working at Amazon does take a toll on your body you work long hours and are on your feet all day. You get three breaks in a day two 15 minute breaks and a half hour lunch. The fifteen minute breaks feel like 5 minutes because by the time you leave your station and get to your locker it feels like you have to turn around and go back. Managers are really nice they do really try to get you excited about working every-morning and they are always available if you have any questions. They do have a pool table, basketball hoops, and a play station for employees to enjoy when on lunch. One thing you have to be careful about is your time off you only get a certain amount of hours of time off and if you run out of those hours you will automatically get terminated but Overall it is a great place to work once you get used to being on your feet all day."
good,Clock in and get right to work by giving it your all to give quality customer satisfaction. Very crowded environment. I learned how to function and multi task in a very large wharehouse that stays busy on a daily basis year round. The hardest part of the job is keeping yourself well hydrated in this type of environment. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting people from all diversities and origins
good,Working for amazon was a great experience. I learnt a lot of leadership skills. I was also able to grow and learn with ease and a lot of support from my manager.
good,"Amazon was a friendly environment. Love my co workers, made work a blast. Only thing that was hard for me was the temperature, was very cold. That taught me to push through anything."
good,"A typical workday is normally very hectic, and that makes the day go by very quickly.  I have learned a lot about behavioral safety while working at Amazon.  The management team is the brightest and the most talented that I have ever worked with.  The hardest part of my job was finding enough time in the day to complete all that needed to be completed.  The most enjoyable part of my job was the interaction with all the associates who are truly the engine that makes this place go."
good,"Steady place to work with relatively reasonable goals. Some organizational problems, but in such a diverse product warehouse it's to be expected to a degree. Pay for the work felt appropriate, managers had fair expectations and were largely promoted up through the ranks, so they had the ties to the people on the floor, making them very relatable. There is room for advancement, as previously mentioned, but it seems to require a rather socially outgoing personality in addition to work ethic; the quiet hard worker seems far less likely to be noticed here."
good,"In Problem Solve, I would have to fix any virtual anomalies that came into the building, such as a receive errors or handling damaged product. As a forklift operator I would be required to double stack pallets of product and load trucks, I also have experience unloading trucks as well. I have enjoyed doing both of these jobs, and I believe I was very good at them. I have worked for two of the Amazon cross-dock facilities. One in Hebron KY and the other in Moreno Valley CA. The management to Hebron was very cooperative and associate oriented, Usually very interested in answering questions and keeping the work flowing properly. In Moreno Valley however, it has been very difficult to get answers from them or assistance in anything that requires immediate attention. My coworkers have been generally good people, my only problem with them has been whether they actually work or not. Many of them have been lazy and difficult to work around, since I am always focused on staying busy and working efficiently."
good,"People has clear objectives, critical minds, professional spirits all over. They really live by their leadership principle, and I believe that's why the company keeps on growing and progressing."
good,"When i worked here they didnt offer a mon - fri job. me still being young bothered me a little. i did part time. The people that worked there were almost all rude, but it was still a pretty easy job  and they pay you well to do that job. I enjoyed working there besides their employees. I probably would go back there in the future since i better know how it is."
good,"You where constantly on your feet, the break rooms were too far. their was barely any standing mats there for your feet. i learned to wok at a faster pace, i loved working the dock."
good,"uma empresa muito boa pra trabalhar e se aprender.."
good,"Amazon has great benefits, but the hours you work in a day aren't good for everyone. For me going in at 6:30 pm and working until 5 am doesn't fit well into my personal life. I have three kids, one with Leukemia, and I go to school fulltime, at the time I was hired I needed a job. I was told that I could switch shifts at my new hire orientation, but that was not true."
good,Amazon will give you an accommodated schedule so you can go to school. If you have worked there for a year they will pay for your school as well.
good,"Amazon is a good company but it's no joke there. You have to maintain a productivity rate consistently or you will be fired. There's many people who want to work there so the company doesn't have to put up with mediocre work from their employees."
good,"I love it!. Interesting people to work with. Fast paced, friendly workers. Process changes all the time so able to learn and improve constantly."
good,"High energy required, I stayed motivated. Good to know that I was making a living doing well at the company. I wish that I could have stayed longer but my means transportation was unreliable. Otherwise I probably would still be there."
good,I found that co-workers were for the most part cooperative and patient with each other. The managers were willing to work with you or help you in improving at your job and were very patient. It was at times a struggle to make rate while on equipment due to being over staffed. Errors made in receiving and pallets restocked backwards made accurate inventory counts difficult. Very safety focused.
good,"Amazon is fun place to work where i learn a lot each and every single day. My job role is of Site Merchandising where i run different campaigns as per demand from the customer and the market."
good,"A typical day at work starts off with a stand-up meeting to give us the overview and workload for the night's work. We then continue on to head out into the mods and walk between 20-30 miles each night while using a scanner to pick customers' orders. "
good,"You will work with a lot of great co-workers, but it is hit or miss if your particular manager will be a good coach for your career development.  It is really on you to figure out what you need to be doing to advance your career.  Step 1 is always to do your job effectively."
good,"At amazon you work 10 hour shifts for 4 days a week. Standing through out entire shift except for breaks and lunch. It could get a little boring, but you are surrounded by a lot of people."
good,"Pretty laid back...I love to assist customers regardless of there reason for call."
good,I enjoyed working for Amazon for the first couple years despite having a salary well below my education and experience.  Constant changes in policy and work practices made development and advancement difficult.  I had the opportunity to work from home which compensated for the cons of the job enough that I stuck with a temporary job outside my usual field for a few years.
good,Overall nice place to work. Management was nice. Schedule was perfectly organised. great environment. I would go back and work if I had the chance. Shifts are good
good,In my somewhat brief time here I learned several key skills that should be utilised for a healthy and productive working atmosphere such as cohesively working alongside other team members and helping one another with missed sources.
good,A typical day starts with a morning meeting with management. Then everyone goes to their assigned stations to begin their workday. The hardest part of the job is staying busy sometimes. Sometimes there isn't enough work to keep us all busy.
good,"The facility I worked at was over 1 million square feet big and you will learn every foot of it fast as you walk/ride about all day. The people are generally nice but their are constantly new faces as temps are brought on then released during holiday seasons. LOTS of walking and/or standing depending on your task on a given day and must be able to lift, bend, stretch, and stack with many different shapes and size products. If you like what I'd consider manual labor then it's a sweet job that I'm sure offers opportunity for advancement (i was only there for about six months) then you'll enjoy working for Amazon.com"
good,"Great place that compensates for the work that is done. It is hard work but well worth it. It is hard to build employee relationships because the shifts are always changing, and seems to be new people all the time."
good,"The work involved in an Amazon facility is not hard at all. It can easily be done. However, the management can make or break the job. If the management is good, the job will be enjoyable and the environment will be positive and supportive. If the management is bad, the environment is slow and they make you feel useless. The coworkers range from students to the elderly and are genuinely kind and fun to be around. The job is fairly light in terms of labor, but can become labor intensive if you are not perpared. The repetition of the job eventually begins to affect your perfomance."
good,Awesome. But no space for personal life. perks are great and the money is good. Facilities will lure you over and not let you leave
good,"Working for Amazon has been great. As long as you come to work with a positive, competitive, and upbeat attitude, you will definitely succeed. Management has great morale. They're out there with us every step of the way. They help you out with every problem you may come across. Whether it be transportation, daycare, or production, they work with you to make a resolution! "
good,if you do not have a family then these are the jobs for you because they will both work you 6 days out of a week. You had to work 40 hours a week and overtime was mandatory.
good,"I work at one of their distribution warehouses.  An easy job but they seem to be one of those employers that will give people with arrest records a second chance.  Now that can be a good and a bad thing.  I am all for giving people a second or even a third chance to get their act together and be a productive member of society.  With that being said some of their employees are literally right off of the corner so some of them use some very coarse language when speaking.  You know ""F"" this and ""N"" word that and I'm not sure some of them are the kind of people who would return your wallet if they found it laying on the floor if you know what I mean."
good,"Assisted sellers with issues with the Seller Central platform. The job is stressful, as you are walking people over the phone on how to do things and they can become upset in an instant."
good,"Good place to work for entry level employees.  Salary for along with benefits are great, lots of time off available during non peak months"
good,I hated working for Amazon the stuff had no manners towards the employers and I had no social life while working there. While working there I would start work at 9:00pm and finish at 7:00am while working we would have one 1 Hour break for lunch and that would be all.
good,"After working for the company for 5 years on and off I have probably seen it all and touched every job that is in the place. I have to say I don't mind warehouse work so it wasn't horrible. The employees however are worse than middle school kids and that I don't have the time or patience to deal with. The people who don't work seem to be the ones who advance and the ones who bust their butts seem to be unappreciated or acknowledged by management. Most of it doesn't makes sense, but if you can go to work with hundreds of people and management to keep to yourself it wasn't horrible."
good,"Enjoy all my coworkers. Management, not always on top of things, asked to speak with someone from HR, took 3 days .Hardest part when your partner is not pulling their part. Enjoy the people"
good,"Due to most hiring being seasonal it is very hard to advance in the company and retain a permanent position. Very long hours, weekends and holidays. Employees were required to work 12 hour shifts on Christmas Day."
good,"great company to work for, keeps you busy and has great pay. The people there are very friendly and helpful, I do recommend this job for someone who likes to be moving at al times or likes a fast paced job."
good,"When i worked here there were a lot of older staff members. Most of them women. Literally a few man staff, including myself. But it was ok. Mellow...easy work. stocking and what not. You do keep busy doing something pretty much all day."
good,"We would start our day off with a quick meeting about the volume the was projected to be done on our shift. We had to check the roster to see what our job was for the day. I learned a lot I was a new hire trainer, problem solver, problem solve trainer, saftey coordinator and fork lift driver. I got along very well with many of my co-workers they always knew they could come to me if they needed help. The hardest part of the job was locating product that needed to be on a truck by a specific time and made sure it was proccessed. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be helping other succeed."
good,"Can't really be explained better than the other reviews. Hard work....etc..."
good,loved this job! I loved all the people I worked with and I loved what I did as a problem solver. I stayed very busy.  My job was to fix things. Virtual and physical problems with inventory and customer orders. I enjoyed this job because I was helping people.
good,"Great coworkers with an awesome sense for teamwork. A lot if heavy lifting, but we have fun pushing each other to see who could do the most work with safety and quality in mind at all times. Management is like a revolving door, never really get to know them to well, but they are all very professional. Some are young, just out of college and think they know everything, but eventually come around and realize that we all can learn from each other. I really enjoy getting to know my coworkers, whether it is during lunch or working in a team environment.  The hardest part of the job is trying to stay motivated due to the job being so repetitive, very repetitive."
good,"-	My position entailed improving and maintaining the performance of my associates "
good,"Typical day began at 6 (ish) and ran through until you finished your route. This meant that your work/life balance was slightly compromised as the job sometimes required you to work 7 days a week. Salary was paid weekly and was very good. Job security was fair to middling and the turnover of drivers was quite high. Management, again fairly OK. Hardest part of the job was the everyday delays faced when getting to the depot, loading and leaving the depot."
good,"Fair employer that places employees in positions to succeed. Work included stocking merchandise, loading and unloading trucks, building and wrapping pallets, receiving and packing merchandise."
good,Overseeing departure of drivers in the morning ensuring the process is followed safely and within targets and metrics set such as driver departure times within 45 minutes for example.
good,I liked working for amazon 3 plus years... paid well good insurance only thing is the management team was not to my liking
good,Amazons slogan is Work Hard Have Fun Make History. It is true but the jobs are very repetive. The jobs give room for growth and advancement. The pay is a little low but good for someone that is just starting a career.
good,The job itself is fairly easy and a pretty good. It usually makes for a easy day. Almost everyone that I have met are really helpful and nice. I've learned a lot of different things.
good,"the best day for me in my work place .was that day when they finally decided to get me trained on a PIT , it is just what i wanted to do. I love working with PIT."
good,A typical day at Amazon is fast paced and energetic. The management and leads are friendly and helpful. My co-workers were friendly and helpful as well.
good,"Working for Amazon was a good experience for me, I enjoyed it, there was no time for standing around at all, you constantly walk, several miles a day. It was physical but very exciting of sorts, always new things to learn."
good,"Fun workplace"
good,"working for Amazon was good, the work was fine but a little to much for a new starter."
good,a typical day at work but with fun and joyful staff/managers
good,"-I walk within 4 to 5 miles each shift."
good,"At Amazon I learned many new skills and had fun doing my job. There were motives to get your rate up, such as power hours, where if you were in the top few you would receive a prize. I enjoyed working for the company. I plan to do peak next year."
good,"Doing daily walk through"
good,Working at Amazon was a learning experience. I have worked there for 3 seasonal peak seasons. I was very amazed at how the company grew within the past 4 years. There are many different products that come through the doors of Amazon from vendors and many different customers. A typical day at work is to go to stand up where we would stretch for the first part of the day. We are notified of the goal that we have for that day and are pushed to achieve as well as beat that particular goal. Management was still very shaky. It could be a  little more organized. There is no hard part of the job. I love to learn and everything is a challenge and I try my best to do my best to the best of my ability.
good,"Work day was fast paced, I was cross trained to perform many duties, Management was very helpful and always positive. It was work at home so I did not meet many of my co workers but chatting in the team room was always fun and usually productive. The hardest thing was the large amount of information I had to digest as I was cross trained into almost every split.. I loved solving a complicated problem for a customer and earning their loyalty!!"
good,I like the environment at work and the way the management team refer to associates.
good,Working at Amazon taught me how to work in a fast paced environment. The working environment was great everyone was very friendly and supportive as we all faced difficult customers. The management is very supportive and are always there to help. The only hard part for me about the job was the night shifts.
good,"associates become Your second family ,very fast paced its not hard work but You work hard! good benefits, if You manage Your allowed time off good then You usually have time to take off when needed (it is very crucial that You keep track of this time), a lot of walking  and physical work, breaks are very short compared to the time Your on Your feet"
good,"A typical day would consist of sorting and processing retail using a scanner. Working third shift 10 hours a night, 3 days a week. I learned to work both alongside my peers, and as a separate entity within the work site at my station. Our workload was on a rigorous side; we moved boxes, cut open boxes, and counted items inside. I experienced first hand the retail transitions of goods between consumers companies and buyers such as amazon."
good,"same as before bad managment nothing to do with ambassadors , bad policies , very strict not saying i wouldnt work there again because a job is a job"
good,"amazon was a fun place to work but also a very busy place"
good,"Working at Amazon was great, you move around so much like you are working out. I really liked it, I wouldn't mind going back if asked."
good,"good job 12.00 an hour but lots of favoritism, hard to advance short breaks, a lot of room fro growth"
good,"Por ser uma  subsidiaria da Amazon, a A100 é uma empresa que opera os datacenter em missão critica. Possui procedimentos internos bem complexos e com uma quantidade enorme de relatórios para evitar que os erros não se repitam."
good,"Una empresa diferente con una filosofía al estilo americano, en la que se aprenden muchas cosas"
good,"enjoyed all the crosstraining, good chance to meet people with 6,000 other co-workers, but no time to socialize while working. work hard of course and the ten hour shifts fly by. air conditioned (great for it being the largest warehouse worldwide) opportunity to work 70 hours during peak"
good,Amazon is an awesome company to work in in terms of the in office work culture.
good,Amazon is a easy going job with a tough environment to stay on as a full time worker after the holiday seasons. The jobs you are tasked to do are very repetitive but are also very easy to put to task. You can learn many things from the job if you seek to aim higher on the employment chain as many bottom level jobs are common sense and don't take any skill what so ever to perform. At the time I worked within Amazon we were undertaking 10 hour shifts starting from 7pm and was perfect for everyone to keep both their work and social life separate from each other and yet still have time for them both and came as one of the many perks to the job.
good,"Amazon got some great DBAs around.  It was fun working with them and learned a lot.  Oracle on Linux is the standard along with FSFO."
good,"stand up in am and at lunch to learn any new information and we strech. Review work board each quarter to find out our job for that time period. As with anywhere so management is very informative and supportive while others are distant. Co workers vary as with any work place, you have the ones who work to help out the team and ones who dont want to work. We all just mainly try and support each other in our daily duties. The hardest part of the job is not getting the support in a timely manner since our rates are based on our weekly assessment. Example, our machine freezes and takes a tech 10 mins to come out we are downa dn our rate drops with it even though it is not our fault it at times it count against us. The most enjoyable is the people and the fun things they do from time to time."
good,"TRMS :"
good,Work place was very positive with wonderful co-workers. Everyone showed up and worked hard. Working a third shift and 10 hour days is difficult. You are on your feet for 10 hours with two 15 min breaks and a 30 min lunch. You work almost all holidays and overtime.The most enjoyable part of my job is processing the return items. Fixing up the items so that they are presentable and ready to be sold to a customer. The hardest part is to stand for 10 hours while keeping up your rate. The hours are long and exhausting but my wonderful co-workers made the job enjoyable. The management at Amazon is not so great. They don't listen to their employs and implement new UI's and ideas that just make more problems then they cure. Overall I did learn how to be very independent in my job but also work with a wonderful team. I loved the people I worked with and the work was not bad. It was management that was the most frustrating when you feel like you are not being listened too and that higher up management knows best while there dissensions are making you do 50 to 55 hour weeks starts to make you not want to come to work.
good,"This was my first job and it taught me a lot. I learned how hard you have to work to achieve daily job expectations and to have to answer to a manager. For the most part I rather enjoyed it. It wasn't overly complicated and the managers were friendly. Unfortunately amazon policy dictates that you are proficient in all jobs and I was eventually moved from the packing department which i was rather good at to the ""picking"" department which involved going around the building and getting items off the shelves to be sent for packing. the production rates were slightly too high for me to be able to consistently meet."
good,"Amazon is an awesome place to work for. The ambience, Management and work culture is good. There is a lot of scope for improving skills and learn new things everyday."
good,"At Amazon, there are always new developments, as they say, every day is Day 1. "
good,Amazon is a easy going job with a tough environment to stay on as a full time worker after the holiday seasons. The jobs you are tasked to do are very repetitive but are also very easy to put to task. You can learn many things from the job if you seek to aim higher on the employment chain as many bottom level jobs are common sense and don't take any skill what so ever to perform. At the time I worked within Amazon we were undertaking 8 hour shifts starting from 7am and was perfect for everyone to keep both their work and social life separate from each other and yet still have time for them both and came as one of the many perks to the job.
good,"This use to be a great place to work.  Work hard, make history."
good,I am a trainer so I get to interact with different people on a daily basis. Which is what I love about my job. My peers are great to work with. Can have stressful days but that comes with any job.
good,"clock in. participate in a daily workout with safety suggestions."
good,"Pick orders for customers, display dedication an detail to customer orders. How Amazon is fast an efficient in getting orders out. How they succeed in business. Hardest part was the physical walking around 20 miles a day."
good,"All around a good place to work. A typical day begins with a start up by our area manager, communicating expectations of the day and reviewing performance of day past. Management is great and always has time to discuss any concerns or barriers to being successful. Co-workers are honest hard working folks who don't have time to chat during the day!. Toughest part of my job is all the walking, comfortable shoes are a must. I enjoy the satisfaction of being a small part of our customer's Amazon experience."
good,Amazon is a good place to gain experience in retail and understanding how a business operates.
good,"Restaurant Fernando is a familiar restaurant, and it a great work for everybody, the management is always helping the employees."
good,"walking alot,its all easy work."
good,management is very slack but its a very easy but physically demanding job
good,A typical day at work would be putting product on the shelves to be picked to be shipped to the customer.  I've learned to work in a face pace environment.  Every one there was friendly and supportive.  The hardest part of the job was having to work nights.  The best part of the job was it worked well around my school schedule.
good,"As a picker, I would walk the whole time I was there but it keep me busy. This was 4 days at 10 hrs. a day, at night, so only saw co-worker at lunch or break. Unfortunately, I did not get to work long because of a personal matter and had to quit."
good,"My time spent at Amazon thought me how to manage Associates to maximise their result which effect improvements of 150% on Associates targets. I was able to manage and monitor Absence, performance and Safety Audits on a daily base with extremely focus on Customers satisfactions. I was well trained by Amazon to understand the process best than Associate to create important and very helpful feedbacks which affect on the biggest Amount of over well performing Associates per shift than any other Agency at Amazon.co.uk."
good,"Amazon will keep you busy, forever.from the time you punch in till quitting time, you're on the go. but people are nice and friendly and ya can put bucks in your pocket when you need to."
good,"*Involves me participating in Stand-Up, where everyone is briefed about the day's goals. Then 2 hours of picking, 15min break, 2 hours and 45 minutes of picking, 30 minute lunch, stand-up, 2 hours and 15 minutes of picking, 15min break, and finally 2 and a half hours of picking."
good,Amazon.com is a great company to work for that has absolutely amazing benefits. They take care of employees. There is limited room for advancement that they could improve on.
good,"Empresa boa para trabalhar, com um boa dinâmica, sempre atualizada com cursos de capacitação para o empregado, uma gerência organizada."
good,Amazon is a great place to work.The buildings are very secure. Most people are friendly. The management team is very geared towards developing the team. Amazon is extremely concerned with employee safety and constantly ensure that duties are being performed as safely as possible.
good,"it was good experience."
good,The hardest part of the job is where you push the packages on the conveyor specially when they come enormously.
good,"I liked working with the customers to find games they and their kids would like."
good,Great work experience and work ethics. Friendly Work Culture and Environment. All together a good place for starters.
good,I gained an additional 2.8 years of experience in a Call Centre environment and was given the opportunity to really grow myself as a Quality Assurance Specialist; a role I have worked more than 5 years to reach.
good,starts by stratching then going to the spot your working at in the building. i learned everything i could there. managment was great down to earth people co workers are ok also. lifting cases of books. sorting the products to be shipped out to costumers
good,"•	Collaborate with my business area, Amazon Local UK; holding regular meetings with stakeholders and hiring managers to make decisions about our current recruitment cycles and future headcount plans, offering a consultative approach to ensure best practice and efficiencies. "
good,A typical day at work is staanding at one station scanning products into the computer and sending them down the production line. I learned how to work at long periods of time and how to work in loud places. My co-workers were very cool and nice. The hardest part of the job was standing on my feet for long periods of time. The most enjoyable part of my job was making money & interacting with my co-workers.
good,The opportunity is a great way to gain experience. Working hard pays off
good,"Its a warehouse job so you basically have no life working there. Busy atmosphere you can always find something to work on."
good,"amazon was a high expectations warehouse job with many rules and lots of expectations"
good,"1 semaine sur 2 du matin, l'autre de l’après midi."
good,"For the most part it's slave work. I worked as a picker and it was tough to say the least. Typically had to walk 5-15 miles per day. The breaks were too short. By the time you leave the pick area and get to the break room, your break gets cut almost in half. "
good,It is a fast paced environment and the people are very supportive and helpful.
good,"•	Solve customer service issues and demonstrate passion for delivering a positive Customer experience"
good,Hard job but good work and met some top people. Sucks that it was only temp work but that's made very clear to you as is how hard the job is. Don't bother applying if you're work shy or not willing to be in a bit of pain when you start
good,I don't know what I enjoyed more the everchanging variety of friendly faces I got to work with or the workout I enjoyed getting as I completed my tasks at Amazon.
good,"Since my work was contracted, I have the personal responsibility of connecting with the publishers to get audio books to produce. Most of the work was royalty based, which means a very lucrative salary if you can stay on top of auditioning and meeting with publishers. The typical day includes auditions for the various books available for recording, Then depending on the day, having different talent come in to do V.O. for their parts. For me, I enjoy the freedom given, and responsibility to succeed."
good,"The high-pace environment is great for the length of shifts. The management is decent, but they do not put in the desired effort to assist you with problems and issues. The co-workers are decent, yet a lot of them do not put effort into their work which leaves you to do extra. The hardest part of the job is the physically aspects along with the long shifts. The most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that you always have consistent work, and you can move up the chain of job positions if you put in the effort."
good,My typical day at work is clocking in and working as hard as I can. I learned a lot working for Amazon; being able to learned different departments and getting a general idea on how to collect items that customers place online to sending the product to the customer. Management not very good; a lot of the managers lack on communication with co workers and also towards other managers. The hardest part of my job is walking on concrete for at least 16 miles every night for 10 hours. The most enjoyable part of my job is training new hires on how to do there assigned task.
good,People work very hard and still maintain a positive attitude and culture.
good,"For me a typical day involved, manifesting trucks o go out for deliveries, pick orders, and pack them. I learned how to organize my time so I was sure to get my job functions done in the time allotted. Co-workers were a fun bunch of people who worked hard. Hardest part of the job was during our peak months. I enjoyed learning how to handle different situations as I became a seasonal supervisor."
good,"Overall to me, Amazon was a great place to work at, but the only bad thing for me was the fact that I lived 1 hr and 15 minutes away. The hardest part of the job was the ride home for me but the work there was fairly easy. I worked with a group of amazing people that I had the pleasure to work with and get to know. Management was great for the most part also except for the fact our managers in our department changed 4 times during my tenure. Never got the chance to really get used to any one in particular. I learned the importance of  teamwork."
good,A typical work day at Amazon.com is busy. Never a dull moment.
good,"Responsible for scanning and packing generated internet orders for a well known, nationwide shipping company. I pack multiple and single orders for the first 4 hours of the shift. Second half sort and load trucks safely and securely. Ive learned proper lifting procedures and loading techniques to get the job done fast and correctly. The associates are always more than willing to help and train you to be successful within the company. The hardest part of the job was adjusting the enviroment if you never work in a warehouse before but it will come natural eventually. The most enjoyable part of the for me is working on the dock it feels like a challenge or competition against yourself to not get overwhelmed come whats coming your way while working under a little pressure."
good,"A very challenging and drive-thru culture, really working hard and having fun here"
good,"Amazon's logo is ""Work Hard, Have Fun, Make History"" - and they certainly try to make this happen."
good,"a day at amazon was tiring, the work you do every day varies based on customer orders, so as far as volume, your team might have to move fifty thousand or one hundred thousand items in a day. so there might be lots of work, or not enough. "
good,would of liked a fulltime position but it seems they deal with a lot of short contracts
good,"I love the job I perform. I can run the shipping and pack departments by myself. I have 70+ associates under me. My only regret is that it takes to long to advance. The pay for all the task I perform is very low. I enjoy the workload, but I hate the attendance policy."
good,"moving at a very fast pace to get orders picked and shipped to customers, great management, friendly co-workers , the hardest part is trying to keep your energy level up to work the long day"
good,"Repetition all day everyday. The breaks weren't long enough for the quantity of people employed there, but over all it was a great atmosphere to work in once you found your rhythm. Management wanted to see you do your best so they would push you to the limits."
good,Wonderful opportunity to work with Amazon and clients. Enjoy driving assignments with assigned areas to make client relations and service levels much better.
good,Amazon.com is a great place to work and you meet some amazing people there. I really do miss the people at Amazon.com
good,"A typical work day is you go in grab a scanner log into it and it tells you what you will be picking,multi items or single items. From there you are walking as fast as you can to pick these orders for your entire shift which is 10 hours.Most of the co-workers are fun to work with. The hardest part of this job is being able to keep a fast pace all day with some deadlines on some orders.The most enjoyable part of this job is having fun in between picking these orders while passing by a co-worker."
good,"Maintain and develop components assigned."
good,The job itself is okay... Just as a picker it is extremely boring... Do not get much interaction with others... Makes for very long days... And mandatory overtime... Especially in the fall...
good,"It doesn't look like you are in a big American company; the environment is casual and you can talk to everybody without any awkward feeling, from the new arrived to the senior manager."
good,"I'm a good worker , work hard and I like work. I learn very fast new job and learn more when I get time.I have always good relation ship with my co-workers and I'm working in team to be together."
good,"goo for seasonal job, very good pay and benefits. hard to keep in touch with the outside world"
good,- Foi a minha segunda faculdade. Aprendia na faculdade e tinha a oportunidade de botar em prática no trabalho.
good,"Amazon was a place where you could always expect to have to work to do which was nice because just standing around does nothing. The managers at Amazon were exceptional, they made sure to check on employees and help them with anything they needed including instruction. The managers were very understanding and made sure that everyone was well informed on anything that was going on The hardest part of the job was making the rate that was required during peak when room was very limited. The most enjoyable part were the people I got to work with everyone was outgoing, caring and very friendly. I learned to keep working hard no matter whats going on because hard work pays off."
good,Non-stop action from the time you clock-in til the the time you clock-out. Surrounded by great people.
good,When we first started it was a very nice place to work. I was able to learn a few other things outside of just pack however it is very hard to advance
good,"Working to all the usual contact centre restraints, but more focused on resolving customer queries on first contact and taking ownership until resolution."
good,It is a good place to work. It has good benefits. The management is a little bit unorganized but in general is good.
good,Typical work day included picking items from inventory in order to meet quota.
good,"long days, hard hours on concrete. Good pay and no benefits. They pay for your site, that is helpful."
good,The workplace was crowded and everyone was in constant movement. Going from one end of the warehouse to the next under a certain amount of time.
good,At first the work seemed difficult to handle but with more dedication to learn how to be productive and quality efficient it all got easier to deal with.
good,"*A typical day at work. I do my job as an order picker. I walk the warehouse library pushing carts full of selected items I've scanned into the system that have been ordered. Once I've completely loaded my cart, I drop the cart off at the pack line so that they can be boxed (packed) and shipped out."
good,"Many teams have agile scrum process, which is good in a way to make your day productive."
good,"I enjoyed working for amazon, the staff that trained me was great. I"
good,"always something to do,great co-workers,make sure your flexible in your schedule"
good,"Everyday I scanned items using scanners, placed items in totes, and placed the totes on conveyors. I've learned to pick the right items and increase my pace. The managers were nice, helpful, and understanding of my situations. Some co-workers were mean and rude, but others were good and polite. I hardly spoke to my coworkers because I was always busy. The hardest part of the job was being timed trying to find the correct items and dealing with some of the mean and rude co-workers and people sometimes being in my way. The most enjoyable part of the job was listening to music, and the job was pretty laid back. I liked my job. It was also peaceful."
good,"Very good work environment, good culture and also fun activities,"
good,My typical day would be to go in the system to see what orders needed to be out for the day. I was in the position of shipping oversized items that had to be overwraped. The hardest part of my job would be during peak when I had to train new people that didn't want to work. My most enjoyable part would be training new people that wanted to work and we got everything out on time
good,"Job was simple and had opportunity to grow. Aside from getting used to being on your feet for 10 hours a day, it was a pretty simple job, and not overly demanding."
good,long hours fast pace. they work people like high paid slaves. If a person dies on the job the will give a moment of silence but then expect the other workers to get back to work.
good,"Pay could be better, but its a fast paced fun environment. This is for people who don't mind a lil hardwork. A couple bad apples here and there but flexibility and benefits are great."
good,"Good work culture and awesome ambiance with work life balance, campus and benefits are good. Management can be trusted. Hardwork and Ideas pay off for the promotions."
good,Moderate workplace. No music just warehouse noise. Straight work. Two 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch break. Good people. Decent management. 40 hours solid.
good,"When I first got the job as 'seasonal', i hated it. I worked 4 days a week, 3:30am-7:30pm. Then again I am a student and have another job as well, that season specifically was hard. However, making it out of the seasonal period, Amazon hired me! Let me pick my days, my hours, AND benefits on top of that. MUCH better!!!"
good,Virtual employee that worked ~9-10 hours per day. had a lot help for onsite management for sites i worked with were very helpful. the most enjoyable part of job is creating new content for assoicates.
good,"Bezahlung für alle Mitarbeiter der jeweiligen Berufsgruppen gleich."
good,"Repetative and fast paced work. No special skills required, just need to concentrate. Well paid and overtime available for everyone, not just the chosen few. Majourity of management are welcoming and helpful. Any employee that caused trouble or harrased other workers was quickly removed.Would work at this location again."
good,The job is fun but it is hard work. It is not a job where you can come in and think that you will relax. The benefits and opportunity for advancement is great though.
good,I enjoy the work culture and work/life balance.  Fun place to learn new things and network. Ability to advance career depends on the leadership in your specific department.
good,There is an old saying....this is where over achievers go to feel bad about themselves. Work life balance is terrible but the job itself is fun and loose.
good,I have liked it there so far. It is fast-paced and you will be trained in multiple areas if you are a top performer. The pay is competitive compared to other jobs like it.
good,"Great Benefits"
good,Fast pace work environment. You'll learn how to work individually and as a group. You'll learn and develop team work culture and get to understand amazon's working culture.
good,Was a great place to work just needed to get employees a little more under control and not so into one another Business and personal life’s and actually focus on working and not making friends but to get our tasks or jobs finished. Rather then that it’s a great company to work for and be around lol
good,"Was a good environment, the supervisors and managers really care about our safety and was a excellent hour pay rate."
good,"Life at Amazon was ever-going. Like any prosperous outfit business was ever-changing on so many levels. The management, hourly and the business partners were as diverse as I've ever met. There was goodness encountered, with people from around the world. My time there was something I'll always cherish."
good,"I have worked at Amazon as a automation analyst for more than 3 years. It's good place to work, competitive work environment, great working culture. ."
good,"Nice place to work for , I would work for them again.  Put orders in packages and treat everyone with respect. 4 days work schedule, and extra hours during the holidays."
good,"I enjoyed very much working there but it was a very hard to get in touch with any person from Human Resources to converse over to keep the full-time position, when I was hired I was under the assumption that I was hired for full-time work but it turned out to be that I was only there for seasonal help but was told that I could apply again. I have been trying to reapply dadaily.impossibleimpossible to get in touch with anyone"
good,The LGB8 warehouse has a great group of people very helpful. they answered any questions you could have.Overall it was a lovely place to work and it sucked that my seasonal time came to end.
good,"A typical day at work consists of many boxes, thousands of them"
good,"Easy going"
good,"Amazon Web Services (AWS) is both a challenging and great place to work for many reasons. The most challenging aspect to work with is the constant contradictions. Your direct bosses will stress the need for quality work and assure you that you're fine as long as you are doing your best and maintaining that expected quality. However, their bosses need to ensure your team is fulfilling the appropriate quantity metrics, so there is increased pressure to do more and more while maintaining quality. It's very easy to become burnt out in this kind of situation. "
good,The work can be easy but labor intensive. A lot of walk and lifting. Can be fun if you are working with the right coworkers. Like any other place. The offer a lot of fun activity's at Peak / Christmas time. You can move up here if that is what you are looking for.
good,"Best place to work, salary is OK, other perks are good but don't expect growth n promotions as that is depends on your manager. Even though you're performance is good, they will delay it.."
good,"It is really nice working at Amazon, a nice working environment and pleasant colleagues to work with.  The management was forth-coming with every concern."
good,I had a bit of problems when I was working there when I started my feet hurt a lot I got used to it after a month it got easier. The people were pretty nice
good,Great place to work for someone that needs a non-traditional schedule. I worked with great people that were supportive and cared about the employees.  HR at Amazon is very big on employee interaction and engagement.
good,"Buona azienda e buon rapporto con i colleghi,ottima la sicurezza,buona la pulizia,l'unica cosa che migliorerei la pausa ""troppo breve""uno smile a questa azienda che mi ha dato un'opportunità!."
good,"They are very Good company to work with, they pay very well, they care more about your safety and there are enough breaks. They are games to play to reduce stress"
good,A lot of opportunities if you are in the right city. Vert fast paced. Good company culture. You have to make the best of it as there is no hand holding.
good,that had greater incentives with their staff and greater opportunity to grow within the company.  that workers are trained with courses and certifications to have the possibility of growing in employment.
good,"pack, load, unload, scan, lift, push, pull, sort, wrap, fast past, different shifts to choose from, opportunity to grow or advance, heavy lifting for some areas"
good,New challenges to overcome everyday as a Process Assistant. Management had good communication with associates and was good at putting out proverbial fires. Hardest part of the job was the physical activity. A shift serves as a full workout. Part of my job was to keep morale high since the remedial work for the other associates was boring and repetitive.
good,"I have a lot of enjoyment as the culture of Amazon is totally different from the corporate world."
good,"Sono stato assegnato al magazzino con compito di sistemare i materiali in arrivo dallo scarico merci, posizionandolo negli scaffali.  Di supporto al gruppo che carica la linea dalla riceziine merci e raccolta cartoni."
good,Good company if you're ok with not knowing overall goals or direction. Everybody is very relaxed which is both good and bad. Management doesn't adhere to their own promises but generally - can't complain.
good,"Tasks are easy don't take much skill, but can be tiresome. Long hours especially during peak season. Good benefits, school accommodation, decent pay. Only a handful of people in hr are any good."
good,u'll be looking for another job soon it is fun. But hard work. Training is good job is ok a lot of ppl like to stand around and do nothing make u do all the work
good,Working with different people is cool and the flexibility with hours is great if you have another job. I have no issues except for the short hours. This would work great for someone looking for a part time job for extra cash.
good,"si corre tanto, troppo. Ma i superiori sono gentili e l'ambiente non è poi così male"
good,Great place to learn and be exposed to the latest technology in automation. Continuous improvement is encouraged and hands on experience is acquired. Good benefits.
good,People say a lot of negative things about amazon working people to death but it’s totally worth it. The pay rate changes in the winter time during the holidays from $15 to $20 an hour so it’s worth it. If you go in and do your job the correct way you’ll be alright. But they will let you go when the holidays are over when you go through integrity staffing. And you get paid weekly. But if you don’t work for a temp you get better benefits and you get paid bi-weekly
good,"I worked on two separate teams, and I had vastly different experiences with both.  One where I felt management wanted to see me succeed, the other wanted to succeed because of me.  Very different outcomes, and styles and I don't know which is more common within the company."
good,"Il est clair que le travail à fournir chez amazon est vraiment difficile au tout début. Si vous n’êtes pas quelqu'un d’énergique et qui a beaucoup de ressource pour tenir une cadence très rythmée sur environ 3 heures, je vous déconseille amazon. "
good,"Overall hard work, but you get compensated for what you do. Having a great attitude is key to completing the job and managers really do anything they can to help out."
good,Amazon was a great place to work. They always made sure everyone stayed safe while also making sure people were happy. Managers were usually very quick to help with any problems you had. They were stern but understanding.
good,"Management, people are good, work culture. It was good working at Amazon. It was my best phase of life. Learnt how to manage people, how to work on people management"
good,Please tell clearly to ur employes job duration. Because there no fair dealings with worker about job duration. This work is not easy so please don't do like this
good,Whole foods shopper is a good part time job if you are still a student or have another full time job. It has flexible working schedule. Business attire is not required.
good,"The job was easy honestly, the managers are well spoken and helpful and i enjoyed my time there i hope i can go back. Amazon gets a little crazy during peak season and it's a little hard to manage your time but overall a good job."
good,"Every thing there is good."
good,I am working at amazon in outbound associate part. Based on my experience working in this large and famous company I can say that It is really organized in all parts.
good,My overall experience at Amazon was very professional. The culture at Amazon is customer oriented and makes you feel like your starting a career rather than just a job per say.
good,the co-workers was amazing because they were so friendly and easy to talk to and the packing was very easy to do but well sometime be a rush when priority item comes up.
good,"Stay busy, there's a lot to do at all times and always stay on task. Do anything they ask you to do and you'll be able to grow and learn new skills in different areas."
good,I came to Amazon with a lot of managerial experience. I am there to learn all that I can and to grow within the company It was physically hard at first but now is enjoyable. I like the independent working and freedom to shine if you desire to do so
good,"A very good place to start your career. The work culture is great. Got an opportunity to expand my knowledge about business, operations and performance analysis."
good,"It is a very safe workplace "
good,"If you like drinking from a fire hose, completely unrealistic deadlines, dealing with managers who should not manage a peanut butter sandwich but want to show off your automation skills, this is the place for you!"
good,Amazon Turk easy to do with a decent computer and lots of time. Dedicated to doing lower paying work to increase the number of hits in order to get higher hits in the future.
good,I enjoyed working for this company because I was able to work from home and the hours were pretty flexible. They also had decent management which is always a plus.
good,"They really dont care about their workers, they make us work 60 hours of mandatory overtime back to back weeks it was a good experience but it wasn’t the best"
good,Everyone is always so grumpy during the morning shift and the managers barely want to help you. Only want to gossip than do their jobs. It's decent money and benefits though.
good,"It's a good place to work , some days can be a little stressful. But what job isn't."
good,Amazon is a young management employment employer. Employee's are rarely supervised. They act and treat other employees as they please. Great work hours and flexible schedule.
good,"Hours were good and pay was reasonable.  Management was friendly, helpful and understanding.  I found the culture of the workplace to be exciting with many special events."
good,Quick pick up's with easy to follow route planner. Different round all the time. can be a bit lonely at times. great way to see more of town/city. decent rate of pay for work done.
good,"good management, nice people, work woth schedules, various times, good pay and benefits are okay, no the best but it gets the job done. also, be ready to lift and bend."
good,Interesting and environment is impressing. Welcoming and understanding in cultural differences and maintains professional respect in their system. Good for all employment departments and effective.
good,Muy eficases y rapidos un orden muy bueno y estricto
good,"The work was enjoyable, good enough pay. I liked the hours. The only problem was the location was too far away. The work station was individualized which was enjoyable. It was a fast paced environment."
good,"One thing I liked about amazon was the 14 leadership principles of the company are followed by everyone from ground staff to senior management.Apart from that it is a good place to work, senior management is directly approachable, you can voice out your opinion."
good,"Lift packages, load vans, worked 10 hour shift. Flexible times to start your shift. The routes would be inconsistent so you would not know the area or where you were delivering."
good,"It was like a regular 9-5 job which required focus and patience."
good,Very demanding but rewarding. Good coworkers.  You can go with your friends or something to you and you can go to the school tomorrow morning if we are going back home 🏠 night or not tomorrow morning w
good,"Working conditions at Amazon are not good. Paranoid culture, constantly looking over your shoulder, micromanagement in the extreme. They like to turn over staff because the belief is fresh staff will bring new enthusiasm and energy to the business"
good,Great for someone in college trying to make nice money to get by or someone older who’s retired.. Shifts can sometimes take up of all the day but the good thing is you work four days and off three days except when peak time. Management was very disorganized and not fit but would ride your coat tail about rates / production.
good,Would be much better if there wasn’t a lot of drama. Hopefully they will do better with that in the future. They should also be more aware of who the chose to be manager because they can get very immature and unprofessional also.
good,"Overall great place to work at for a side job, hrs/days are flexible. Room for advancement and many other locations to transfer to if need be thorough out the country."
good,"Working as a warehouse employee was one of the best jobs I had. Although the location I worked at was not as demanding as regular warehouses, it was still tough work in the department I was put at. There was a lot of heavy lifting and relying on other workers to get their work done as well. As much as I did my work there was always more work made because of the laziness of some employees the company had. They pretty much hire anybody who passes the drug test since there is no interview process required."
good,Doporučuji práci pokud nemáte problém s noční směnou
good,"Trabajo intenso, carga de trabajo cambiante, ambiente de estrés. Sin embargo los equipos de trabajo suelen ser unidos, siempre hay una persona dispuesta a ayudarte y ciertamente se encargan de hacerte sentir lo más cómodo posible para que puedas desempeñar las labores sin problemas."
good,This organization helped me in gaining multiple skills over the period of time I was there. It promotes good worklife balance for the employees leading to a good culture.
good,"It was not a bad job. The reason I left was not job related. It was long hours, but the work wasn't that hard. Made a few friends, was fun mostly. Load trucks daily, work in induct daily. Worked tranship most of the time and loaded trucks. Always palletizing. Have to keep busy constanly. Had 2 breaks and a lunch everyday."
good,"Working with people at Amazon (more specifically Kindle Direct Publishing) has been, overall, a good experience. The reply rate is quick, and the people generally want to help."
good,Fun place to work.  Each position seems to be highly specialized in skillsets which is an issue for advancement.  Best advice would be to get some broad certifications (like project management) so you can traverse laterally as you want.
good,"It’s a good job but wish Management and HR in Texas would appreciate their employees more  Every Amazon is different, I transferred from Ohio to Texas and it’s all ran different"
good,"Decent job, great benefits. It's hard to beat a four day work week and the Peak rush has gotten much better in the last two years. A great place to gain marketable job skills."
good,Easy job as long as your doing your doing your work. Great options for schedules. Sorting different kinds of item into totes for the correct destinations.
good,They should consider people who work with them as temporary staff and upgrade at least 70% to permanent staff. Because they are already part of the organization and it will safe them cost of recruiting and training
good,"They offer three shifts. Front Half, back half and donut.  Coworkers were friendly. Once you let management know that you would like to move up, they try to get you an opportunity to advance."
good,"It's a great place to work, customer satisfaction and safety is the main concern. Amazon is a huge company and I'm really surprised about the structure or lack there of from management. It's chaos because management doesn't put out a standard and every day something changes. Lack of communication between managers and assistants because you could go to one about an issue and 95% of the time another manager will give you the opposite of what you were told was the right way/ solution."
good,"Environnement de travail agréable mais forte demande vis à vis des intérimaire."
good,"A very well managed and fun work environment, where making friends is easy and the work is physical but requires almost no previous knowledge of the job. Fast paced and competitive if you're a competitive person, but relaxed and fun when you need it to be."
good,A good work place to get you off your feet and started on a better life. And the pay is pretty great the only thing is you stand on your feet all day.
good,Picker position requires a lot of walking (12+) miles a shift to meet the quota set by Amazon. The pay was about twice the state minimum wage at the location I was working.
good,I love what I do and enjoy being part of a team who strives to provide  excellent customer  service.  Typical day is complete when every package leaves the door
good,Amazon is a good place to work for younger people.  The offer paid career training and 1 year. They paid for my CDL with no commitment to stay. Great place for people to grow.
good,"Travail plaisant , jeune , dynamique ou la routine n existe pas"
good,It's a warehouse job. Pay and benefits are good if you stay long enough. They encourage education through their own building or support you after a year of full time work with tuition help.
good,"Very interesting culture. Physical work with deadlines. Good management, caring human resources, flexible schedules where you can work any time day, night."
good,the work environment was friendly. if you had a problem and ask for help your co workers will be happy to help. Its a fast pace job. And they have mandatory over time.
good,You will need to work hard to meet your productivity and quality target. Also you will need a listening and fair manager to give you the opportunity to progress. Amazon is good place to work and have fun with the right team players.
good,"Amazon expects you to be lightning fast and add tons of value. "
good,"It was a great experience while working as a catalog associate , I have learned how a operations team work along with how quality matters over production and how you can always challenge yourself to do more when put under loads of work."
good,The job is simple. I only struggle cause I have back issues and lifting items and being on your feet constantly makes it really hard. The company has helped me a lot though. Great benefits
good,"Job security and opportunity, nation wide job locations, great and dependable work support and strong reliable management team overall a great job to have"
good,I have enjoyed my time at Amazon Robotics -- although I feel it is time for a new opportunity. I've learned what I can learn and am ready to apply to and bring success to a new company.
good,"Amazon is an awesome place for anyone to work in with great people,a fun workspace and awesome tech to work on.Everyone is given equal opportunities and treated with respect"
good,"From the first email back from Amazon, the experience was pretty fair and just. The structure was professional and quick, yet easy to navigate and comfortable."
good,For L2 & L3 employees the pay scale is not that much good. It can be revised. Above L4 it's very good. Work culture is very good. No dress code. Good place to learn and develop.
good,"Excellent work culture. "
good,Amazon Fulfillment center is an amazing place to work due to the workplace being so open and welcoming. Almost all of management are likable and understanding. Plus the lunch room has a ping pong table and a good food selection.
good,You get pushed so hard that it takes the energy out of your regular life. Benefits and pay are great. Some favouritism. Some expectations are unreasonable.
good,It was a lot of boring and long hours and strenuous activity while working. The managers wanted people to work like robots and people couldn’t get tired or go slow or a write up was coming. The money was good but I did not like being there. The people got me through the days.
good,Amazon  is not as bad as people say it is. I was there for over a year and a half and enjoyed my time there. I grew as an employee and learned a lot. Management is great with their employees
good,It was a good job it just started to take a toll on me and I was no longer happy. It was easy work as long as you were flaxible and didn’t mind doing a lot of things in one day.
good,"Learnt a lot at Amazon with respect to work culture and leadership management. Most enjoyable part of the job is freedom at work and act on your responsibility simultaneously. "
good,It’s a job it pays decent. I worked 3 12 hr shifts so having 4 days off was nice. Just show up do your job and go home. I’ve herd the stories about amazon but in my 3 years there I never had to use a bottle.
good,"It was a seasonal position that rewarded me well. However, I did not receive the opportunity to continue with this wonderful company there are not regrets and will apply again."
good,"The job pays good and the schedule varies on your choice. Everything is set up Amazon’s website and you can choose when to schedule. Once acquiring job, you will be trained in a group around your site for the first day. Make sure your badge works because it didn’t work for a couple people including myself for the first week. Other than that the atmosphere is pretty chill just look out for grumpy people.  In the morning. Oh yeah, they give free coffee."
good,"Pays $15 ph + more for shift differential. Full-time schedule is great but flex- schedule (or Quad A) is unpredictable, uncertain, & unstable. A good mindset is key. I liked to think of it as Amazon paid me to workout rather than me paying a gym! The work is manual labor-- simple tasks, repetitive, some heavy lifting, fast-paced--in a warehouse facility not temp-controlled. Summer and winter month temps are extreme! temps are"
good,"I was Process Assistant  and my job is to make sure all the new hired have enough training to produce quality work to meet the expectation of the customers."
good,"Lots of room for overtime especially around holidays, some favoritism as with any company.  Once you get the hang of it very easy to fall into the humbug routine.  They kept it interesting with contest, pizza day, fruit and different little things.  Just stay away from the drama as with any place."
good,"If you are thinking that every team and department at Amazon is equally treated and valued and paid, then I hate to burst your bubble."
good,Management are slightly friendly but mostly strict. Punctuality and work safety is key. Staffs working at Amazon are friendly and helpful. Completing task on time and committing for the last minute shifts given by management is tough.
good,It was really fun to be a part of the Andon Cord Team at Amazon development center Bengaluru centre(India). There certainly used to be episodes of overbooking work however the work culture in Amazon ensures that the employees enjoy working in the Organization.
good,"A typical work day, hate or love have to do what you have to do no matter what. I was a picker for my first time yes i dislike it but it has gotten better overtime and if you keep up good work. You may get offered to another position inside the warehouse. All up to each individual"
good,J'ai adorer mon expérience a Amazon et si c'était à refaire je le referais avec grand plaisir
good,"A normal day of work starts with a SoS(start of shift) meeting where you stretch and get info for the day. following your meeting you look at a board that says what function and placement for the day."
good,I enjoyed my team as an MBA intern. I worked on a tough project to solve a real problem that the team wanted resolved and was treated the same as a full time employee by both my team and other teams.
good,"You will learn a great deal working at Amazon.  You will be tired, in fact you will be exhausted - both mentally and physically at times.  Peak season is a real experience and it will test you in every way imaginable.  Inbound is a significantly longer Peak than Outbound.  Both sides have their pros and cons.  Regardless of which department you might work in I think you will find it a competitive environment and to really learn you will need to ask lots of questions.  If you are young and willing to move geographically you might find yourself advancing very quickly.  Amazon appreciates those who are willing to travel and move to new locations, open new buildings etc.  There is a ton of opportunity at Amazon."
good,"Steady hours and at peak time (christmas season) mandatory 60 hrs/ week."
good,"Super Team und Zusammenhalt, sowohl im deutschen Büro, als auch in den internationalen Offices"
good,The warehouse job was an evening job that included working by giving your maximum as it was physically demanding.
good,Unloading and organizing materials from truck to rack was a good fit for me. The management team made it enjoyable to come in for my shift. The team effort was strong with most.  Being an ambassador for PIT allowed me to share in the safety of the company as well.
good,Good opportunity at Amazon with good benefits and compensation  also room for advancement  the schedule could be a bit challenging as it is a fast paced environment
good,"La mia prima esperienza lavorativa in ambito contrattuale, il luogo di lavoro è dinamico, competitivo e non la consiglio a chi si vuole rilassare durante il lavoro qui è tutto molto duro e tutto molto preciso. Solo in pochi riescono ad arrivare al contratto indeterminato"
good,"This work is for those who enjoy a fast-paced, challenging environment. One associate can send out 100 packages per hour.  That involves moving quickly, following safety and operations procedures, switching up tasks and constantly moving... it's a workout!  Amazon.com is a cool place to work, but the people create the energy."
good,"Depends on team and manager, Amazon is a huge company, no common culture across the company despite the leadership team wishes. There are lots of ash hole managers here as well bottom workers."
good,"se avessi la possibilità ci tornerei domani, purtroppo la distanza influisce molto sui ritmi di lavoro"
good,productive and fast pace work place to work in. Also working in hot and cold tempertures during the course of the year.  The fall season is called peak season meaning more packages more deliveries and more hours to work
good,"Esperienza positiva di crescita professionale."
good,Work was good but sometimes management was unorganized or not on the same page. To many new temps or seasonals  but not enough room in the warehouse for all of us
good,They are really professional. They always take care of inexperienced new comers. The  major problem is their location : it's not easy to find a means of transport to reach there. You should have your own transport.
good,"it can be a fun place to work depending on your manager.  it is a PHYSICALLY DEMANDING job.  if you don't like to walk, hate steps or exercise , this is NOT the place for you.  pay is good and can be great when there is overtime or holidays."
good,"A place to work hard and get the job done. The managers were pretty decent and good people to work with. The hardest part of the job was the super heavy packages in extreme heat in the back of the tractor trailers , I learned to become literate with the scanner ,use a power jack for pallets and become team oriented."
good,"I worked for a cool group. I liked my boss and he treated us all with respect. The work life balance was fine, there were no horror stories. The work was a bit more cumbersome especially dealing with mobile development because Amazon expects its ads and apps to work on ancient phones, so QA testing was always a huge blocker that you had to deal with."
good,"Amazon cares about the associates as well as the customers, ensuring the orders get out in a timely and tidy manner. The managers are very caring of their associates, making sure they have all the tools needed to perform their jobs correctly and safely."
good,"I love my job. ? I'm smallsorts problem solve, waterspider,induction,loading ulds. Large problem solve. Everyone helps you. Friendly atmosphere.glad I'm there"
good,"Lots of walking and standing during work hours. Learned good time management and organization skills. Solid management along with helpful human resources. Hardest part would be, but not limited to, adapting to standing all day. Most enjoyable part would be, but not limited to, having two breaks for each shift."
good,Great opportunity very active and busy environment work place study movement very fast past environment several different available shifts available also
good,Overall I think Amazon is a pretty good company to work for. I feel like they really try to make sure they are being inclusive and have a diverse workforce.
good,"journée de travail un peu fatigante"
good,"A typical work day is this: Clock in, check in, go where you are needed, work the shift, and go home. You're on your feet 10 hours a day doing anything you're trained in, water available for consumption at areas designated for water stations, and have to take on tasks that are not part of your normal job tasks. Management is good, not much of a problem for me. The hardest part of the job is, well, everything. It gets difficult after a while doing a lot of the same thing over and over again, but you just got to do it. Its more or less part of the job. "
good,"When working as a delivery driver, it's important to be alert to your surroundings. The trucks are a bit top heavy and more complicated to drive in inclement weather conditions."
good,Grocery setting while doing warehouse work. Wear comfortable shoes. Prepare to be cold at some part of your day. Easy work to keep you busy. Various shifts. Part available
good,We would work 10-12 hours everyday. This was their busy season for the holidays. We would be on our feet alot picking and sorting items. Had to keep everything organized to make sure the customer got the right item.
good,Nice employees. One rude female “supervisor” (I don’t remember the name of her position. It’s something in training). One of her supervisors is okay with her disrespecting employees under her.
good,Basic pay is good and its a good place for work life balance. Weekly one WFH is available. Not much pressue . Annual bash. Very open management. Not much work pressure
good,"Amazing Place to learn and develop skills. Frequent changes in the role, both pro and con. You feel challenged every day and its fresh start daily. "
good,"Great benefits. Great job. Unfortunately,  I quit my boss, not Amazon. Upper management had cliches that were beyond frustrating. "
good,Would love to be still working there but transfer didn't go through and had to resign after being told that transfer always go through but beside that it is a great place to work.
good,"It was ok place to work in Crafton Industrial Park the same location as Horn,s warehouse and not to good person to call off to in Seattle Washington,there time 2A.M. our time 5A.M. and they never reported me as called off her in Pittsburgh,PA to Seattle Washington at 2 AM. that is why I was fired there in Crafton,PA was ok place to work if you got PA number to call off sick to not Seattle,Washington number!"
good,"I have worked several peak seasons for Amazon and enjoyed my job, they dont have leave options for emergency purposes which resulted in me losing my position entirely."
good,"buen ambiente laboral, pero hay poco tiempo para aprender a hacer las cosas rápidamente"
good,"Good experience while working here"
good,"It was a tough job at first but once you get through the hurdles of being responsible with your time and standing for hours and hours straight, you'll see just how fulfilling the work is."
good,The pay was great but they did not have enough hours to make it into a full time gig. It cost a lot in gas but they would pay good when you go overtime.
good,"Temporary job, seasonal job, perfect for students or people in transitioning career. Decent salary, not enough for the area. Management is fair, not many chances to grow in the company."
good,Over all a decent place to work  they have great benefits that you get to use on day one of hiring. There is not really any dress code. Its pretty easy to get on.
good,This was a work from home job and I can manage my own time at my place. The work is not quite hard just to translate the listings they are sending. I can watch over my kids too and spend more time with my family.
good,"Walking around with an RF unit and counting everything making sure everything was correct and if it was damage we did problem solved and we did about 6,000 within the days we work"
good,"This job required lots of hours on your feet, and bending and stretching. Lot of teamwork needed throughout the day. Opportunities to train in other departments as well as management opportunities. Good people, and fun goals to achieve in teams towards rewards during time of high productivity."
good,It was a decent experience due to long hours and I was barely turning 19 and was still in high school when I worked so it was hard to manage personal life
good,My review is it's hard to move up in position. If your not keeping your rates up then you won't be they won't really train you in other places. Which is not fare...everyone should be given the opportunity for advancement....
good,Culture is focused on individual work with periodic group reviews. Expect to write and defend many 6-page papers. Sometimes difficult to tell where to stand from a performance perspective
good,"I enjoyed working at Amazon.com, fulfilling orders as a Warehouse Associate Picking.  It was great exercise, mildly competitive with other coworkers to make the counts (usually young college students hired for peak season), with games included by one of the supervisors I had.  Not always a great atmosphere with some who were long term employees and did not always agree with changes.  I think that is found with any job!"
good,"When I started, I was seasonal until I became a regular employee. what we mostly did was pick up packages from the rolling belt and stow the packages to the bags. management was okay for the most part but the ambassadors were around for assistance. they have an average of how many packages get stowed per night and we get notified of how many are coming in. a few months after working there, I lost a few pounds."
good,Great place for a young person to work.  I think they would serve their employees better by having permanent set schedules and not V.E.T (Voluntary Extra Time).
good,Every work place has pros and cons and over all I liked it here. Just didn't agree with the pay but they will go above and beyond for you. I left because of pregnancy.
good,Good place to start a career.   Hard working individuals with a good work ethic can advance quickly in Amazon.  Transferring from one part of Amazon's business portfolio to another is easy.   Excellent employee benefits.  Climbing the management ladder internally for an experienced manager is a little frustrating.    I have advanced quickly but have not been able to skip management levels.
good,"The day was usually in forms of 4 hour shifts although you could take an extra shift that day if it was offered however you could not break 30 hours a week."
good,"Amazon is a nice workplace to consider it is very well a fast pace company. Working for Amazon you have to be able to lift up to 50lbs. The staff I work with is very organized and care about the company. Amazon gives you many opportunities to advance in the company. I myself learned  different areas in the company such as , knowing how to pick and stage."
good,"Really enjoyed working with Amazon as a Seasonal Delivery Driver, I only wish there was enough work to continue on. I built great relationships with the other drivers, and all were eager to help one another out when needed."
good,Amazon was a fun and fast paced environment for anyone. They offer great benefits and a food court alone with a fun environment for everyone with great communication between management and workers.
good,"Great starting job alot of good advantages, work is tolerable but fast paced I would recommend Amazon to anyone, and you meet alot of diverse people which is great."
good,"If you like to drive big trucks then Amazon TOM team is for you. It's a bis company and it is still young. Great opportunity for those who are young and fresh in their career. If you are seasoned, you can move in the business, but at one step every 30 days."
good,"My typical day at work involved processing orders to be shipped out.;"
good,"La mia esperienza in Amazon è stata più che positiva. "
good,"I don’t mind working at amazon. I work what they call an RT shift which is reduced time (36 hours a week; 12 hours 3 day a week). I work Thursday-Saturday midnights. This allows me to be home during the day with our children and avoid daycare. The only complaints I have are poor management, constant changing of management, favoritism and lack of training and advancement opportunities."
good,"This job is very physical, it requires standing for hours at a time on concrete floors with very short breaks. There didn't seem to be a very strong management presence, or, they were there but did not show strong support for employees. There was a sense of nothing matters except producing to meet the goals for the day."
good,"Good and fun environment and can be stressful at times but very understanding management."
good,"I worked for Amazon on a seasonal assignment for their Customer Service department. At the time it was only to support the holiday season so from November-January.  Basic customer service position nothing extensive.  Customer would call in and ask about the status of orders or you'd help them cancel and order, etc."
good,"You gotta be in some form of shape when you work here or youll want to quit. place is straightforward, listen to music and come dressed comfortably with a good amount of water. come with the mindset that you are here to do hard work for 8 hours."
good,Fair place to work with balance and benefits. Environment was ok. They gave us prizes. Snack and meals on holidays and randomly. Pay was great. Hours were low as part time
good,"There are some great managers that work here and some managers that one is not really sure how they got into that position. But I am confident that is with any organization. "
good,Good environment but expect too much from employees. Very multicultural which made me learn a lot about other cultures. Stowing rates are too high and management expects to keep an unrealistic pace.
good,"A typical shift is ten hours long, depending on the backlog. (Some days it may be extended to 11 or 11.5 hours.) Our managers, safety team members, Human Resource representatives, IT tech teans, facilities, and PAs are there to help us with problems as they arise. It truly is a team-work environment. We are responsible for meeting customer deadlines in a timely fashion. All missing and damaged items must be reported. The hardest part of the job is trying to make the rate. Not everyone is built for speed. The best part of the job is making a lot of good friends."
good,I like the variety of work. It is never a dull moment. I like that there is a lot of overtime and that sometimes they give me a day off to do chores at home. I also like the discount that we receive at amazon.com.
good,As for working with others it was the best job I've had outside of the military. However just way to much micro managing around the building. They are by far the best though about recognizing good work and awarding those accordingly
good,"The people working there are really nice, and they'er always about safety. It is a fast pass; your daily rates are high but it is possible to achieve. oh, and there really no music to listen to. sorry"
good,"The pay at Amazon is what got my attention. The starting rate is extremely high in comparison to many jobs in that area. However, you have to be a strong-minded individual to be able to work there for longer than a year or so. The work itself is very stressful due to the kind of contacts you receive and people you interact with."
good,"High pressure to keep up ratings, which were customer-created. Sometimes ratings were unfair. Mostly pleasant, but some nasty characters on the other end of the line."
good,"Fast paced. There is always something to do. Process changes to improve the productivity rates."
good,Amazon was a hard and rewarding place to work. During the early stages of Amazon delivery network there was alot of difficult times in tech and American understanding of the UK ways.
good,Ho lavorato nel magazzino di Amazon e posso dire che molte cose andavano bene ma altre no... Diciamo che li si è un po' abbandonati a se stessi e nonostante ero uno dei migliori del mio turno purtroppo non mi fu rinnovato il contratto
good,"Fantastic company to work for, though varies with what team you work ON. I worked on one excellent team and one okay team, but both were incredible learning experiences. I learned and incredible amount about the Amazon software ecosystem, systems management, Support Engineering, Product Management, customer satisfaction, communicating across departments, and much more."
good,"The Amazon is best company but the office at coimbatore branch is worst."
good,There's not really much to say. Confidentiality Agreements is signed upon being hired. Cannot talk about it or take pictures. Otherwise Working at Amazon is an okay place to work at.
good,"Buena cultura general, lo unico es la promocion interna que si non tienes carrera no subes"
good,"Ottima esperienza, persone simpatiche e socievoli, sempre pronte ad aiutare. Ambiente multiculturale dove si può imparare e in cui ci si può confrontare!"
good,"Ho lavorato in diverse logistiche, ma l'ambiente positivo che ho trovato in Amazon grazie agli OPS e Shift Manager sempre disponibili ad ogni esigenza non l'ho mai trovata in altre aziende. Quindi la valuto come un'esperienza positiva."
good,"Packs and repacks a variety of items such as industrial, electronic, and general parts, components, equipment, and other items including printed forms and publications. Uses standard and specialized prefabricated cartons, boxes, metal containers, and other packing materials and devices including tapes, seals, stretch wrap, staples, bands, as well as vermiculite and other cushioning materials. Places, arranges, marks, seals, and tags items on pallets and in containers, bins, and bulk storage. Consolidates various items for shipment. Conducts routine packing procedures, techniques, and equipment as well as basic warehouse procedures.  Measure, weigh, and count products and materials. Examine and inspect containers, materials, and products in order to ensure that packing specifications are met. Record product, packaging, and order information on specified forms and records.

Load and unload items into packaging machines and remove rejected packages to be isolated as surplus. Sort, label, grade and inspect packaged products. Counts the correct amount of stock and determines the proper shipping container in"
good,"Overall i think Amazon is a decent place to work if you need a job. That comment was for people who are level one's. If you are a level four or above its a pretty laid back place to work with interesting people as well as challenging. To be honest as an OMR things seems to change a lot considering the ""computer work side"" of things. I do believe part of this is because of the continuous change my particular building was going through. This is definitely not what all amazon warehouse's go through. I do believe if you are an EMT and want a change, overall i do think amazon is a good starter place to seek out in the midst of earning a degree and going on to bigger and better things."
good,I have had a decent experience working for amazon so far. It has only been a few months and it is the new delivery driver department so things are still new and always changing.
good,It is an easy job to manage regardless of what role you're given but the ideal conditions of the job are not equal for those who work harder than others.
good,"Great learning environment, it was easy to improve your skills while working with friendly, easy going co-workers. There was a wide variety of projects and tasks to learn multiple skills that will translate to any work environment."
good,I like working for Amazon they trained me even though it was temparory ld. Would go back and work for the company they really took care of the employees by having  pizza day of coffee and bagel day and special insensitive to win.prizes made you feel appreciated  IAM currently looking for work but can access the website forgotten password.
good,Working for Amzon was nice work enviroment and well organize. There was good employees and well manangment. Overall I had good experince  working and and it being my first job.
good,There wasn't really what you would call a typical work day there.  Every day I would do something different.  I learned the process from the very beginning of receiving packages until placing on truck and how important the proper scanning and placing of packages in correct area were if there was a need to track the exact location of the package.  The culture was very diverse with people ranging from 18 years of age up to 60+ years old.  The hardest part of the job was the heat.  The only kind of cooling they could provide were large blow fans due to having electronics and sensitive surfaces to protect from moisture.  The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the work I completed daily personally on a statistics board and seeing the progress I was making with each day.
good,Committed to inclusion and diversity and everyone feels valued. Opportunities for growth could be quite complex however as there is little to no personal guidance from supervisors.
good,"Pay Is fair for this kind of job and work environment is great, I didn't find it stressful at all. On the other hand, the warehouse I work in didn't offer full time positions which means little benefits. Upward mobility is limited and you would make just a couple more dollars per hour anyway."
good,"I’ve been with amazon for 11 years now. Amazon is amazing for the benefits, maternity, time off options and courses you can take to advance with amazon or to go elsewhere. My biggest issue I would say is the movement of management. The managers switch off (days to nights, vice versa OR to other departments) could be every 6 months to a year or if a manager leaves amazon. When you have a manager who sees something in you, it’s hard because they only are with you for a short amount of time before they get promoted or seek other opportunities. From my experiences, what makes people want to leave is first, the advancement opportunities. Lately there has been advancements in my building but that was a concern for most. Year after year many try to come up, but get “not inclined” for the positions they are seeking. Could be the person, but sometimes going through the interview process over and over can be discouraging.Second, repetitive work. There are times where you are doing the same job for quite sometime. So, if you do not like the job you are doing then people tend to get burned out and want to pursue other opportunities elsewhere."
good,"good culture good place great people good products average benefits"
good,"Company was really good to work for. Good pay, good hours, and time off. Multiple breaks during long shifts and 4 day weeks. Weekends off. Excellent accommodations as well"
good,Easy work good work environment flexible hours ok pay have to be available all day any day to move up in the company  Teterboro building is good environment but another buildings are not the same
good,"• Sorted packages based on size and destination, it was a little like Tetris (if you will) with boxes, envelopes and pallets."
good,A good place to work. Job is not too difficult and also they are giving a good salar but the management is worst. Job security depends on your relation with superiors.
good,Amazon has a lot of opportunities to advance. They offer classes for many different types of job opportunities. You can transfer to different departments.
good,Amazon provides opportunity to think big and present ideas your passionate about. Depending on job role allows for career advancement. The compensation is great and individuals who are driven and determined to excel will thrive in the environment. Amazon offers the opportunity for employees to continuously learn new things and grow themselves.
good,"I applied for a work-at-home position, which took about two weeks to get a confirmation of employment. I was excited at first to get the job as a Seasonal Work-at-Home Virtual Customer Service Associate. At first I was promised 28 - 30 hrs per week in the initial job agreement. However, after working with the company for about a week (paid training lasts for 4 weeks) we were told that we could bid for our actual production schedule. The schedule offered to us was only for 22 - 26 hrs per week?! I was so disappointed. Also, they expect you to work during every holiday and during these times you have what's called MET (or mandatory extended time = overtime) that you cannot be excused from, no matter what the reason. I love the benefits but the work culture could really use some improvement. They are slave drivers."
good,"Great job, fast-paced environment and enjoyed working from the comfort of my home.  Was laid off after working two years 50 to 80 hours a pay. Without notice!  You were practically your own boss but you did have a manager to oversee and my manager never spoke or engage with us as employees."
good,"1) A typical day at work was fast paced, but as the saying goes, “time flies when you’re having fun.”"
good,It's not a difficult job but it does require patience and flexibility. The people are great and they just want you to work at your best level possible.
good,"Highlights - "
good,Amazon is a good paying job but not much advancement opportunities it’s more who you know than what you know. Very polio in my opinion. But if you’re someone just wanting to make a check it’s the place for you
good,I am constantly driving. It’s quick pace End it makes the day go by quick. Overall the work isn’t too hard. I just wish it would pay a little bit more for tier 3 associates.
good,"The job is high paced so you need to have a lot of energy to do the tasks required of you. It is not difficult but you have to be attentive. But overall as long as you come to work, your shift should be smooth."
good,"This is a company that has a great starting pay and most certainly has the best benefits. The only company that I worked for that keeps employees engaged and motivated. People will of course get fired for attendance and maybe not performing well however, there are so many opportunities that will help an employee keep their job if they want it."
good,Great team management and efficient training provided. I had a great supervisor which helped our team in keeping its productivity and morale. I would definitely recommend.
good,everyday you go to your assigned station for the day and do that all day. I learned that it's all about longevity in a day at work. Management is highly energetic. Hardest part of the job is expected to hit and keep rate up through out the day. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you are in a different path. Meaning any indirect role. You are not timed
good,"Amazon is a decent company to work for, 12 hour shifts, 6 days a week, good pay, decent benefits if you can get through the door as a permanent employee"
good,"Amazon trying to do to much at 1 time, hiring and training not so good. HR seems clueless when you need their assistance, no one is actually on the same page."
good,Good company to work for if you want good benefits and good pay. The job isnt too difficult you just have to work fast at all times. It takes a little while to get used to but when you do it's not too bad.
good,I have nothing bad to say amazon is not a bad place to work. as long as you stayed focused on your job function's. I advanced with in ICQA quite fast. I was able to preform the job requirements.
good,"Is a good company to work for ."
good,Process incoming and out going merchandise to customers. The work place was friendly and a fast paced environment. The other employees I met was the most enjoyable part of the job and the satisfaction of getting customers merchandise out to them on time.
good,"I'm thankful for a variety of reasons. The hours & pay. The flexibility. I can have some grace on time & use unpaid time or my sick paid time for lateness. We all have to work fast & hard but we can leave early if we are done early. They give free t-shirts, candy, bbqs, & give out free gifts or gift cards. They try positive things ."
good,"Amazon is a very challenging place to work, very competitive but no consideration on internal promotions and would stay due to the experience overall and a lot of opportunity."
good,The immediate supervisors care about you but cooperate treat you as just another number coming or going out. Coorparete can definitely do a better job
good,"Great pay if you do overnight. My location provided lunch or donuts usually once a week. Great atmosphere and super busy. They do “Top-Ranked” for week and month for awesome prizes. Bonuses. Good benefits. The only negative is time-off. Non paid and it’s a point system that reloads every 3 mo. If you don’t have points to cover tardiness or absences, you accrue points. 5 and you’re fired."
good,If you are able to go in and just do your job then it's no problem at all to get it done.  If you like to go in and socialize all day then this isn't the job for you.  I only left due to the new managers they brought in that had no clue what they were doing.  Previous managers were great and actually asked for input before making changes.
good,The management I was under did a good job caring about production speed and the employees. The conditions were very cold in the warehouse and there would be times people couldn't do their job because of this. Management would always have extra supplies to keep the employees warm and they would give periodic breaks so that we could warm up.
good,"The hardest part of this job is when we have to delivery to rural area, and many places don't have internet. It all thanks to my experience to delivery successfully. I memorize the route direction while I have the internet, and that's why deliver packages successfully."
good,"Good policies, bad managers( unprofessional conduct by many floor managers)"
good,"Rewards inputs well, competitive, open culture, need to prove self, frequent reviews, flexible working hours, good stock options, highly rewarding for people willing to go extra mile"
good,"Ambiente molto positivo, solare, collaborativo ed amichevole."
good,Amazon is a very organized place though I think it's a little bit too systematic and fast paced. What I like about Amazon though it's the energy that it brings which is high.
good,Meet quota and are there on time will get you noticed. Lost weight with all the walking. Move up as quickly as possible to have true responsibilities and challenges. Some associates are willing to just go with the flow and not care about moving up or earning overtime.  You can't worry about team mates schedule only your own drive and work ethic. Give help where needed and be a team player and you will do well. Most L4's are new college graduates.
good,I was contracted through the concentrix. Amazon itself was awesome and they took really good care of us. Very pleasant work environment. I would not mind working for them again if I were given the opportunity.
good,Productive and nice work environment. It feels like a real family environment. Production moves at a steady pace so its not hard work. Managers are friendly but its hard to move up through company.
good,Targets are hard to achieve but can be done.  40 hours over 4 nights works well for work life environment.  pay is good
good,"I’m trying to get back in. I love it, it’s fast paced, hands on. I love that you could do more than just a scanner. I was also a splitter that I loved, small sorts and runner. Wanted to learn more. The only thing I was there for 6 months and still wasn’t permanent part-time and not too many hours. But other than that. I loved my job at hou1"
good,Great place to work best atmosphere and productive from most call centers that i worked at. Management in some dept are toxic and many people leave against there will lots of manager's are pretending to be caring and helping but they just looking to stab you in the back. You get tired of defending your self and decisions  you make.
good,"Too large of a company to be organized efficiently.  Oftentimes, the solution to a problem was to throw money or more employees at it.  The facility where I worked had very good managers, and very poor managers.  But the work was immersive, and could be done either poorly or well--better employees took up the slack of worse employees.  The good employees were very noticeable, but also tended to get quickly burnt out because of the the amount that was asked of them. This being said, I very much enjoyed the high degree of activity demanded by the job, which was to the extent that you were essentially being paid to work out.  The facility provided free coffee, and refrigerators for food brought by employees, as well as lockers and places to hang coats. Every Christmas they had gift raffles where they gave away everything from lotion baskets to widescreen HD TVs.  Also, during the Christmas rush, you could pick up hours up to and over 60hrs a week."
good,"Amazon is not for everyone. For me, it was great. I love a fast paced environment to work in. and yes, its very faced paced, but rewarding at the end of the day."
good,Amazon is a great place to work. The days go by quick and you have 3 days off in a row. Working for Amazon is not hard. it is just very high paced. Great environment.
good,"A great place of business. The weather acts up sometimes, rain or very hot.  The hardest part of the day is organizing the van, so your stuff isn't sliding and falling all over the place."
good,"It was a challenging experience. We never worked on the same line, nor with the same personal although the job mostly had women employees. Which in my case did not work because we often had to team lift, and some of the women did not like to help an old guy out. But this was not the norm because we had more small packages than big boxes. I learned how to use scanners and identify the pallets with ease. Overall it was a great experience."
good,"Amazon does a great job of hiring incredibly smart people, but not all of them are trained to be managers, it's something they are working on to develop their people for success."
good,Not a bad place to work. I really enjoyed the culture and all of the incentives that came along with it. The training was always very helpful and thorough.
good,This company isn't for everyone. It is very fast paced and requires individuals who can adapt and thrive in a continually evolving environment. As long as you have a decent manager the experience is very rewarding.
good,"No Work life balance "
good,if you like to keep busy at work I would reckamed this job I worked nights as well they also had a good canteen with great food and all veding macihens where always full
good,I learned a lot from them. I wished that I could work with them again but can't because now live in the state of Ohio. The state that I worked in with Amazon was Washington.
good,"Surrounded by the smartest people I've ever worked with, lots of opportunity to learn a new skill if desired. I was given more scope than expected and as a result grew professionally very quickly. The pace is rapid, so it is not a place to work if you arent a self-starter and always pushing forward."
good,For my 1st warehouse it was  An amazing experience. Just wish that they wouldn't change management so much.  Great company to work for many opportunities to move up with the company.
good,"I liked the job. Its fast paced and sometimes stressfull but as long as you know what you're doing and stay on task, you dont have people always nagging you."
good,Schedule gives you a work life balance and the opportunity to work from home gives me a work life balance and plenty of time to be there for children and their school activities.
good,"Busy place some difficult managers but overall was not too bad. Nice people to work with, just difficult with the long hours.  Could use some work on there way they handle HR."
good,"Amazon provides a good pay, great benefits, stability but sometimes it’s too fast paced,   too Competitive to the point you’re constantly doing overtime and spending less time with your family."
good,hard to advance but can be fun working environment depending on site. also the type of work done depends on the site you are at. peak season is much overtime
good,"Good stable/growing company. You will work hard. There are a lot of advancement and growth opportunities. I work with the maintenance department. We spend our time monitoring, repairing and servicing the equipment."
good,Amazon dpx5 was a productive and fun place. There wasn't a day I came to work and felt under appreciated. Everyone looked out for each other and it was a good team experience learning to work with others. I would recommend working for them
good,"They will push high scan rate, when you arrive they will sort you to where to work. Either scanner (scan the packages in your lane and place on the right location), sorter (up top of the chute where all the packages are sorted to whatever lane), and there is the guys that unload the packages from the trailers."
good,If you are not afraid of work and need to make money this job is right.  You can get overtime if you want.  Work is not difficult but monotonous.  Staff quite friendly.
good,If your looking to get hired quick this is the place to apply too you have a choice of what type of hours you want to work many different positions to work at Amazon
good,"I enjoyed this position, it was only seasonal though,.  However it was an experience and a great opportunity.  I would definitely do it again if the opportunity presents itself."
good,Amazon est parmi les rares entreprises où je travailler qui maîtrise très bien l'outil du management.
good,This job was very fast paced and driving could be challenging. I found the customers to be very friendly. The job changed as I worked there and the program evolved.
good,"I love the job ,I look forward to the different  tasks that's put upon me daily. I have been working here going on 8 yrs come November.I love ky job along with my co- workers and our conversation  we have doing our lunch break."
good,most enjoyable part of the job is the environment and meeting new people. fast paced environment and you have to stay on top of your rate production in the workplace
good,"Fast paced and long day work hours"
good,"You will there for ten and half hours every day. I worked Sunday through Wednesday 7:30 am to 6:00 pm. You will get 80 of person time off, 80 of unpaid time off, for the year. After a year of working you get 40 hours of vacation time as well."
good,Had a good experience in my building I worked at I worked there department called inbound at first it was easy but as I did it more it was a easy department overall great benefits and you get stock of you work there 2 years in a role through the company and not a seasonal or temp
good,"Good place to work at, always busy and there is always something to do. There is place for advancement and greater opportunities. Great place to meet new, different people."
good,It was fun working at the Amazon Bookstore. It was very busy during the holiday season. The other coworkers made it very inviting and fun during the workdays.
good,Es un buen empleo si eres una persona activa y con ganas de trabajar.
good,Use to be a fun work place but not all amazons have the same rules. Some allow you to listen to music and have your phones with you ours does not. Other Amazons get paid more than others just feel it should be the same for all.
good,"This company is 100% self motivating work environment. I'm surrounded with smart, driven individuals who collaborate, help each other, focus on data, and truly focus on the customer. I definitely learned a lot with help of the leadership team and safety committee. You definitely have to be self motivated because no one will hold your hand and tell you that you're doing a great job. If you need constant affirmations from management, this company isn't for you."
good,"Good place to work productive and fun work place a lot of drinking water , friendly environment ,good amenities , open schedule, I also like the pay system"
good,"A typical day consists of a liaising with the operations team, communicating with suppliers, managing orders, building strategies to improve the purchasing process, and creating visibility for our clients. It also includes communications with the rest of the Schlumberger Supply Chain group—sharing product information to create leverage and discussing quality and compliance issues."
good,Amazon is very fast past working the night shift. Always something to do. Work overall is very easy and anyone with right training can easily be available to do almost all positions. Teamwork with most employees is also very good. A lot willing to help out when needed.
good,"It is a very fast phase work environment, and you have to achieve goals or you're gonna get a write up. But what everybody thinks about Amazon is wrong. People say that Amazon is evil, but actually it is not. They give a really good compensation and benefits. You're gonna do fine if you show up to work everyday and make rate, and it's not that hard to get 100% rate."
good,"Fun to work at even though stressful"
good,"good people"
good,"Pros: Great Benefits, Job Culture (depending on which department you work in), engagement with FC associates."
good,"There is definite job stability here. Especially with peak season, it is very busy and a lot of opportunities for overtime. It can be tiring sometimes and it is something to get used to."
good,"I enjoyed working for Amazon. Management has great people skills an very understanding an open door policy with employees. Good work environment,its nice to work along side many motivated people from the top down."
good,"Amazon warehouse is a good place to work for high schoolers or teenagers. It’s overwhelming especially when being rushed because someone else couldn’t complete there job. Overall the vibes were awesome in the warehouse.. summertime is the worst it was so hot and itchy touching those bags we had to pack the trucks with. It’s fast paced, and energetic mostly! Every morning we were required to do morning stretches to prepare us for the workload."
good,"I liked working here it was fun and fast-paced, but it is very competitive and if you are not prepared to work with increasing expectations, you should not work here."
good,"Very fast pace. have to be willing to work hard from the time you clock in to clock out. very easy once your body gets use to it. labor is high, i recommend to give yourself 1-2 weeks before making a decision of leaving."
good,"The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the pace and also taking the burden of a slow team. On top of that our breaks arent even enough, By the time we get to the luch room , break time is already 5 minutes less, on top of that theres hundreds of us so there are lines, AND the managers come and take us out two minutes before lunch is even over ."
good,"It was labor intensive more than the 'other guys' which means a full 8-hour shift vs 4 hour (other Amazon locations do have 4 hour shifts). You sort a ton of packages. I have developed a tremendous respect for Amazon employees who ensure I get my Prime delivery."
good,"We do mostly pulling, sorting, shelving, splitting, scanning of packages for delivery. A worker may do a variety of works depending on needs and workloads on a particular day or week. Hence work assignment may vary from day to day. The works usually are fast pace and timely. Mistakes and problems have to be resolved almost immediately. Also workers have to observe company's rules and safety rules at all times while on the premise. "
good,"I enjoyed working here it is very physically challenging but I would recommend it for anyone up for a challenge. I only worked part time and it was hard on my body,"
good,working at Amazon was difficult from a driving stand point but the pay was good. SOmetimes the most challenging part of work would be scheduling a block of time.
good,It was amazing to be able to work for this company and be there for as long as I was and be able to gain some knowledge of the warehouse. It's relatively easy
good,Having the ability to work with people that's working together to complete the tasks in hand. Having a good working environment that's safe to avoid injuries.
good,When working at Amazon I have learned that they don't like to waste time they need us to get those boxes where they need to go so the customers get their boxes on time. Management needs to do better on time management and shouldn't stretch out our time for breaks. But I love the friendships I made at Amazon.
good,Ganz nach dem Motto: Wer viel macht hat viele Chancen. Sehr entspannte Arbeitsatmosphäre wenn auch penibel überwacht. Jede Minute wird kontrolliert und jedes Feedback ausgewertet. Kann schon mal nerven.
good,"The work is not too difficult, slow at times, but the people and supervisors are really easy to work with. it's a clean environment, the benefits seem fair, although I was not receiving them."
good,"Amazon is a great place to work.  There were many opportunities for advancements. Whenever there is an issue, administration was always accessible and attentive to my needs."
good,a good place to work good training good facilities good equipment to work with long training for fork trucks. wages could be higher and rise quicker but in general a good place .
good,It's a job that either you can succeed at. There is growth. Also you can fail at. Amazon is not for everyone but they can hire everyone. The people make the company. The standards make the stress.
good,"If you are dedicated to growing your career, and not a family life, this is a great company to work for. Shift moves are mandatory and you have little say in where you work/what you work on. If you are able to stay flexible in this environment, there is plenty of room to grow."
good,"Amazon fulfillment centers are hard work, but they do have great benefits and pay. IF you are there to work short term, its a good place to stack up some cash."
good,"The management can be very understanding, There is no need to get a gym membership due to the fact that  the job can be very physically demanding. They cross train you for several departments."
good,I was a call center representative at amazon and my experience was overall good. Training was good and my manager was okay. we got discounts and a pay increase for great services. I left the job because it didn't fit in my school schedule at the time
good,"Your manager really makes a big difference on whether or not you get trained and promoted, or stuck doing manual back breaking work for a decent wage for what it is. Benefits are good and first day."
good,Good for not taking stress home from the job with you. Tough if you're not good with typing or computers. Fun holidays and the trainer is excellent. Can be tough dealing with the same customer calls every day.
good,Labor work for fulfillment center! Everything you can expect from a shipping warehouse. They don't really care about their employees but you get good pay and benefits.
good,"After your first week of work, you are not allowed to make electronic errors (which can sometimes happen without knowing) or you will be put on probation and then fired. They are very strict with their employees, which i find as a good thing, and they teach you good work ethic."
good,"When I first started working at Amazon, it was so much fun. I loved going to work and seeing my co-workers. However, after we got new managers the culture changed and everyone started to leave."
good,Fun and best place to work. Lot of career opportunities in Amazon with good benefits. Shift and timings are good. Work place and environment is very good.
good,"Like to achieve experience here and such a good balance in life."
good,mon rôle de pick étais agréable j'ai bien aimé cette première expérience de travaille
good,"Work culture is good"
good,Be prepared to be on your feet for a pretty long time. Also do not be scared to be creative during your shift. It can be boring at times. The management is helpful at times.
good,"A typical day would start off with a group meeting to see expectations and work load for the day. After the meeting you would go straight to work, get a cart and a scanner, find the item you are looking for in the corresponding aisle as what your scanner is telling you, then load full tote onto the conveyor. other responsibilities would include, restocking totes in the asiles, packaging materials to get ready for shipment and loading trucks up with product."
good,"Working at Amazon is a great place to get your foot in the door to advance your career.  Its no easy task.  Learning how to manage and cooperate with day to day operations is a HUGE learning curve.  Once you get around your learning curve, everything falls into place."
good,Good place to work with fun and motivated people. Quick paced but managers will stop what they're doing and help you before the shipping window closes. They tend to have fun activities each month.
good,"The pace is sometimes a bit much, but if you're the sort of person who likes to stay busy, it's not too difficult on a normal day. Managers come and go, but good ones make the job fun and easy. I suppose that's everywhere, though. "
good,"If you like to work in a place that constantly changes everything than this is the place for you. In the beginning, I had productive work to do every hour of every day. After these changes started occurring, I had much less work to do. I was walking around the warehouse finding stuff to do when there wasn't. My coworkers and I pretended to sweep (when there wasn't anything to sweep) just so the managers wouldn't think we were slacking off. After working there for six months, I left to search for a job that will provide me constant work. I recommend Amazon for anyone finding a first job or something slow-moving."
good,A typical work day included picking items using a RF Scanner. Meet rate and accuracy. Time management is essential. Long hours and mandatory overtime.
good,"I had a pretty good experience working at Amazon. It was fast paced, had to be motivated all the time. The management was very helpful and the hardest part includes a typical sales day with back to back calls. Great job to make some extra money but not for someone looking to build up their career."
good,"Amazon is great! If you are a quiet person who doesn't mind doing repetitive work then it is a good job. Great for young people to start out in life, but to be there for a long time, you will get burnt out. Because they are building more facilities there has been less work but you are guaranteed your hours."
good,"a lots of young people, remained me of being in high school.  The atmosphere is very competitive.  At times felt like they placed you against each other almost in a unhealthy mental behavior to out perform each other"
good,Overall I like working at Amazon. Management is usually pretty good with helping you out with time card issues. They make sure they stress the safety tips. They are pretty good for recognizing your good work. There are some areas that need improving. I feel like they should communicate with the employees better. Sometimes management isn’t on the same page.  They took away our last break. Which is causing some issues with people.
good,"Love my job and the people, just wish I could get compensated and rewarded for all the work I do. Instead, even as an ambassador I'm making the same as everyone and I don't believe that to be fair."
good,"I liked it, it wasn’t really a stressful job, there was a lot of work in the beginning of every shift but it makes time fly when you’re working hard and fast to send the packages out to where they need to be."
good,"very strict on numbers. numbers are everything there, productivity numbers, time off task numbers, long break numbers, how many items/how much you need to do numbers. etc etc"
good,"A typical day is spent on your feet for the better part of your 10 hour shift."
good,"Amazon was a very physically demanding workplace. It was extremely fast paced and stressful at times but it was also sometimes fun and had a very diverse atmosphere. There is an excessive amount of hours and mandatory overtime. They offer a fair wage and provide generous benefits. They also have constant rewards, competitions and offer plenty of incentives."
good,I enjoyed working in the warehouse.  I was not able to pack at the desired rate.  Received ecouragement from mysupervisor.  Company policy stressed that I was to be discharged.
good,I worked as a part time employee at Amazon. The work was fast paced and you had to be a quick learner. The training was more so hands on no one really spends a lot of time with new employees. You're basically told once or twice how to perform a duty and then you're on your own. I been at 2 different facilities and what i noticed is that most of the management were young anywhere between 19 years old to about 35 years old. What i liked most about the job was how fast paced it was it was always opportunities to learn how to do different job duties. Another great thing about Amazon was you were always giving the opportunity to advanced to the next level. I would recommend anyone to work for Amazon if they're looking for a job either for temporary work or full time employment.
good,I enjoyed working there I had an amazing time met a lot of good people and loved my pay rate there they are active with their employees and do events for them
good,"Amazon, ottima esperienza, la rifarei ancora. Colleghi disponibili, pronti ad aiutarti."
good,Overall a good job.  It just depends upon what time of year that you start.  Only negatives is that there is constant change of rotating management and there are certain individuals that will try to set you up for failure in order for them to gain position in the company.
good,"Good when hours were there,"
good,There is no chance to continue working for the company because of the poor organization of the hr. department. Mostly the communication between hr and employees are a lack of phone use. There is no chance for one on one consultation with hr. in the building because of the over use of security. There is a web site that is not useful to just to further more trouble that help.
good,"An easy ""go to job"" if you need money in a hurry. Easy to get in as a temp, harder to get to stay even if you work your socks off. Best to take a view on it as strictly a temp contract or maybe get converted if you're lucky. Pick if you like walking, pack or stow if you don't. Shipping is good as is VNA. Whistle while you work, background music now year round."
good,Good company fast paced with pretty good benefits. You  can learn a lot about warehouse work and the different processes involving logistics and merchandise.
good,The process is completed described. You must follow the script. Nice climate. Very technological company and easy to solve any kind of problem. Leadership is so busy.
good,"It is a safe and fast pace environment, in which you can grow in the company.  You are able to reach standards and sale records has a team.  The hours and pay enable you to provide for yourself and your family."
good,"At Amazon, they have their peculiar way of doing things. Take career advancement as an example, I have no idea how you get promoted, even after I asked a member of the leadership team about this, I still do not understand it. It seems to me hard work is a very small, or maybe, insignificant part of being promoted at Amazon. {I may be wrong, this is just my personal opinion}"
good,Good for money and easy work how ever dose not leave a lot of time for a soical life. Managers are helpfull and recritment Componys always easy to see
good,"Amazon is so large that there really never is a personal approach for employer to employee relations. Overall a good place to work, decent pay (now) and good people all around you."
good,"If you have a lot of bills you will likely search to have another job because you don't have 30hrs guaranteed. "
good,"Amazon is a good place to get your feet wet. Doesn't require extreme intelligence and it allows you to go to different departments easily. It is manual labor intensive, at times. They also tend to be sticklers about how you conduct yourself."
good,Great place to work. The environment and atmosphere is casual and comfortable while work flow is organized and efficient. Everyone works together and is very friendly with one another.
good,je travaillais a temps avec des horaires d'équipes.
good,I had a blast at Amazon. The people were great the work was good. They actually cared and went out of their way for the employees. I always felt welcome.
good,"I was really excited to work for Amazon. "
good,"good incentives and policies that help regulate work output"
good,Very long days and you must move at a fast pace at all times. You get good pay and you get multiple breaks. You also get paid vacation. You're team members
good,"Work was relatively easy and expectations were not very high due to the opening of a new location. This was poor on the behalf of Amazon and the management at the time. My manager was excellent, but the rest of the management team was not consistent. I learned that taking on new responsibilities gives you more opportunity. Most of the coworkers were great. I would appreciate it if advancement into management was more smooth and didn't take so long. The hardest part of the job was watching others around me not work as hard and get away with it. The most enjoyable part of the job was recognition for hard work and great memories with my team."
good,"Amazon pays a good amount, and raises are pretty regular, but the work is pretty rough. long days and repetitive tasks. The building I was at was in charge of sorting products from distribution companies into totes to be taken to the warehouses. This is what would be done for ten hours a day."
good,Numbers matter! Be mindful of how many units you are required to do on daily shift. Be aware of your Unpaid Time hours that are given to you for emergencies only. You should not go below 9 hours.
good,"It's hard on your body. Great benefits and pay, but because of the type of work you will use your benefits, it's a very hard and fast passed work environment, not made for everyone. I did like it while I was there."
good,"Amazon used to be a lot of fun. Years ago you could come in, stow or pick and leave and it was simple and fun with good people. Today the company has made stowing and picking so difficult and punishes the associate for any little thing even if it has no negative effect on anything. The people are still great but the company has become impossible to work for unfortunately."
good,"At amazon you have to work at a steady pace and keep pushing to reach their goal of scanning items which if you start off with a plan you can def achieve the goal. Amazon is encouraging right at the start of the shift. They feed their employees too!!! The hardest part sometimes is pallet making, they are helpful with showing you the proper way to create a good pallet and once you can do that...success is yours!!"
good,"Amazon is a great place to go and start a early career and job opportunity, work is a little hard but u are always busy. The break are good 2 15min and 1 30min."
good,"Its not a bad place to work, very fast paced and there are plenty of opportunities for overtime. The team is very friendly and willing to help in all aspects of the job."
good,"Interesting to see the many things that people order though Amazon that I think they could have just went to a store and picked up without all the hassle, but it's the new way of life"
good,I was very surprised my seasonal work tenure ended. I was told that I had an excellent worker and that I met the requirements to be converted to full time. but I did not receive a conversion e-mail nor letter.
good,"This is their first try at delivering their own packages so the systems were day to day changing. It did not seem as if upper management was training and directing the floor managers so even though they tried very hard, you could tell' they were chasing their tails' often. They will get better tho....."
good,I enjoyed working at a sorting center. it paid well and time flew by if you kept busy. managers would constantly check in on the groups to make sure everything is going smoothly. it was easy to report problems if there were any. only left after my transportation blew up and it was too far from home.
good,"Things change very fast and you need adapt to change quite well."
good,I actually really enjoyed it there during peak season. Wish I could’ve stayed on as a permanent employee. A lot of cool people and a lot of eye candy lol. It’s a great way to meet new people and get in shape while making money.
good,"Fast-paced workplace. Too many managers,.always asking  VTO after rushing you to work fast. Always send to different departments. I don't want to recommend to anyone."
good,"An easy job, hard physical work but enjoyable. Workplace culture is relaxed. Easy to converse while working. Occasional hard work days but not often. Would recommend."
good,"Now while it is a decent job and the pay isn't terrible, It is really easy to get let go. I would say don't rush, take your time and see a problem solver if you think you messed up somewhere."
good,"Ho trovato un buon ambiente lavorativo,giovanile e stimolante"
good,"Nice place to work with friendly staff and management."
good,better than some jobs but not my cup of tea. Must meet time quota's for speed. Great benefits though. Many possible jobs though in fulfillment centers. Mine is a robotic center and new.
good,"Working at amazon is socially incredible. The environment is diverse and people from across the world are working with amazon. The Culture is definitely diverse with the mind of the whole world in one place. There is also a bunch of things to learn from different people."
good,At Amazon you will meet a lot of people from different cultures. There are some things that could still be worked out when it comes to the organization of the warehouse/station but overall it is a fun place to work.
good,"Training from Management was minimal, restricted to one hour of safety training.  Everything else was ""learn as you go"", ""on the job"", observing others and learning from co-workers."
good,"Amazon is a quickly-expanding company with no signs of stopping. Unfortunately the speed of the expansion is reflected in the work environment. Because the company is experiencing such rapid growth, there is little opportunity to grasp much less master the new information that is broadcasted almost daily. this coupled with the breakneck pace of workflow and a revolving door of upper management makes Amazon a very difficult but potentially rewarding place to work."
good,Working at Amazon was a lot of fun & hard work. By this I mean you constantly have to be on the go for your picks as you are timed for every pick. If you are a hard working person and love challenges then Amazon is for you. It was fun when you challenge your work colleagues to beat each other on picks and being able to pick fast and effectively. Work breaks are timed as usual as you have a certain amount of time to clock out before your break and clock back in when coming off your breaks so by that said you could be on a pick which can take you far into the warehouse for the pick and when break time comes you have to walk to canteen into your own time and get back to work before the time is over as it is controlled by finger print scanners from then you clock out and back in from breaks hence why you have to leave early to go back to work to avoid being held up in ques. Management is very good and supportive as well as professional at all times. Hardest part of the job would be keeping up with the picks at all times as you are timed between every pick and locating every pick can be difficult at times as you have to match part numbers plus location to make sure you have located the right product. The most enjoyable is that it is a challenge and on the go all the time and meeting seeing different people everywhere you go on your picks.
good,"The best part of the job is the people you meet and i was very disappointed when peak season was over. The job is very physically demanding but i loved it. I've heard plenty of bad things before but i never experienced anything like that while i was there. The rates expected of you are high but i liked the challenge. The managers were all very nice and helpful to me. HR does lead you to believe that maybe you'll get hired on as a permanent employee after the season is over, but i truly believe they never had any intention of doing so. As soon as peak is over, they let all of the seasonal people go. Even so, i really liked it there and hope to go back."
good,"i work overnight, work isn't too difficult but its nothing more than a side job for some extra cash. the workload can get a little stressful during the holiday hours though."
good,"Manage a lot of 3rd party contractors."
good,"Amazon is a great place to feel like you're making an impact. However, the culture is not conducive to work-life balance. Further, most people are chiefly concerned with upward mobility instead of pushing the mission forward."
good,"Very fast-paced at times. Can be very physically demanding. Have to be able to load trucks by yourself, lift pallets, lift boxes 50+ pounds. Little to no communication between employees and management."
good,I work at a delivery station so it is pretty easy and you know what to expect. You meet before your shift to go over how the night will go and sort packages into routes to go out. The only negatives is that there isn't much opportunity to go full time if you are hired in part time and sometimes there isn't much management around so people can get away with changing up things or not doing a lot. Overall if I could go full time I would because for a job to offer $15 starting out is hard to get around here.
good,"If you are looking for a job for extra cash then Amazon is a great place to work. A typical day last about 4  hours. You learn to find enjoyment in the job you preform. No management is perfect, but overall Amazon has some great managers/leaders."
good,Amazon is a great place to work for those that want to get ahead.  You learn a rigor around how to deliver results and make decisions that are driven by data.
good,"A typical day at Amazon FC are structured by time segments. You have specific times for meetings, breaks, lunch and time-on-task expectations. I learned more effective and efficient ways to handle stock."
good,This is a good place to work as far as money and benefits that they offer. but the management in some department do not have enough knowledge to run the department.
good,Just wish that you received raises yearly. Other then that it wasnt to bad. Alot of packages but nothing you couldn't handle providing you received help.
good,Foi ótimo porém é necessário um gerente com experiência e visão para melhorar a empresa.
good,"pushed myself due to the competitive nature of the job and loved it, would work there again if the opportunity came as it taught me new things and how to stay on top of my work."
good,"Days go by quick because of the fast paced work. Very competitive workplace, which can be good or bad. Many of the workers are young with little or no past work experience so they lack a refined work ethic."
good,"Great experience. They are truly customer service driven! They also make it there business to here from their employees. They set up a system for advancement; however, it is up to the employee to succeed"
good,"Amazon has a very dynamic work culture. Every day is Day 1 in Amazon. You learn, you challenge yourself, take up new and adhoc tasks, collaborate and succeed. Amazon encourages experiments and risks. You can explore your potential to the fullest in Amazon."
good,"great people to work with, very quick paced job. they give you enough opportunities for over time and very understanding about certain situations. great work experience"
good,"It can get very stressful when there is so much workload, but if you keep a cool head, you'll be fine. Managers can be hard to find sometimes when you need it but they have other associates there to help you."
good,"Amazon is nice company for everyone to work and the payment is good."
good,"You learn teamwork "
good,"Lack of internal growth, excessive working hours, lack of salary growth. Though, Early Money Earning Opportunity for freshers. Lack of educational learning. No growth at the lower level of employment."
good,"This is my first warehouse job and it is hard work but the management make it fun. My typical day at work is 4 hours long. We have a quick meeting at the beginning of every shift and we do stretches, talk about the day. We scan packages to pallets so they can be delivered. Some boxes can be heavy but everyone works together and helps each other."
good,"Les managers sont supers. "
good,"Amazon is a great place to work, it drives an awesome work culture and it is same across all Amazon Site globally. It always feels day one in Amazon.."
good,"A typical work day in amazon fresh is fun , fast paced item picking in the cold , the freezer , and also an ambient picking location."
good,"Being a driver is better than working in the warehouse. There are days when there are too many parcels to deliver.Very long hours as well. When on the road you are your own boss, makes you feel free. In the warehouse the targets are very high and hard to reach, being challenged by the management constantly."
good,"The people working there were amazing. i love their sweet hearts, but there needs to be more PTO and UPT. As for Vacation, i started around peek so i didn't get to enjoy any of it seeing as it was gone before i could even use it."
good,I work at a Whole Foods location and its is fast paced at times but rewarding when you get all of the orders out on time; which is almost all of the time. I help and coach other shoppers to do their best and find their items with precision and efficiency.
good,Some RF Scanners have issues with connecting to serve therefore if your employees are receiving quality written ups due to the fact of miss picks or miss stows. Please take a serious look into what employees are speaking about so that these barriers are being resolved.
good,Amazon ist eine gute Firma man lernt schnell und gewöhnt sich schnell dran
good,"I loved working on the fashion team. The managers put in charge were very young, inexperienced and not very understanding for work/life/family balance. People were fired for sharing their honest opinions with management after being asked to share it."
good,"Enjoyed the mandatory warm up & stretch meet ups in the morning and after lunch. Getting to be beside different co workers everyday was nice. The hardest part of the job was the extreme fast pace you have to go and being on your feet 10 hours a days, but it goes quickly. The Amazon culture is all around the best."
good,The operations team was very welcoming. The job does require being able to think outside of the box at times but if you do your work I think you can fit in very quickly.
good,I'm currently working as a fresh warehouse associate in Everett but so far I do like working here. I'm always moving around doing different kinds of tasks like working in ambient or in chilled to bag products or to send donations in totes. The pay is really nice too though I do hope in the future that they can provide me a full time position.
good,"Stand Up/ Stretch"
good,"Greet guests, catering assistance, package delivery assistance, data entry, correspondence prep, trouble ticket submission/approval, order office supplies"
good,I have enjoyed  the work it is from third party  i just left it is good  to be working  in amazon if it is an onroll job and we have growth but still good  company
good,"It is a good place to work just that there is too much strictness there"
good,"A typical day at work would be taking calls and assisting customers, long hours and busy co workers. It teaches patience, endurance and good customer service skills such as communication and empathy. Company culture is very vibrant and energetic, we work hard, play hard and have fun."
good,"Fun place to work, if you can handle being in head all day."
good,"is an easy fun job, cons are short breaks and lunch and attendance policy. May not have paid well when i worked but now its 15 hr which is sufficient, Great place to get your foot in the door and grow within the company"
good,Competitive pay and benefits but but extremely boring repetetive work. I would recommend if you can handle literally doing the same task over and over. Also it's very physical work.
good,Didn't really like 10 hr shifts. When there is nothing to do we take VTO which makes our check short because it's boring standing there for 10 hrs doing nothing.
good,Super entreprise agréable d'y travailler par contre les salaires ne suivent pas forcement
good,"A phenomenal place to work if you want to grow and have ownership over innovation and delivering impactful solutions for customers. Highly focused on customer experience means less red-tape. Though it varies a lot from one team to the next, there is a strong results-driven culture that encourages even the junior software engineers to take on ambitious projects."
good,"Amazon is a caring working environment, but it is very quick paced. Managers are good but some of them can pick on you for dumb errors caused by other co-workers. ""15 minute break"" is cruel."
good,i loved it  just like any other  job you just need a break. i didnt like that waslk time was included in your break. Time off task is a biggie and will still effect you if machines go down or work load is low.
good,"With every shipment that comes in you are met with a couple challenges, for instance you have to know what area the package is going to, keep the conveyance moving at all times. All while making sure that bar-codes stay facing upright as the packages move along. This is also while training 2-5 new associates in this particular job function."
good,"Sometimes free lunch.."
good,"sorta out mail packages"
good,"If you enjoy a fast paced team environment, then this is a great job.  I believe it is important that employees are physically healthy. There is a lot of physical stress with the job, especially as a picker; but it is great exercise.  The management is pretty upbeat and they are pro team environment."
good,"Certes comme dans toutes usines le rendement est une règle si cela dérange change de métier de suite, Leader à l'écoute, instructor toujours présent, parfois un peu trop mais d'une grande aide, après sa reste l'usine avec ces qualités et défaut, ne pas oublier que c'est pas Amazon qui vient à toi, mais toi qui va à eux, donc faut savoir assumer ses choix, au lieu de dire c'est nul c'est de la faute à un tel etc.....sinon Mcdo recrute aussi. ......😉. Au moins quand les robots nous aurons remplacé là vous comprendrez ce que vous avez perdu, vous allez au travail, certes, peut-être amélioré sans nul doute, mais vous allez pas en thalassothérapie tout frais payer non plus. Merci Amazon Boves"
good,"Very fast paced environment. It is very physical demanding. You are on your feet moving around all day. You have to be in great shape to work there."
good,"Our facility is essentially for unloading packages from the semis and sorting them into delivery bags. Fortunately we aren't touching any products, just boxes and envelopes. "
good,The company is stimulating to work at and gives you many chances to advance. The work hours often are a lot so for salary employees you may not make as much per hour based on job responsibilities and duties.
good,"The time of my employment at Amazon proved that Amazon's Warehouse had been a rather interesting place to work with the conditions, the Drivers to the Lane Assignments and the Packages changing daily."
good,"The job was rough on your body since it requires a lot of lifting and pulling. However, the work itself required no real skill and it was only 5 hours a day part time."
good,This is not really designed for the person looking to live on this job. It is great for extra cash as you can work as few or many shift as you can grab when they become available.
good,"I like working with thousands of people. Most are very hard workers."
good,"Great atosphere with really fun people to work with, Met so many characters there and talked with some really cool customers, They are a really relaxed company and im sad i dont work for them anymore"
good,Mostly enjoyed the hours broken down in a 4 day span. Work was simple and productivity was optimal. Workspace is big and focus on work was pretty easy.
good,"Amazon was a reliable job with good people but the hours were stressful and prone to be given mandatory overtime during busy areas. Your working hours can be shifted as needed with little warning and HR policies are rather strict. There is very little if any time between customer interactions (hardly enough to finish after-call work) which can be stressful but does make the day go by faster. The company does make up for some of the stress with lots of events and optional activities, good break room facilities and amenities."
good,"Enjoyed the job. Paid training, walked 12+ miles per day, took a month to physically get used to the pace, focused work, great time to think and de-stress, bonuses. Sent home on occasion based on production but still worked 40 hours a week."
good,"Pretty good! the up to date technology is par, and the leaniantcy of the managment is ok. the breaks should be longer since the commute to the break room is such a far commute in such little time, but its alright!"
good,"If you're single, th savvy and are good with people, then Amazon is a great place. The culture is subjective though and if you don't fit in you won't make it."
good,A good place to work if you like being on your feet and being busy. Paid every week was nice. Managers very nice to work with. You need to ask if you can be trained in other positions that you were not hired for.
good,"Not a place for the workshy, if you like to be busy then its the place for you, lots of different roles to work at, from walking all day while picking products to driving a forklift..."
good,"It is hard work at the warehouse , but there is always shifts available. They offer 4 hours shifts ,but you have to pick them quick because the fill up fast ."
good,"The work is not bad. I enjoy working here get to meet new and different people. They offer different positions to move around in. It is fast pace, sometimes fun, great learning experience."
good,"For a part-time job it was really good! I got paid $14 and received benefits! Super relaxed, I was able to work in sweats! You have the option of 3 shifts: morning, day , and night. You might not get the shift you want, but you can change it later on."
good,"Every day is day 1, you learn something everyday"
good,Good work experience with tension free work culture. Nice place to learn newer things to develop skills. Hard to get to higher level which requires to spend more time and effort.
good,"Amazon has great benefits and perks. The pay is not as great as it should be. However, it is a good start for some. You are able to move up quickly and they hire within."
good,"Don't believe the news completely, it's not as bad as they make it out to be. You can get your steady 40 with little fuss. The benefits are a lot better than most other places in my area."
good,Working at Amazon is a very physically demanding job having to walk all over to get the items needed for your order you are filling. Packing a box properly so nothing is damaged.
good,"affidabile, preciso, che dire ci tornerei volentieri"
good,"great place to work,great peoples ,follows all safety rules "
good,Great experiences were provided throughout my time. There are all stars and low performers but if you look for growth you will find people to assist you in your goals!
good,Training was thorough.  Both my trainer and supervisor were down to earth. Strict policies but great support at your fingertips.  Pay and benefits are fair.  Opportunities for advancement based on performance metrics.
good,when i was working here is was hard to keep up with other rates i would be stressed at some points. it was a fun job to have if you are coming straight at out high school and needing a quick job.
good,"J'ai passé 1mois et demi super chez Amazon Saran, où j ai eu l 'opportunité non saisi ( pour cause de déménagement sur l' île de France) d évoluer sur d autre poste que le picking. Les managers et leaders de ce site sont de vraies perles"
good,"If the employees were paid a more competitive wadge and allowd to work without so much micro management.I can see production & quality improve. "
good,"Almost constant packages coming in to sort. No time to talk to people, which I liked. Storage place for food and clothes. Fooseball table and tv in the break room."
good,After getting a job at Amazon the options provided are threshold based meaning you must be exceptional at the job they give you in order to change positions. This posed as a problem for me as I had difficulty meeting their high standards and resulted in me having to look for employment elsewhere. Otherwise it was a very beneficial working experience that pays very well.
good,This is a new position. I am just getting acclimated to the position and the job duties. I do not have any negative or comments otherwise at this time.
good,"En general muy contento con el trato de los empleados y de los responsables, el problema viene al tratar con la gente de mas arriba. Poca empatía. Pero todo lo demás bastante positivo"
good,Management is good but work load creates imbalance in your life. Company will pay well and give you all facility which will beneficial for company point of view.
good,Amazon has wonderful benefits and an overall good place to work. No other company offers such great benefits on day one of your service with them. I would recommend this company to anyone.
good,Was a picker for Amazon worked about 13 hours a day 6 days a week. Would fall asleep the second I got home and get right back up to rush 14 miles back to work. Only worth it because frequent pay raises and the financial stability it gave me.
good,I work for JLL and not directly for Amazon but man Amazon does not play games. They strictly follow the safety guidelines and one mistake or careless action can definitely get you terminated. Btw JLL management currently sucks.
good,"Logging into the VPN to clock in on time was a hassle "
good,They are very understanding and flexible when needing days off.  Holiday pay is great.  If you are not willing to work hard then this job is not for you.  It is a commitment
good,"I was humbled everyday i went to work by they quality of people i worked with and the intensity of work they did. I thought i had a handle on a problem and with just a few questions, all my work / thoughts went out the window. "
good,Everyone is respectable in the company. I learn manner of communication and how to manage work burden.all are equally respected their. The hardest part of job is to give more work and different work for which we are not selected.
good,Fast paced but I didn't like the way the absorders train and tell you one thing about rate and then manager tells you rate is another way. They want you to learn fast like in two weeks. Then it's rate time and you have get it up or you get 1st write up you can ask to get retrained before you get a second one then final and your gone.
good,My perspective on Amazon is that many older people work there for the work out and isolated work style. Many people stress over the fact that they weren't payed enough and such but I believe that its just not for everyone.
good,"It is  good job that does not pay too low, but can compensate more than they offer. I recommend it to anyone that need the money, but not for long term."
good,Alla .mia età non è facile trovare lavoro e loro mi hanno dato questa opportunità. Cerco di dare il massimo x averlo.
good,"Amazon is a great company to work for.  Especially if you want to work for a company that offers career advancement.  Just be careful, the management culture can be quite rough."
good,Un buon ambiente ma con poca comunicazione tra i vari gradi dei lavoratori
good,trés bonne équipe des personnes qui sont là pou l'aide et le bon avancement du projet
good,The normal day of work was a fast paced situation that was easy to get a handle on within the  first day. Overall it was a pleasant environment and the supervisors were helpful when it came to learning duties and on how to improve.
good,"I started at the part-time sortation center before I transfer over to the full-time fulfillment center. I made some great friends but I don't miss the work itself. I did like the 4 day a week schedule but not the 10 hour shifts. And peak time is the worst. Sure you get some incentives to hit rate but it doesn't way out the pain of standing for 12 hours a day or night. And of course your paycheck looks great after 2 weeks of killing yourself to hit rate. I know there is give and take with any job. And I do miss some of my managers that I had the pleasure of working with. And what can I say about the benefits I will miss them the most. Because they were great. Health, Dental, Vision, Life Insurance. 401(K) & Roth (IRA) and 2 shares of stock in my name after I've been there for 2 years as long as I didn't take any time off. And my employee discount. Who can argue with these benefits but I guess they have to be awesome for what they put as through on a day to day basis."
good,They need more opportunities for people who work hard day in An day out have to understand also that people do have lives outside of the job am not just Amazon but all an all it was a okay job thankyou you guys for the opportunity to work there
good,Although the work can be demanding. With a bit of hard work and dedication there is plenty of opportunity for you to have a career with one of the biggest companies in the world which continues to grow and expand in many different departments some examples are technology and logistics as well as Health and Safety and other areas.
good,"Stowing at a fast rate. The rate changed daily, based on the items and the number of people on staff that day. Stowing was the task assignment. I looked forward to labor share days because it would give opportunity to work in a different position.. I would have preferred to be in outbound versus inbound. There was always something to do. The money was worth the work"
good,"My English grammar and vocabulary improved, also my communication skills improved as well."
good,"If you dont like to stand up or physically work hard, then amazon is not the place of work for you. It can get a bit overwhelming at times but Otherwise, its a challenging/fun experience."
good,The Job/Work Life Balance is non exiscentant if you want to advance at Amazon.  This is something that your family needs to be aware of in the beginning.  They will work you 60 hours a week during peak season and you must choose to use your time off wisely in order to schedule time off to keep yourself health because it is really hard work.
good,overall its a nice environment where they shove free food down your throats. The managers and co workers alike are all very nice and very understanding to any personal needs you may have
good,Get to walk 25 mikes a day. Theres no way you cant lose weight working for Amazon. Amazon ewuaks Amaxing Body!.. Give it two weeks and your body will be conditioned.
good,"Es un bonito lugar y dependiendo de la campaña que elijas es el buen sabor de boca que te llevas, lo recomiendo."
good,Fast paced job where good money can be made and plenty of pretty faces to look at when your work is done. This is the only job that I wish I still had.
good,"Because of the safety policy, there is no music allowed on site, and there is a lot of walking for the hours, but the hours are good. There is a chance for progress and the benefits are good."
good,It is a simple job. The workers are all very easy going and easy to work with. The skills are easy to pick up on and it is a fast past to slow past job
good,"Amazon is amazing company to work at. "
good,I like the fast pace and experience. I like working with people that works consistantly.  The environment was very cool and business like The sorting and shipping of packages was a nice experience
good,"Amazon, the company is a great place for a regular employee, but as an apprentice, your options are limited. The technology is cutting edge, but as an apprentice, you will have to wait an unreasonable amount of time to convert to a regular employee, even if you are competent in your job."
good,"The day at work is typically a ten hour shift for four days. I learned various tasks of the warehouse. The job tasks assigned was not hard. However, the management consisted of immature team leaders that needed to have some customer service skills. They needed some additional tools on how to communicate to older peers and diverse cultures. The most enjoyable part of the job was the bonuses and incentives received when the department you were assigned to met their goals."
good,"It was an enjoyable and fun workplace. There is a lot of turnover due to young adults working there before , during,  and after college.  It is also a get along to get along kind of workplace which does reflect in the advancement opportunities."
good,"Its very fast paced, a lot of people around you, some areas are extremely crowded, but you can sit when stocking bottom bins and some pilots aren't hard to clear off. You get 30 minute break and 2 15 minute breaks. Variety of shifts that can be worked so you can pick which shift you want."
good,Being an Amazon associate is a very physical job with high expectations but they do train you.  I loved the job at first and excelled at everything I did but if you are not the Amazon 'type' then there is no way to advance.
good,"A typical day at Amazon varies on the work load that is available. It is either really busy or really slow depending on the amount of orders customers put in, especially around the holidays."
good,Apply! Much better than most warehouses not to hot in the summer really does care about employees has on site nurse and a information desk for daily questions
good,A good job to get on your feet. Offer great benefits and semi decent pay. Regular hours as well are a plus. If you’re a single mother or just a student it provides some security at the entry level.
good,The department I worked for allowed me the opportunity to meet some amazon people. Yo have to make rate which at times made it stressful when no freight was available.
good,"Amazon was an ok working experience, i just feel they ask for a bit too much out of there workers. That job just wasn't for me First they told me i was only going to be working 4 days 10 hour shifts then they would tell you they have mandatory over time for the next 2 days so ill end up working 6 days a week."
good,"I think it should be 3/8 hr shifts,and get paid every week instead every 2 weeks,should have an employee of the month  other then that it's a good place to work at."
good,Competitive work that is monitored by computer scores and grades. Challenging and sometimes fun. They ask a lot from their employees but are willing to pay a higher amount for it.
good,"Nice job, with good salary but full of night shifts. Management is worst and promotions are currently banned, I will suggest to go for that process if you do not get a job at least then only"
good,"Fast paced. must make at least 10 deliveries within an hour. Sounds easy until you approach a customers house that is 1) not home, 2) lives in an apt. bldg., 3) have their dogs out roaming about. Good thing is you pretty must get the same route each day, get to know your customers some what, and break for lunch when you want. no micro manage...…."
good,"Great place to work if you are a go getter, no place for lazy people. You get lots of time to take off if you choose to,, Healthcare on day one. Stock is great"
good,"Fun place to work, but they need to rethink their hirering process. There is good workers out there but Amazon won't hire them because their background may not be the tape their looking for."
good,"Its a nice place,nice people,had some fun times there,you get three days off,wouldn’t mind going back again at some point down the line,needs more fans tho"
good,"It's an amazing job experience and good team,managers and process assistants. The job is quite challenging but could be fun too. Allows the pursuit of other aspects of one's life."
good,Amazon is a great company but the expected pace can be brutal. It is not for those who can't give 110% every shift.They will support the associates as best they can but you will definitely earn your check.
good,"Honestly its just somewhere to go when you need a good amount of money in a quick amount of time. Breaks are super short, the job can be easy but repetitive so it gets boring after a while. But you get good money and good benefits."
good,A strong working Area and responsible for picking . Learned  the process of picking fest and the different processes of safety at work and the management
good,"good experience with a big view of  the real managing , it's a big company so too many employees and many works to do but still very structured and it's nice to work there. I learn too many things"
good,"Amazon expects employees to stay on task. Typically functions are rated and we are expected to keep up with our hourly rate. The culture is very forward thinking. We're encourage to work hard, have fun, and make history. From Amazon I learned how to work. I'd never had a job before so this experience really helped me. The hardest part of the job can be the hours. Sometimes during the holidays we work 60 hour weeks and it can be very physically demanding. The most enjoyable part of the job is all the great benefits. Full health, 401k, school accommodations, paid time off, and many more."
good,"low pay "
good,"The starting pay should be raised; as well as, the bi-annual raises.The way VCP is paid out should be changed. Also, there should be more health insurance companies to choose from. The Career Choice sounded like it was a great idea. There should be more communication between Stow and Pick management to ensure safe and quality work."
good,"As with most jobs, it was fast paced and you were expected to meet a quota. regardless of position there is a challenge. if I could go back, I would. I enjoyed it"
good,Be prepared to work long grueling hours. The benefits make up for this but not completely. Be prepared to have every bone in your body be sore and aching for at least the first 2 months.
good,It was fun to learn about how the company actually works. I learned how to operate heavy machinery. It was interesting moving to one area of the warehouse to another to work in a different section.
good,"If you are lucky you can find yourself under the wing of a manager that will push you forward in your career and challenge you. Sadly this also leads to some favoritism, and not every PA will get this opportunity. It's a high paced job with a lot of moving parts, that requires being able to step back and visually see what needs to get done, and what will kill you in the long-run. Every-day is different and its all about setting yourself up to succeed by the numbers. I personally loved the job, not so much the pay. Benefits are good, and competitive but the wage increase in non-existent. 2-3 years without any raise,  and really this position should only be viewed as a stepping stone, not a landing zone. You do not want to be stuck as a PA for a career in my opinion. There are opportunities to get an education through amazon and if you don't have one I'd jump on that ship as fast as possible."
good,"Aside from some unrealistic rate expectations and insurance connotations relative to the potential development of work related conditions not being referred to as work related, like their willingness to illustrate staying hydrated, stretching, and the correct movements associated with certain products/packages higher than shoulder height and weighing more than is simple to move quickly, without illustrating the importance of well ventilated clothing beginning with pickers, to avoid the development of painful rashes!!"
good,"long days at work. something new every day to learn, different management every year hardest part of the job was probably the drama and hours.. most enjoyable was the paid days off and away teams"
good,"If you can handle the job that are fast pace, rate scan and none stop. if you can't handle this job, then this job isn't for you. just be par pare for none stop."
good,"Go in, Stretch with your group and when the bell rings grab a gun for scanning. After you stretch and login to your gun you'll go to the location the gun gives and you'll begin scanning the items it tells you to. You'll unload your cart when it starts getting full."
good,"Prior, to Amazon I worked In Accenture in India. I did have the knowledge of how big enterprises work, but Amazon was a completely new experience. I learnt there from day 1. And for a customer centric organization like Amazon, Software skills are as much important as their leadership principles. "
good,LOVED being the cannon in the chill department my supervisor's and managers were terrific but the equipment was faulty and the demands that you have to be beyond quick is exhausting for 8+ hours....we are only HUMAN.
good,Lots of opportunity for learning how to work in all areas of the facility. Fast paced work with good incentives. Good people to work with for the most part.
good,Learning different things everyday. Sometimes the management team wants us to learn different things on a daily bases. For example different area to scan the box because the changed it for the day.
good,"Working at Amazon can be tough when you first start working there, but it gets easier the longer that you work there. The hardest part of at Amazon is getting used to having to do the same tasks over and over."
good,"The company in and of itself is very fast growing and fast paced, which was not a problem for me. The only two issues I had working for Amazon at the Carteret location was that there was never a manager around and I would have to go on a hunt for a manager, which in the long run would affect my productivity. However, the benefits are AMAZING and there is ton of room to advance!"
good,Decent pay for the work you're doing but not many advancement opportunities if you aren't a favorite of upper management. You have to do your job based on a rate that you must keep up
good,"I loved Amazon great place good people easy work near to no labor but the only down fall they have a 3 strike policy witch is of course understandable if you don't make rate you'll get written up and a couple warnings till your termination, but they'll give you a work path that is , and I say with no exaggeration impossible to make rate from switching floors sending u across warehouse will drop your rate, they'll give u bad pick paths till your last warning then they take the weight off you with easy paths and on you to not make any mistakes for a month or two to save from termination and I've noticed and been told by a supervisor this is true , I believe it's extremely unfair don't understand why you would put your employees at risk of termination"
good,Many employees are lazy. Many low rank workers feel that they are the boss. There are employees that view certain topics in black or white with no gray area. The most enjoyable part of the job is break time.
good,"Depending on your financial responsibilities, the pay and benefits are ok. Personally, I am used to making more money so the pay and benefits are not really attractive to me."
good,"Working with fast pace atmosphere, updated with latest technology around with a great potential to learn new techniques, Amazing leadership in managers and seniors, Best & hardest part was to compete targets not just in your facility among whole state. I have always enjoyed the encouragement after achieving my goal of every single day."
good,Very Fortunate to have had the opportunity the learn and grow with outstanding company. Glad to have been part of the team. Different departments to develop and grow.
good,"On a typical day I walked about 15 miles a day picking.  The culture is rush, rush, rush.  The hardest part of the job is getting throught the first two weeks.  My feet felt like bloody nubs.  The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting some interesting people from across the globe."
good,Amazon is a great but fast paced work environment. The benefits they offer are amazing. There is room to advance in employment. The only con is that the long 10 hour days are exhausting
good,"The workload was manageable. My day started at 6 AM and was done by 3 AM, sometimes going overtime during peak season. Flexibility of work hours would have been nice. The work ambience was great and food in the cafeteria was good too. Perks like free transport and Sodexo coupons appreciable. Overall a good employment experience."
good,"Honestly, if all you're looking for is part-time work, this is a great job. Pay is above minimum wage, and with the new shift choice system you can easily make over $1000 per month purely working weekends. Permanent associates get a decent pool of unpaid time-off that you can use with no questions asked."
good,worked there for 3 years and all i had to complain about was pay. good job experience overall. i learned alot about the real world and what to look for in a job and what benefits to investe in.
good,"easy money"
good,"Typically we arrive at work sign in and check the board for which location in the building are team is assigned to. We go to a pre-shift meeting and do stretches. At this time we get an individually assigned work area. It is not a difficult job as long as you stay focused. The rate expectation does not allow for time to socialize at work, only at break time. Managers try to help employees reach their goals. Most people are helpful."
good,"I am working in Amazon since 3 months..I like to work there but!!!!! the breaks are not enough..too much waking..10 hour shift ..stressful time..too hard to stow with big items.its really hard to make a rate up if u slow down for a bit,the rate goes down..and I hate this thing.."
good,"a typical day at amazon, get to work clock in stretch, pick, lunch, back to work til end of shift."
good,"Lavoro impegnativo, ma stimolante."
good,Was a great weekend job.  Paid well and was simple enough to do.  Unfortunately they are eliminating the part time weekend employees from the TOM team as they are experiencing too much turn over.
good,a typical day at work would be go in and work hard for 3 hours then you get a break then another 3 hours of hard work then another break then last 3 hours before home time. our breaks were half hour long. I would always learn new things on a daily basis. the hardest part of the job is being in a small workplace on your own without having the chance of communicating with your colleagues.
good,Friendly environment. I enjoyed it as it allowed me to work my socks off to get the job done. The management team are supportive and ensure you are encouraged to make sure u perform.
good,The company does not care for the individual. That being said the managers at the Modesto work sight try there hardest to listen to and respond to there employees. They also communicate extremely well.
good,"Laid back job, one thing I learned is how to drive a forklift. Management sometimes seemed like they didnt know what they're doing half the time and sometimes called the wrong call. Culture very diverse."
good,"Enjoyed my schedule. In any case, I prefer they work with opportunity to see if you fit for all positions without worrying about job security. Rotation in each area would be a better fit for amazon. Having enough management in each department or sitting up a place on the floors where management would be easy to access without going thru steps to speak with them and giving them a place to work.Since my warehouse has cut back, I feel that management has to much opportunities to stay invisible when needed ."
good,A fun place to work in with growth opportunities. A lot of learning opportunities. The management is good and the work culture is nice. The team building and employ culture is worth working for.
good,The company was ok. I started during peek season. IT was a lot of working over time. But I like that you get benefits being seasonal and being full time.
good,"Worked through integrity staffing solutions out of Reno, NV for the Amazon.com warehouse in Fernley, NV.  Lots of walking,  bending,  and lifting as well as long hours (average of walking 12-15 miles a day).  Easy enough work, though physically taxing if not used to it."
good,"I enjoyed it. I worked from home and it was easy to tell how well you were doing. However, I was seasonal and trying to be made permanent, and they never let us know when we would be let go or when we might be kept on. It was horrible having that ax looming over your head."
good,"The hours are long and breaks are short, Prepare to be on your feet all day long pay is competitive, and if you are full time, their are tons of good benefits."
good,"In order to stay longer here, all you need to have is patience, and strenght because some can't last a week on this companymainly beacause you lift heavy stuffs like 50lbs to up. you might also need to carry your medicine because you might not know if your body's  gonna give up."
good,"There are a lot of great perks to working at Amazon, as long as you don't work for INBOUND STOW. The inside joke is that is where people go to get fired. If you stay on task, making rate is easily achievable, but stowing in the wrong bin can lead to a write-up. Many hard workers are terminated due to errors or because they mismanage their time off. Stay focused and check in on your numbers constantly."
good,The Everett Location is a great location to work.  I work with some great people and have a lot of fun.  You get a good understanding as to how Prime Delivery works.
good,Great company to work for. They definitely show appreciation for their employees. Depending on location make sure you dress comfortably and stay hydrated.
good,"Great company, but they there is no work life balance. I had to work the night shift, and saw my wife for 5 minutes on Mod-Wed. The people there are very smart and helpful. You can definitely do well there if you put in the time."
good,the job was hard and long and in the beginning has job instability but after you prove that you can meet expectations and become full time associate the work becomes easier.
good,My typical day would be like. I would check in and meet with my superiors to discuss the job that is awaits on us. Then check the floor to make sure to it's what have discuss.
good,"9 - 5 job"
good,Make sure to buy good shoes and dress comfortable! You will walk about 10 miles a  night if you are a picker so make sure you are also staying very hydrated.
good,"Amazon.com staff and employees great folks.  integrity "
good,a typical day at work requires you to pick 3 routes or more. pack vans and help out coworkers. the most enjoyable part of the day is my break. i really enjoy engaging in conversation with my peers about sports and other enjoyable things.
good,"Good work culture, fast paced and management listens to their subordinates regarding issues that arise and implement changes as required.  Best part of this job are the people you work with,"
good,"Great place to understand running a global business. You are given lots of responsibility right from the get go. Very smart leadership, but depending on your team it might be slow to adopt new ideas."
good,"It was a fast-paced job. At least in the holidays. I think the salary was fair for what you had to do. It requires a lot of energy and strength at times. The management was ok. The shift hours were terrible, at least for me as a student."
good,Satisfied with the work and work mates. Shift of 10 hours was bit stretching but it saved my transportation cost for a day in a week so it was neglect able.
good,"I started as a temp and was converted to a Tier I Blue Badge Amazonian and am currently a Level 4 Sr. Staffing Coordinator. I love working for Amazon! The benefits are amazing, the pay is fair, and the process used for raises and promotions is evolving in a very fair and positive direction. Management can be hit or miss. I have had way more great managers, than bad ones though. The opportunity for advancement is awesome. I know many associates with nothing past a diploma and they are Trainers and Process Assistants. They have a Career Choice program that helps pay for schooling, so if you are not promoting, you can study for a better paying job and leave. This job is all about attitude though. A positive attitude and willingness to learn will take you VERY far. Coming in and constantly complaining and drawing negative attention to yourself is not the best way around Amazon."
good,"A job if you need one.I started this job, and I worked it for a while. I was good at first, but the strain my body took from the fast paced manual labor was too much for me."
good,"Amazon is a great place for  fresher's point of view"
good,"The insurance here is great.  The company has really worked to get a great rate and coverage.  A definite plus.  "
good,"We have excellent work culture in Amazon, fair hierarchy. Management is very friendly. Lot of opportunities for learners. While there is a bit less work life balance, we do have a great work culture and necessary support from managers to deal with difficult times."
good,"A typical day at work will be 10min excercise, start setting up for Flex drivers, set up computers and job done."
good,"The job is face paced and requires a lot of moving. Standing still is required in some positions, but thankfully mine was not. If you need to get your steps in, this is the place to do it. 20K - 30K each day."
good,"I really enjoy working at Amazon, and I really hated to leave but all my family moved to different state. I enjoy working at different time of the day.and it was fast pace. I enjoy the relaxed dress code, although I have no problem wearing a uniform."
good,"Think of the worst job you could possibility have and this is it. Back stabbing, cut throat, no work life balance, it just never ends. Bait and switch jobs at date of hire."
good,"Mon passage dans l’entreprise fut très instructif, le seul problème a était la localisation du site par rapport à mon domicile qui malheureusement a vu mon départ plus rapide que j’en ne l’aurais espérer."
good,"Amazon as  an organization drives members to be innovative and stands true to its principal that it is still day 1."
good,"Great place to work for if you don't mind being on your feet for 12 hours, pulling, pushing, and lifting. Very hard labor but nice pay! A lot of kneeling and reaching for high and low items, very hard on the body."
good,"Broken promises to become a manager or move up in tiers was very difficult through the interview process specified. I was trained for a position that months later was taken away and moved to a different shift. Thereafter, was told to become a regular worker as if all my hard work did not matter."
good,Inside you are consistently moving handling packages and making sure the these packages are being scanned appropriately. Outside there is downtime in between checking in and out tractors and trailers but a lot more responsibility.
good,"A typical day is not too hard but is constantly busy. The management staff are nice and never on your back about things as long as you're doing what you are supposed to do. The hardest part of the job only comes when the job gets backed up due to late trucks, otherwise, the job is easy"
good,"I love my company , just no chance for advance , you need a collage degree, all the people i worked with are great , !m just ready to move on and advance myself, i thought i was going to be at Lafarge Corp but my company closed done."
good,"Amazon is a cool place to work at, but some of the managers have their favorite picks which isn’t really fair. I like the fast pace and people that gave positive energy."
good,"Seller support was a great experience, training provided by amazon was very relevant and enabled me to grow as a professional. The growth path and interdepartmental mobility however was limited."
good,"Not a hard place to work , fast pace however. Pay was good, hours were consistent but could be hard on the body. A bunch of walking and stretching is required. Warehouse job"
good,"It would be nice if the youth were able to experience Amazon  and witness it's value to the community. The Amazon where I was employed, is a good place to work. Employees had direct access to levels of  management and we were encouraged to express our ideas and concerns. While working there, I experienced  Management taking strives to ensure the safety of all employees."
good,Honestly the typical work day is fun and fast paced. So many different job responsibility that it's hard to get bored. So many departments and interesting people that work in them makes for a fun new experience.
good,Very long days and extremely high rate associates are treated like robots rather than humans. All they want is numbers numbers numbers. When they say safety first I don’t think they mean it
good,it is an easy job to do but there really isn't any opportunity for advancement. hours were ok  for part time. lots for chances to pick up hours  during peak season .
good,"The site I worked at was one of the busiest and most fast paced. Once peak season ended, I found myself without the overtime and needed more money for the family. So I left due to that one specific reason, otherwise Amazon, offers great benefits and advancement if you work for it and strive to gain more."
good,"As an entry level position the Amazon warehouses provide a very good option. The base pay is much higher than most other places and the benefits are very good, including health insurance, 401ks and eventually company stock."
good,"The work was standard warehouse work, and the people there were nice. I suppose my only complaint was such late notices of shifts being flexed up an hour"
good,"It tough and rough but you get decent pay for the type of work.  The stock benefits are great if you stay for several years.  For the right type of person, this can work out with advancement."
good,"Great company to work and learn."
good,"Employed 5 times through agencies. if i could give 0 stars for job security i would. having said that, the Agency staff were decent and management were easy to talk to and not 'us and them' with agency staff."
good,"Delivery Driver with 2 years experience in multidrop courier deliveries. 130 – 170 + stops per day"
good,"New building, great company to work for, not organized well, but the benefits were awesome and the surrounding establishments were very friendly and cheap."
good,"MY time with amazon was very enjoyable. Good pay, very stable work, and a  lot of paid time off, an so many other benefits. My one problem with the company is that there is obviously to much favoritism between management an employees. At times i felt neglected an that most of my concerns were not fixed in a timely manner compared to other employees. overall it""s a very good company to work for an i would recommend it to anybody who is willing to work in a fast but enjoyable environment."
good,"Seasonal job at a Sort Center.  Management is encouraging and easy to work with.  Work environment is relaxed (dress as you like), but you are expected to work the entire time you are on the clock.  Job can be physically demanding depending upon your assignment.  You will lift many heavy boxes, but you can request assistance (if needed).   Safety is a big priority along with high production.  Better communication in regards to a career path and development is needed.  Difficult to stand out in a sea of workers (over 100 per shift).  One negative is that your work hours vary each shift.  You are scheduled to work 4 hours, but you may work anywhere from 3 hours to 5 hours (dependent upon that day's volume, staffing, etc.)."
good,"Ambiente stimolante e giovane, lavoro meccanico ma certo, Ottima organizzazione delle risorse umane."
good,The hand held scanner is your life and your identification during  a typical work day. A great day for me was when I was able to find all items sent through my scanner.  A bad day was when I assigned work orders that had me constantly walking from one end of the  warehouse to the other end jus for one item and then I have to walk back to other end for remaining of my items before that tote is completed.
good,"Own your career and you shall have no complains at this organization. No spoon feeding, no micro management. Lot of opportunities for taking projects and developing your career."
good,Un environnement qui permet aux jeunes de faire leurs preuves ainsi que leur premier pas dans le milieu professionnel.
good,Don't allow the sometimes IDIOT managers to ruin your work day here. You can move around the building as you need to to find suitabl e work for the day. Weekly Checks!
good,Good warehouse with nice associates in there good place with good sollary for persons which are just arrived to united kingdom best for persons which come here just for some months because there is busy time at cristmas with a lot of owertimes and very nice sollary
good,"I have increased my energy levels with this profile, by making new contacts every day and visiting different environments which enhanced my skills and ability of my skills in sales."
good,It's a fun place to work but career growth has been stymied by an org change.  I'd love to stay here but don't have a path ahead.  Great benefits and mostly great people.
good,"The days were long, filled with hard work across the facility. The upper management would push for more and more work and run people into the ground. It is a hard business, but if you can deal with all the issues, you can succeed."
good,Amazon is great for someone who dislikes face to face customer based work you can focus clearly on your duties and get the job done without being distracted
good,"I was water spider that's putting boxes on the lines, taping boxes that role down the line, working on he dock, working in picking scanning items that people had ordered"
good,"Workplace with good atmosphere, with good benefits."
good,"I love the organization. If I didn't have an internship to fulfill for school, I wouldn't have left. I am trying to return now that I've completed my school obligations."
good,"Unfortunately amazon decided to cancel 100 peoples contracts last week despite working there for 2 years."
good,"A typical day at work should be fun, with real teamwork and interaction with the clients. I learned to handle problems which the clients encounter, and how to actively listen and act with regard to clients problems or requests.Management should always be supportive to the team on the floor, to act as a team.I prefer a relaxed and friendly in a mutually supportive team environment. When I have not an immediate answer for the clients requests or problems, I had had to fall back to my colleagues or superiors for help.The most enjoyable part of my job would be to have pleased the client, to have solved the problem for the customer."
good,Amazon provides many opportunities to cross-train and learn many other things than what your normal position would entail.  I personally think it is imperative to have those opportunities because doing the same thing every day can be very monotonous and boring.
good,"This place always kept me very busy but I was not thrilled about working on holidays. Also, I did not like that employees had to work ""at rate"" in different functions. That means you have to work very fast at the warehouse."
good,"Management is good, workplace culture is super, but to work all shift 10 hours on your leg is very hard. Free coffee is advantage, smoking shelter is excellent, canteen is very big. To work in packing is not very bad, but picking is horrible."
good,"While I was at Amazon, there was a lot of attrition so as quickly as we could hire people through the front door, they were leaving through the back door. I really liked the team that I worked for and I felt that the positions were challenging but manageable."
good,"Cambian constantemente de procedimientos lo cual es bastante bueno porque no te deja mantener una zona de confort."
good,"I did six months at Amazon Prime Now, 2 hour delivery service. The managers were cool except from Columbian Chris-he wasn't good at talking to people. The job is pretty easy and you get up to speed really quickly.  "
good,"Altamente recomendable."
good,Very fast paced work environment. Lots of great people to work with. Learned a lot about myself and what challenges I am able to take on now. I recommend Amazon as a great place to work to family and friends all the time.
good,"I work there during peak season, it was 12 hour days 5 days a week and sometimes 6. My body personally could not take that type of work day after day. I chose to work a little smarter and less harder. Just my opinion and experience, but I was 44 yrs. of age."
good,"The Amazon.com atmosphere was an enjoyable one to work in. The company truly cares about their employees and making sure they are taken care of. The management, however, is clueless."
good,"I work inbound dock which consist of each receive, prep receive, pallet receive, case receive, audit of pallets. Support on dock with wrapping pallets to be transported and getting zones ready for the next shift."
good,"C'est un bon job, les journées passe vite mais les possibilité dévolution sont mince ."
good,"N/A.......Nothing to say. I basically worked in the warehouse doing selector work. Training provided.Worked various hours. Uses "
good,"conttatto con il publico , bella gente simpatica e disponibile"
good,It’s a good job pays fine but sometimes I felt like we were being over worked or to many hours for people with families but it’s a good job overall pays good paid time off and other things witch is good
good,"Every department is different and requires different training. Amazon is a very fast paced company that has you moving, bending, lifting a lot. You will be cross-trained in order to help in other areas of the department depending on business needs."
good,"Need to be on your toes as each day matters at Amazon. Company had grown in leaps and bounds in a very short time and all this is because of the competitive work culture."
good,They really needed help some of the managers didn't really know what they were doing. I got fired for listening to a manager and the people in the HR department .
good,amazon is a really good place to work for if u are trying to get on your feet and your young.. they offer great hours and they also will work with your school schedule..
good,I loved working at amazon. The only reason I left was because another company offered similar benefit for a better work/life balance and career advancement.
good,"When I worked at the fulfillment center in Haslet TX., the place was overwhelming at first;Huge!The positive thing about Amazon is that it cultural mixed with a plethora of nationality. I got to learned a couple of greetings in four different languages and made friends that I still talk to till this day."
good,"I really enjoy working at amazon, things are always moving. If you get the chance to cross train I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!! The more you know how to do the more chance of rotation you will have and not be stuck doing the same thing over and over. They do things to keep it fun, like activities to earn swag, or contests and games at start up meets. I am trained in Receive, prep receive, stow, reverse logistics and pick. Sometimes I get stuck in stow without any rotations and as of late work has been really slow that there is many days where VTO (volunteer time off) and if you don't want to leave you get to sweep or 5s (usually means laying tape down). But all and all its a really good job and the benefits are good and there is month incentive based off performance of the whole building plus your attendance. You receive bi-weekly pto (paid time off) and Vacation and every 3 months you receive upt (unpaid time) for your use when you want. The only thing you have to worry about dealing with your time is to never go into the negative with the UPT or you will not have a job. But other then that, if you maintain your rates you will have a job that is easy and get paid well!"
good,Enjoyable employment and valuable skills gained on operating machinery and learning Amazons business process. BHX2 in Coalville has great facilities for employees and majority of co-workers where friendly.
good,"Excellent exposure, warm and friendly people. Focused and target oriented. Good Place for newcomers to Canada. Ideal location, flexible shifts. Fast paced environment."
good,The people you work with are generally nice though it varies from department to department within the different buildings. The managers are decent but never be late from a break or leave early. A good amount of people seem to get fired for this. if you want to advance get involved and do as much as you can and be on many committees as well as applying for season advancement job positions. Benefits are great. Best part is to not be on your feet after a long day. Hardest part is the repetition.
good,A lot of smart and young people to work with. You need to work a lot but everyone is very enthusiastic and you have a lot of career opportunities and to move in different countries.
good,There is a lot of heavy lifting and standing for long periods of time. They are very strict on the company policies. During certain seasons you can get a lot of overtime.  They have a reward system which I think is awesome. The only disadvantage would be the shifts you would like to work may not be available.
good,Management is good overall but salary has to be improved for all departments and employees.Company has next level in future related to other companies
good,The atmosphere is good. It is busy and fast pace. Little time to rest. It is also easy to advance. They provide opportunities to work and learn different areas of the company. They also have discounts and gifts for employees.
good,The job is not terribly difficult. The only real difficultly for me was just the adjustment to a ten hour work day. The benefits were very nice and the pay was fair for the job required
good,Work life balance is hard to achieve with the number of hours you work and how exhausting the job is. The job is fun though and can be personally rewarding.
good,"Amazon is an awesome place to to work, time flies by and options to grow are endless. Leadership is very supportive of out of the box ideas, yet red tape does slow some things down."
good,Ok not bad. It's cool and fun and I liked the work attitude. It's vert faced pace and you must practice safety. You will get plenty of training and benefits start on the first day for full time workers.
good,"Amazon Fulfillment Centers are a great place to work.  The work is fast paced and you work hard ~ but you also have fun.  This is probably one of the few companies that I can say truly cares about it's employees.  The only draw back was the majority of the contact with the company is done through email ~ when I applied, I never spoke with a real person until my orientation day.  And I also didn't enjoy not knowing what my exact job title would be until my 2nd day of work."
good,"I enjoyed it immensely.echnical Support Specialist"
good,Was the best company with I work and was nice because was good pepople and nice payrate on holidays you know....  And they have good supervisors and best team leaders
good,"At amazon in vacaville,ca, sortcenter,  they need to give us more hours. We have been #1 on inbound. we need a raise, and leave the heaters off, and a/c on"
good,there wasn't much stress in this job but there was a lot of work to be dine and its alot of standing on your feet this particular one was overstaffed for the holiday peak season so it was easy but alot of people got sent home early and often
good,"Long hours of no sitting, stowing, or picking and you'll Def inetly be standing the whole 10 hours pretty much. But the pay is very good and makes up for the long hours"
good,Amazon is a great place to work if you only need part time work.  If you need more than 20 hours per week it might not be your ideal job.  I personally require more.
good,Amazon is the perfect place for a first time job or if you are in college. Not recommended for people of age.I noticed the older employees seem to feel out of place.
good,"I wouldn't recommend Amazon as a company to work for more than a few years at. The best part about it was the other employees and the community you'd make with them during work hours or on breaks. The managers are very ""my way or highway"" but in reality have very little control over you so it's hard for them to be taken seriously."
good,they give you a clear expectation of the job you either can handle it or not. If you cant many quit and they bring in more temps to replace. It is very physically demanding but its good clean honest hard work. compensation varies on Peak(Holidays/Christmas) or other experience.
good,"Manager and crew will give worker skills needed."
good,"Amazon operations program has tremendous learning opportunities and scope of leadership development. Even though work-life balance is a little off, but at the start of career, it is worth it!"
good,I did not have any major issues at amazon. I worked in the warehouse 3rd shift my hours were usually between 6pm-6am. Sometimes the hours changed depending on if I had to do overtime or not.
good,"Management is amazing she connects with all employees and makes our job sail smooth. When there is a problem Management and Process Assistants come up with a solution in a heartbeat. The most difficult part about being an order picker is meeting the rate. Overall, i feel like anyone would make a great fit for the Amazon Fulfillment center in Aurora."
good,Guaranteed job. Always overtime available. Benefits are amazing and management is good. Advancement with pay increase is difficult. Must be responsible\\\\ for one's own action at this company.
good,"Typical Work Day- Fast past and feels like your are playing Tetris when working with the packages."
good,"Amazon was a constant fast paced job where you learned how to operate in a large warehouse facility. The management was fine, except that it plays favorites with employees and the only time you can advance is if you are very outgoing. The pros of the job are the benefits, the 401k, health insurance, a lot of hours. Cons would be little to no off time, being worked into the ground everyday, hours can be hectic, management is unorganized. The most enjoyable part of the job was making money."
good,the days went pretty quick
good,It was an ok company to work for. Management was not the best and payment was also not the best with all the hours and hard work sometimes you had to do
good,"Working at an Amazon fulfillment center you will see a multitude amount of personalities but overall is a good place to work. Hopefully you can get in a department that you like in the beginning, even though they are flexible with changing departments during different times. Expect to work overtime at this place during the holiday season, and always maintain a good health so it doesn't impede your work."
good,"A normal day at work is always never ""normal"" because of how flexible you have to be at the job also the people you work with will make everyday a day to enjoy. As i worked there I learned how to be a team player and to work independently as well as work in a noisy fast environment. Management though I have to say was not the best many times ive needed things and help when I first started to work there and no one helped me I had to learn by trial and error which is the number one reason why they let me go because I got so many strikes trying to learn what to do and how to do it. I think the hardest part of the job is the first month because of all the mistakes you'll make but the best part of the job for me was never really the pay or benefits it was the people I got to meet along the way during my amazon career. Its a great place to work after the first month I have no regrets."
good,"Don't quit your day job! It's just not worth it, if it's just a temp job for the holidays it's great but any time other than that is a no go. Thanks!!"
good,"Amazon is a fast paced work environment that can be fun.  The management at the DKY-1 Amazon location that I work at is responsive and easy to communicate with.  All of the jobs at DKY-1 are part-time with schedules of five 4 hour days, or four 5 hour days.  There is opportunity for advancement within the company, but since this location is small, advance here appears to be limited.  I would recommend working at the DKY-1 location to anyone that is in school or looking to supplement their income with a second job."
good,"Overall they deman alot from you physically, you are on your feet 10 hours of the night and are not allowed to sit. those employeed throguh the agency dont get same perks as employees hired straight through amazon and must keep their rates up all the time or should be worried about getting let go. During peak they do a mass hiring and afterwards a mass firing so keep your rates up and dont get pointed. have to kiss up to the managers to have a secured job."
good,"Fast-paced, physically demanding. Good if you enjoy those two things. Pay isn't what it should be, but the benefits (insurance, stocks, etc.) help to take that sting off a little. Would still recommend it to others. Great advancement opportunity, incentives, etc."
good,"Very crowded, a lot of workers, very fast paced, management there is friendly, the hardest part is keeping up with there quota and the most enjoyable thing there is the free food."
good,"excelente, buen ambiente de trabajo, trabajo de infinidad de procesos, trabajo en equipo."
good,Great place to work during peak season plenty of incentive and raffles for gifts i learned how to use a picker safely and efficient and the hardest part was to make rate other then management not applying this policy with everyone I was given a opportunity to make good money during the holidays
good,"Amazon can be a very political place at times but for the most part it is a good place to work. Stock options and great benefits are what the company use to keep people around. Depending where and what you are doing, it can be a very stressful job."
good,trabajar de 9 de la mañana asta las   11 pm sin horas extras
good,The company cares staff's safety in work. Salary is better than other warehouses. It is only good to work temporarily. Warehouse Managers do not work effectively enough.
good,"My typical day started at 7:30 am, with 15 minute breaks from 9:45-10:am and 3:25pm-3:40pm, with a 30 minute lunch from 12:00pm-12:30pm. Most of the time, from the start of shift until time to go home is non-stop. During my first few months, I was trained by well qualified associates, who were committed to preparing you for what was to come. I learned the policies and procedures that were proven to be the most efficient to be productive, all the while, paying close attention to safety, and the importance of watching out for your fellow associates, as well as yourself. If you came to a point, to where you were having difficulty making production, You could always go to your shift manager, and request assistance, and in most cases, you would receive assistance from a trainer or process assistant who was very knowledgeable in all aspects of the processes. The workplace culture is very competitive and overwhelming at times. The hardest part of the job is constantly being on your feet, and at times, walking anywhere from 12-20 miles a day, depending on the process path you were assigned to.The part I enjoyed the most was seeing how amazon gave back to the local community."
good,"A great company to work for no matter what anyone says. The job can be repetitive at times but it is by no means a ""hard"" job. The management team is always willing to help if you are in need."
good,"Everybody on your team is so friendly and really help you to be your best. The managers really try to uplift you in the beginning of your shift with stretches so you're not stiff and so you work as smart, quick, and hard as you ever have so you have nothing holding you back. Solutions are found rather quick to any problems that may occur."
good,"Working the line in shipping get ready for back pains and sirens."
good,The calls start little late and the manager is always there to support. Lots of different fun activities go on. Management is great. Overtime is required most of the times..
good,"This company is organized & well thought out. I would suggest it as a viable place to have a career. The job for me was very active, fast paced, and had a time goal to accomplish my tasks, especially when I started there collecting orders. In the outbound, it was still fast paced & active, but the scrutiny wasn't as bad. "
good,"Amazon is a great place to work."
good,it was a really quick job that you had to pick up on your own or you would drown. Once you got the hang of the job it became pretty chill. Didnt have a lot of time to hang out or downtime. Work and leave
good,Fast paced work environment. Most people were eager to get their rate for the day/week. Company kept everyone informed at all times what was changing in the building. Nice bonuses.
good,Amazon would be a place to stay at if they’re top out rate wasn’t so low. Everyone wants to work towards a brighter future. I had good experiences at amazon I just needed a better paying job to support my family.
good,"Very Busy, never sitting around unless you have break, always moving during this job. You get your work out. Friendly co-workers and leads as well with staff."
good,"Working for Amazon I would say was a wonderful opportunity. The managers I got to work with on a daily basis were very helpful in every aspect. Most times there were a lot of miscommunication, it would take a couple of people to clarify what exactly was to be done. Making rates and quality at Amazon are the most important things there. They call you in as well for mandatory extra time a lot but I didn't mind at all. A lot of people dislike that about the job but it was worth it from the paycheck."
good,"Management needs improvement but other then that, its cool. Cool co workers. A lot of fun events. And a very motivational atmosphere. A lot of room for growth."
good,"Amazon is a number based company where on a day to day basis you will have 150 associates you have to motivate to hit a rate. This is how Amazon makes money, by hitting the rate for the building.  It is stressful because as an area manager you have your boss down your back but then your associates are giving you barriers you have to break down."
good,"it was fast paced, long hours, I would pick stuff that customers would order on Amazon.com, my manager was nice, the hardest part of the job was trying to move as quick as possible"
good,No Comment I really enjoyed working there got to learn a lot about the company as in which it was and still is a company I order from till tis day....
good,"I had a great time with amazon. Our team is used to publish all the kind of the Ads for Amazon. We had different regions like US,UK,Germany, France, Italy, Japan."
good,"Very fast paced,"
good,I enjoyed working at Amazon. I wish I could still work there Pay was good and I made a lot of lasting friends I would highly recommend this place for a job
good,"Fun, fast enviorment, Managers care for there employees, amazon Benefits, work 10 hours wed-Sat.  Two 15 minute paid breaks and one 30 minute unpaid lunch."
good,i do like working at amazon but the hours were to long for my lifestyle. Im a single mom with two kids. 7am to 5:30pm then i dont get home until 6:30 because of traffic.
good,Warehouse environment focused on safety and employee condition. Must be hydrated and be willing to walk all day with minimum breaks. Be prepared. Lots of employees so advancement can take time.
good,Some expectations are too high. But youre guaranteed two days off and you work fulltime. I wouldn't recommend unless you're a hard worker! And take it seriously.
good,"Amazons a great place to work. There's only one negative thing I have to say about it and that's its overtime. Some days your shift will be mandatory to work, you'll be on your way to work and then you'll get a phone call that tells you it has been canceled. Other than that amazons a good work place."
good,"The company culture sets it apart from other employers in this industry. The flat management structure ensures that each person has a voice."
good,Amazon is great despite some people say they are overworked i don't believe that at all they will work with you if you show them the problem you are having.
good,"If you decide to work for Amazon Logistics, you must be willing to put the time and the effort to do the tasks that are given to you, no matter how tedious they may seem."
good,Fun easy job but the pay doesn’t add up. If you’re looking for a real part time job and don’t mind getting less than $100 a week then by all means go for it
good,"Good place to work, good benefits, offers help for your day to day. Able to work at different jobs during your work day. This helps to break up the day/night."
good,"Amazon is a good job to work at, it's a very fast pace job to work,  great hours and the pay is worth it I would recommend anybody to work at Amazon plus you can go as comfortable as you please just nothing inappropriate."
good,They provide great opportunities including career development but the demand on its employees can sometimes be stressful. You’ll have to learn how to balance your work and personal life to ensure your longevity with the company.
good,"Working at Amazon has a lot of ups and downs, due to its high capacity work, and a exhausted fast walk, but all in all it balances it's cons out with the pros such a fairly good pay, good hours, benefits and surprised gift cards etc ."
good,"face paced, customer service. was responsible to loading and unloading all freight. Was responsible fir picking customer orders for shipment. The hardest part is the time consumption and easiest is the pay and stability."
good,"Working for Amazon taught me to diverse. Working with many different type of people and not to judge. A typical work day I would arrive and have a group meeting. As a group we would stretch and break up into our lanes to do our jobs. Some of the employees may not speak the language and I would take the time to help them. The management expects us to finish in a timely manner and the hardest part of the job when the loads come in all at once and expects us to push all the product in a certain time limit. What I learned is patience which is virtue,"
good,Best place to start a career. Great colleagues and big learning. You will be amazed to see what you become as an individual after you spend 2-3 years in this company
good,"Awesome People to work with, Lots Of memories at Amazon, Must Join if you want to make career in Customer Support, excellent facilities.. "
good,"A competitive place to work, a lot of rooms for advancement and opportunities to learn from some of the best people in the industry."
good,They are a great company to work for. If u have problems in your family all you have to do is communiate with them and let them know what's going on. They will help you with ever you need all you have to do is let them know.
good,"	All human resource onboarding, welcome and training of new associates. "
good,"A typical work day consists of getting your station number, walking to your station and sorting the boxes that pass where ever you were assigned. The managers are nice, and always willing to work with employees when it comes to keeping the job. Working at Amazon taught me how to use my job as a stepping stone instead of security blanket.The hardest part of my job was staying on task when my shift was coming to a close. I loved the energy at Amazon the company always made sure that the employees are happy and ready to work."
good,I loved working at amazon i wouldn't mind going back i enjoy the fact its fast paste you get your own section and work without being bothered with other associates. and you get rewarded with acknowledgment when doing a great job
good,The hardest part about the job is meeting the goal for packages in a 5 hour time frame. Making sure all packages are accounted for and ready to be delivered. It is a fast paced environment and sometimes can be stressful.
good,"Come in, scan your badge to get in the building, put up your lunch, go clock in. Work for 3 hours 30mins , eat lunch, work for 3 hours 30 mins, break, work for 3 hours, go home. Hard to maintain their required rate."
good,I would recommend Amazon to any of my friends and family they have great managers a great team there's always new opportunities to work in different departments the managers are very Hands-On and they give you opportunities to go to school and I work with you on your school schedule so you don't miss work and school
good,"I really enjoyed working at Amazon, the atmosphere was one of the best I have seen. It is very fast paced, and at times challenging but the management showed their appreciation. They encourage you to try harder and constantly learn new things, which I love. I only wish that it was not a contract position."
good,The management and hr department picked favorites if you weren’t one of them you would get screwed over but other than that it was a very fun job with lots of great people to work around.
good,"the job is ok if you don't expect too much of it. You spend 10 hours a day picking things off shelves. It can get boring, but it's easy and pretty carefree."
good,On average your typical work day is a bit stressful. Every manager will say that quality is better than quantity. But that's not always the case with amazon. My experience with amazon has shown my that they want quantity more than quality. Especially when your job depends on your weekly rate.
good,É uma empresa multicultural onde você tem oportunidade de interagir com pessoas de diversos países. Conseguir compartilhar nossa dinâmica fiscal com os demais times de outros países é um grande desafio. Ótima oportunidade de crescimento profissional e foco 100% no trabalho.
good,Time goes quickly. Hours are difficult because you only work the night shift. Work if repetitive and dull. Amazon is a good company and pays well for the type of work you do.
good,Fast paced but also a laid back environment. Most people have lakes or sections they go to everytime they work so it’s pretty much a set schedule at Amazon you’re doing the same thing every day.
good,Air conditioned environment with a very fast pase. Responsable for quality control for customers orders. Checking for quality of product and correct quantity. The coworkers are very nice and easy to work well with. The ceo of the company comes to the plant on a regular basis. Sometimes engaging the line packers into a packing contest. He doesnt always win. Sometimes his workers beat him. He just laughs it off.
good,"Started with a group stand up, everyone is happy and talking. Told us what amount of work we have to do for the day. Everybody goes to their stations and complete the tasks."
good,"I love the fact that being a father of 3, and going to school full time, that amazon is good with letting me pick the days to come in to work. and they offer lots of overtime."
good,"I enjoyed the work and staff, but promotions aren't as fair as they should be. After thirty-five applications and a total of three years, I was finally granted an interview for promotion. Once they finally got to talk to me, they decided that I deserved the promotion. Amazon needs to do a better job at recognizing the employees who really benefit the company."
good,"Supervisors pitch-in with the work"
good,"good place to work. if you get the right position. great lunch and break area , big screen tvs microwaves. vending machines. free lockers and safety equipment."
good,The work pace at this job is very fast and physically demanding as you are constantly working towards reaching your targets with little time for breaks. can be exhausting. Well paid and professional atmosphere.
good,"During my time with Amazon, I can honestly say it was one of the better jobs I've had. The work pace is quick, real quick. More so depending on your position. If you are a person that likes to move a lot, this is a good place to be."
good,"they only problems I had with them is the ridiculous quotas they have that are hard for small people, I'm 5 foot 1 in and in pack its hard to pack a lot of there stuff when you can barely see above the table with a box on it"
good,"Not a hard job, hours are short but gives you plenty of advancement opportunity. New facility, management is nice and works with you. Can be competitive."
good,"it was a great experience to work at amazon but it was sometime poorly run inside, they push drivers to their limits, there are 18 hours shift daily. that is the reason why a lot people quit"
good,This is a great job if youre looking for a little bit of money and want to work on your own schedule. I wish they treated employees less like tools and more like people.
good,"I truly enjoyed my time at Amazon, and seeing how quickly the products we produce grow and change in time. Seeing things go from an idea on a whiteboard to a tangible reality was my favorite thing in this job."
good,Employees are just numbers and are reminded often that they are easily replaced. Management does not convey a message that employees are valued. Most positions are physically demanding and very fast-paced.
good,"Amazon was a great place to work at first. Good pay, great managers and friendly people. But then things began to pile on, the very thing holding you in the balance of keeping/losing your job is nothing more than a computer that has been proven wrong on quite a few occasions, not to mention the lack luster wifi interfering with scanner operations. The pay is stellar but if you come to work for amazon, dont expect your position to be by any means permanent."
good,Didn't work well with school Schedule. Other than that worked there for quite some time learned a lot about how things work. Good job for a student to have.
good,"Its a decent quick shift, usually no longer than 4hrs unless its peak season. If you support yourself, this job will probably work only if its your secondary and not primary source of income."
good,"it isn't the best place to work but it also isn't the worst. The experience is good but the more stuff you get trained in, the more the managers will over work you and have higher expectations and push you to go above and beyond to reach higher numbers past the expected quota. Which isn't a bad thing but it overworks employees and not everyone can take that pressure."
good,it was an experience all on its own. I loved my P/As and most of the managers where great. The people I worked with came from all backgrounds. Im some one who loves to work and this place will make you work. but if u are with them long enough it will wear you down peak after peak. I love peak though its a great time to win prizes and show your competitive side. its just hard when you have kids.
good,being a temp worker at Amazon resulted in me only working on the assembly line but it was still very high speed. It was over the Christmas holiday which made the experience interesting.
good,"It is not the worst job ever, however, it is a lot of manual work staying on feet for a period of 3-4 hours for 10 hour shifts. Parking is crazy because there are not a lot of spaces. Some managers are excellent, while others are distant."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of independent tasks, that require lots of rest prior to commencing your day. I personally learned that this workplace is a very diverse, place full of amazing people."
good,"Très forte culture d'entreprise "
good,"The culture at Amazon is fun and engaging. They keep the changes coming. If yo are ok with changes and being creative and can think on your feet, you will do fine. Management is great."
good,Good place to work. People were nice. Work was constant. I solved any problems on the receive side of the Kindle department. Managers were approachable.
good,"Great place to meet people of all backgrounds. Very physical but a great way to lose some weight and stay fit. Learned how to use a pallet jack, scanner and wrap pallets. Management is good. The hardest part of the job is you walk for 4 hours. The most enjoyable part is meeting new people and making friends."
good,It's always a day 1 in Amazon.. Having fun working here. The day I started working here was the day I realized it's a good company to work for.. But the salary is too low. They should increase the salary as let the market
good,"Managers had no experience in the positions they were charged to oversee.  I enjoyed working for the company but felt that the requirement of achieving production numbers was unreasonable. "
good,"Each day goes roughly the same, 10 or so hours of picking items from bins into totes. The management was very helpful and friendly, and my coworkers were typically very friendly as well."
good,"Standing in one spot, for 10 hours, scanning items and placing them in too large of boxes. Or walking around filling others boxes. Or, stepping up to ""Problem Solving"" which is resetting shipments from ones that have been canceled, but essentially standing in one place doing the same task for hours."
good,Amazon has many WAH positions. The company provides great paid training also a great day to day routine. The only downside is when you take time off for grievance if you do not have every hour to cover your days off you will be fired on your return.
good,"As a software engineer Amazon provides some of the best cutting edge technologies and leadership roles for a career advancement."
good,"You learn a lot from your colleagues. Very innovative culture. You are paid fine, not extremely well. But, you got job satisfactory from your impact. Big company with start-up in the heart."
good,Amazon is a great company and treats it's employees well. Depending on the job you receive is will tell is you like it or not. They are too tight on just about everything.
good,"Management engagement is good."
good,Working in a Fulfillment Center is a constant whirl wind of activity that needs to be managed by driven leaders. There is always something to improve or create to make the lives of associates easier. You are always thinking and innovating. The challenges are always there it is up to you to pull them onto your plate. To work at Amazon and succeed you must be a self starter.
good,"Working at Amazon Distribution Center in West Columbia is very fast-paced and your on feet for a good bit of time. Not very hard work though, and they offer rewards for hard work and other prizes."
good,its a great part-time job for any individual that's currently working or attending school its a great fast pace environment i enjoyed my time working there
good,My work place was good bcz the travelling problem I resigned my job company was well n good I loved workin there and my manger was good to employs and your weekly 2 off
good,I learned something new everyday how to work different  machines how to work them I would work at different stations go up and down stairs everyday sometimes I would work a lot of overtime I would scan bins and place the right order in the right bin or I would scan a cubbie and then scan all the items inside the cubbie and it would tell me what all goes in a certain box then I would put everything in the box tap it up and put a barcode sticker on it then scan the barcode and ship it off.
good,"I only left because there did not seem  to be any hopes of advancement for folks without a degree, and even those pursuing degrees, it seemed the process was not very friendly. There are plenty of individuals without degrees that will make great managers and or leaders, but for some reason this is overlooked, and good people look for something else."
good,"Speaking for just the shipdock, Amazon policy on who can work on the shipdock is unfair. While I was there an 85 year old man was assighned to the shipdock;a 63 year old woman who weighed only 90 pounds worked on the shipdock. The policy is everyone is required to load trucks for five hours of the shift. To load trucks you must be quick and strong and it requires climbing up and down climbing a stepstool. Who in their right mind comes up with the idea that everyone is suited for that type of work?"
good,Overall work place is good but no scope of getting into higher position even after you worked previously in Amazon. Not so good for benefits .The work is balanced
good,I enjoyed the short time I worked at Amazon but unfortunately this job was not for me. The commute was too far for me an the hours didn't comply with my home life.
good,"Ok place to work , pay is very good , just work long hours and it's hard labor .. You get paid time off so that's a good thing & there are many fun activities through the year and chances to win things"
good,A good place to start off with getting a great career in life. Has many career choices to choose from and they work well with associates. They offer great benefits from medicare to insurances of all types.
good,"Fast moving job. Very well balanced with your family and work life. You have three days off and four days of work, which get you plenty of time to spend time with your loved once."
good,"ten hour days 4 days a week. Freedom to associate freely with thousands of coworkers. Great benefits. Tuition is not reimbursed it is paid up front by amazon once you register and apply for classes, Very flexible job. You get PTO and UPT which is unpaid time off earned each pay period. You can clock out at any time of the day and leave but must use upt or pto."
good,Great People Fun Job Just Some Management Sucks And Unorganized i Been Here Fore Two Years And Since We Got A New Manager Things Started To Change And Thats When it Was No Longer a Great Place To Work.
good,"Fast paced, competitive, during holiday season. Requested too frequently to take unpaid time off once the Christmas season was over. Difficult to transfer to another department yet the hired new hires to a department that might have been a better fit for talents that were already on board. Great for the younger employees."
good,Manager and Area Manager are very disrespectful to associate and we are not treated will respect as an adult.  The hours are cut short after 3 hours.  Need better communication.
good,Amazon is a great place to work if your determined it has excellent benifits. And many oppurtunities for advancement if yoh get full time then it would be sn excellent long term job .
good,"I work 3rd shift which is 12 hours of trying to move as fast as possible, without making mistakes. We are constantly pushed to go go go. The job would be perfect if there was no mandatory overtime. I also go to school and barley see my family. You spend most of your break walking to get your stuff and can't take you phone into the cafeteria so either sit by your locker or outside."
good,"I worked online as part of the support staff, reviewing consumer complaints and issues with orders. I learned to work art my own pace but be fair and understanding. The hardest part of the job is meeting the quotas and the most enjoyable part is being able to work from home."
good,"Amazon as a whole is an okay job. The best part is the pay, but the long hours will definitely take a toll on you. Peak season is where it definitely gets crazy and hard to handle but if you are a goof worker you should be fine."
good,"Can be very stressful ,a chew them up and spit out enviroment,If you aren't a all star you are consider so much chopped beef by some of the managment."
good,"Much better than labor or retail jobs for $10 bucks an hour. Not the best job of course. Overtime makes a difference in yearly pay. Working at home is of course the best benefit. No gas no travel, paid after every 2 weeks."
good,"Management tries their best to answer any questions you may have and if not, they will find someone who will. "
good,"Part time facility."
good,Fun fast paced environment where they allow you to be yourself. No dress code aside from the no heel/sandal policy. Relaxed workplace with much to learn
good,"Each warehouse is different. Some departments you'll have great managers and co-workers, other times you have terrible managers who do not know what they are doing."
good,Amazon was a great place to work. Management was very helpful and professional. I enjoyed working there. They had great benefits and pay was pretty good as well.
good,"hard work but pays off. if you are hardworking and do not mind working longs hours then this a good place to work. it is competitive. as long as you meet your departments rate, then you should be ok."
good,At Amazon was a fast paste job expecially during peck season. I enjoyed my experience at Amazon. The only thing stopped me from continuing working there is balancing my work and college schedule.
good,"Amazon has great pay, and most people arr friendly i actually met my bestfriend at the wharehouse, they have holiday pay and are very strict on the safety of associates."
good,"Excellent organisation motto, every day is still day 1. Young and energetic crowd, and the floor is filled with fun activities. Growth in career is drastically fast."
good,"Overall is a good company with great benefits, but the pay is not where i would like to be. Insurance is great, but i feel that raises should also be accordingly to your consistent performance."
good,It was a good first job for me i would work there again and would also highly recommend this job to somebody else as there first job or even if they are experienced
good,A typical day at work was repeated.  I did learn a lot with this company as a leader. Management was very fare. The culture was average.  It was nothing hard about this job. I did enjoy learning different jobs.
good,"Amazon is a great company filled with really wonderful, innovative employees. The pace can be challenging if you have never worked in a similar environment, and the work-life balance is the biggest negative from my perspective. Amazon is a good environment for two types of people - those who can draw a line in the sand between their personal and business life, and those who can devote the majority of their time to their work. The benefits and work environment are great, and there are truly many things that are enjoyable about working at Amazon. If you work hard and aren't afraid to stand up to your leadership about what you think is right, this is a great place to thrive and further your career."
good,"I need any work in any department "
good,"Good place to work to stay afloat, maybe a year or two. Not a place for a career. But something to be in while your looking for your career job. Pay is decent but increases stop after 3 years unless promoted which is hard."
good,"It's being fun since I started to work at amazon, tho it wasn't at first , I just don't like my shift,I work weekend days which I don't like, I'm anticipating on getting a new shift"
good,Very easy and good environment   The managers could slack up a little bit but besides that is a good place to work everyone pretty much gets along with each other and is very easy good benefits
good,"its a relaxing job, night shift is very enjoyable. negative thing about the job was its too hot. but people taught you very well there and I liked the job because it was hands on."
good,"I enjoy the job, looking to make it my career. I would like to be that change and make the bad management better. There are new managers fresh out of college with no type of work experience and seems like they don't care at all."
good,"Amazon is a very fast paced job , you can't move slowly if you wanted to or else you're out the door . Amazon had a great environment , friendly staff , OKAY management I can't recall meeting any managers really but the warehouse was very put together and ran properly I would go back if they would consider taking me back"
good,"constant online training on customer satisfaction "
good,"Amazon is a great company to work for. You will be working in a warehouse environment, so be prepared to actually do some manual labor. Nothing to extreme, just good old fashioned manual labor."
good,"Policy change to elevated lifts. I am uncomfortable working 2 to 3 stories up in the air. Compensation for work performed was fair, but with my past machine operation experience, I realized I was not utilizing my skills to the best of my abilities for a better pay structure."
good,"Typically you know what you are expected to do each day.  However, the exceptions are when associates are proficient in multiple roles, then the job required of the associate can vary day to day.  I learned how to work with many different types of personalities in a factory type atmosphere which was a new atmosphere for me.  I also gained skills in a leadership role.  The management is friendly and will usually go the extra step to work with an associate that is struggling with job performance.  I was able to build a positive relationship with my management team and was not afraid to bring any issue to attention.  Also management is usually easy to find unlike some other jobs where you can work an entire shift and never see a manager. The motto of Amazon is to ""Work hard.  Have fun.  Make history,"" and this is certainly true.  I rarely had a bad day because of my co-workers or managers, it was only a bad when when products were hard to stow.  The hardest part of the job to get used to was the amount of overtime that is required of associates.  When you are hired you are under the impression that you will only be working four days a week for 10 hours a day and then it turns into five days a week for 11 hours.  It takes a major toll on a person's social life and body.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the relationships you build with your co-workers.  Everyone is in the job together working toward one main goal so everyone is usually willing to help one another get through the shift.  The other enjoyable part of the job is that there are challenges that are placed on people"
good,"On day one management tells you that it is more about quality than numbers, but they push employees based on rate. Favoritism is against the rules at amazon, along with targeting, one noticed this when working at amazon."
good,"Its always a busy day/night working at amazon, ive learned how to recieve in product through a computer. The management is on top of everything and always there to hear concerns or anything that needs attention. The hardest part of the job is the hours if you cant work 10 or more hours its not a job for you. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting paid."
good,"nice place to work and learn, but job security was not yet good for contract employees. Management also bit not yet initiative to give better job security."
good,Amazon is a great place to work at flexible hours and good benefits.  A good platform for people looking to learn and grow within the company throughout the various programs and options of career choice.
good,"Was an easy but tough way to make money. Kind of a hit or miss with finding things to fill out. And if there were things to fill out it either was very low pay or you weren't certified to do that task. "
good,"A day begins at 7:00 AM. After performing certain procedures drivers load out the van out of station. There are 120-130 packages each day which consist of 80-115 stops. some time day last till 6:00 PM. so by the time I reach station, it is 7:00 PM when the day ends."
good,Amazon is a good option to choose when you are coming for the first time in UK. They are hireling people very often. But in the Warehouse is quite difficult.
good,I was only a temporary worker.  I don't know anything about the benefits.  I do recommend this job to others.  You must be a hard worker and you must pay attention to details.
good,"Arrange all incoming shipments in designated storage areas according to established protocols"
good,"Personally, I enjoyed working at Amazon.  I like the fast-pace and the people I worked with.  I also had great managers and PA's.  When Prime or Peak season hit, be expected to work 6 days 10 hours.  This is a very extreme schedule that I did not like.  You have to work every major holiday except Christmas.  So if you like all this, then this is the job for you.  If you are a competitive, career driven person, it should not be difficult to move up the ladder.  I've seen many Tier 1 employees move up to level 2 and 3, respectively.  I made great friends here and was fortunate to have pretty good managers and process assistants."
good,did exercise at first. went over job assingments. count inventory.take care of wrong counts. Help other departments when needed. work overtime when needed.
good,"Nice environment, young , smart and motivated people."
good,"nice company n environment , would love to work again in different profile, perks are also very good, the holiday counts are good, management is good, canteen is good"
good,"As a company to work for, they have great benefits and pay well. jobs aren't hard other than lifting up to 50lbs and the bending over/ standing all day. As for management, their organizational skills need improvement. As does their LOA team."
good,Work culture is pretty Good and was trained on all most all the process and the bad part is we don't have personal time. No time to unite with family.
good,The staff is friendly and the people are really nice. The work is fairly easy to do and if you want to get in better shape then highly reccomend working there.
good,"I enjoyed amazon first of all because it was a well paid job. When I started working there, I quickly found new friends and was able to work comfortably."
good,"full time job, healthy environment, fun workplace and also pressure filled atmosphere."
good,"I am really not sure what to say. I enjoy the job thoroughly. I work with Drivers in the UK as well as in Germany. I assist the drivers with locating addresses, should there be problems with Navi, I assist drivers in getting ahold of the customer should issues arrise among quite a bit more. There is quite a lot that we do all while sitting in the nice cool environment of my own home!"
good,"A typical day for me at amazon usually has do with a lot of walking . At amazon you are required to pick 2,000 items a day to make rate for  the  day and to make rate."
good,"Fast and enjoyable workplace with nice supervision with great efforts including manager, supervisor and other workers. I must recommend to other people if they want to work."
good,"Load and unload freight trucks, store cargo."
good,i love my job in all at amazon but all they care about is their rate per hour in every department they don't care about how bad everyone has to work to just make that rate.
good,"Amazon holds good working culture. Here, we can learn from basic warehouse etiquette to advance level. Working at amazon Fulfillment Center is quite good."
good,"Co-ordination between Vendor and Transporter."
good,"I've only worked there for two months seeing that it was a seasonal job, but I can honestly say I loved it. Very productive and quick pace which I absolutely love."
good,"A typical work day for Amazon would just be doing our jobs, prepping, making sure everything is in the right order, "
good,Typical day at work is pretty much auditing Auditing boxes to make sure they were being sent to the correct destination. Company is average. but I just don't feel that rules and regulations are applied fairly to each individual
good,"Communication could be a lot better between upper management and the general workforce as to changes and updates in rules and guidelines being made, but otherwise have our safety and concerns in mind. Work can get very tiring and/or tedious over the 10 hour shifts, which leaves you exhausted when getting off, not leaving much for yo to do between consecutive shifts but rest. They also have a bit of a high turnover rate when more help is needed around the warehouse, causing more work for relatively few people."
good,Management makes this job less desirable. The fast paced environment adds on to the stress and the pay does not equal out the balance. Good place to work if you can handle it.
good,Not a bad job. They're pretty good to their employees. Decent opportunities for extra hours and advancement if you plan of staying in the warehouse/packing industry.
good,"It took awhile to get used to the repetitiveness of the job along with the long hours on your feet, but after about a month the job was not that bad. Benefits were good even though i was working at amazon through a temp agency."
good,"Good place to work overall. Does require lifestyle changes i.e. getting up early in the morning, waking up in the late afternoon for the night shift. Can be physically demanding. Pay is good and consistent."
good,"I've worked for Amazon twice. They work you hard. During the busy season, you can work as much as six thirteen hour days, which can be hard on a person. During the off season, the four ten hour days are nice. Also, since it was warehouse work, it can be too hot or too cold in the work environment."
good,when time cam ei had to walik ten miles a day around the warehouse pick items off the shelf's and putting them in a cart they I had to take to the coyverbelt all day
good,"Overall good working environment. Easy job, descent pay, and nice sized lunch room. Multiple parking lots so plenty of space to park. Many different jobs within the warehouse so plenty of options to work once your inside."
good,"Fast paced with quick implementation, less QA work, just push the code if u feel its working. No time for any extra activities. people talk about work a lot and finish a load of work in less time. Great company to learn quickly and challenging environment"
good,absolutely loved working here. I was just seasonal but we worked long hours but the pay was worth it. loved all my managers and supervisors. you was eligible for discounts while you worked there. I didn't get vacation and all that because I was just seasonal
good,"A typical day at work is simple, we pick our partners and receive our route pick list (packages), pick the routes and load them into vans to be delivered. I learned to work fast, efficient, and safe. Management is getting better, but everyone is nice. Workplace culture is really fun. The hardest part would be getting everything loaded correctly and within a certain time. The most enjoyable part is working with people who are of different backgrounds and cultures."
good,"The job was fun by customer service standards. Reps are given a lot of authority to make judgment calls based on the situation. There were a lot of overall perks in the office i.e. a pool table, exercise equipment. THE VIEWS."
good,Amazon does have nice incentives also pay is good with good immediate benefits when hired on full time employee. Their paid time off works very well and friendly people.
good,It's a good place to learn new things that will help you move up in to management either here or else where. The in work place is always changing and fast pace
good,warehouse work. if you have ever worked in a warehouse this one isn't different. you have shipping and receiving. not really much to explain. at this location it was extremely hot in the summer
good,Its good working here but job security is not the best. You have to reach expected quota to secure your job. This place is only good for younger people.
good,"Amazon is the go-to position for career advancement. Working with new and exciting technologies daily gives you invaluable experience. However, they know this position is desirable and pays less than other positions of similar duties"
good,I manage about 200 employees daily in a multi pack department.  From scheduling jobs for each and everyone to making sure the process goes smoothly in this high volume department.  I deal with many different people and situations daily and I enjoy it.  A challenge is what I am looking for.  I handle stressful situations well. Enjoy working with others in a lead position.  I have learned to multi- task very well and manage several things going on at once and keep all things running smoothly.
good,Amazon Hires and develops the best.  We have many great leadership principles that many companies may claim to follow but Amazon truly holds all to the highest tandard.
good,"I didn't personally like the management here . They don't care about the employees.  They breath down your neck about everything.  Whether it be using the bathroom , heat exhaustion, or needing something to drink in the summer.  The only good thing is the pay.  But even that didn't seem worth the hassle of the job itself"
good,A typical day at work is hard and long. I learned to pack and send out packages.Hardest part of the job is standing fo 10 to 12 hours. most enjoyable part of the job was the paycheck.
good,"Amazon is a great place to work. As a fulfillment center associate, you will be on your feet for the duration of your shift. Work hard, Have fUN! As long as you know what is required of you, work towards that as efficiently and quickly as possible."
good,"It's a decent job with good pay If you aren't up to standing on your feet for a long period of time, this job isn't for you. Nice beefits. The work is easy to learn, nothing extreme."
good,"If you are willing to be on your feet all day, it is not too bad. The work is simple and monotonous, but it is not very difficult. You are initially given a training period during which they are not very concerned about your productivity, but once this period is over, they monitor your quality of work."
good,Overall I have enjoyed my experience working for Amazon because of the people you work with and the benefits are top notch. I will say that the turn over for managers is quite high and that is because of the high demands that is required of them. I have seen managers go to other states to work for Amazon or have gotten a promotion in another department. The hardest part about this job would be handling the pressure that is put on you by the PA's and the managers because they are held to a higher standard and are responsible for much more.
good,Amazon provided a safe studio environment with industry standard equipment. They encouraged team efforts as well as individual contributions. I learned a great deal about production work flow for a large studio and maintaining a culture of positive employees. The hardest part of the job was sometimes the repetition of tasks. The best part was the atmosphere of intelligent and accomplished fellow photographers.
good,A typical work day just consist of doing the job you're assigned to every night. Workplace culture was pretty well spread. The hardest part of the job was probably the hours.
good,"Amazon is a tough place to work but one that will challenge you to exceed your skillset before you know it. A good place to grow and develop professionally. "
good,"This job definitely requires a commitment from your family as well.  The hours are long, especially during peak.  The weeks blend in the winter because you will work 50-60 hours each week from October to December.  The pay makes it almost worth it."
good,The company is good but benefits are not so great.  I work there as a contractor but not directly for the company. The company itself is great and have many people however the advancement is very slow.  some issue with the contracting company communications.
good,Working at Amazon was good for the most part but it is a very fast paced environment due to we were always busy and sometime with a customer for more than 45 minute but besides that It was a great job.
good,"fast pace of work,  good management, good training to all staff, can be challenging at time some rates are a little high  for the ave worker. but overall a great place to work"
good,"I worked in Inbound Receiving for 4+ years. Depending on what job function you were put in determined how easy or difficult your day to day work was. There are very many job functions to perform in Amazon warehouses and you have opportunity to cross-train based on length of service and company needs. Overall, I enjoyed my work at Amazon, but your opinion will be subjective based on the individual."
good,"Working in an Amazon warehouse can be fun, depending on if there is work. You meet a lot of different people. I really appreciate the benefits that Amazon offers its employees, as well as the perks. The only downfall is that we don't get paid that much for working hard. The breaks could be more enjoyable if they were longer (two 15 minute breaks & one 30min lunch)."
good,"	Led project to reduce time of the company to complete the task."
good,"Most people work 10 hour shifts but can be flexible depending on each person's needs, eg child care or studying. There opportunities to develop yourself"
good,"I enjoyed being a stower at amazon. The pay is great and the work is definitely a positive challenge. I was just a temporary individual so I can't tell you too much about benefits and whatnot -- I just think most times if one is matched up to a position they choose, they'll probably enjoy it."
good,"As a sortation associate, expect to work at a fast pace.  Due to the pace, shifts are short but rushed. What you can acheive with teamwork and organization is, however, quite impressive. Feel accomplished knowing your one of the final hands a package goes through before being recieved by a happy consumer!"
good,"I am still searching for an ideal job . Working for amazon is a good company to work for. Days off are good  and your time is very valuable . Benefits are great , 401 k is granted"
good,"Working at Amazon Fresh is still fast paced but the supervisors and managers are more considerate when it comes to their workers. They try their best to make working fun by setting up raffles once in a while, especially on holidays and even set up fun competitions to win prizes. One issue involved mandatory overtime which simply meant work days that were not originally on your schedule affecting those that had other jobs or school. If overtime was stated to be on that same day , it wouldn't have been such a problem for a few. Other than that, working at Amazon was not so bad! Running around picking and labeling was like an exercise routine and the more days you picked, the better and faster your rate would go and the more recognition you'd get!"
good,"Everyday began with the entire shift participating in a stretch before we head to our stations, at our stations we received pallets for us to break down, count and place the counted items in totes."
good,"Not the ideal job for most people, the targets seem a bit absurd sometimes, they have a very low tolerance for unstable rates even when it's not the employee's fault. Their ethics are questionable, always demanding more and more from the staff, even tough they state that safety is top priority, sometimes it's clear that all they care about is productivity. You may have a hard time achieving the rates expected on picking and stowing following all the safety procedures. It's a job that requires you to break the safety rules to keep it. And whatever happens, they will always claim that it's a friendly and safe workplace. They will never admit that they train you to act one way but force you to act another. That is my personal experience with them, and I'm sure I'm not the only one."
good,"its a very good place to work, as long as your wiling to be on your feet for 10 hours a day, its easy work as long as you do what your suppose to the right way , do not procrastinate it makes things even harder to catch up , you have a goal to reach everyday"
good,A typical day at amazon would consist of packing customers orders. I have learned a lot about this company and what they sell by processing customers orders. There is really no hard part about this job. Even though this job was seasonal i had a lot of fun working with this company.
good,Relaxing Work when delivering. No pressure and can move at own pace. Pay is well for students and full timers. Only con is having to wake up early to go to work.
good,"The job is very easy, and repetitive. It can be slow at times, and other times very busy. Overall, the company is great to work for. However, management can use some improvement."
good,The job is pretty easy the hours are long but you get the days in a row off. Management and HR are available 24/7. They don't have a point system as far as attendance so if you have an emergency you can leave work no consequences. Just make sure the time they give you never goes negative or your fired. As long as you're responsible and doing your job properly you'll enjoy Amazon.
good,"They treat you like robots, want you to make rate constantly, all they care about are numbers an rates, People constantly quitting an they constantly hire new people, like a revolving door, in an out. IF you want a hard working, hard labor job with great benefits then this is your job. The benefits are top of the line, can't get any better."
good,I love working at Amazon however hours were to be full time when I was hired in October. Since January 2017 most people in my department are lucky to work 20 hours per month. I need a career with at least 40 hours per week; willing to accept more.
good,The hardest part was all the mandatory overtime. I did enjoy making friends and learning multiple aspects of amazon. We need more time to walk from one part of the warehouse to the break room.
good,"Amazon is an amazing company to work with. They have good growth opportunities."
good,"toute chose à sa place, nombreuses règles de sécurité, ambiance familiale et jeune"
good,"we receive about 20,000 to 35,000 packages a night. you grab your desired package for the lane you are working in; proceed to scan the package and place it in the corresponding bag. the culture there is a big variety all types of ethnicities. the hardest part of the job i would have to say is when the lines get jammed and we get swarmed with packages. the most enjoyable part of the job is when we finished all the work in a timely fashion and are able to take it easy until its time to go home."
good,"Amazon has benefited me, it has aloud me to catch up on my bills, the Ambassodors are lazy all they do is stand around and talk. The managers are somewhat ok but could be better. I don't complain because I need my job"
good,some days are hard others are easy. All and all it is what you make it. I worked in a great location with a great staff other may not be so lucky but that life. You blossom were you planted.
good,"It was a temporary job offer, but I enjoyed the job while it was offered and appreciated the opportunity. I will always recommend Amazon as a job for those who enjoy being busy."
good,"Worked at home for them during holiday season. Busy, fast paced, pay was ok..training was great. fair place to work. would recommend to anyone wanting to work from home and build customer service skills."
good,"In my case, a typical day at amazon involved me to either pick or pack, I have occasionally slammed or problem solved. I learned to develop better social skills as well as to work in a team environment. Management, at least in my building is decent. You won't be bothered by managers as long you make rate/productivity and not accumulate TOT (time of task). Although, there are some managers that expect miracles from you, but if you aren't a slacker you'll get through the day. You will meet great people that make it worthwhile and make life at amazon fun and something to look forward to. Of course, if you are the quite type you'll still be okay you'll just be very bored. There are some rude people, but ehhh... they're everywhere.  The hardest part is making rate/productivity (at least in my building) especially when coming into work tired from the day before. Overall, amazon is a good place to grow. They are always hiring and if you pass the drug test you are pretty much in. You also have many chances to grow in the company if you have the motivation to do so. Amazon is always growing and will one day take over the world............!"
good,"Work Hard, have fun and make history!! Going with its logo the company has maintained work life balance."
good,"Typical work day would go by quickly, running around warehouse to fulfill orders. Organizing totes before sealing them and sending the on their way. Was interesting to see the things people would order."
good,A day at Amazon can ether very slow or very busy. the PAs there are very nice and understanding. Rates are easy to make. Packing is really fun and you get to meet great people.
good,"The company has good benefits, management is approachable and willing to help. The workplace culture is fun and challenging. Hardest part of the day would be leaving really late from work."
good,A Amazon Prime foi uma empresa agradável de trabalhar pois é um armazém pequeno mas com poucos e bons funcionários e bom ambiente de trabalho. Salário pago semanalmente e com bons benefícios.
good,"If you are fast and young you should work here. plenty of ways to take time off.  Pay is fair,  Great benefits.  but if you are slow or aging they push rates hard."
good,Amazon is a good place to work. Their compensation is very good. They do not provide enough training for new hires but expect them to hit production target as soon as they start working on the floor which is not reasonable.
good,"Exercise with fellow crew members, onsite healthcare facility. I also enjoyed the paid time off that was given every three months. At times the job can be stressful because management rides staff about keeping up with productive but do nothing to help."
good,"This is a good company to work for, great benefits, good people. Workload is strenuous but not too bad. They are very flexible and understand to time off. Amazon also has a good disciplinary system, I enjoyed working there."
good,dealing with customers from the comfort of my home was great wish it had better training could be more in depth other than that no real complaints not lots of room for advancement
good,"It's a nice place to work, very flexible.  We get paid every week so that's another bonus. They have VTO which is voluntary time off, so if you have anything you need to get done it's usually always available."
good,Best e-commerce firm to work with. You will handle the most complex issues and will enjoy solving them with a highly competent peer group. Work life balance could be better but it depends on your role and enthusiasm to learn.
good,"Learned as many positions as possible. Keep up with rates and quality to keep your managers and yourself out of trouble. Amazon gives you Paid time off, Vacation hours that you also accumulate, and Unpaid time off for emergencies. I met many great people, all vary from different ages and race."
good,"Amazon is a great company with innovative ideas and future plans. Amazon gave me my best confidence so far. It was fun working to meet deadlines but can be demanding. No server downtime is allowed. Feels good to be part of something great and a privilege to work at Amazon, thank you."
good,High perks and learning environment. Organization gives good salaries to its employees and takes very good care of each and everything. However in spite of every thing heavy workload which impacts personal life but on the other side all this work make us learned a lot.
good,"I've been with the company for about 8 months. It's a decent place to work, with okay benefits. They expect a lot, production wise, so be ready to work."
good,"Amazon is a very nice company to work for, I enjoy the company. The managers always help in whatever way they can. you can tell they are always trying to benefit the employees and make sure, we are satisfied with our working place."
good,I liked that we would have special dinners for the holidays if we had to work. I also liked that you were payed for those holidays that some jobs don't pay you for at all. The pay is also great.
good,"Work days go by fast.Weekly rates that are expected out of you are too high. If you fall below a weekly rate of a 100%.You are written up. If you receive 6 write ups in a 12 month period, for the same reason ex.productivity you will be Terminated. FYI from experience. Otherwise i really enjoyed my time with Amazon."
good,Fun workplace with a lot to learn and build yourself up professionally as well as a person. you learn a lot about management skills as well as team building.
good,Fun place to work and the work is easy. I learned a lot of different skills. Most management is ok but some need improvement with knowing certain processes pertaining to the job. The culture is diverse. The hardest part of the job is long hours with short breaks. The most enjoyable part of the job is some of the people you work with helping to make the day go by easier.
good,"Benefits, and requesting days offs are good very high. Security is very strict. The work life is the worst though I can see why many people leave it. Aren't allow to communicate and talk. Managers don't fill you in all the time. Other than that a good place if you like to work and don't like to communicate to people."
good,"Pros"
good,"This was a decent temp job, they seem to constantly be hiring for entry level positions. They are very structured on break times."
good,I very much enjoy in my all work and co operate with my all staff at work field.I learned everything to work related skills.
good,"Everything was straight forward and not too difficult to understand. "
good,"It's okay for a fill job until u can find something else"
good,A very straightforward job working with highly active and friendly people. Does require a vast amount of physical work but pays well.
good,i work at the return center. Jobs are relatively easy and it is a fun place to work. Salary is the same as other ware house jobs.
good,Runs off production so it's mostly busy day of finding items ordered through amazon by amazon customers. Once i find these items I send them to the pack line to get packed and sent off
good,Very diverse and fun people. The work is very physical and hard labor. Management is good to you if you show that you are a hard worker.
good,"Typical day at work included packing and sorting items to be delivered to customers"
good,"Amazon Warehouse Was A Very Busy Place But Also Not So Much Organized. I Was Never Able To Meet  My Manager, But Working For Them Was A Different And Well Known Experience."
good,"A typical day would involved being placed to perform a variety of different tasks, some which involved little physical and others which required a lot. I enjoyed the physical aspects of it, and usually volunteered for these positions. The work hours were also reliable, with plenty of opportunity for overtime. Management was lacking however, with people leaving their positions for a considerable amount of time with no repercussions; I also felt that management did not adequately address employees concerns or requests."
good,"It's a decent environment to work in, mostly straightforward; if you find a decent group to work with, it'll be a good experience. Personal recommendation, just try to get out of Pallet Land ASAP."
good,Working at Amazon Seller Support division is interesting and you get a better understanding of what is required to sell on Amazon and what sellers do to become successful.
good,"Working from home as a customer service agent was awesome. Although seasonal, you meet some great people. Management however are never on the same page. I was trained in all aspects of customer service from phone, chat, email and device. I was transferred to 4 different teams in less than 2 months.My skill sets were reduced to just phone. When I was sick I was not told that I could use a waiver for days off instead of sick time. This was told after the fact when I had a negative balance."
good,I only left this company due to them moving to reno. I have 3 kids and could not travel and work 12 hour shifts i would never see my kids. They are ok for the most part. Good pay but could be a little better. Hard work but i loved it.
good,"For this position it is a great side job. You pick your own schedule based on the hours available which is great if you like to take vacations or have kids/school. At this location the communication between supervisors and associates needs work. There's more than one supervisor depending on the shift so one might tell you a specific thing, while the other may tell you something different. They aren't always on the same page with important information which can be frustrating. It overall is a fun place to work if you like order picking but can be a little hectic based on peak days."
good,"It was a good work place for my  first wok in United Kingdom, I was feeling good and the people are verry gentil wit the begener, but I like to do more experiences ."
good,"Always loads of hours on the table for literally anyone to pick up, positions are flexible and the shifts are long. My days were spent driving forklift while grabbing and delivering items around the warehouse."
good,Typical day is a steady pace. I had the opportunity to learn different functions. What makes it alright is working with the people that I do. Some drama but that is everywhere. I enjoy the free lunches from time to time as well as the peak season and participating in the holiday events.
good,It's a really nice place to work. There's allot of great friendly people and the management is always there to help and listen when needed.  You can have the opportunity to learn new things.
good,THis place isnt that bad to work at there are a few nice people but i just feel they should be more better management. However its a nice environment.
good,"Kollegen super , am besten gefällt mir das Sprechen diverser Sprachen .Manager , na ja...."
good,a typical day at amazon includes doing morning stretches and getting the daily news before heading to your station/job duty
good,Decent place to work if you're looking for side income. But is imperative to have another job. Wear comfortable shoes and dress in layers. Also it helps that you can you choose your schedule to fit your life.
good,"The work was well explained, safety was a constant priority, there were surprisingly nice break room facilities for a concrete warehouse, and there were probably one or two interesting ways to switch up your role on a given week if you happened to be a motivated worker. The only issue was that it was only ever part time, and even that was questionable towards the end of the busy season."
good,Can be very hard place to work however the work/life balance is good.  4 days a week 10 hr days.  Competitive pay and benefits.
good,"I would consider Amazon to be a great place to work.  Although you may have long hours and heavy lifting, if you stay dedicated to the job, there are alot of opportunities to advance and grow with the company.  The benefits are great and management gets to know the employees one by one.  Overall good company to work for."
good,The company drives on success.  The opportunities are irreplaceable.  Amazon focuses on its ideologies for success.  Everyday is as challenging as the next.  Quick decision making is a must but results must follow.
good,"das mangament war immer freundlich und zuvorkommend"

good,"Very fast paced busy work environment. Clean and warm work environment. Excellent canteen. Good training and health and safety standards."
good,Very nice warehouse always was cleaned and not too cluttered and employees weren't mean to me or gave me too much drama but overall drama free and they had all types of ethnicities working for them.
good,very tough work to place but overall i did enjoy the walking because it was good fitness. very strict on break times and your idle time. i didnt like the food in the canteen plus the price on food expected better quality.
good,good opportunity to have a good paid job for this city.the management is good but the co-workers are not.the hardest part of the job is the log shift of 10 hours.i learn to touch my limits
good,Amazon is a good place to work if you don't mind working in groups. Plenty of work to go around not always enough people. The best part of the job was the amount of breaks you received due to the physical aspect of the job.
good,This is a great job with good attitude and a lot of fun to be here. Never a dull day to be here with great attitude from the staff.

good,Working at amazon is very fast pace. Putting out a lot of work within an hour is very important to amazon. They want too make sure their customers get their things on time.
good,"Job requires you to be on your feet about 9 1/2 hours of the 10 hr work day. Very short breaks. Benefits are good, if you are full time There are many different departments you can work in at the warehouse."
good,"It was a good work experience, it helped me to develop my language speaking, to work with a team, i learned how a wearhouse work, it was a good experience"
good,"A typical day at work was very busy and crazy. Lots of moving around all the time. What i learned is how to work well in a wearhouse, and how to work alone for most of the time."
good,I was an inbound associate. I was also an outbound associate and worked security as well. It was a fun place to work. Could be stressful at times but they helped manage it very well. Peak was very successful.
good,"fast pace, constant movement,"
good,L'ambiance général était bonne mais dommage que les managers se coupaient des autres salariés
good,"A typical day involves starting your shift by clocking in, followed by a team briefing where you find out what is needed for the day, After that you collect your equipment and begin your work until instructed and moved onto other tasks or the shift ends."
good,Job is great management not so good lots of safety issues  management is constantly writing people up that are actually working they do nothing to help with any barriers
good,"You are promised advancement, and it rarely comes.  I liked my team mates and helped the manager out often with providing new employees the information to help them succeed in the job.  I took triple the clients in the same amount of time with positive feedback.  I knew how to get the job done while listening to the customer.  Got switched to a new team with a new manager, and she didn't like that I knew more than her, and helped the team mates in distress.  She fired me after digging (she had to dig deep) and caught me on one technicality of a customer not saying "".com"""

Different locations order are properly organised and loaded in appropriate way for the right shipment. Also need to make sure the new hires are properly trained and provide consulting if any needed."
good,"many of the tasks i did were based on individual performance. with some effort things get done efficiently and after a while effortlessly, pay close attention to how you handle the merchandise"
good,I started working at Amazon about 2 weeks ago. Its very organized and the productivity there is always I improving. I would like TT o convert but I want to work somewhere full time.
good,It is a great place to work but if u have a family amazon doesnt seem to care. I worked 5 twelve hour nights.  Managers are awesome. Big turnover. Awesome benefits
good,This job offers lots of cross training opportunities a great benefits package and a fast-paced work environment the other associates a very friendly. The supervisors are very knowledgeable the area managers are clueless the HR department is extremely helpful and understanding and there's a lot of opportunity if you're willing to relocate.
good,As a packer my job is to box items customers order online. With doing so moving very quickly to get the orders out as soon as possible.
good,Very punctual atmosphere in respect to performance and availability. Every employee is required to uphold their task at a respectable rate to keep the warehouse efficient. Flexibility for schedule is available after an earned seniority.
good,"it's an ok place to work, with great benefits, energetic, upbeat lively environment. Very generous with time off. Standing up all day on concrete is the hardest part especially for me , I just gave birth 4 months ago. There are breastfeeding rooms."
good,"É uma empresa que funciona sob pressão, os funcionários precisam sempre está exigindo seus direitos pois a mesma falta com muitos benefícios."
good,"I believe Amazon is the future of shopping, and the convenience is oh so great! I their motto is definitely the customers choice but employee top care."
good,"Great job if you need money, but if you are going to school its extremely hard to balance both. They only down side is time off task, and if you are a stower it really sucks because you can't get past a picker, and picking behind another pickers is awful. Be prepared to deal with some rude coworkers. Not a job for sensitive people. But overall its a great job. Management it great and willing to work with you and help you grow. Just wasn't meant for me is all."
good,"Buena empresa, es un trabajo dificil pues el cliente siempre es un reto, pero en general gusta"
good,"Amazon is a high demand environment at every step of the way. It is easy to ignore the fact that you are an individual until you realize that you have no self left. However, it does provide great benefits and provides a comfortable living environment."
good,"Working 10, 11, 12 hours a day is tough but paid well for a teenager. However that was also my greatest problem with the job was the hours. Not the most enjoyable work, very physical and quite tedious after some time."
good,"Heavy lifting hard day at work. 10 hr shifts with plenty of overtime 4 days a week. I learned a lot working at the facility computer skills, upc reading, sku lookups and much more. Management was amazing. Great happy outgoing group that made the job much easier. Co-workers were phenomenal. Great and fun to get along with and lots of after work fun. The hardest part of my job was 10 hour shifts lifting 30+ lbs. boxes everyday. Most enjoyable part of the job was the environment and teammates along with the people and management make it very exciting to see what happens the next day."
good,"Environnement agréable"
good,A typical work day involved each person being assign to a team which was responsible for removing boxing from a moving belt and building six feet pallets.
good,Very good condition for working here. Most enjoyable thing is that there is always a team and u don't have to worry all time
good,"Amazon can be a great place to work, they are understanding if you have a family to care for. They do many events for the employees to make things fun,but if you are a seasonal employee your chances of being hired on permanently can be very slim. with the good , and the bad it's still a good place to work."
good,"This is a great place to work unless you have an injury. They have so many different types of paperwork for you to keep filling out, taking papers to the doctor to be filled out. Some doctors charge a fee to fill out the paper work. Then being out you cannot keep paying out to get the work filled out you will eventually start to look for another job."
good,"wonderful place to work at good salary and multi cultural environment. wonderful co workers , from different countries. Great management which is concerned about the associates."
good,"While the job is not hard, workers must be flexible with doing simple tasks up to 10-12 hours. The management is not great. Depending on your position, you may be stuck working by yourself every day."
good,I eventually liked the company a lot but was let go because it was a seasonal job I was hired for. this job stays on a fast pace which I like. I just wish the breaks were longer.
good,Les échanges avec les autres salariés étaient récurrentes ce qui fait qu'on s'y plait beaucoup et on ne s'ennuie pas tellement.
good,Amazon is a wonderful company to work for. You can move up in the company.The managers are unorganized and sometimes not available when you need them. The management team as a whole is very unprofessional.
good,during the peak season ( Oct- Jan) it is very intense. work overload. there are a lot of hours to work during this time. a lot of standing and lifting.
good,"Prepared for customer inquiries by studying products, services, and customer service processes."
good,i want to join in a good package in good company amazon is a good company but i want to change my company because of + salary so i am looking a good job
good,"Good company.. Great Culture.. "
good,"A typical day working at Amazon is filled with success, excitement, adversity, and fulfillment. As a Process Guide/Process Assistant I am responsible with assisting pack associates with their problem solving issues, assisting in meeting their rates according to a metric system, and informing them of any changes or adjustments implemented by the standing Area manager. I learned how to effectively communicate with associates, team leads, and other personnel. I learned how to support others and help them effectively navigate through adverse situations. Management is effective in that they delegate assignments effectively and they often help problem solving issues related to the job. The hardest part of the job is just maintaining your energy and focus throughout a typical shift in order to achieve department goals. The most enjoyable and exciting part of the job is achieving departmental goals as a unit."
good,"Overall a great transitional job, but not a secure job, you are always replaceable in their eyes. Hard work is not recognized enough and slackers are allowed to cheat the system with little to no punishment."
good,"4-5hrs a day scanning packages, stacking on a pallets,  wrapping them down or open or closing pallets. I learned how to work a pallet jack, water spider, and a scanner, management is okay, its like high school with the co- workers. Hardest part of the job was working on the source slide, you are basically receiving all the packages and jiffies, big and small down a slide and throwing them down the correct slide according to letter, enjoyable part getting paid $10.25 and hr on a part time job"
good,"A typical day at Amazon begins at 730 in the morning where all associates gather for stand-up to find out the latest news and updates  and to find out where we will working that day. Since being at Amazon I have learned how to perform certain tasks in ICQA, Inbound, and the learning departments as well as what Amazon considers being safe.Management at times doesn't seem to connect with the associates, but are more interested in the numbers we produce. They do not seem to care that we are obeying all the rules and collecting the right product for the customer-just numbers. My co-workers are awesome by every definition. they work hard consistently, always have a n upbeat attitude, and in general, are just very nice people to have as friends. The hardest part of the job is actually driving to work because I live 45 miles from where i work so that is a ninety mile round trip, but the most enjoyable part of the job I have already mentioned which was working with my friends because as I said before they are in one word-AWESOME!!!!"
good,"A fast pace, highly structured company. Offers a wide range of positions and departments. Management can make or break your level of success and satisfaction while you're employed there. Great opportunity to broaden your skill set and learn the ropes of a corporate company that focuses on customer service."
good,You just walk in and get hired if you bring your license. That doesn't say much about the caliber of the associates on the floor. The supervisors tend to be lazy and the management seems a little too far removed to notice. You are encouraged to apply for jobs at other facilities if you want to move up.
good,"typical day at work - picking and packing"
good,"The work wasn't to hard and they paid you well, but the management and job security wasn't too good.  I was a seasonal worker at Amazon, but in my time being there I was able to see that it was all about favoritism"
good,"Amazon was very nice to work at, however, the hours were ridiculous as it is a 24 hour contact centre"
good,"shipping department is a very busy job, packing on an hourly basis at a rate of 180 units and shipping out a volume of 1800 units per day. very nice co-workers and managers.Everyone is really nice and treats you with respect."
good,On a typical day I would be very busy. I learned how to pick items in a certain amount of time. The manger was friendly. My co-workers were the same also.
good,"I loved it. I loved it. I loved it . the benefits were outstanding , I just wish theyd let you pick your days.the jobs are easy and it is very easy to move up in the company."
good,the people that work there are easy to get along with but the days are long. the pay at amazon is pretty decent too. but the management chooses favorites to get promotions.
good,The day starts with a team meeting and some stretches which are highly recommended. I've learned how to track and place the boxes on different pallets for delivery. The management team is very knowledgeable and helpful.My co-workers help out when needed or if someone is new and struggling.The job isn't hard at all. I love the free exercise that comes with this job.
good,"Amazon inc (EUK5) is well organised, procedures and processes are well in order,knowwledge is repeatedly and easilly accessable, it is  friendly busy and some times fun work place. Which offen helps with the hard target aspect of the job."
good,"You get to work with a ton of people in a very large warehouse, and depending on your job position you might even have to walk multiple stairs to reach to the floor where your job is assigned. Most co-workers are friendly and easy to get along with which helps a lot trying to get through the long day of work."
good,Integrity staffing works very fast in helping you find a job. Its the best job in the world but if you need something fast this is the company to apply too.
good,"Working at Amazon was a great experience for me.  It extended my Customer Service Skills and taught me how to work with emotionally unstable customers."
good,Very faced paced enviroment which i love because it makes time go by fast. At this job during peak season you will work with all different ages groups and ethics. I learned a lot from this job and the people that worked there. Getting to work is a hassele due to where the facility is located and the amount of people that they hire during peak season. My scheduled time to satrt work would be 6pm but i would have to leave my house  two and a half hours early just to get to work on time and my house was only 15min away from the job.Managment when working during peak season for the temp agency can sometimes come off a bit rude. Other then that I had a great time working here and I also won alot of gifts for best performace and highest speed.
good,"Great Job Overall. Employees are hardworking people that got the job done and met the requirements everyday."
good,Fun filled job with many opportunities to learn another part of the job or better yourself in the current position.  The employees here were a group of good people with a few bad apples.  The enjoyable part about this place is they made it easy for the employee to learn and listen to music while working.
good,"I've worked here for three years, very easy job, but very demanding. If you think your going to make good money and not have to work for it this is not the job for you."
good,i have a lot of learning being a amazon researcher because of it i now how difficult to work as a amazon researcher but its ok i have  lot of learning to work with it.The most enjoyable with this work when you and your team conneted with other.
good,Amazon is a very diverse place to work. The enviroment is fast paced and management allows minimum growth within the company. Amazon alone has very good benefits.
good,"Great experience."
good,"The day starts too early and ends, slowly. Working with the wrong people can really make the day seem like its dragging too long."
good,Amazon is a good place to work for me. The schedule is flexible and the training as well as development is helpful. A typical day involves solving customer issues and working with my team to ensure Amazon meets customer needs. The hardest part of the job is meeting somewhat unrealistic but achievable goals.
good,Amazon is a great place to work for IT. We are treated with some respect to a degree but as all places favorites pop up and you got to be quick. Taking things to a new level and taking ownership is a big key to many of Amazon's beliefs.
good,"loading-unloading the truck"
good,working at amazon is pretty normal some days if they need you in other areas of the building and you've been trained they will send you there to work. its gets pretty hot because you're always moving. making rate is pretty easy. the people that work their are pretty nice. will help you with anything. the hardest part is standing up for 10 hour straight. but i did enjoy learning new areas and having the highest rate you could leave early or when it was no work getting off early.
good,"this work placement was a good choice for gaining experience and money in the bank, it wasn't something i wanted to commit myself to as it wasn't really my settle down job."
good,Its a good organisation but i was into the roll of third party. work culture is very good and with all benefits.And there is a good transportation too.
good,"The work environment is excellent - laid-back, friendly, fun, supportive. However, the attendance policy is ridiculous for the Seller Support position. And so far, they're not very accommodating of medical conditions if you've worked there for less than a year."
good,My workday begins with me getting there 15-20 minutes early. I go to the morning meeting and then go to my work station. I check my emails and notes from the day before. I get along with all of my coworkers and managers. I like to learn at work. The more you learn the higher up you can go in a company. I think the most enjoyable part of my job is getting as much work finished as I can while doing it proficiently. I like working with people. The only challenge I find everyday is clock watching. I feel like the busier you are all day rhe faster time goes.
good,"35h/semaine travailler du lundi au vendredi en équipe 3-8."
good,Great place to work the managers are involved a lot and they provide good benefits. My co workers was good people. The only thing is that if you are an full time college student you would find it hard because they have long work hours and you have to try and mix that in with school.
good,While working at Fashion Bug I enjoyed the fashion part of it. I enjoyed interacting with the customers and helping them find the right items to express themselves. I loved my manager and co-workers but the pay was not that great.
good,"it was a cool job, long hours, fun people to be around and very good money. I learned hard work pays off and nothing good ever comes easy."
good,"Process customer returns, I learned how to keep a good pace and be productive at the same time. Management wasn't horrible but could've been better. Co-workers are usually nice and easy to get along with. Moving around to do different roles within the company. I love the shifts."
good,Amazon is a great place to work with lots of opportunities to learn. The company encourages employees to experiment and learn on a day to day basis.
good,the hardest part of my jobs the physical work for 10 hours and meeting the required goals each quarter of the shift but I enjoy working with my coworkers and being able to talk while working. The management and the required goals is what has caused me to look for another job.
good,The company as a whole is average to work for.  With the 4 day weeks there is plenty of time to find another part-time job to supplement your income. There is a lot of walking involved. They also encourage training in different departments and advancement.
good,"Amazon offers lots of opportunities but also is very demanding place. Those who are career focused, passionate about learning new things, and think outside of the box, amazon is the right place to start."
good,"I like working at Amazon but it is a numbers game.  You must keep your rate up and produce.  I don't mind that but they have unrealistic goals for people.  You work with minimal air conditioning and it is very hot.  There is a diverse group of people working at Amazon.  I have learned about a few different cultures.  Typical work day is 10 hours sometimes 11 hour days 4-5 days a week.  There is a very high turnover rate at Amazon.  You don't produce, you are gone.  I feel they should invest time in training the people they have instead of constantly hiring."
good,I love working for Amazon. I was hired as seasonal and have not been offered a conversion. If I was a permanent employee I would give them 4 stars for their benefit package and ability to advance within the company. Starting pay is minimum but a great place to get your feet wet and gain experience if new to the world of customer service in the retail environment.
good,"Amazon offers really good benefits and compensation. The pay is definitely good for fresh graduates. Though, there is no free lunch in this world. With that good pay, it comes with great responsibilities. For Area Manager, you basically have to walk around the fulfillment centers all day long. Keep giving rates to associates and listen to their barriers and how to fix it. This job requires both physical and communication skills. I ran night shift so it's especially hard for my body. I feel like my bio clock is all a mess right now. Stressful job because you have to meet % to plan every day. If not, you have to bridge your barriers in your end of shift report. People skill is very vital as well. That's why you have to work with your associates on floor together. Otherwise, it is very easy to lose their respect on you as a manager."
good,The job is fun something new everyday lots to learn no one day is alike. It needs more mature people at the management positions.
good,"This job has been a great experience, depending on what location you are at. I had a great experience working in Ruskin,FL the leadership team was great! Always working with you to achieve your goals."
good,"Sorting out products that should be required to pack, and pack those products in the boxes. It requires patience and concentration, also fast pace."
good,"Typical day on the job included;"
good,"I really enjoyed my job. I was able to meet new people and learn different things. I learned how to work the DORA, which is the machine that we use to scan the packages."
good,It is fun to work at amazon. You get to work along with a bunch of smart and intelligent group of people. looking forward to work in an organization which has similar kind of environment.
good,"My co-workers are great.  My immediate bosses are good to work with.  Upper management is not focused on the employees, only on numbers that will produce bonuses.  Safety is a buzz word that is not properly enforced.  The most difficult aspect is dealing with the lack of a mental challenge, very boring job.  Most enjoyable, the people I work with."
good,I love the company.  Management is alright however some of the managers do not communicate well with each other and their associates. The hardest part of the job is standing on your feet for 10 to 11 hours a day but you get used to it after a while. I do enjoy the fact that I am responsible in providing a great customer service experience by putting together orders that were made online. The major thing I have learned from this job is that good team work is important in the success of the company.
good,Working at Amazon is a crazy day that is never the same. I have learned the job of receiving clerk and have gained forklift experience.
good,"Advance very quick. Had to deal with too many different personalities that weren't collaborating with others."
good,Amazon is a good company to work for. They offer benefits to their full time employees and compensation if needed. Work ten hour shifts so you work 4 days on and 3 days off.
good,"The Job is near by home. Majority are very friendly people to work with. The managements are nice and caring. The working atmosphere is nice. However, inside the warehouse, the air can get very warm and muggy."
good,A typical day at work is working from you get on the clock till you clock out.Whats I've learn is that there is always work to do. Management was great to work with.My co workers always keep the job exciting.The hardest part was not enough hours. The most enjoyable part was coimg in to work.
good,"I learned how to push myself to new levels of efficiency, speed and accuracy. Working at Amazon is a challenging yet satisfying place to work. Every manager there is willing to help you improve your skills in a kind and courteous manner,"
good,"It is a good job but health and saftey standards need to be checked as there was a lack of health and saftey there, management there was good as they did help you when help was needed."
good,"Bei AMAZON, Ich war zufrieden am 2014,aber an 2015 sind sehr streng geworden und leider Ich habe eine Managerin bei verpacken das hat keine gute Ausbildung und kann nicht so gut mit dem Menschen umgehen. Außerdem die Gruppe Leiter haben uns druck gemacht wegen menge von Packeten  pro Stunde ,wenn wir nie eine Vertrag unterschrieben haben das ist gestanden das mussten Acord Arbeit sein....die wolten das wir Tempo machen. Aber war eigentlich freundlich die verhaltung von die Männer . Es ist nicht so gut organisiert wo Ich war. Aber von andere Kollegin Ich habe gehört das die andere waren super Nett. Die Kollegen waren super,Multikulti"
good,"High level of individual effort required."
good,"You begin your shift by clocking into the electronic scanner with your Amazon ID Badge. Soon after, you meet your coworkers and manager before starting at your needed positions. The hardest part of my job was Peak season when everyone was required to work 11 hour shifts with only two fifteen minute breaks and one thirty minute break. The most enjoyable part of my job was that I was left to complete each of my goals independently."
good,"Shifts are 4 hours long but can be flexed down or up according to business needs. Most people at work are cool including management. We have free gatorade, an arcade machine (pacman & galaga) flat screen tvs, vending machines, microwaves and two breakrooms. sadly, our breaks are 15 mins in total but we actually only get to use 10 mins to ourselves and there are no full-time positions until you advance to management."
good,"fun place to work for. you will get all the hours that you desire, not enough room for advancement.you have to oppertunity to cross train in a bunch of other departments."
good,"A lot of standing but the company is good, fun people, helping, team work, incentives are provided so you know your hard work is not going unnoticed."
good,"Exciting place to work, due to fast growth plenty of opportunity for learning and professional development. Strong company culture, high performance environment."
good,"enjoyable place to work,good work hours,good pay,good leadership I work under the smx temps and they along with amazon made working here enjoyable"
good,"A typical day at work was picking orders for customers.I learned to keep up with the paced.My manager gave me constructive criticism,positive feedback on my achievements.My co-workers were very helpful and encouraging.The hardest part of my job was keeping with rate and standing on my feet for 10 hours.My most enjoyable part of my job was meeting new people working in a positive environment."
good,"The Schedule were split in weeks and we had to change every weeks and work on the morning or this afternoon. from the 5.45 am to 12.30 pm and from 12.45 pm to 7.30 pm, We were doing Picking and Packing, which is a very physical and demanding activity but everything is made to help you to improve you experience and get faster."
good,"This job is not for someone who does not want to work and yes it can be very stressful, overwhelming, yet very rewarding. Everyday if different and you encounter numerous challenges, you always have the help of management to overcome the challenges. Moving up in the company is an opportunity that is given to everyone you just have to want it and be wiling to sacrifice time to do so. Over all the job is amazing for me, the distance is just taking its toll on my family."
good,I've learned a lot working at amazon.  i believe amazon is a good job to start off with to get some experience.  The job seem fairly easy as long as your doing what your supposed to do
good,This company tries to keep work fun and is more of a relaxed place to work and I recommend it.The pay is a bit lower than other call centers.
good,"Making progress report,provide back up,transmision task end finding solutions.Nice management.Profesional end helpfull staf."
good,Typical day in my department come in at start shift due staffing.. when the shift begins make sure every station is filled and make sure orders get out on time
good,My review on this is very beneficial and good pay co-workers was good I learned to stowe items to their bins for pickers to come by and take the items to then give it to the packers
good,"not bad time goes by fast kind if felt like high school very bug on safety and the days are very longmbfmj ygkl "
good,"Horaire d’équipe matin ou soir"
good,"12 hour work day"
good,"great place to grow good benefits, great co workers great management . if your looking for growth within a company this it ."
good,Learned how to handle team in critical times and to educate the team with their misses with the customer feedback. Provides opportunity to work with customers and stakeholders directly. Colleagues are work friendly.Management is reachable at any time. Hardest part is to remember the people who are joining daily as the company grows day by day.I will be busy for the entire day with my works since everyday there will new learning and that is the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,"Co-workers are great there, everybody is friendly. The hardest part of the job was the floor to walk on daily. Job was enjoyable"
good,Productive fun work place. every one is great. You gets lots of physical excercise and at the same time you learn and grow in the company.
good,Amazon was a great place to work.  The people were nice and you knew going in what had to be done and what was expected of you.
good,"The day starts travelling to Normanton, we line up in a queue for just an hour max, if there is no delay. Once in the warehouse we organise our parcels in numeric order, then load into our vans, pick up your equipment and on the road we go..."
good,"Huge company with many locations world wide, some the management is very supportive its a very high pace work. Great co-workers, hardest part of the job in my case is being stuck in a position that is holding me back and I have clearly showed that I belong in higher role."
good,I loved working at Amazon until they removed the day shift hours. Half of the employees had to quit due to the shift change.
good,"6 am starts 12 hour shifts, 6/7 days to cover Christmas and holiday periods, downside I could travel to Doncaster for 6 am and be sent home at 10 am if no work in factory. Diversity brilliant a great mix of internationals on the work force and on the management."
good,"Amazon is all about the numbers and getting things done their way, if you have a different view than the management you can voice it but nothing changes."
good,It does have some good and bad times. It has good basics but they sometime fall short. Great potential just need the correct motivations. There is a lot of favoritism and little job development with no real room for growth.
good,Amazon is a fun place to work. Manangment is friendly wages are ok with lots of opportunity for overtime and they have employee giveaways and prizes
good,"Very fast paced "
good,"I joined Amazon for a three month assignment and it has been a great role because there are great people to work with, processes that are easy to understand and able to adapt smoothly."
good,I would say working at amazon was pretty cool considering the great benefits you receive while working there. The only downfall I have to say is dealing with certain managers and there lack of knowledge and personal interacting skills. I feel I should not be intimidated while at work by my upper management as well as some of my colleagues. Maybe the hiring process should be improved. Other than that my over all rating would be Average and could use improvement.
good,A typical day at Amazon Warehouse was very strict. Honestly I did not learn anything. Management was serious. When I worked at Amazon I did not come to me friends I was going to make my money and thats what i enjoyed most was receiving my paycheck.
good,"decent job, wage is decent. But... the agency lies to you day 1, they say you're only required to work overtime only 1 week, once you've done your first week with overtime, they keep giving you overtime until you get paid off, and if your using the bus the agency put on, the extra 20 hours overtime you do one week it hardly adds up cause it all nearly gets taken off for the bus, so overtime isn't worth it."
good,"I was hired on through SMX, a temp agency. Overall, I loved the job. The only thing is I wasn't able to make rate in stow. I have even had managers, who followed me around and watched as I did my job, tell me I did nothing wrong. It's problems that are out of my control that cause me to not make rate. I got fired. 2 days after I started the conversion process. If you get hired on for stowing, be careful and make sure you make rate. I'd say telling your managers all the issues you come across would help, but obviously not. I wss told that I did extremely well in every other department they had me work in. But obviously that doesn't matter."
good,"You go through security and clock in, making sure not to take any personal items, like a cell phone or a recording device, along with you or you will have security issues coming back out. Then, there is a ""stand up"" meeting, where your supervisor takes questions, and relays daily information, and important changes. After a quick optional stretch, you start your day in whatever department your in. Depending on how many departments you are trained in you could be sent anywhere throughout the day. You clock out for lunch and at the end of the day."
good,"You typically work 10 hour shift with non-stop working with the exception of two 10 minute breaks and one 30 minute lunch. You stretch everyday before starting your shift and after lunch. Lots of walking, bending, twisting and lifting. They will hire anyone. I learned about working in a warehouse environment and the rest is just physical labor. The hardest part was working 3rd shift. The manager I worked with and his team was awesome!"
good,"The typical day included meetings with my team and my peers team to review project updates and proposals for new initiatives. Among the many teachings, I learned how to develop a financial model for forecasting and to write a clear and concise six page proposal for a business plan, "
good,"Many policies prevented actual effectiveness in close-call situations. It seemed to me that these policies almost promoted time being wasted. Disorganization concerning equipment was also a concern to productivity. A practice of promoting new mgmt positions into fields where they had no experience also seemed questionable."
good,Awesome work culture. One can actually get time for personal and professional lives. Lot to learn with great minds around. A must work place.
good,"I do enjoy the people here, and have made many good friends and met many great coworkers. However, the general impression from management and from the company as a whole is that the well-being of the actual employees is a low priority."
good,Dynamc company that is growing relentlessly. Everyday you get to work on something new that the company has never done before. Its a great place to launch a career.
good,"There is not a moment, where your not busy. The work is not hard but there is a lot to do, The people that you work with are always up beat and positive. its a good environment for those who like to stay busy."
good,"Working at Amazon was pretty decent at first, until I realized I basically had to speed-walk all around the warehouse for approximately 10 hours in order to pick my items on time. I somehow received my final warning, although I was never informed about any other prior warnings or how to resolve any issues. The shifts are 10 hours for four consecutive days which didn't allow me to have a full night's rest and  doing whatever I wanted on my leisure time."
good,"Amazon was an amazing place to work. The toughest part was definitely positively positioning bad news to customers. But other than that, the co workers were knowledgeable & friendly. The managers & leadership were SPLENDID. Every day was awesome because we constantly received snacks, that was awesome."
good,"The three minutes walking time to your breaks wasn't long enough."
good,"hard and fun to be be there with all new and different people high food and shot breaks very hot, "
good,Processing at amazon was a very dull job.  You are required to do the same job every 2-4 mins.  The job can get challenging if they have a competition on who can process the most work.  But i like a job that i would be doing many different task.  i like to think and problem solve.
good,everyday is the same thing and it does become a burden the only way to make good money is to get as many full time hours as possible and you are working 16 hour days which is not bad at all  but it does take a toll after a while especially if you have another job at the time.
good,"Amazons a great company to work for, I would start my shift early set up roster and where each person is assigned to. Hand out rates and productivity goals. had also trained opps the direct hired opps management in tasks."
good,This is a great place work.  Must be very comfortable with constant change.  The biggest issues that there is little opportunity for advancement.
good,"Amazon is my first company where i have been experienced 3 years where i learned about amazon business operations which enhanced my knowledge , no pressure,no work load, fun loving work place."
good,Amazon has been an amazing learning environment while I finished by graduate degree.  The typical schedule contains only four days a week (10 hrs each).  I enjoyed routinely having three day weekends to work on my studies.
good,"It was a decent line of work and the HR took the time with employees for any issues. Overall, it was okay. Co workers were okay, work was okay, I just didn't like how I couldn't adjust my schedule for any education until 6 months in."
good,"I will rate my employment with Amazon a seven out of ten, due to the fact that I had the opportunity to advance, but without compensation."
good,Very diverse work place. Fast paced and always moving. a very welcoming environment. Work hours go by very quick. Avery well recommended place.
good,"Maintenance department good place to work. "
good,Great place to work with good benefits but of you are not flexible this is not the place for you to be. Other than that its perfectly fine
good,Productive company with lots of open possibilities to achieve amazon goals every week. Chances of winning  seasonal prizes. Works with school schedule. Always willing to retrain associates falling behind company standards. Always a set goal daily.
good,"It was a good experience.  "
good,"It is the place where the tag line of the company is aptly suited WORK HARD HAVE FUN MAKE HISTORY. You have to put your efforts to earn more, Good place for beginners."
good,"Worked 10 hr days, 4 days a week. In October we were doing 10 hr days 5 days a week, then could be set at 60 hr weeks, depending on the time of year."
good,"I'm not going to lie to you; this job is not for the faint of heart. The work is hard on the body: your feet are going to hurt, your back is going hurt at the end of the week even if you follow health and safety protocol and you will likely develop a severe hatred for anything related to Disney's Frozen (well, I did anyway). A typical week is 40 hours long although I was working during the 'Peak' period at Christmas, so I was working 55 hours a week instead. Overtime pay is great: for the first ten hours your pay goes up to 1.5x of normal hours and anything over doubles your hourly pay. The management are brilliant: you can have a good laugh whenever there is an time to do so and they are incredibly helpful. You will likely end up making friends with your co-workers, but you will likely see them move on as they're contracts end."
good,"management organisé et optimal"
good,"Its been 9 years i have been working one basic thing i learned at work and would share it with you all, give it the best to your work and i am pretty sure work pay off for good :)"
good,I have worked for the company for 2 years and have advanced quite quickly but at the same time there are many rules and policies in place that keep this job from being secure and your employment can be up in the air from month to month even as a seasoned veteran and this is currently reflected in a the high turnover rate of 56% attrition year over year.
good,"This is a great job for people who like to work hard and move around a lot. There are many good people who work there, but its very hard to move up past Tier I"
good,"Amazon takes care of their employees as far as benefits, pay and schedule as well as many other perks! However, advancing in the company is very difficult and once you are doing a job, that's where you will be. No changing!"
good,Amazon is good opportunity to make good money through long hours of hard labor. Fulfillment Employees Receive better benefits than temporary workers but the chances of direct higher are very fair compared to many other temporary positions.
good,worked and over night job so it was a difficult thing to do. Yet had approved paid time off. Management is good too and its a well organized work space
good,Amazon is a place to mixed with different origin people & work as team is most important massage if anyone really want to work here.
good,This job is wonderful as long as you are physically fit as it does require you to be in your feet all day. Even physically fit individuals have some problems with body pains on a daily basis. Otherwise I love it here.
good,Management was horrible!!!! If you didn't kiss butt them you got treated any kind of way. Only the suck ups got treated good. I loved my coworkers though but the pay wasn't worth the stuff that you have to deal with.
good,"well since i was working there for pick time its hard to tell about a typical day, for me each day was different,lots of new people and lots of stuff we had to deal with, summary would be each day coming to work without knowing what is going to happen, but at the same time, doing the same thing every single day. I perfectly learned how to work under the pressure. Co workers were supportive and easy to work with. the hardest thing was not knowing what to expect from each day. the most enjoyable was waiting for all the celebrations, coming together and enjoying the time that we had together."
good,Well never a dull moment.What I learned is patience is a virtue. as for management well it was a big big turnover  with that .coworkers made lots of friends.The hardest part of job was when machines broke down then your rate drops then you get yelled at .we tried to make everyday fun no matter what the day brought everyday was different.You never knew from one quarter of the day to the next what  you would be doing.kind of exciting always something different.we did exercise every morning before starting and after lunch every day.
good,"Great place to work, people were friendly and helpful.  Was able to work at a steady pace.  The hours were long, and getting up at 4:30 was difficult, but working there was a great experience.  I was hoping to get hired on either full or part time."
good,"I enjoyed my time there.  We had long hours, but it was a fun and engaging environment.  I was able to have experiences in three different processes both in intake and outgoing capacities.  The attendance policy is easy to understand and quite fair, and the work environment is a climate controlled warehouse."
good,going to work you never know where you will be or what you will be doing . it sometimes is a guessing game and it is very enjoyable at tim es and sometimes you have fun with all the people that work here laugh joke and have fun. but miost of the time it is very serious place making sure the customers get there product that they order
good,"Everyday at work I would count stock at a reasonbly quick pace ready for shipment, I learned to count stock accuratly and quicker than I thought possible, the managment were kind and willing to help if I had any problems, as did my co-workers. "
good,Benefits were good. Long work hours standing 10hrs for the shift. The  job was fun not very harsh. Management was pretty decent.
good,I would just make sure the item and the of numbers product was right.
good,"Worked there for 4 years, fun if you get on a good team. Others can work you to the bone."
good,"operated an order picker"
good,Le site de logistique Amazon et une bonne entreprise dans la-quels les employés sont très bien traité contrairement au rumeurs qui ont pu être raconter
good,A day at work is were I would pack orders for ten hours. The hardest part was having to stand up for ten hours. The management was very confusing because you never really knew who was in charge. The short breaks that they give us that lasted only fifteen minutes and that included walking to and from the break area.
good,"typical day at work includes picking and packing orders from costumers and then sending them off, I could say that I've learnt in a large team rather than a small team it is arguably agreed that the hardest part of the jobs has to be standing for long hours but the easiest and the most enjoyable is getting the job done!"
good,"good place to work and great work environment, company standers and the culture is good. learning wise the scope is little less if compare with other companies but realistic and practice mission oriented."
good,For the most part it was a great place to work. It was a safe place to work.
good,"Stowing products on shelves."
good,"Fast paced, everybody worked job to get their jobs done. "
good,typical day would be filled with assignments to finish. learning everyday with assignments is the fun part. management is new and understanding. a great place to work ..hardest part being the fast shift changes. else all is good
good,my priorities are : to balance and control the flow of my shift. i am responsible for staffing and labor moves to ensure the perfect balance in order to run a smooth shift. and also maximize productivity. i have learned that i am in control of MY OWN success and growth. my management is ok. i enjoy engaging with my associates to give them that extra push and energy in the workplace. the most enjoyable part of my job are the associates. and waking up and doing everything all over again.
good,"Very busy, very hot and loud and can be calm and times, The managers there at times weren't really knowledgeable about certain thing we needed done within the warehouse."
good,The job good place to work over all. I learn a lot people good to work with the work as a team. the worst was walking everywhere. most enjoyable was we did different work load.
good,"I worked from 2 pm to 10 pm, everyday except the weekend. I had to manage the packaging of different articles."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the opportunity to be involved in fast-paced change.  If something doesn't work there isn't a lot of red tape to get through to implement change.  Working with Associates is also a great part of the job."
good,This role allows a lot of room for both personal and professional development. Stepping into the role allowed me to build on skills I never experienced before and I work in line with Amazon's Leadership Principles.
good,Huge employer world wide so often follow ups got lost in the system which resulted in increasingly frustrated customers.
good,"Typical day of work: Many hours of reporting and lots of event overview and brand management."
good,The people at Amazon are great. Make sure that you ask your recruiter a lot of questions around your compensation targets for the next couple of years and the career opportunities for the role. The job varies so much from person to person based on company needs. If you are a hard worker and a top employee you will be worked HARD.
good,"Amazon is a great place to work and I always proud to be part of such a wonderful organization. Happy to be part of the ""Earths Customer Centric Company."" I love the concept of ""Always Day One at Amazon."" Its policies and work culture inspired me so much. "
good,I sold consumer electronics from my home and this allowed me to go to college and be a stay at home father to two children
good,"Taking dual chats on a daily basis retail as well as kindle"
good,enjoyed the time i worked there . i stopped working there because of lack of hours and management staff was pretty rude
good,"I am the only person in the department on my shift, I have had to learn how to manage my time and cultivate relationships. My manager is stationed at another location so I am the owner of this department. Also, there is no one else who comes in behind me at night so its a must that I stay current with my duties. I have to maintain my shift as well as set up the night shift operations in order for them to be successful. It has proven to be a challenge at times for me and with that I have been exposed to many experiences. Gaining the trust of the company, I have been selected to be sent out to other facilities as well as train multiple people to set their departments up for success. I have been working here for over 5 years and now I have come to the point in my life where it is time for growth. I have no regrets, & love working here."
good,"When i go into the building first i clock in and we have a meeting for all associates that are stowing called a ""Stand-Up"" We go over quality, success stories, if there is any overtime, safety issues, and safety reminders, we also go over where the work is on different floors of the building of the items that needs to be stowed. I learn things everyday as i go depends on what i am doing everyday. My management team is okay, they look out for their associates when they are in need of help or if there are any questions they always have ansers. The Co-workers are helpful, they work hard, always seen with good confidence and motivation thats another thing with our stand-up meetings they can motivate you on doing a good job everyday. In my opinion the hardest about my job is finding space to virtually stow an item. Eventually, looking for space wastes alot of time and brings your rate down, management are pretty strict about rates. The things i enjoy about this job are that some co-workers are nice to you and when you need help with anything they are always there to help. I also like that your getting all the exercise you need working here. The building is very big so there is alot of walking, lifting etc. Almost every job in this building works in a fast pace."
good,Long hours at work and plenty of overtime if needed. Plenty of walking if on the picking and help with finding items with the use off handheld scanners.
good,Every  Monday we have new joiners in Amazon we co ordinate with the new hires its lot of communication with new people i would like mostly.
good,I honestly loved working for Amazon. Everyone there really made me feel like i was part of there company. Hardest part of the job was walking so much and my knee couldn't handle it. I learned how to scan items and put them in bins. Management was awesome because they made sure employees were safe and made sure we were taken care of. I really enjoyed my job being able to walk and scan items that customers had purchased.
good,its a very enjoyable work place and co-worker are always helpful. we achieve everything here by team work.
good,"AWS is absolutely fantastic place to learn more about technology. It is slightly demanding and your work life balance may not be the greatest, but it rewards handsomely, esp if you are willing to adapt to new technologies fast."
good,"Very Poor Management"
good,big on safety fast paced workplace friendly co-workers most enjoyable part of the job was learning how to reorganize objects so that you could do the impossible management was great how they would help you immediately if an error occurred hardest part of the job was putting thousand of objects away every night accurately
good,Amazon is a great company to work for. The management team tried to motivate everyone to work hard and enjoy their job. I have learned how to work with many different personality types over the years that I have worked for Amazon.
good,"Job security, easy advancement. okay pay overall good place to work"
good,"It was a good place to work, but there wasn't a lot of opportunity for advancement."
good,Fulfillment center with vast areas to work within the facility. Training and experience prior to accepting assignments. Good interaction within the company and its employees to management.
good,This company allows for advancement along with training available. The company is new to this area with many transfers from Corporate and branch offices. The work ethic is a very positive one and allows for inter-actions.
good,"THe company is very frugal when it comes to expenditures, frugal in the wrong areas"
good,"There are a lot of good people that work here, For the first couple of weeks you're going to be sore from all the walking but you get used to it."
good,"Good work environment, co-workers make the job a fun place to work at. I make sure to get done as much as i can. I've learned to palatalize , how to use a scanner, etc. The hardest part of the job is the long shift. I like working the dock or working jackpot because it can be fast paced and i like to scan the boxes."
good,Very productive. Learn to pack orders. Management is awesome and coworkers are nice. the hardest part is continous  standing. The most enjoyable part of the job is when the D.j comes in and that makes the nights go by faster.
good,"Amazon has a good work environment. Jobs are simple, from picking to packing. My co-workers were very nice people who i got along with very well."
good,"Amazon Fulfillment requires their employees to be dedicated to the company. Company culture is always present and one must always be conscience of the attitude they portray in regards to Amazon principles. If one wishes to advance their career, they must be willing to travel and most likely relocated. Managers and co-workers are a mixed bag. Some are great to work with, they are competent and helpful. Others are not. The hardest part of the job is working off-hours (especially long night-shifts) and holidays."
good,"such fantastic to join a fast growing company , i learned lot in short period being hired in Amazon"
good,"Work in Amazon is more of fun and challenging."
good,it was fun working there. but not much growth in the company.
good,"This was a great job. I enjoyed it. I was sad to leave. If you came into Amazon as a (blue badge) Full time employee, you had it good. I advanced quickly. Becoming a problem solver and becoming one of the top problem solvers on Day shift. The environment is nice, and the management treats you with respect. The hardest part of the job is its fast paced, but its also the most enjoyable. It makes the day go by."
good,"There is lot of opportunity to grow. You will be thrilled to work with lot of Techies around you."
good,We can learn many new things and can explore our self globally  within the organization.
good,"During my time at Amazon.com I worked in a fast paced, high attention to detail atmosphere.  I worked cross functionally over many teams in order to achieve a high level of success.  Also, learned new software systems and became highly proficient in the MS office suite.  Supported one of the most confidential, high pressure, prestigious  organizations at Amazon.  Worked with a great supportive team."
good,Good job to do to start of with but not an life career job had to pick pack ship
good,"Amazon is a perfect example of a real-world that benefits from the application of Business Intelligence. Complex, challenging problems will face you every day, but your input will guide important, immediate and long-term global strategy. Great compensation and benefits, but the work-life balance expectations are a bit onerous. Typical commitment is 1-2 years per role."
good,"Ayant été employée dans une équipe d'aménagement, j'ai pu faire du move, de la stow, du picking, de l'étiquetage et de la manutention d'articles plus volumineux, notamment en utilisant un tire-palettes."
good,"I work at the moment in an environment which is based around, ""working hard, having and making history"". "
good,"I learned to be quick and on my feet, My co-workers were friendly and helpful. I learned alot about the factory the line."
good,In this line of work accuracy and production is very important. You have to be able to maintain a stable quota. It is a very social enviroment with co-workers. The perks are the best part of this job. The hardest part is being on your feet for hours at a time.
good,I liked it i wish it was full time. I would go in do a start up meeting go to my assembly line or truck depending on where i was put that day and begin to work intel the day was up.
good,There is no dress code at amazon which lacks in most of the companies.
good,"sem restricao contra empresa,, em dia com seu pagamento ..tudo dentro das ordens,, empresa boa para trabalhar,"
good,I enjoyed my time at amazon I got on with all members of staff and made a few friends along the way
good,"there was good friendly workers working together, also was quickly managed work and no tyred work. this work not boring and all the time not same. no monothony."
good,dia de trabalho passava bem e rápido tínhamos uma bom espírito de equipe
good,I learned how much to excepted in the job field. Management and the co-workers we're their when you needed them. The hardest part of the job is meeting the Qualification you needed to reach to work their. The enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and working with them.
good,Innovative workplace with challenging business problems. Work involves cross functional teams
good,"walking for 8 to 12 hours a day, I learned that people order strange stuff like the angry bird plush toy"
good,"a typical day at work meant walking around a big warehouse scanning bays for items ordered by customers, then taking those items to be packed at the other end of the warehouse."
good,Amazon has a great atmosphere and it has very laid backday to day culture. Management is usaually very friendly and approachable.
good,"As an Amazon vendor through the Northwest center I am responsible for checking in guest, distributing employee badges, handling crisis situations, and more."
good,"Working at Amazon was a different experience, I had to be there at 7:30 AM everyday. I learned how to communicate with others, the management was good and my co-workers were nice to me. The hardest part of the job for me it was that i did not got enough time during the break to get my lunch, but it was fun coming in to work every day with the people i worked!"
good,This was my first job in USA. I like the job very much. However this was a seasonal job so i couldn't work for more time. employees there are very friendly.They help you if u have any problem. Overall it was a great experience and i would like to work with amazon again.
good,A typical day at work begins with greeting each other followed by reviewing emails etc. The best part is when we enjoy potluck every alternative day.
good,"On a typical day I would open the store, get supplies prepared, and start cookers. I would take orders from customers, and do typical cashier duties. At closing time i would clean grills and tables, and close the shop."
good,Great fast pace work. attention to detail while working was good for me.
good,"The things i learned there was how to drive forklift ,reach truck, pallet jack and management was OK the hardest part of this job was driving forklift"
good,"I loved the time I spent while working at Amazon. The atmosphere of the work environment was great, the pay and hours were consistent, the managers and colleagues were always very friendly, and I loved doing my job. the only downfall was that they would over-hire when the season came around so once business started slowing down, the majority of people would lose jobs."
good,"It is fun working at Amazon. Over the period, I have learnt that the management gives more importance to grades rather than people. It has forgot the core values which helped Amazon reach its level today. The training is good, but enough care is not taken to see if it reaches the end person. Technical support is not good."
good,"Straighforward work process, fast-paced, decent amount of work, management had high amount of supervision, enjoyable learning experience and multi-purposed tasks and events within company."
good,I have learned how to maintain team work. The job is fairly easy and learning different functions is very essential to the job. I work with a great team of people.
good,The build was hot and you was alone the whole time you there. If you did see any coworkers you was not to speak to them do that you got a rate that's timing you while you there.
good,"If you love to spend lots of time developing software or fix legacy systems, it's a great place to work. People are energetic and deal with cutting edge technology. However, lots of churn -- software gets obsolete very quickly."
good,I had a great time working there. The only thing i had a problem was that i had no idea when i was going to get let go so it may of hurt my production a little bit. the fact that i was walking for about 15 miles a day so i wasn't sitting or standing around.
good,Typical day includes of unloading and receiving freight or picking stocked freight.
good,It felt like you were partnered up with Amazon. Of course this is where I self taught myself about online marketing and the first way I ever made real money. It's up to you how you learn to drive this business because you're doing all the social media work and etc to get people to click and buy through your link. The downfall was the fact that you didn't make much money at the very beginning.
good,Its a friendly environment to work in with great managers and really nice co-workers who help you when you need it as well as offer you support when its needed.
good,Amazon is a great company to work. It is fun with great people that willing to help the worker out. Fast place too. Amazon really love their customers and wish to give orders on time. I also love buying my orders from Amazon too.
good,"I recommend Amazon as a positive place to work. Management is helpful, HR is on top of any issues in the work environment, and hours are flexible, providing a great work/life balance."
good,"When I started working at Amazon I was in need of a job that could get me money quickly. This is what I found. At first, I believed that the job would be a simple task of moving boxes around, which it was, but it was a little more than that. The job was productive and management constantly checked in on the workers and pushed them to work harder, in a manner that was not overbearing. That said, they can be a bit much sometimes."
good,The job itself isn't hard at all. Some managers make it a great place to be. Only thing that sucks is the  2 30 min breaks but associates don't quit the job they quit their manager. Everybody wants to be a chief and not enough Indians.
good,"Amazon was a good place to work for especially if your younger and fit. The training was very good but very fast paced and after only 2 weeks your out on the floor on your own. As for me I could handle the work but wasn't fast enough for them. After your training you are expected to attain some higher goals and if you didn't reach them you were pulled aside until you reached them. As for me the shift manager was always looking at the bad in you and never rewarded for the good. This place is very competitive which allows the team members to see who can work the fastest with not the best quality. Its seems they look for Quantity over quality."
good,The pay is fair . Be prepared to constantly be on the move. They cross train everyone and do not discriminate. You will lift up to 49lbs daily . It takes about a good month to get your body use to the physical demand that the job entails. I do not recommend to anyone who is looking for something easy. The skill level is simple but the labor can be intense.
good,The work wasn't to hard because of the team work. It was a good environment to work in. It was in a warehouse and the parking situation could be a little better.
good,I want to develop career in an organization where contribution to the company will ensure the growth for both the company and my expertise.I will be loyal and innovative on my work.
good,"J'ai eu opportunité de travailler avec Amazon en tant que préparatrice de commande. Cependant, le service one pack était très ardu. Il fallait une très bonne force physique par rapport aux autres postes. Quant à la direction, tout se passait agréablement. L'équipe était assez bonne. Je garde une expérience positive."
good,"I worked here for short time. I was promised full time but then once started I was told they had too many on my chosen shift and could only give me 30 hours. Bumping into another shift wasn't possible."
good,Domaine dans lequel il faut avoir l'envie de se surpasser mais surtout faire attention à la sécurité primordial pour le groupe Amazon
good,Very good compensation and excellent benefits.  Freedom to create and make mistakes.  Main downside is you are at mercy of your manager and HR tends to side with leadership over your concerns.
good,"great place to work."
good,A lot of hard work Gotta keep a fast pace  in a Timely manner  the Staff our great to work with they hem you a lot if needed it’s  nice place to work at
good,Bonne expérience chez Amazon malheureusement fin de contrat sous la souplesse par sms 2h avant la prise du poste.
good,Good experience had in customer service. Amazon is good place to work in and has a good environment and work culture. But they should give more job security to employee
good,"It's a great place to work and also provide dental and vision to part time employees. They will also pay for you to go to school, have 401k that their employees can take advantage of. They also give employees discounts yearly and free merchandise."
good,"Great place to work, good benefits and pay but the management is horrible. Most sites are just opening so the management is mostly new and they don't go through a proper training."
good,"The job is ok and at times busy but little to no hours available at times which leads people to have to get a second job. Management is remote and sometimes is there and you will, for the most part, interact with them remotely,"
good,"I would like to see better pay for the work we do in this role "
good,"Best Place to Work"
good,La formation est très bien nous sommes bien encadrés.
good,"Amazon functions like a bunch of startups linked together. Your experience from one department to another will vary greatly. Overall, great people work here and it's worth checking it out."
good,This job is a very busy work load job. It requires at of energy and effort. It can be busy but very rewarding in other was. If they have better pay for the labor the job would be a match.
good,Bonne entente entre tous et bonne esprit d’équipes
good,système à l'américaine et équipe jeune et vigoureuse le bien être des employés et la sécurité est de rigueur
good,"Standing for long hours, but not very physically demanding. Very easy, but can get boring. Great medical benefits. Extreme work hours depending on which building you're assigned to."
good,"It is an awesome experience you will get your base here and good platform to grow and best work culture they have, it is a dream company with many benefits with salary."
good,"Its a fast paced environment with management expecting you to be able to package and stack 225+ packages an hour to meet customer needs, but you also have to be precise and by that I mean you have to know that the packages that are going to certain pallets actually go there. That is about as hard as it gets and enjoyable it gets at the same time."
good,It was a good experience for the company learn alot each and every day didn't have a problem with manager or management got along with all my coworker
good,Its a job to keep you busy but it can be a little overwhelming when volume is low but they want you to continue working when there are no boxes to scan/sort and doing the same thing repeatedly without being able to do anything different gets kind of boring but other than that I love the job its a great place to work for people who just don't want to be home all day its only a 5 hour shift and 30 hours a week
good,"A typical day would rely on steady stability , im always learning new ways to make my experience better , thanks to the learning ambassadors . management is fairly alright . workplace mostly fulll of young people ."
good,"Amazon ist der größte Arbeitgeber, im Online dasein. Im großen und ganzen ist es wirklich ein super Arbeitgeber, auch wenn es hin und wieder  sehr stressig wurde, vorallem über die Weihnachtszeit."
good,"Night shift at a warehouse moving packages all day. Hard sometimes, but the pay is nice. Part-time helped me work and go to school. Rough during December and around August (Christmas and Prime Week)."
good,"Lavorare in Amazon è stato molto piacevole, soprattutto per la questione umana, manager e capi sono molto alla mano, rendono il posto di lavoro piuttosto sereno e tranquillo."
good,"it was a nice envoirment, enjoyed my co workers but the hours weren't really working for me as a single mom with young kids.  Management were nice and helpful"
good,"I was able to get the hours I wanted because of how flexible it was. The job was very simple, receive orders on the phone and fulfill them. There was a lack of knowing your coworkers and who exactly the manager was and how to contact them."
good,"Hard work, on a sensitive time schedule when it comes to completing a task. I get in to do my job and assist others as needed. Great pay and benefits."
good,A great work environment with reasonable compensation and benefits. The company offers endless opportunities for growth and learning. The management makes the work a joy.
good,"- The job in hand was straight forward and how to the use the equipment was taught by the managers."
good,"Amazon demands excellence and production is key to meet the customers' needs.  Culture promotes training, education, and the betterment of all. Understanding Microsoft office and an indepth knowledge of Excell is very helpful."
good,Wasn’t for me. Needed a job to match my performance level. This came close to it but was matched with others who did less work and still got paid the same.
good,It is a good place to work. Lots of nice people and management is very helpful. People always willing to help out if have questions. Only reason left was cause got a chance at my dream job.
good,"Ho lavorato in diverse stazioni su Amazon, immagazzinando, raccogliendo, preparando l'ambiente per magazzinieri e raccoglitori."
good,"If you are not physically fit & agile, do not consider this job.  Even the fittest of the fit have a struggle with the physical demands of this job..especially for your first 60 to 90 days. Very competitive, you must be efficient & very quick in order to hit the required & expected numbers for productivity & quality."
good,It was a decent job that paid pretty well! Requires a lot of hard work & dedication. The benefits were good & my coworkers were fun to work with. I really didn’t like the mangers it was a lot of favoritism.
good,On your feet a lot. Managers make or break each department. Diverse workforce. Great benefits and pay for entry level. might have to travel to break-rooms. productivity=employment
good,e stato un periodo interessante e ho imparato molto
good,Great benefits and opportunities for advancement. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people. The culture was friendly and positive however working virtually presented some challenges for team building.
good,"I TRULY enjoyed working here. It was a great experience and I met some REALLY AWESOME and genuine people along the way! "
good,"The job is most certainly fun and the environment can truly be encouraging and fun. However, sometimes business come first before your happiness and inclusion in the job."
good,Great company. Flexible shifts. Free transport on late shifts. Cafeteria which serves good food to meet each individual's dietary requirements. Beautiful building
good,È stata un'esperienza fantastica e ci ritornerei a lavorare con loro. Peccato per la durata del contratto 1 mese 10 giorni
good,"At least at the lowest positions in the company, Amazon hires blindly.  As long as you can pass the test online, and pass a drug test at the orientation, you have a job.  It is up to you, from that point, to differentiate yourself in order to move up within the company.  Management is very supportive of employees looking to advance themselves"
good,"Buona  e ottimo rapporto con colleghi.Laorato"
good,Correcto. Mucho trabajo pero enseguida te acostumbras
good,"If management were better screened and properly trained then culture and environment would flourish. Until then, great place to start your career and gain experience to move on to other things."
good,Good place to work. Motivated fellow employees. Decent wages and a relaxed work environment. Very clean. Well stocked employee break room. Tech savvy workplace.
good,"E stata una bella esperienza positiva ,lavoro di squadra ,belle organisazione di lavoro"
good,"Working with Amazon was fun. The shifts were short, it was easy to get more hours if you needed them, and management was kind and easy to get along with. The work itself is very physical, so make sure you are physically able to do it. However, it is easy to understand and pick up ASAP"
good,"Bell ambiente sereno, colleghi OK, molti comfort come il caffè gratis e l acqua frizzante dallo spillatore, nonchè il bar, ping-pong e calcetto. Ho avuto un ottimo rapporto con lead e manager, però dopo 4 mesi, arrivato gennaio, il lavoro è calato e han deciso di non farmi proseguire. Non ho mai avuto rimproveri lavorativi nê litigato o risposto male a colleghi e superiori, per cui il passaggio a tempo indeterminato è puramente casuale nonché cliente lista. Anche altri colleghi hanno avuto amara sorpresa senza meritarlo."
good,Es bueno que tenga un ambiente laboral en el trabajo para que los colaboradores sientan el apoyo moral que es muy importante
good,A normal day is handling between 25/30 contacts regarding orders that customers need re-attempting or providing them with an update on their order. Shift's can be a bit long winded but the extra day off makes up for that.
good,From working there I can tell you it is a great working environment and they are very reasonable and understanding. There is plenty of opportunity to grow working at Amazon
good,Very good company to work for with great benefits and rewarding. I would recommend this job to anyone who is need of employment and don’t mind standing for long hours.
good,"Each day at work has gotten a little easier, and I have noticed improvement in my work each day, which is great. The people are great. Very nice, warm, and welcoming."
good,"Great if you're looking for some extra money, easy work,good people, but they don't have much room for meaningful advancement, or offer many weekly hours."
good,"Amazon is a good company overall. They are real flexible with scheduling and time off. Most roles were easy to understand and apply knowledge to the task. Amazon allows you switch roles within the warehouse to avoid burnout.. the health benefits were amazing. What I didn’t like was the “buddy system” In my experience the “Managers” gave their favorite employees the better work(lighter load etc.) which resulted in better rates for their favorites, Huge turnoff for me very uncomfortable"
good,"This is a solid job as an entry level position to start a career in logistics.  Decent upward mobility and opportunities for training.  If you have a desire to grow and work hard, you will find additional roles in leadership."
good,Sometimes hard sometimes easy and sometimes slow. It’s never the same pace everyday which is good depending who you are. People there are very quick to call you out on your faults and remind you to stay alert the whole time.
good,For ten hours you are outside in all degrees of weather with the exception of cloud to ground lightening. You will be trained how to move 53 foot trailers around with a non-commercial vehicle. You will also get to do yard walks and process trailers in and out of the yard.
good,"I had a good time working at Amazon. The pace of the job was perfect, they emphasized safety, and they encouraged a positive working environment. I never felt in danger if I made a mistake. I would do it again if it came down to it."
good,"Une bonne culture d'entreprise, toujours une bonne ambiance, des managers au top."
good,"Manager were fair,always concern with our safety, but still needed production had a good experience with them. Good with sending help whenhelpifneeded"
good,"Working for Amazon can be very stressful especially in the peak periods. "
good,"Working as a delivery driver here has taught me how to be as efficient as possible and how to manage a heavy workload. Most days we will get consistent routes and once you leave the station you're on your own and only accountable for yourself meaning that its up to you to get your route done as quickly as you can and that means efficiency is key. Most people  I've interacted with at the station are just normal people and the majority of the drivers are nice and down to earth but you will probably meet a few that are kind of smug. The hardest part of this job is the days where you get rural routes and you get lost or have to travel longer than usual in between stops or the rainy days. The most enjoyable part of this job has to be that you're not stuck in an office or indoors all day and that you don't often have to pick another drivers slack, you're only accountable for yourself and your route."
good,A typical day at work you’re ALWAYS moving. If you’re not moving you’re not working. At my sort center the people that’s above you make it seem like they care about you when in fact they really don’t. because they’ll let you go WITHOUT a weeks notice or anything like that.
good,your usual shifts consist of alot of people you start by scanning the first hour before a lead will move you to another line but that will make the shifts go by faster
good,"This company helped me grow in many ways, hoping to go back some day and work there. The managment team was very helpful and nice to me and helped me grow as a person."
good,"It ok working there, I just rather work for myself. I want to be my own boss. So I don’t wanna work at amazon no more. The location I work at is just a bit unorganized."
good,Can Learn a lot in this kind of fast paced environment. Culture is similar to startup culture in which one gets ownership of the product end to end. Best company to work in the start of the career
good,"Overall I like working here as a delivery driver. Its fast paced and you stay busy which makes the time go by quite quickly most days. Is physically demanding and a bit hard on your back, bending and reaching a lot and getting in and out of the van and running to and from the van. Some days are easier physically than others if you have a more country route for example. "
good,"Given a team brief at start of the shift which helps us to understand how Day shift went, the amount of orders that have come through. Always go through safety measures and any questions."
good,"A four day work week is good if you need three days off, however, the four days you work, you will not have the time to do much more than the work in front of you."
good,"Stay focused and try to always move up."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Amazon (remote) it was a life changing job, but not a career. The only con about this job for me was the flexibility. I didnt see much of that in picking my schedule."
good,"Working for amazon direct was a great educational and gratifying experience. Some fulfillment centers use third party contractors such as CW services and JLL. These contractors are extremely over managed and misleading. They will lie about advancement opportunities and treat you like your in high school. If you can avoid working for these contractors and work for amazon direct, I highly recommend it."
good,"this workplace is very good."
good,"Wonderful workplace with a good corporate culture and flexible work hours and work-from-home options, but I got a lowest-possible hourly rate from the contract agency who has been working for Amazon for years."
good,Amazon is a fast pace environment with many growing opportunities. Management was good as they were able to accommodate different needs. Most enjoyable part of the job were the friendly co workers
good,Working with amazon is a great company it’s a lot of physical work involved just be prepared for that. Some days can be hard with the routes but long as you stay focus positive and motivated you can get the job done
good,"The job was decent and had great security, the work life balance was nothing really to talk about because you really didnt have one during peak season."
good,"depending on the department you are in you have a time off task. you  have to stay on task, or you could be the top offender the next day. "
good,It was a nice way to earn some fast cash. Have to be consistent and on time to maintain your job in here. Friendly management and workers. It’s a place anyone can work
good,Great job for benefits with plenty of opportunity for growth Must be physically fit job is demanding on the body hours are long and breaks are short.  Management could be better a lot of there ops managers are inexperience college graduates.
good,"Friendly and clean work environment. I worked in outbound which included sorting items to be shipped and palletizing orders to be loaded onto trucks. Fairly easy work for good pay compensation and benefits. A con to this place is rate was a little hard to achieve in palletizing due to miscounts and unsatisfactory ethic when it comes to correctly placing objects. I spent a lot more time fixing these errors than being able to continue palletizing. However, management worked with me and allowed me to be in unrated functions as I would take the time to close out pallets correctly. There is a lot of room for growth in the company and they work with their employees to find the best fit for them within the warehouse as there are many different positions to fill."
good,"Great atmosphere, friendly & straightforward to work within, although some tasks can quickly become repetitive."
good,I enjoyed working for the company and only left due to finishing a degree. I recommend working for the company. I has a great emphasis on empowering the employee to grow in their personal life.
good,the day goes by fast once the orders starts coming in. working there around the holidays kept us very busy. I learn Alor when we came to scanning packages and also delivering them.
good,"Main issue would have to be the long hours. Amazon allows you to have multiple titles and leadership roles via cross training, but you may not be compensated for them. "
good,Amazon was very motivated and goal-driven. In order to succeed an overall rate must be met everyday. Managers were supportive and helpful. The work culture was great and meant to help you succeed
good,"I was going to stay at this job for a long time, until I found out I had to work 6 days a week, 10-12 hour shifts. I was fine starting out 4 days a week with those hours. If the extra days were optional instead of mandatory, that would be better."
good,Sunrise location is new but can use better organization. I was on unpaid maternity leave; which was challenging due to lack of communication through their Ambassador portal.
good,Nice but it’s stressful sometimes the only things that stand out was the rush of orders that were piling up and may have made a mistake when separating the orders
good,"The schedule worked great with me. I worked 4-10's. I had three days off to rest. They have a big lunch room and a couple of vending machines, which was great because there was a lot of people there during peak season."
good,"Amazon culture sets it apart from BPO culture.  Very customer obsessed and managers, agents even guards and facility personnel are friendly and respectful. Work/life balance exists at Amazon!"
good,But they dont understand what i went through tryna maintain coming to work i was staying in dallas coming all the way to fort worth it wasnt the original place i signed up for an i still stayed ive asked f9r an conversion mutiple times cux i knew at the end whn i got everything right which i just did that i was gone loose it and i did i was perpared
good,"The company was a best work experience , a place where everyone can learn for his career success. "
good,"It was my first job and was also right out of college. Amazon taught me work culture and how to conduct yourself in a work environment. "
good,"The workplace culture is inclusive, energising, and presents many different opportunities for advancement and support for family as well as the employee."
good,"travail simple avec des perspective d'evolution cafe gratuit "
good,"During peak season It is fun working in Amazon because everyone is busy doing their job perfectly, helping each other to reach to the final count at end of day. Fast pace work and a person learn about time management."
good,everyday is different which makes it fun. there is always work to do everyday. given pto or upt to use on your own time when you not feeling good. meet great people there.
good,Love working with my coworkers always make it fun and workable at the same time. Come in move boxes and clean work space. Get along with all managers.
good,"Sehr nette Menschen, Zusammenarbeit."
good,"I am currently working for Amazon Flex. I love the flexibility this job offers. You get paid twice a week, and the money is good. I would recommend this job to anyone"
good,Will recommend others to work there. Sometimes stress level used to get increase due to more demand of projects from manager. Salary was good after including bonus and other benefits.
good,"I enjoyed working at Amazon DNA 1 and I wish I could've kept my position, but unfortunately they didn't have a location close to where I moved! It was hot a lot of the time, but my managers provided fans, water, etc to keep us hydrated. The work wasn't hard it just had to be done in a timely matter and it was mostly repetitive. Overall, I would recommend people to try it out especially if you're looking to make extra cash and get overtime!"
good,Everyday is different. That is what i love about it. No two days are the same. being there. Hard on body and mind but the people i work with are great. I absolutely love the friends i have made.  It has made the job worth  being there.
good,Lots of growth potential. Very supportive colleagues and management. Must be able to work under pressure. Must be professional and be able to relate to different people.
good,"You get what you put in when building relationships with all stakeholders and candidates. I have learned management can either help you make it or crush you. "
good,"Amazon is a great company to work for.  Opportunities are vast and available to those that have the ability to be flexible. The companies commitment to customer obsession is encouraging.  There is so much growth potential within the company, it can be overwhelming.  Unfortunately, career advancement may require you to leave the company in order to be placed in a position that better align with your capabilities."
good,"The work is fast-paced and labor intensive. Management is OK for the most part. They will acknowledge your hard work as a team and reward you with food and prizes. The only thing I dislike about working here is the blatant favoritism. Easier tasks are often delegated to favorites and *some* ppl who lack tact and leadership skills are promoted to learning ambassador. Other than that, it’s an OK place to work."
good,A very good place to start a career. There is a lot of scope of learning depending on the role and team. Good work culture and work-life balance. Great to be with the organization.
good,Best experience as a work place and amazing environment to work to the best of my capabilities. Great experience for me as my first job. Very flexible management culture as well
good,"The job itself was very easy, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to grab items out of cardboard boxes. As far as the pacing of the job, it was fast paced enough to challenge you, especially at the beginning when you're still becoming familiar with brands and labels."
good,Very good place to start career. There is a lot of scope of learning depending on the role and team. Good work culture and work life balance. Great to be with the organization.
good,"Amazon is dynamic, to be a great employee one should always keep his/her learning skills sharper and help themself updated and one should be ready for any changes which comes on a day today operations"
good,I been working with amazon wholefoods for almost a month now and it's pretty cool. I go in and do my job and leave. I've met a few nice people and don't have problems getting shifts. As long as you log on in time or a minute before and stay put till the shifts drop you shouldn't have a problem getting a shift.
good,"Fun place to work at (part time) but the work can be stressful at times especially during ""peak"" seasons. No real issues with management team. Show a willingness to learn and one moves up the chain rapidly. Sometimes the work hours are decreased due to lack of volume during the day but overall hours are between 15-25 hours weekly depending on work load."
good,Amazon offers many schedules that may fit into your schedule. After the probationary period they will hire you permanently. Laid back work atmosphere.
good,"Fast paced environment. As with most jobs, you either have a good manager or a bad one and that can really make a difference. In general I love my co-workers."
good,"I learnt a lot of things there at Amazon, it’s work culture is fast paced and enjoyable. People are very much helping in nature. Two things I specially noted, time management and proper use of recourses."
good,Ok  it’s a job  it’s a Job  work  casual dress 👗 tomorrow   Warehouse environment  set hours overtime may be necessary  must be on time  work four days off three
good,"This was a seasonal job, beginning during the peak of the holidays and continuing for some after that but for those not meeting Amazon standards, a parting of the ways was inevitable."
good,It was a great experience working with Amazon as it was my first corporate experience being there. The work environment is really chill and colleagues are really nice.
good,What I didn’t like about working at amazon was that all I did was stand on one spot and move back and forth. It made the time go by so slow. I made a request to take some time off but it didn’t go through and that got me fired. I wanted to quit but it’s whatever.
good,"Great place to learn"
good,"I was brought into the ever-growing Amazon empire fresh off my college internship. The work was exciting and often demanding, and was a fantastic introduction to the corporate world."
good,"Good pay if youre willing to do the work, long days but they have great benefits just hard to find a balance for me between work and home life.  worth working here"
good,"intensive work and heavy load. pushy managers, and supervisors. Culture is oriented you can actually have fun at work while working with other co-workers as a team."
good,"Loved working for Amazon,  pay was decent and benefits were great.  Worked 10 hr shifts and mandatory overtime during holidays. Work was massive and also very tiring.  Paychecks were worth the work load and a the beat bonus was I loved my manager and work peers."
good,A really good place to work. You pick you’re schedule so you’re able to get more things done in you’re life with out having a set schedule. Fast paced but easy to do.
good,"Amazon is a great organization that truly encourages everyone to be and give their best.  That said, it is also a very demanding organization that truly insists on the highest standards.  While this can be extremely rewarding, it is can also be exhausting in the long run."
good,Hay mucho privilegios con los que tienen más tiempo trabajando
good,"Productive and fun workplace. Staff have enough room to grow, as there are numerous openings regularly. A very intense work environment that requires consistent hard work."
good,Some of the managers at the location I was working at just don't know how to talk to grown people. Some of them talk down and at you like you are a child.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Amazon. Actually, I've been working there for 2 times, since I cannot work during my Uni time, but I've been there during my summer holidays, and I liked it. It's a hard job, since it's quite physical, but it's good to work within a company that doesn't pay attention to your gender, your beliefs, your origins, or whatever, to give you an opportunity to learn, and to always acquire new skills."
good,Very helpful when it came to work injuries. HR was very helpful with helping you understand the employees website and the way the rules work. Especially when it comes to understanding the hoursz
good,"Easy tasks but taxing on the body "
good,"At Amazon, my day typically had me moving around the facility a lot, moving slates and moving packages. "
good,It was fun working at Amazon.com. The management is extreme motivating and the environment is relaxed and positive. They were very supportive and encouraging. The management always made you feel like you were part of a family and not a business.
good,"Amazon is a great company to work for if you are not there just for the pay. Most of its employees have primary employment. The secondary shifts are for 4 hours part time. The night shift  will never get the full 16 hours as everyone else, due to the lack of work on some nights and the completion of the shift. Shifts can be picked up on other days to supplement for the lack of hours. During peak season holidays there are plenty of hours to be picked up on. They even give gift cards to accept hours. You are allotted UPT hours to cover lateness but if 6 minutes late they take a full hour of UPT; it will not affect your pay for that day. They provide breakfast, lunch and prizes on certain occasions. They do not allow any discrimination or bullying on site,, which is wonderful. I have never worked for a warehouse with so many incentives and a great place to work. They should allow more life work acceptance for individuals with primary careers and better internal promoting rather than it being a hidden secret or word of mouth."
good,good place to work has its slow season where they offer a lot of vto. really busy in the witer months so expected to work 55 to 60 hours. management wasn't the best. But I've always was productive on the floor doing multiple departments a shift. and also has very good benefits.
good,"Achieved 100% performance goals for accuracy, speed, volume, resolution of"
good,This company is a perfect launchpad for the freshers. You will have ample breathing period for the transformation from student to employee. Once the transformation is complete you need to look for an actual job or else you will be struck here for a lifetime of nothing.
good,"Amazon is growing up due to good performance of both management and staff, people are happy because their expectations to have their packages are delivered on time and in good shape"
good,"A typical day includes clocking in and working with two breaks. No time for chat or socializing; not really. Though I got opportunities to improve, only the ones with initiative get these. It's great in the sense of personal improvement but does exclude a lot of the workforce and discourages them from working there for more than a couple of weeks at best. I am someone who excels at best under pressure and clear communication. Both of which only came to me when I started to demanding insight and training."
good,"if your used to fast paced work and you are not in need of constant praise"
good,"Mi sono trovato molto bene sia con i colleghi che con i responsabili aziendali,ho avuto la possibilità di svolgere un bel lavoro.Peccato che il mio contratto anche se con feedbeck positivo sia terminato."
good,"Easy work , management changes often, Good benefits, Pay ok, Just long hours on your feet and lots of walking. offer education , discounts. You do get to cross-train in different departments. If you have the right management then you will be able to learn different jobs with the warehouse."
good,"The rules and culture is changing continuously which can't be easily adapted. Nothing else than that. The growth has literally come to zero.,........."
good,"It's a great place to learn, experiment and grow in career prospect. Management encourages new ideas and appreciates the process improvements introduced by the employees."
good,Loved working for them. I left because I found a better paying job to help support my family. I was only seasonal. I would gladly work for them again.
good,"It was a fairly good and easy job great work place. Great first job experience. They kept yo motivated, learned new things made friends . They also gave away free things to the hard workers"
good,"Stoksuz satış için zaman ve para ayırırsanız, gelir kapısı elde edersiniz."
good,A typical day at a Amazon warehouse you would get a shipment for your work day thought the shift you were working. The hardest part of the job is having walk at around the warehouse at a fast pace to keep your stow rate at 220 or above.
good,"Amazon does have its good points, but there are a few things that can be managed better. They are great with medical/vision coverage.  Some of the managers could do better."
good,"Productive workplace with a strong ownership based culture, customer obsession is the main driving leadership principle that guides our business decisions."
good,"For someone who did this at a young age, the money was worth it. It's a good workout because of the different roles and being on your feet for periods of time and getting breaks were necessary. Do not go into this job ignorant about factory life. While it is climate controlled dress like your going to the gym and you'll survive."
good,"I had fun working for amazon at the time that I did. It was a really fun experience. Sometimes I had bad days and good days. If you work hard you get paid well. I enjoyed working for the company that I did because they were always so nice and understanding. If you can handle lifting up 40-50 lbs a day and also driving a big truck, doesn’t matter what weather it is, this is the job for you."
good,Fast working environment with multiple jobs available for each employee. You can move from one department to any other depending on your performance. Metric system involved.
good,"The job I have/had at the Amazon in Sussex was ok, I just wanted to switch temp. companies or jobs because I have a part time job and there was days I would only get 3 hours of sleep so I'm applying for different jobs."
good,"fun workplace. flexible schedules easy to balance with outside. However, there is barely room for growth and professional advancement."
good,"It was a decent job, I was paid fairly. There is always plenty of stuff to do. The 10 hours fly by. Breaks every 2.5 hours. Management was all over the place but it was still under control"
good,"Very fast paced work environment, you had to be there on time before the team leaves for loading."
good,I loved working hard for Amazon. There was less and less work to do.
good,"Overall positive experience once you get used to Amazon's culture and methodology. You do stay very busy but when the work ends for the day, you don't carry anything home. Work-Life balance was easy to keep."
good,"You punch in and go to standup where the managers explain goals and productivity standards to meet for the day. You then go to your secluded assigned station and do the same thing for 10 hours a day. It does get lonely and boring at times but the 2 breaks and lunch make up for it. Rates are genuinely high, so you have to work hard and fast to meet the standards. Benefits are amazing and they are pretty lenient with giving flexibility for time off."
good,C’est un travail de nuit mais on dirait pas..tout le monde est motivé avec une ambiance conviviale sur le site.Des manager qui savent comment booster leur équipe sans trop mettre la pression et le stress..une expérience que j’ai apprécié
good,"Working at Amazon is so useful but they have some problems with managing, the managers don't really know how to manage their associates, they take new managers coming straight out from university and they give them the position of management."
good,Get your head down keep going if you put in the effort you can make not bad money got on well with agency they were professional a good place to work you learn more if you put the effort in you will be trained in all aspects of the work
good,"It’s okay not the best they have a great lunch room. Very minimal breaks, standing for very long periods of time. I recommend it if you don’t mind and like to get paid a decent amount."
good,"Great environment to be surrounded by highly intelligent colleagues.  While the culture is strong throughout the organization, a great deal is asked of you and work life balance suffers a s a result."
good,"Buena experiencia en esta empresa."
good,Amazon was a good place to work but no chance for advancement. Management played favorites had to barter to get anything sometimes . You ask for help then after complaining 3-4 times they will get someone to help you . I have years of management training . The management skills these managers have isnt good at all. I think they put them in for some odd reason but should of never been made managers . They lack training and skills. Management needs to treat all fairly.
good,"I will say if you have a goal and aspiration, amazon is the place to be provided you able to stand for up 10 to 12 hours on your feet, standing is the main challenge of the job."
good,My only recommendation would be more flexibility at the time of the shifts since there are people who need more hours and still do not offer the FT ..
good,I really enjoyed working only 4 days a week even thought the shift was 10 hours. Management is always trying to help you out and keep you right where you want to be.
good,"Good work culture, great company for kick starting your career. "
good,It is a fast paced environment and you have to meet a set rate of production. The benefits are great and begin on start date. There is opportunity for overtime year round and you are required to work 60 hour work days between Black Friday until the new year.
good,"I start my day early in the morning. I've learned that every day is day 1 here at amazon anything can happen,there are changes everyday."
good,"Although my time at Amazon was short, it was a productive learning experience. The job was very fast paced and highly number driven. If you weren't able to meet hourly numbers, you would be pulled aside and talked to by management to try to figure out a way to better preform your job in order to meet requirements."
good,It was a lot and not really worth it and they would always make people do over work. And they always wanted me on the forklift I didn’t like it but it was ok
good,"as a delivery driver, i was entrusted with customers' items. it felt good to know you are trusted and there was a great communication between management team and i."
good,"The job had its stressful days but there were many pleasant distractions there in between calls to unwind throughout the workday. These Distractions included Pool Table, Ping Pong Table, Air Hockey Table, Gaming Systems, and Shuffle Board along with many others."
good,Logistic center in Smyrna Ga was a fun place to work. Upper management was very fair.  Some supervisors were jerks but tolerable. Worked with some awesome people.
good,"A typical day at work would start off with announcements and stretches.  Managers would give us feed back from the previous day and tell us what we need to do to be better."
good,Amazon is a good company to work for. The shifts would always go quick and the managers we're always very helpful.  The mandatory overtime was always nice.
good,"Das Bild, das durch die Medien vermittelt wird, deckt sich absolut nicht mit meinen Erfahrungen. Die Arbeitsbedingungen sind wesentlich besser als öffentlich angeprangert wird. Ja, es gibt Feedback und natürlich orientiert man sich an Vorgaben und ermittelt durchschnittliche Zahlen hinsichtlich der Produktivität der jeweiligen Abteilung. Und ich denke, es ist nur logisch, Mitarbeiter anzusprechen, die unter gleichen Voraussetzungen weit unter dem Durchschnitt liegen. Die angepeilten Zahlen sind für wirklich jeden, der eben“normal“ arbeitet, zu erreichen. Diejenigen, die sich über diesen Druck von oben beschweren, sind aber auch genau diejenigen, die 10 Mal zur Toilette gehen oder in den Gängen stehen und quatschen. Ich habe das in neun Jahren nicht erlebt. Mit einer gesunden Arbeitsmoral kann man dort sehr viel Spaß haben.Mit Kollegen wie auch Vorgesetzten. Ausserdem kann man sich intern immer weiter qualifizieren.Ich habe nahezu alle Bereiche durchlaufen, war somit auch immer in der Lage, mal die Tätigkeiten zu wechseln. Ausgeschieden bin ich durch einen Aufhebungsvertrag, weil ich leider eine langwierige und wiederkehrende Verletzung am Fuß hatte und mir nach entsprechenden Ausfallzeiten nahegelegt wurde, mich nach einem geeigneteren Job umzusehen."
good,"Almost had fun music playing as you walked in, and did team stretching before and after breaks. the only thing I didn't like is the fact that you had to work alone and had no way of communicating with other people while working."
good,"I would clock in, and drive my forklift to the startup meeting, where I would receive info pertaining to my position and the company in general.  After startup, I would get an RF scanner, and forklift safety harness.  From there, I would drive to get a pallet of merchandise and proceed to find locations to store them. When all the merchandise in that pallet was stored, I would get another pallet and store those items.  I would repeat this process throughout the day and take my breaks at the scheduled times."
good,A normal day at work consists of a variety of things. The work changes regularly as Amazon grows. There are always fun things planned and the people are great to be around. Hardest part of the job is being patient with others. I love my Leads and coworkers and I enjoy the challenges my job brings.
good,"A typical day at work would begin with a snack in the immense cafeteria available in the premises. I've learned how to effectively communicate with the customers across the globe and also taught me to interact correctly in a work environment. The management at Amazon is incredibly helpful and always reachable. The workplace culture is amazingly good and highly motivating. The hardest part of the job would be the intense night shifts without proper availability of food. It always kept us hungry during the night. Last but not the least, the most enjoyable part of our job was making connections with people around us, analyzing the psychology and implement the generosity accordingly with the customers reaching out to us."
good,If you need extra money this is a great way to get extra income in for a short while. It will be alot of walking around that you would have to get use to over time.
good,New stowing bins were mainly made for tall people and the environment had vehicles in and out of the building causing lots of smog inside the building.
good,"cool co workers and awesome managers, weekly pay , 401k and good amount for tuition reimbursement. Nice area and stock up on some good shoes becuase you wil need it"
good,"A good Atmosphere where a person can learn new ideas New Techniques, New vision and a goal that every one is shared to achieve with positive aspects of knowledge"
good,"Responsibilty. In my time working with Amazon I learned if you are willing to give that extra 10% and take responsibilty you'll quickly move on up."
good,Very strong company and developing pretty fast. Anyone can learn a lot among smart colleagues and managers so that to improve personal soft skills. Leadership Principle is good but the understanding for each person are different. Too high frequency of re-orgnization.
good,"Loved working there. The people and day to day operations were good"
good,the work environment can be messy at times but the people tend to be nice. the pay is decent and the benefits make the job worth working at least for the time being.
good,"Amazon is a good place to work at if you really need money, it pays well. Like 400 or so pounds a week. My part at amazon was restocking and stocking. Nothing big."
good,"Good company. Benefits are adequate, and working conditions are fine. Very structured from a corporate level, necessary due to the size of the organization. Lots of young managers recruited from college or military."
good,They were nice to work for. The pay and benefits were great. It will definitely keep you on your toes. Would recommend other people to work here. You meet some pretty cool people as well.
good,"Amazon gives you a framework to succeed in any organization that you go to. While the job is demanding , it does help you learn a lot.  They pay well and the performance management system ensures that you grow up the ladder if you are good at your work."
good,"I worked with two different managers over 4 years. The first was very intense and only let up for a while when I was working on production software and handling the project myself. The second was mostly permissive, but the environment was highly ambiguous so we were left to muddle through."
good,"Decent place to work and friendly and helpful staff. Good pay. Hard work, but great satisfaction after a job well done. The management are easy to speak to as well."
good,The great company to work for at Christmas they do activities every day of December  to make up for the hard work we do. too many spread sheets. we have fun days out all expenses paid.
good,il personale era molto cordiale e si era formato un gruppo molto affiatato
good,"New Accounting methods. ""KPI.com"" Accounts, MS Office (Word, Excel), Manual Accounting, Administration Tasks,"
good,"I got a lot of satisfaction by developing a product which millions of people currently use: Fire TV Stick. Learnt a lot by interacting with cross functional teams such as Product Design, Industrial Design, RF, Antenna, Power, Electrical, Software, Manufacturing etc. They provide RSUs but the vest heavily in the third and fourth year, so it takes a while to get them."
good,"Amazon Logistics is a very fast paced and challenging work environment where change occurs daily.  Opportunity to advance and come up with new ideas and solutions is common and encouraged.  Working with hundreds of different people daily to solve problems and complete tasks makes this job uniquely challenging, competitive and fun."
good,Great until it wasnt.  They need to do some evaluations on the company and they way they push for numbers. Which I get the more people order the more you work. But they need to understand we aren't their machines. When we break it takes us longer to get fixed than mechanical machines.
good,"Exciting place to work. Very productive. Management is great, but with most jobs you have your few bad eggs. Training is fun. It’s all about how one makes the job work for them."
good,"Fun workplace"
good,I truly enjoy working from home. I help people on a day to day basis operate their accounts as well as the website. I have a lot of patience to assist the older customers with checkout issues too.
good,Lots of employee so the managers have a hard time learning who everyone is. Coworkers are nice and easy to work with. The hardest part of the job is getting bored. The most enjoyable part is the short shift.
good,"Productivity and pay depends on the individual. Amazon allows you to be your own boss, but does not provide any benefits, or base pay for affiliate marketing positions."
good,"In my 7 years experience in working in Amazon, I have learned a lot of skills that was leadership oriented. In working there I had to deal with a lot of stressfull situations and learned to work under pressure, also as a Team Leader I had to manage team to up to 50 associates."
good,It was just the atmosphere of different people that made it fun and productive and we all would come together and handled our business accordingly to be able to have real smooth days
good,"Working at amazon was a fun learning experience. The management was lacking but overall it was fun. I was the delivery driver and spent a lot of my time by myself so I wasn't too bothered with in-house politic stuff. The advancement is hard to come by there and the benefits were lacking. If they improved those, it would be a perfect place to work"
good,"I liked working for Amazon but I personally couldn’t stay longer than a year. Almost every position is timed by a rate that you are required to make and the likelihood of you getting a different position after being placed into your selected position is slim to none without making specific accommodations. I’ve worked in fast paced jobs before and had no difficulty keeping up, though, with amazon I could not keep up the stamina they required without having 2 or more Red Bull’s which was causing my existing anxiety to worsen. I really wanted to move up and into a new position and was never given the opportunity. The pay is great, the benefits are great and I will rate my overall experience 4 out of 5 stars."
good,"Secure Company to do the best"
good,Amazon has a good culture in management and are always striving to improve the work culture.  Expect to work hard with 1 day shipping and always working on process improvement projects.  Good pay and upward movement.
good,Working for a big company has its benefits. The work processes are standardized and everything is organized. You have everything you need to do your job.
good,"The ten hour shifts at Amazon would fly by because you were working continuously throughout the day, with the exception of breaks.  The work is very labor intensive, and management can be hit or miss.  Whether good or bad you would only have you manager for six months as they would be rotated around to different departments every six months.  The benefis Amazon offers you will not find at any other company at least in the United States.  The pay however for the amount of work you do is not that great.  However, since I left the company did push it's starting pay up to $15/hr. I made some good friends at Amazon that I am still friends with today."
good,Amazon provides a great platform to start a career as a fresher. It depends on the process you are in as to what the learning curve would be. But it surely is a challanging place to learn and grow everyday of your tenure. Work culture is amazing with great people and good pay/benefits. Definitely a preferred employer.
good,Amazon is a great company to work for. The job work/life balance is unmatched compared to any other company I've ever worked for before. There's always so much to learn. Plenty of room for growth in so many different departments.
good,"The only thing that upset me is the fact that I kept Getting sent to part time when I wanted Full time. And I was Not able to be sent over by someone even when I called  Also, if you have things pre planned before you work there you get points due to them having you already on a set schedule. I have Two jobs some days are going to clash it’s not fair I get A point for working the other job with longer hours."
good,"I’ve been here for 2 months. It’s very physical, but it keeps you from watching the clock because you don’t have time to honestly. You are able to cancel any shift 24 hours in advance with no penalty.. Make your own schedule.."
good,ok job but you have to work cant be a slacker will get over time and pay is good can be a fun place to work just have to follow rules and manage your time
good,"It is a flat, open organization. The organization is structured and we have been given an opportunity to be creative within our roles and that is the best part."
good,"Amazon is a fast paced work environment. Focused accuracy and time oriented. Management could be more acknowledging."
good,Good environment fast paced job part time but opportunity to get extra hours great for second job or career growth strict on time but its a good thing
good,"I enjoyed all my time at Amazon up until the last 6 months when I got a new manager. He was awful, dishonest and immoral. I guess it was just the luck of the draw for me. Most of the managers at Amazon are good."
good,"As can be expected, Amazon rivals any other tech company in terms of benefits, compensation, and opportunities. However, it does have a very specific cutlure that you either ascribe to, or you don't. If you do not then you will not enjoy your time as much there... but hey, it does compensate it's employees very well and it does provide a lot of perks and benefits."
good,Start the night off with a production meeting and then we proceed to the area the manager assigns you to. When the item that has your area's number on it comes take it from the line and then place them on the labeled rack.
good,No review for the site I am at. The company as a whole is worth working for. Advancement is possible if you are willing to relocate after you get so far up.
good,"Excellent balance of autonomy and mentorship"
good,"Meeting quotas and checking driver summaries. Very fast paced and team oriented. I enjoyed everything about the job, it was challenging but team oriented,"
good,"Clock in EARLY, to make it to Stand Up on time which will determine where you are working for the day. Follow the guidelines, listen to staff and if you get confused ASK for help from someone. Asking for help is a good thing, don't think you can do it alone."
good,Good place to work with good collegues.The work culture was really nice with no restricting rules but sadly it has started to change with the change in management.But it would depend on which department your working with.
good,Great for someone with no family or quiet animals! Great pay and work as many hours as you can if you are hired for full time. It’s a part time temporary job.
good,"Overall I love amazon and the environment, it was a truly wonderful experience and if given an opportunity I would again but time can’t only tell and my main focus may not be in FC."
good,"I worked one night. I couldn't retrieve any hours be cause the supervisors were giving hours to friends and family. On the first night no one told me what to do i had to catch on. Very unfriendly atmosphere. I just recently applied again in hopes i would be placed at another building and guest what, i was accepted as a rehire ONLY to go on my portal and there are no times/dates available  intwrview"
good,"I had a very progressive and productive time at Amazon in Hemel Hempstead. I was one of the first members of team to join this as a brand new Fulfilment Centre. The HR, Learning and Development down to the floor managers were brilliant. Great management, team culture and a friendly environment."
good,"Amazon has recently started hiring their own delivery work force.  While doing so, they seem a little more disorganized than I thought they would be. The delivery job is physically demanding. You often work in 90+ degree heat, during heavy rainstorms, and until nightfall. This is expected and can be difficult at times. They initially start your workload out light, but it progresses to a level that is unattainable. They have ""rescue"" teams who are sent out to help you finish your route if it appears you won't get done before dark. You are initially scheduled for a 10 hour shift, but most days run 11-12 hours long. They do offer a lot of perks designed to keep morale high among employees (free bottled water, ice pops, hot dog/hamburger days....etc)."
good,"Good pay relative to work difficulty, supportive, relaxed work environment"
good,"Standing in one place doing the same thing over and over for 10 hours straight, not bad if you have comfortable shoes and can manage to find ways to deal with the hours. Hard to manage the hourly rates wanted every hour, every day consistently though, very monotonous."
good,"My shift was nights four on three off, I loved working there when it first opened in August, everything was brand new, I quickly and others progressed to instructors and the atmosphere was great and getting busier towards Christmas. Excellent pay as a night shift worker, the management and team leaders are young but they're good. The job is easy but if you like to move around and variety, unless you work hard and get lucky in getting to do other tasks which are not target driven, you will find yourself standing in one spot for 10 hours doing the same task as a permanent job which in the end gets repetitive. Career progression is there regularly but not guaranteed. The job is target driven which is achievable if you work hard, however sometimes productivity demand is high and quality drops when asked to pack over the target number. The breaks are timed, the canteen food I would not recommend it myself, but plenty of fridges and ovens and two canteen areas if you take your own. If you want a job with decent money then amazon is great, also there is flexibility to work less days if you are a student for example, if you want a career or easy job then best work for another warehouse that is not sales driven."
good,There is a lot to do all of the time. The only problem was with the scanners not working as much as they needed to and not being able to find a scanner by the time your shift came. The batteries for the scanners don't last long and it takes an even longer time for the batteries to charge.
good,I think the drivers should be paid more. Because we work in 90 degree weather in the summer and 20-30 degree weather in the winter. We strive to get the customer package to them on time.
good,"Excellent company to work for and lots of opportunity’s to further your career but must be on a blue badge with 1 years service before you are eligible to apply for any of them."
good,"As a recent graduate when I joined the team, it was very difficult to establish a personal support system outside of work in a new city and state. What ended up happening was that I would work 40-50 hours a week, and then my free time would involve grabbing a drink with fellow amazonians and then discussing yet more work, so that I never got to truly disconnect or unplug from work. I ended up burning out rather quickly because of this. Seemed to be a great fit for some folks that either already had families and networks in the area or that didn't mind the grind."
good,Very physically demanding job but more than compensated fairly.  I had some bad experiences had some very good management while at Amazon.  just remember Amazon is out to profit Amazon as long as you understand that going into the job the job will treat you fairly
good,I enjoyed working there it was just management needs work because some lacked the communication skills. The environment was a good place for someone that worked at fast pace.
good,It is a very demanding job that requires physical capability. Be sure you are fit and ready for this job particularly at the fulfillment center. Overall the job was very helpful at the time I needed it.
good,"Amazon is  a company in which learning is encouraged.Though workloads can get quite intense, I've always felt my input lead to either automation or process optimization as to ensure the next time around the unexpected had been planned for."
good,Good work place for anyone needing extra money for school and extra money in general. Would recommend to anyone with a good work ethic and able to work long hours.
good,"An enormous company with multiple leels of management. The only thing limiting your promotional capability is you. They offer many ways to move up, but it's not easy."
good,they were still going through growing pains but overall it was a good experience.  the pay could have been better. most managers were easy to work with.
good,Working there gave me some experience at working at Amazon with how the process works for the workplace. Being the night shift we often get the opposite direction of traffic and getting out when no one was awake on five 8's but when the four 10's came around it changed everything that we did with every day for the rest of the time I spent there was a tad longer. the side that I don't like from Amazon is getting workers to do more and more rate to the point where it looks impossible but other workers manage to do the rate somehow. Keep an eye and write down what happens just in case if they say you didn't make rate. the people at the job next to you are amazing and can make they day/night fly by faster if you are assigned next to someone other than that you could be left alone for around 2 hours at a time
good,"Your regular warehouse job and its fast pace must get a certain rate every day.n The benefits healthcare, PTO, UPT, AND STOCKS. Management sometimes seems to have favorites like all jobs."
good,Never a dull moment. Time flies very fast when packing next to people who talk. Love the overnight shift and managers. Wouldn't trade that crew for the world.
good,"Great work place, Good work/ life balance. Fun and culture of work and other activities are well balanced. The management is very supportive to cultivate new work styles and approaches."
good,Good to work atmosphere with not so much pressure based management. Great work and fun balanced work life. Management has not been the best but now and then there are few good ones
good,"Manager cordiali e presenti, ambiente pulito e ci si sente tutelati dal punto di vista della sicurezza però si paga l'instabilità dovuta al lavoro a chiamata e contratti a breve termine"
good,"Resolutions Specialists were really good support staff. They coach very well on the online processes, however, the accounts used during training were not supposed to be touched since it will affect the progress of the customer accounts. Dummy accounts could have been used so that the trainee can actually see the beginning and end results of the online tools. But the management here are composed of great, friendly and fun-loving people. The only problem here is that, the form 2316 will not be given on a time frame that you will be needing it. This form 2316 should have been given ahead, during nesting,  because the 45-60 day wait period on the release policy of the form 2316 will delay so much the next endeavor of the resigned CSA, since her form 2316 will take so long to be released. This is all true with the other companies. They release the form 2316 after 45 to 60 days. This form 2316 really sucks the next endeavor of the resigned CSA. I hope you from the HR will know how it feels to wait for 45 to 60  days, just with that document. That could have been provided during nesting already, so that whatever decision there is from the trainee, he/she can already have a copy, whether he/she continues or not. You know, that form 2316 is always required by the next application, even if the trainee has not reached the second quarter.  Anyway, Production Staff from Amazon are helpful people. Though not all, there was one who was not. But overall, it is a very good bpo company to work with."
good,It was a good environment i learned a lot fro Amazon fulfillment. Amazon was the first company that proved to me if you work hard you can move up in the company.
good,"For any individual looking to grow their management skills Amazon was perfect. You have to have critical thinking, problem solving and leadership skills. If you do you'll thrive."
good,Just management was nasty and  some what prejudice. Just didn't fill good working there any more it was the way management handled . The situation wrong blasting me out on the line in front of everyone. Should have pulled me to the side. Are Really in his office are management in that area.
good,"As part of the Leadership team at Amazon. I had the pleasure of communicating and interacting with all types of people on the daily bases. Managing and developing people on different tasks was an absolute joy. The typical work day would normally fly by due to the fact that we made sure we got orders out the door to the next facility or customer in a safe a timely fashion. Overall the company taught me that no matter the obstacle ahead, working as a cohesive unit is a sure fire way to get past an obstacle and safely."
good,"Yes, Amazon has a few drawbacks when it comes to balance, but I think that's entirely due to the nature of the business. Yes, it is hard work, fast paced and very physical - be prepared for that! You will walk, lift, sort, pick, and divert all shift. 30 minute lunch with two 15 minute breaks. Breaks are paid - lunch is not. Wonderful company culture and my manager was excellent! I worked only 24 hours per week but the pay was reasonable. It would have been nice to get more hours. You CAN pick-up some extra shifts when they are available. All-in-all I think Amazon is an exceptional employer and a good place to work."
good,Pretty relaxed work environment. Great staff that was nice and helping.  Great team work all around and Managers were super helpful.  Work got busy here and there.
good,"Intend on leaving because of pto days and unpaid time availability. Back breaking work and it’s so hard to get scheduled changed "
good,"wonderful, awesome company to work for.  encouragement, supportive but can be very stressful and some managers will make it very stressful. be ready to stand , walk, bend for more than 10 hours."
good,"Amazon is a great company to work for, assuming you actually WANT to WORK. It's not a job that you go to thinking you can slack off and get by, they pay good and expect superb work. The long hours took some getting used to, but after a while, that time flew by. Unfortunately, due to some carlessness I sufferred injuries that left me out of work, but besides that Amazon itself is a great company for those actually willing to work."
good,Casual work environment with the ability to wear your own clothing. Discounts and great insurance for family. The growth opportunity is very limited without higher education
good,J’ai été Manutentionnaire et préparateur de commande ça s’est bien passé
good,overall good work experience but required a lot of work and time in the job. Im glad I got tot work in a working and busy environment though. It made me mentally stronger to endure the work hours.
good,Its a lot of walking... If you want to lose weight this is the job for you. If you love walking this is the job for you....I would recommend this job to other people.. I definitely will go back... & pay is lovely & so are the paychecks...
good,nice people work here at amazon everyone treats you with respect and make sure your okay management could be better but other than that its a fantastic place to work
good,"Amazon is a good place to work, their work environment is fun but prepare to work. Management is positive and fair.   One of the qualities of Amazon is their Diversity, there are so many people of all ages and cultures, you'll meet a lot of good people and make friends."
good,"The work environment if very fast paced at times, but it can be rewarding, there is room for advancement.  There is a lot of competition for good paying positions."
good,it a great company it pays well typical work day is long but easy alot of my skills came from amazon management was ok and nothing about the job was hard
good,Virtual customer service position with Amazon is good for individuals that are looking for supplemental hours to go with their existing job or family life.  You are able to create a schedule that will fit your needs.
good,Lavoro su turni ben distribuito. Utilizzo di gestionali di ultima generazione.
good,amazon is a great place to work for a temporary place of work as they dont take many on for a permanent position. the hours are long but you get an extra day off.
good,"I’ve worked at the amazon fulfillment center for six months and I didn’t like the high expectations of that of the company standard and the demanding physical labor, if you applied for the fulfillment associate tier 1 position at any amazon fulfillment center in either inbound or in outbound be prepared with a bottled water as you work in very warm environments in either AFE, Stow, etc. Wear comfortable work shoes as you walk the facility for 13 miles a day on average for a 10 hour shift if cross training."
good,"It was a great place to work, but only if your in between college and find your career job. It was tiring because you're in a warehouse role, but the managers made it enjoyable. My warehouse was a training facility for new managers in the company so always adapting to changes was exhausting but over all a great place to work."
good,Work Culture is great at the company and there a lot of benefits that the company provides which are useful to employees. But training is very minimal and they don't inform the employee about the policies during joining.
good,"Good work environment & Great place to work, The company has good ambiance and work culture apart from the work load. Work load can be easily managed with work life balance"
good,Amazon fulfilment center really does not look like a warehouse. everything is very well organized & instructed. Good place to work but long hours. Talking to managers is easy.
good,Great place to work. Must want to work and keep up with pace though. It can be a awesome job if you have the right attitude. Pay is decent for the type of job.
good,"When i first applied to amazon, I was put into a ''picking position'. meaning i would have to get a company scanner and scan barcodes on totes to find items that will have to go out for shipment. My shift code was from Sunday through Wednesday working a total of 40 hours each week with Thursday, Friday, And Saturday off every week. About a little less than 600 people would show up for each shift and go a long with their scheduled duties and plans. The individuals in manger positions would work on the floor as much as regular employees did, helping out with whatever they needed to help with, which made them seem just like normal people and not just a manager. Although, the culture isn't too up to par with walking 10 hours a day, with carrying heavy boxes with only a step stool and being timed for each bathroom break or a second to catch a quick breath. There are many other conditions that are uncomfortable but that will be a conversation to the person who asked. With working 10 hours a day and being on your feet for 9 hours of it with limited breaks, there was never really a ''hard'' part of the job. It sure is fast-paced but you eventually adapt and adjust to the environment as soon as the shift is over. the most enjoyable part of the job, and i don't mean this in any selfish way, was the isolation. Being a picker meant going through the entire warehouse on your own searching for items, and that brought me some type of inner peace. But a big downside is that you really do not have time to talk. In conclusion i've learned that teamwork works when everyone is in it together, and"
good,Most of the time it was really fun during peak days everyone come in talking make jokes while getting our work done. You can ask to be moved so you can learn new things around the building.
good,I loved my job at Amazon great place to work only thing is I hated how they did call off's. If you run out of hours then your in hot water for termination.
good,Great environment and culture to work. Managers are very friendly and they support your well. Teams leads are always ready for any challenging role while facing customer.
good,"My Experience is good at amazon, they have my ways and activities  to less down the work load. The most enjoyable part of work is we can work any where."
good,Need to lift heave boxes at timed. Good working environment. Have to be on time to work. Manager is very friendly. You might have to work with delivery drivers every now and then
good,I was a seasonal full time Virtual Customer Service Associate. The job was good minus the rude and verbally abusive customers. Management could've been better!!! My old manager was busy trying to be friends and not the boss
good,"Loved working there, great place, fair work culture, lots of fun, awesome people."
good,"I would find my assigned work area and would pick up my device then go through our stretch time and information time. Overall, it is a pretty decent place to work. The benefits are very nice and we were always being offered free stuff. As well, there were drawings for high producers and other categories."
good,the management team knew what they were doing. It was a go environment to work in. The employees there are friendly and most everyone got alone find. I was a good experience
good,"Fast paced working environment. Safety is prioritized almost obsessive at Amazon. Employees in good spirits. VTO was common, if not regular. Management respective of employees."
good,Great Environment for Learning. Every project every decision is made from the customer point of view. Company have great leadership principle which can even grow you in your personal life
good,"Once you get to work, we clock in and have a morning meeting. We then place our packages inside of our work vans and once everyone’s done within a 10min window, we all head out to deliver one by one. This job has made me fall in love with the site of good neighborhoods and mansions. To the point where all I watch on YouTube is house tours lol. The hardest part of the job is the toll it takes on your body. Five days straight of hopping in and out of a truck over 150 times a day, dropping off 200+ packages is nothing but hours of cardio. The good thing about it is you lose weight lol. It’s an overall great job but they do make A LOT of changes."
good,"Obviously warehouse work is not meant for everyone, but Amazon is better then most! Benefits are amazing, but a lot of perks were recently taken due to restructured compensation plan."
good,Its a fast work place and easy but also as easy as messing up and getting write-ups. You work for 4 days and have 3 days off but you make your 40 hours.
good,The best thing about Amazon is the people. The work load is very fast pace which helps the day go by fast.  The second best thing about Amazon is the schedule most employee work a 4 day work week.
good,"I enjoyed my time there but the shifts were hard to do daily. 10 hour days took a toll on my body, working 11-12 hours during the holidays as well. Friendly people working with you and easy to work with."
good,"You clock in , work, take a break, work, go to lunch, work, take a break, work, and go home. It is a consistent work flow. On certain holidays they provide a meal for you such as Thanksgiving. A lot of incentives to perform better. I believe there is room for growth."
good,The company is great to work for. The hourly rate is not by any means a good balance to the JPH/UPH rate we are subject to meet. Managers are there at the beginning of shift but disappear as the shift goes on.
good,"Overall is a great company to work for. I haver been able to learn a lot about myself and develop as a leader. In addition I have been able to promote 2 times in less than 4 years with really good compensation.  Make no mistake you will work hard. A typical day at work is extremely fast pace. Starts with meetings to recap previous days performance, action items to fix and focuses for the day/week from the senior team. The work place culture is very competitive . I have never worked with so many intelligent people in one space. The hardest part of the job is learning how to balance. Work life balance is driven by your manager and your performance. It is not unusual to work 60-80 hours per week.  The most enjoyable part about the company is working for an exciting company that seem to break historic records on all levels. People take pride in working for Amazon and those you work with for the most part are very friendly, diverse in work history and background.  Realistically most people don't stay long because of how demanding it is. Average tenure is about 3-6 years due to burnout"
good,"The opportunity for career advancement is low and not enough positions for promotions, many employees are more qualify than some of the ones that get promoted and are not told the reason why are they not considered."
good,"Fun loving and a good company to work it. Never gives too much of work load and the madness that happens in the floor is loving."
good,"A typical day at work was pretty good, I answered the phone and with my chipper voice it was pretty easy to get the customer onto a good note. I improved my listening skills and learned more about how technology works. The hardest part of the job would have to be some of the stories you are told and the emotional turmoil that people go thru. Also I would say that the diversity at Amazon and the diversity in the customers we help can be one the hardest parts, and one of the most enjoyable parts of the job. You speak to people you know you disagree with, but are also in a position to hear their side of it and maybe rethink your own beliefs. The workplace culture was really great. It was like a family, that actually carries over outside of work. You make life long friends there. There could be improvements, like how they view mental and emotional issues. They are still one of the best, but there is room for improvement. Management is pretty darn good, they really care, and most go out of their way to help you."
good,"A typical work day is full-time hours working 1st shirt the pace is fast from start to end. Everyone is greeted with meeting at the start of the day along with stretching. I have learned to preview items on scanner to have a screenshot in my head as to what item I need to pull before I reach the bin. Management gives incentives to push productivity. The workplace culture is different from any job I have worked. There is no time for relationship building among the team. The hardest part of the job is the walking all day... The hardest part of the job my body would ache and feet would be very sore, on fire and sometimes swollen at the end of the day. The most enjoyable part of the job is break time(sitting down)."
good,"Great people, always having fun and working at the same time. Work around your schedule for your personal or other business time. There’s not any hard work at the job."
good,I was able to meet new and hardworking people in Amazon. However beside peak season Amazon was a very fun place to work. I enjoyed the gift wrapping and challenging  myself to beat my own rates.
good,"The company is large but feels like a many smaller companies which manage their own P&L's.  Some managers show strong leadership and manage their teams with insight and strong values, others do not.  "
good,"Typical day: Get to work, do stand up with associates along with stretches, Grab a working device and start picking routes."
good,"Very busy, fast paced place to work.  Worked at Sprouts."
good,The culture here at Amazon is unlike most companies. We encourage Associates to be outgoing and peculiar. In my time here at amazon i have seen my fair share of managers come and go with various backgrounds. the biggest failure i have seen are college graduates come in here with very little real world experience.
good,It's a good place to work. Great benefits. Decent pay. Hard work. The only thing that is not great is if you want to move up it's very comparative and usually impossible. If you are just looking for a job that pays the bills (with a side job if you live alone) this company is for you. There is a lot of money to be made if you are cross trained in other departments.
good,"Great environment to work in excellent training assistance, great hourly pay... I actually would say that it would be a great place to work for becoming a career..."
good,"Amazon has a great culture but they are very high paced. If you cannot keep up you cannot excel in that environment. I used to be simply an associate but became a splitter and a sorter. I also worked inbound which was highly stressful. You have to move at a certain pace in order to make your numbers. If not, there was always a warning or write-up."
good,"The companies interview process is well thought, so people with passion and talent end up there. You will be working with sharp people."
good,"I like doing picking work as it was very interesting,  I never knew what items I would be picking.  I was amazed at all the different things they had there. I was in the heavy weight division at first and I told them it was too heavy for me and asked for help with a couple of things but was told they were trying to Build my muscles"".  When I got hurt after being off for 6 months they transferred me to the light division but I still could not lift things and I am still having problems. I'm sorry for the negativity but I did not appreciate getting hurt there."
good,As a seasonal hire of a pilot program. I was hopeful it would carry into a full time position. Unfortunately they decided to terminate the program and stay with contracted delivery companies.
good,Stowed incoming merchandise; picked merchandise per customer's orders; sorted customer bags by routes; stock merchandise on designated labelled shelves; stocked merchandise in necessary chilled environment (i.e. refrigerator or freezer); sorted and processed returned merchandise; and segregated meats from produce
good,"Good working experienced, nice culture , my room to company is too distance, journey is uneasy to mine. Good staff, good to treat everyone,  salary is every month correct time."
good,"It's a part time. I still get free vision and dental insurance, I get no money taking from me. I have 401k. You can accumulate 1 hr of sick time after 30 hrs of work. You get 30 hrs of Upt (unpaid time off) when you become an employee and 20 more every quarter. And they offer voluntary time off sometimes, in case you don't want to show up for work. And you get employee discounts on selected items when ordering. You want to leave early you can either use sick time or Upt, and no questions will be asked."
good,"Work varies in pace. During the weekdays, it can be slow, while the weekends, can be stressful and hectic. Work schedule and hours are first come first serve, so if you want to keep this job, be vigilant. The workplace culture is team based and very social, though you can succeed without social interaction, teamwork seems to be what proves to be most successful around the work place. The hardest part about this job is keeping up a steady pace and hitting the average statistic for everything that you do. The most enjoyable part of the job is its culture and flexibility. It is quite literally ""Work Hard, Have Fun"""
good,Fast paced environment. Room to move up and grow. Mangers come and go and with that leaves a lot to be desired. Just when you prove yourself to one boss a new one comes and takes their place
good,"Overall, good organization to start your career"
good,"buon ambiente lavorativo, ottima esperienza sul campo lavorativo come magazziniere"
good,Good place to work. Learning and memory is essential. There are many people working for the same position that keeps the shifts almost impossible to get the hours desired. You pick your own schedule.
good,"it depends different department, some of them are very fast pace work and it dose not offer free lunch which is one weak point because it is hard to find somewhere is good for lunch."
good,"My time at Amazon was the most productive, stimulating, and educational time in my career. Although it lacked in some areas like parental leave, and employee grievance handling, it is a place that catches up and even excels quickly when any optimization becomes a priority, including it's cultural and workplace environment. Great, smart people, but highly susceptible to politics...internal mobility among leaders is often destabilizing to workers."
good,"I loved my coworkers--other warehouse workers, but half of the warehouse ""Ambassadors"" have much to be desired. The VERY fast pace took some time to get used to, but i enjoyed it."
good,"This is a fast paced job.  You will be expected to keep 2 different types of performance requirements above 100%.  These are quality and productivity.  They are very strict on these. Top people get rewards.  Slower people get ""coachings"". You can be fired for a performance of 99% .  This  job is not for lazy people.  It's also a bit tougher on the 45+ age bracket.  You are on concrete all day.  A bit tough on joints over time.   Also, unless you have a college degree, (doesn't matter what field, could be underwater basket weaving) you will NOT be promoted.  Life experience does not count at Amazon.  Almost all management is under 45."
good,"Overall a good place to work if you don’t have tons of responsibilities. The hours were flexible; but almost too flexible, as you’d sometimes end up with 8pm-2am shifts if you weren’t on top of requesting your hours."
good,I feel that it was a good job experience because I had learned how to talk and how to go about every day things. As well me as a man learned how to work with others and focus on my work title.
good,"When you publish with Amazon, they control the ISBN number and barcode, but this really helps new authors who don't want to handle the legal legwork. Their system is fair, simple and very transparent."
good,"the job is what is in the description, there's lots of orders. you get order, walk to get product, put in bag. done. on to the next one. management is getting better with iteration of operations. difficult is when you get assigned in the freezer on your shift. dress for the location and pick orders. most enjoyable part is the 5-10 mins of talking and quiet time with your co-workers."
good,"The job at Amazon is fast paced, can be stressful, and is sometimes tiring."
good,"I enjoyed the job until they decided to get rid of my position and thousands of employee positions around the nation. it was slow paced, not commission based sales position to introduce amazon products to people who do not do a lot of online shopping."
good,"Job Security has limits. Work environment can be stressful. Management needs more planning skills. Training needs more work Good team work. I enjoyed working with maintenance team,"
good,"Fulfillment center has a rotating schedule, so adults with kids you will have to work nights and it sucks. Benefits are superber. Leadership is  always available to address any concerns and provide solutions. Awesome company to work for, constant change and new policy updates weekly."
good,"I mainly sorted, scanned and loaded boxes of customers orders onto a delivery truck. Hardly no down time at all. The hardest part of the job was having to wait an hour and a half between shifts sometimes and I couldn't leave the building because our cars were parked a mile down the street from the actual building where I worked. You had to take a shuttle to and from your car. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with some really great people. I learned a lot on the job."
good,"requires fast pace speed"
good,"My work in the early years in Amazon das a diferent work experience thank other job. I really, apreciate the opportunityopportunity  I was given, in these years I learned new cultures and socialize with different people. Apart I had the opportunity to learn more English and I feel more secure in my perfomance as a worker (associate), of Amazon ."
good,Positive culture but has to be more consistent throughout all Amazon buildings. Amazon has a great mission to deliver the best customer experience but comes at a cost towards employees. Sometimes employees are too overworked with very high standards.
good,"Travail assez physique et strict, où il est question de rapidité et d'efficacité. Malgré cela, les managers sont très accueillants et ouverts. Ambiance de travail agréable."
good,"Decent, fun, relaxed place to work.  "
good,I love amazon that was one of the best jobs I had yet . but when you go threw them its a hard to keep your job threw them and temp. a lot of people lose faith in them because there layoff is very high.
good,"I enjoyed myself working at Amazon. Great culture, supportive colleagues. Always available to assist when needed. Benefits of being picked up for the early morning shifts and being dropped off at home on late shifts."
good,"Very interesting place to work. Benefits were amazing. The only thing I had a problem with was they had very poor management,atmosphere was warming. Overall a good place to work."
good,"Generally, one of the best employer that I ever had. Great training, very useful feedback, massive support, strictly rules. I enjoyed most of my days as a part of Amazon team, driving mostly by the sea. The hardest part of this job is during the evening, when is dark, because is harder to find the right address."
good,"-typical day at work: roles/ assignments varied every day and you never did the same exact thing all the time! you could be scanning packages and building pallets, transporting pallets, unloading boxes from trucks, sorting smaller envelopes into hundreds of different containers, or something else. There were so many different things you could do there, but every role was very fast- paced, physically demanding, and required strong attention to detail (you had to read labels carefully and sort them into the correct locations). "
good,"Working at Amazon can be tiring sometimes but time goes by quickly because of how fast-paced everything is. Tasks are not difficult. If you do find yourself having a hard time, your coworkers will help you. Great thing about Amazon is that it's a team environment."
good,"It is a good company to work for.  If you are for physical labor it is good for you, if not do not apply.  I think advancement opportunities is an area they can improve on.  They need more areas to look into and the interview process could be improved on.  If you want to go into management that is the only area to advancement to, so the option are limited.  Role is pretty easy and not too complicated. Can move into other indirect roles after proving yourself in your direct path.  Management at times can be a little unorganized, no backup plans, but they are friendly in general."
good,"a typical work day a amazon is fast paced, you have to you proper time management to reach productivity. safety is always advised, along with productivity, I've learned to work as part of a team to meet the productivity standards and also have fun doing so. management was tolerable, some more fun than other; i believe it was a great place to work, you get to meet and interact with different people. the hardest part of the job, i didn't have a hard time really, because the tasks were repetitive so you learn pretty quickly. the most enjoyable part of the job was that you basically get paid to have fun, be productive and be a part of something great."
good,"temporary employee but overall a good company, a lot of heavy lifting and picking orders to load on the truck,clean up the facility and also help were ever they needed help in"
good,"My time there was fun met a lot of cool people enjoyed productivity but didn’t enjoy how unorganized there were people taking other people things, making them having to finish their job longer. Some people didn’t want to help because it was early in the morning and they was still tired."
good,super place to work i learned a lot of things and i was the site incharge and maintaining the IT store in my site and helping the employees to solve their issues
good,You have a common stand up area to be informed of what productivity is for the day. And any other activities for the day. Exercise to start shift every work day. Shifts are 4 hr + or - per work day.
good,"Working at an amazon warehouse, I’ve gain most of my warehouse knowledge working there. There where a lot of up and down days but nothing too much to handle."
good,"Peak season gets heavy as usual"
good,"Great place to work and learn business, however need to sacrifice personal time."
good,"Easy job to do, the pay is fair for the difficulty of the work and they are very accommodating to special needs. The managers are all really nice and are willing to work with employees to help them keep up."
good,"During my time as a Student Brand Manager for Amazon UK I was able to work as a leading part of an autonomous marketing team. The management was fairly hands off, however I felt this was positive for the overall outcome of our marketing campaign, as we were able to independently assess and tailor our strategies to our specific area. The work consisted of using various strategies, including face to face contact and social media and was generally engaging, interesting and enjoyable."
good,"I enjoyed working there, they take care of the employees. I was not happy that I tried to transfer to Florida with them, they told me I made to much money for Florida  workers."
good,Learned new skills about EHS Specialist. Workplace culture was very nice and helpful. Associates will push back on many items but will cooperate with you if you discuss corrective actions
good,I worked from home for Amazon and it was a great experience. There was ample time off available and the benefits were amazing. My job was always growing and changing so I was never bored.
good,"I would recommend Amazon."
good,Great place to work but can get very tiring as you are stood on your feet for 10 hours and the work is constant but is very enjoyable. Great atmosphere and great people
good,"What was not bad place to work. I was working on a peak time, salary was not bad when You work overtimes, but without overtimes its not good enoth for me."
good,"5 star✴✴✴✴✴"
good,"very fast paced and hard work but they made it fun. However, when work was low the rate was never adjusted to fit the pick paths or the work load that was on hand. Basically, if you didn't make rate because the pick path was bad because there was no work the rate was not adjusted to fit that days needs on orders."
good,Amazon is a great place to work depending on where you find yourself. I had a great working experience and learned a lot from working there. The culture is not for everyone as they are heavily customer focused at any cost. The management is a very technical management and everyone knows their stuff so you learn everyday.
good,"Amazon is a 'you' company, where you decide whether you want to work for them or not. A typical day depends on where you are working. I learned about packing, and shipping. The management is there to help you if you have any questions, concerns or if any issues arise within your work environment. The workplace culture is very laid back, you'll always find somebody to talk to during breaks, and the managers are easy to talk to, you don't feel like they are a boss. The hardest part is working a twelve-hour shift if you choose to work that specific shift, however, it is only for three days, and the pay is phenomenal. I recommend working at Amazon, whenever they update their site to allow you to apply, that is."
good,Existe muita divisão nos setores por esse motivo se torna desmotivante trabalhar la.
good,My shift is very relaxed. I deal with the flex drivers. Just making sure the drivers pick up the correct route based on how many hrs they picked for their block.
good,Amazon is a fun company.to work with. The various activities help by Amazon at office gives us a break from work stress and Amazon takes care of its employees well.
good,"Mind numbingly boring is the way I describe the work I performed during my time with Amazon. If you're okay with that then the work and the pay aren't bad,"
good,"Viel dynamische Arbeit. Ich fand das besser, das der Chef/Manager  ist immer flexibel und verfügbar."
good,It would go by fast and easy. I learned to manage my time well. It was an overall good place to work. I liked working at Amazon. I would recommend if you're looking for a warehouse job.
good,"Definite favoritism played, little opportunity for advancement without relocation, requests to be trained on or work in certain areas typically ignored. But it is a pretty good company, especially when it comes to benefit of the doubt and understanding life happens. Was given 3 weeks UPT off for medical reasons and had to quit the week I was set to come back and they still rehired me a couple weeks later, they work with you on time off when things come up, and off Voluntary Extra Time and Voluntary Time Off often."
good,"If you like fast work its fun. Times goes by fast. At times its like your at the gym, from unloading trucks, to inducting, to diverting, its all comes together as a pretty good workout."
good,things were faster paced than I was expecting and back was aching for weeks. I had to always take pain medication.but the hours were great and what I was looking for
good,"Amazon was an okay place to work. I was not dissatisfied with my job whatsoever. The benefits at were great and the atmosphere was welcoming. The problem with Amazon, is that you better be willing to work if you get a job with them; also room for advancement is few and far in between. They have their own internal hiring system, which makes it tough to get promoted from within."
good,I really enjoyed working at Amazon and would love the opportunity to be a part of their team again. I enjoyed that the company was easily accessed from my home
good,"Amazon is a good company to work for. The work is fast paced which keeps you busy. There are times when the line goes down so you can't work. In these cases they sometime send you home or you have to keep yourself busy by doing other things. Everyone is very friendly, but there is sometimes miscommunication from  management."
good,And are quite responsive to employee concerns. They constantly ask for feedback and call you if they want more data. Good performers quickly identified and promoted to ambassador and leadership.
good,"Good company to work for, but stressful.The management was amenable, but had unrealistic time-lines. Very fast paced-work but nothing over whelming (at least for myself)."
good,"Great place to work but a lot of walking if you a picker but great exercise if u want to shed some weight. They tend to watch your time off task a lot where going"
good,The people I work with are very friendly. If I have any questions or concerns it is easy to approach a manager for assistance. Managers care about what you talk to them about and are timely in taking care of any employee needs.
good,"The job paid good, I had plenty of opportunities for overtime, had full health insurance from the beginning, I always got 40 hours a week. The job is really fast-paced but if you're use to being on your feet it's not that bad."
good,"great place to meet others with different backgrounds. its environment isn't as most warehouses. very competitive but stressful at the same time. its more or so ""everyone for themselves"" at the end of the day."
good,"AMAZON is a dream company to work."
good,I learned how to work in a fast paced environment. The management was pretty fair. As long as you do what you suppose to do. The workplace was filled with different people of different cultures. The hardest part of the job was getting the morning started. The most enjoyable part getting pay while exercising.
good,Started out as an hourly associate and advanced to salaried operations manager. The company still does the stack ranking of their managers which results in really good managers being terminated.
good,"It was great experience working at Amazon, as they say work hard, have fun and make history. I would anytime would like to return to work for them again"
good,"It’s was a good places to work it was just at the time I wasn’t getting  enough hours to work and I really didn’t like the night  shift, but the day shifted was good."
good,"Everything was digital, so you can call off by using the company site. Clock in on a digital clock and walk to stand up. At stand up leadership would tell you the goals for the day while you stretched and prepared your computers or scanners. Get to work as soon as possible. If you worked night shift, you got all of the bad trucks or left over trucks from day shift. 15 min. breaks and 30 min lunches. There was a little bit of movement as to what you were doing, but only if you had the training for it and management had to approve it or ask for you to receive it. Some of the management was cool and they were nice people. they got switched around a lot so it was uncommon to have the same leadership for very long. The good thing was that many positions kept coming available so you can be promoted. Its alot of physical labor but if you are hired with a good group of people then it is fun. Kinda feels like a high school with all of the drama that happens. we did have a case where a guy was harassing a lot of the women and it was reported to management and they transferred him to a position where he was on a rate, when he couldn't meet the criteria, he was fired. I enjoyed the job because of the people and all of the training that i had received. I worked there for about 8 month and i was already trained in multiple stations and was being considered for a processing assistant position in inbound receiving."
good,"On a typical day we process 80,000 to 100,000 packages, and most of those come through Small Sort. We sort those packages according to Zip Code. Our facility helps ensure that our customers will get their packages in an efficient and timely manner. While the main goal is delivering our customers' packages as quickly as possible, management still emphasizes safety of the associates. They als try to make it a fun atmosphere. The hardest part of my job is its physical nature. We are constantly moving, lifting, pulling. What I enjoy most in my job is the people I work with."
good,"At Amazon, I was able to drastically improve my leadership skills and my ability to quickly make decisions. They are great about providing leaders with the tools and training needed to be successful."
good,"Cool place to work, meet tons of new people which not all are friendly but overall most of them were. Management was decent, you had some that really cared and some that didn't care at all. Production isn't hard to get in my opinion, but many struggle to reach it due to the lack of commitment."
good,"forse l'unica cosa che dovrebbero migliorare è l'aspetto UMANO, ma non si può avere tutto !!!!!!!!!!!!!"
good,"At Amazon I had to pick and scan items, put them in a cart until its full. Then I take them to the front so they can be wrapped up or put in boxes so they can be shipped."
good,"Straightforward job, my only gripe would have to lie in the fact that the warehouse was fairly new and thus most of the employees and management were still trying to grasp some type of understanding of warehouse etiquette and management. Other than that it was a very friendly and conducive work environment."
good,"I like to work in amazon becase the managers are so nice and not bossing."
good,I learned a lot about myself working at Amazon. I didn't enjoy answering the phone and not being able to help customers face to face. The hardest part for me was trying to keep my cool when there was an irate customer blaming you for things out of your control. I had 3 managers during my year working for Amazon. It's a good place but there is no HR in a firm place for remote workers to call into. Benefits were good but I just do not think I fit with helping customers over the phone.
good,"it was a fast paced environment with no time to do idle chatter, you must make sure you are paying attention to what needs to be done and complete it to the best of your ability. There are always managers available to help you through any difficulty or answer any questions that you may have."
good,"as an employee i found the best working environment till now in amazon."
good,"In the time I have been with the company (10+ years), I have seen a lot of changes and a lot of new opportunities develop in that growth.  We have grown from a company known for selling books and videos to several dozen product lines, our own private brands and even a full TV/movie streaming service and production company."
good,Overall it was a good place to work. It was extremely fast paced and competetive but the lack of ability to advance in a career there made it not for me im the end.
good,"Amazon in my personal experience is something of an institution that can forge people into better leaders. You are in constant proximity of very smart and intelligent people, you can grow and learn exponentially. You need a tough skin to work with and around less than favorable leaders, hinting at the leadership principles can open up many doors. Complacency is not accepted at most locations, this is not a place to go in and become stagnant. You come in , work very hard, push yourself and others mentally and physically more so and go home feeling content, exhausted, pleased, or defeated. These opportunities allow you to improve and grow to move up or move onto another place of business, or go into business for yourself."
good,"Amazon believes in Work hard, have fun, make history."
good,"I learned alot at this place, sorting, packing, driving the order picker. The environment was nice, the people there were amazing. The hardest part about it was it was 10 hour shifts but other than that it was enjoyably."
good,"Free coffee for employees and a safe place to work "
good,"Hours were flexible, customers were cooperative, management responded quickly to any issues I had. Only issue would be that they offered no phone number to call if email was not available."
good,Man kann seine Arbeit machen ohne ständig von irgendwelchen Leute unterbrochen zu werden.
good,It was quite different from my previous jobs but it felt good doing something else for a change. A good working environment and also lovely staffs and co workers.
good,I have no comment at this time. Amazon is a growing company with a huge upside. Life work balance is good for a 4 day work week but the hours are long and hard in the warehouse.
good,"Typical day at Amazon is you are always moving around, it is a fast pace job. I like to learn new things, so in a few weeks I learned quite a lot different parts of the job."
good,"Great place to work. Highly encouragina and energetic crowd to work with. Greater exposure to professional life."
good,I would get to the workplace around 6:50 am and load my van. Then I would wait until 8:00 to leave and start delivering packages. I got two fifteenth minute breaks and one thirty minute lunch.  I would be back to the warehouse around five everyday.
good,"I'm new at this company and i love it its a fast pace job and very physical. So far management have been amazing with me and they answer all my question can't wait to see how many pounds i can loose in the long run,"
good,Fun place to work. Great benefits and family atmosphere. There is the daily use of heavy equipment and safety equipment. Superviser is friendly and personable.
good,The part I liked the most about Amazon is everyone got a long really well. All the employees were always so friendly to everyone and made new people just as welcomed.
good,"Working at Amazon was an amazing experience. It was a fast paced job, especially around the holiday seasons. The job could get stressful especially if there was not any work, making it hard to make rate."
good,This place is fast paced and hot. Thank goodness they added fans and portable ac units around the building. Training isn't that great but the workers are great at helping you understand and catch up.
good,"Je m'occupais du contrôle des articles retournée en SAV."
good,"this is a very lively environment and i was able to work independently, I was able to learn a lot from colleagues and senior managers, they also had flexible hours"
good,"I worked here for a short time while in between jobs. I was an order picker. "
good,I liked that they trained each employee for each aspect of the job. We were taught how to use the scan guns in addition to distributing and stowing the packages.
good,"Amazon's canteen has a well organised and well put in place procedures for staff to work in a safe environment. Staff are"
good,"I have gained a lot of experience in supervising large group of people. I have gained knowledge how to deal with poor performance, absents and resolving conflicts."
good,"the job is fast paced, but not stressful, it's physically demanding, it takes a few days to get used to. it has good days off.it offers good benefits."
good,"- Repetitive work."
good,"Opportunity to work from home with a reputable and customer driven company. Able to provide great customer service in the comfort of my own home. "
good,This job is not for everybody but it if you like a challenge and like to be apart of a team this is the place you want to be. There are certain systems in place that set you up for success within the company just ask questions.
good,"Le rôle était un environnement très rapide et répétitif. L'une des nombreuses grandes choses à propos d'Amazon était sa culture diversifiée. Ils ont embauché tous les milieux, des anciens combattants aux handicapés, en passant par les retraités."
good,It’s  a job at the end of the day. Sure it’d be better if we got paid more but I guess that’s about to change November 1st... it’s still a pretty chill job.
good,Learned a lot of work and the culture here makes me comfortable to work. No much pressure of work. Given time of 8 to 9 hours a day is all you need to work and 2 days weekoff gives the best of rest and work balance
good,"Was a fast paced great job, I got overtime and good pay. The management treatment is great and you are able to advance with hard work and dedication, all and all a great place to work."
good,"My shift was from 5 am to 10 am and everyday I never had a reason to complain about the time, because they kept me busy, but also kept it friendly. I would walk in and it would be like its in the middle of the day. All managers were upbeat and helpful and so were most of my co-workers! Honestly, not many complaints besides some facilities need a better A/C system and when loading packages onto vehicles, vehicles should accommodate for the fact that we have to arrange heavy bags while bent over. This can cause serious back problems, but other than that it would be a good job !"
good,"Un bel posto di lavoro soprattutto il trattamento dei capi"
good,nobody was on your back very easy work long hours also long days nice people really didn't have a set manager but any manager you could really talk to
good,"As long as you are prepared to work hard and not stand around and talk you will excel"
good,Fun place . not back breaking but exhausting . No room for flexibility with hours. you come in and know exactly when youll be leaving. Not the BEST with communication but Amazon does strive to hear everyone.
good,Straightforward warehouse job.  Overall the job is not that difficult.  They have 30-minute lunches and 2 fifteen minute breaks a shift.  A lot of walking is required.
good,Nice place to work.  Operated forklift and prepared orders for customers.  Was only a seasonal job so I didn't work there very long. Staff was always nice
good,"Not the worst job, as the hours aren't the worse, but management was all over the place and couldn't connect on the same things. Worse part of the job was the nature of trying to get more hours, but eh trust given to it's workers is a huge plus."
good,"fun place to work people were  friendly.managers easy going very clean building supplied with utencils vending machines if you forget your lunch tv,video games and ping pong tables for your enjoyment on breaks"
good,There loyal to there customers fast problem solving skills and make sure all customers order are shipped out correctly and on time. They are also Good to there employer because like they say with Happy employers means good work.
good,Working at Amazon was a great experience but however there are some  unprofessional workers and a lot of unorganized things in their work force. I really did enjoy working there
good,"Great work environment, set schedules, paid time off/holidays , good management, always something to do, two fifteen minute breaks, some days catered lunch."
good,"10 hour days and overtime on holidays. 10 hour days we good tho, cuz you only had to work 4 days a week. is a job thats good if you like being physical."
good,It is a nice place to work but the salary I get paid and the job are not balanced.  I love what I do but it is better if the company balanced the capacity of the work that employees do and the salary they paid are equal.
good,I hurt my knee but could not afford to pay for rehab and was told I could be crosstrained for a role with less walking and stair climbing but once I went out on medical leave waiting for the doctor to fill out my paperwork I had a hard time getting the HR department on the phone. I called five times in a week and never heard back until they let me go saying i had been on leave for to long. I tried getting in touch with someone but never heard back.
good,"When I arrived at the UK my first employer was Amazon. I worked at one of the biggest warehouse in a few section (packer, 5S, ICQA). "
good,You have to work hard but the pay is good. We had one paid break besides that your on your feet all day. The work was simple when you got the hang of it.
good,This is a great place to work for young people and  those who desire to learn new things and grow with a successful company. There are loads of opportunity for those who are developing their skills. I loved being apart of the greatness.
good,"Fun place to work. Casual attire and no micro management. Some days it is hard work, large boxes. You get your exercise in for sure. When it is busy you are always moving so the work day flies by."
good,I enjoyed the flexibility for time off Amazon allowed.  They offer every employee after a year to further there education at little or no cost to employee.  Also offer classes on sight.  I was able to get two certifications through this program at very little cost out of pocket.  Also will allow flexibility in your hours to attend your classes.  Super grateful for this additional education.
good,"I was always on the move and never stayed a one station long, due to the demand I was assigned to work all over not being able to master one particular station."
good,"Amazon was a great place to work in term of the benefits and the growth, I would definitely recommend working for them. I've enjoyed working for them especially when it comes to advancements of my career."
good,A Typical day of work consist of concentration as well as learn new roles in your own job. I believe the hardest part of your job is doing more than one  primary role.You can have up to three roles if not  6 Job functions by just one year. Management changes constantly as well as managers. The most enjoyable part is when you finally attain the goals that align for both you and the company.
good,"I started at Amazon as a Scanner as all Associates do.  During my two years there I have had the opportunity to work in several different areas - the Mezzanine, Yard Transportation, Sort Slide, Staging and Problem Solve.  I currently work exclusively as a Problem Solve Associate and find it challenging and rewarding. When you get to work and are faced with 6-8 pallets of damaged products, it is fun to see how much work you can get through as every item you fix is going to get to the customer on time."
good,Enjoyed working and had a good learning experience. Excellent benefits given to employee. Good work culture is maintained which makes fun and easy to work every day
good,"Packing orders and  sorting products for various orders, taping boxes shut, ensuring all items are in an order, surveying three level library for the products. consistently changed so managers cant be evaluated. The stress on the body was rough. Learned dedication to a goal"
good,ok job if this is your preference of job type not the best job IF you are seeking career growth you have to comfortable with the pay rate long term if you plan to stay long term rate goals are unrealistic and turn over rates reflects
good,Depending on what department you work at Amazon can be a great place to work. However they usually start you off in one of the most stressful fast paced areas to see if you can keep up with a sometimes unrealistic rate. If you are able to keep up within the 3 month probation period and able to move out of that department its not a bad place to work.
good,"Working for Amazon was a good experience, because the job challenges you to get better at the task that is assigned to you. The managers were fair most of the time accept when they favor one associate over another, but i know that there is favoritism at every job."
good,Will push you to be great but can cause friction with work-life balance. Fast-paced atmosphere that can sometimes be sink or swim depending on the team you land on. Plenty of focus on development if you have an engaged manager.
good,Very good benefits.  Medical Insurance on day 1 (blue badge- permanent employee) Paid Time Off up to 40 hrs a year. Vacation 3+ hrs every 2 weeks (when you get paid) depend on the length of time you are there.  Really isn't a bad place to work.  I got the schedule I wanted Sun-Wed.  I wish they paid weekly.
good,"Amazon is a great job with amazing benefits where you can move up the corporate ladder easily, but is physically draining if you don't get an easier job. The jobs you get as an associate are labor intensive and you don't really get any satisfaction out of it besides knowing that you helped out a customer. Unless you get personal satisfaction out of a job well done like I do, you'll feel under appreciated and over worked. Your body is exhausted at the end of a work week. If you get an indirect roll your job is easier and more enjoyable, but those rolls are limited to whether there is an open position. All and all the benefits are great and the time off is wonderful as long as you don't go stir crazy and AA postion. You have to take initiative to move up and not be overworked all the time."
good,"loved the atmosphere. i learned how to handle a package and box it up fast and place on my harness,  . 2- 30 min  breaks. love the fact they take safety very seriously ."
good,"Productive,fast phased.worked as a sorting associate.friendly atmosphere,friendly team and very busy day.Flexible schedule,weekly payments, some benefits"
good,A fast paced work place where you will be stay busy.  Little down time.  Multiple roles so if you need a change it's possible to do something different everyday.
good,"I work at home through Amazon.com as a novelist. I can work from home, at a coffee shop, or even while at my current job. No stress unless I am stuck on a chapter, which is the worst feeling.  I love working alongside Amazon and continue to write another book in the meantime."
good,"Very easy job, you walk a lot, the food trucks pulls up in front of the building, everyone gets along with one another, and it pays good. They check on you from time to time, to see how your holding up."
good,"Really nice staff and supervisors."
good,There is a diverse group of people who work at Amazon which makes it fun. Also receiving benefits day one makes it great as well. You also get more than one way to take days off and get paid for  it.
good,I was a driver and it was a pretty straight forward job. Basically delivering packages in a timely manner and make sure that it got to the designated location in one piece.
good,I like the company over all its a lot of room for growth and opportunities to travel.  The culture is different from other jobs I worked at but I feel it works for the company which is why they are the richest company.
good,"As an intern experience, Amazon is a good place to learn and work. You will get real experience on industry level and work with full time entry level workers."
good,I worked during holiday season.  Good job with good compensation. Long hours with overtime opportunities. Make sure you buy a good pair of running shoes!
good,Amazon was a lot of work on your feet but that comes with any warehouse job. They supplied enough time off and keeping up with the per hour rate was fun.
good,"Be willing to be a team player and work hard everyday.  Managers usually help develop employees by giving them weekly feedback on your performance, and coach you on how to improve."
good,"It is a nice paying job, but the overnight shift I will not work again. However I would say it is a good job for someone who is in school or just looking for extra income idk."
good,"I would go to work and find a parking space. I learned how to scan items into the system, pack bags onto a van, and organized packages into specific bags for drivers. Management was great at what they did. They always helped out when needed, knew exactly what to do, and had an answer for every question. They were always available for whatever you needed. They liked to order food for us, and train us on new things they required us to do."
good,"Good for advancement if wanting to work in a office or warehouse setting. Also great to meet different people of all ages and backgrounds. 95% of time, standing is only permitted."
good,"Amazon is a fun job and great learning experience. Its a fast pace job so you will be fit in no time. If you pay attention during your training session, you will catch on very fast becasue its a easy job."
good,Good job until they started doing some ne rules. Getting rid of the better leads and cutting hours of most of my coworkers.  Not ensuring full time pay after full time was promised.
good,Horrible hours. Their is no such thing as work life balance at Amazon. Peak times require massive OT which negatively impacts your life. they run 22/7 so the amount of good shifts are reduced.
good,"Great place to work. You will learn Amazon culture, the only con is the pay. You can move up rather quickly working at Amazon. They have a lot of there own process that once you learn can be used anywhere."
good,"this job is not complex at all, will be on phone helping customers with issues they have with package deliveries. long period of time sitting. must have strong problem solving skills"
good,It was a good job but the only downfall was if you were working two jobs. They have mandatory overtime which if it didn't work in your favor you can lose you job.
good,No complaints on my end. Very laid back atmosphere. I really feel as if the management cares for you and will go the extra mile to look out for it’s employees. It’s also climate controlled which helps the overall decision.
good,"I enjoyed working at Amazon. Unfortunately I had to relocate. My supervisor was encouraging and taught me how to challenge myself. My coworkers were friendly and I never had any problems with anyone. The work environment was energetic and fun. Keep on your toes, keep and clean and clear work station. Safety first always! Follow safety regulations and everything will be fine."
good,"Amazon is perfect for those who seek a challenge, this company will throw everything at you and you have to think fast to solve problems. Always putting customers first"
good,"Learned a lot about people. Met a diversified crowd here which was the best part. The most enjoyable part was when there was no work. Amazon treats its employees at its best with all the perks and benefits it provides. To be honest, it was really difficult to leave this job."
good,Job is considered fast pace and stressful but if you have no issues with working at a fast pace and In your own designated packing area for 10-12 hours a day then this job is perfect for you.
good,"A typical day includes customer after customer asking where their stuff is, yelling at you for not knowing precisely and not helping them, while sometimes it's simply an older gentleman who can't read and isn't technologically literate.  You get your good and bad customers, but it can be very fast paced and very hard to keep up."
good,"Overall I enjoyed my time at Amazon.com. You have to have a bit of a workaholic mentality, but overall solid culture. Wish my department had a little more opportunity to work remotely, but loved my team members!"
good,"Relaxed, yet very fast pace. As long as you keep a steady pace you will meet your required numbers. I would recommend this place to a friend. A typical day would consist of the following. Get to work scan in, put your things in the lockers, badge in, go to work area, do stretches, learn safety tip for the day from management and then go do your designated job. Very simple. Nothing there was hard for me but as others would complain about the fast pace and not being able to meet there expected numbers or the amount of walking you had to do. The thing I liked about the job the most is getting to walk around meeting new people and driving P.I.T equipment."
good,"There were four different shifts (2 night shifts; 2 day shifts) at this location. Back half of the week on night shift was three 12 hour shifts a week (Thurs - Sat) and the other shifts were four 10 hour days. The work can be very fast paced and difficult for some. You have to be used to walking or standing for long periods of time. The best part about this particular location, I made quite a few friends with similar interests and we hung out on our days off. Management changes quite a bit, at least once every 6 months in each department. Stock plans after 2 years of work have a great advantage and help with upping your pay if you don't have tons of bills (in my case I did and could no longer afford to work there)."
good,"Amazon management takes the time to get to know every employee as well as they can and are generally very good about responding to any questions, comments, or concerns that you may have.  The benefits are too hard to pass up, but you definitely have to be willing to put in some work ."
good,amazing experience of two years. i wish I could have relocated and continued with Amazon. i have learned a lot about operations from the company. it was the best thing after the armed forces
good,I liked that work would advise on 1st place as warehouse jobs only thing i left for i could balance my life with shift pattern. Very lovely kinda warehiuse ow and one more negative. Canteen food. Terrible
good,"A typical day at work was very fast pace starting out going through security, having daily group meeting and stretches, going to your designated workspace prearranged, working at a rate depending on your job, taking your lunch and two breaks, and going through security to go home. I learned about the many step processes of internet shipping. The management were really cool and usually worked there way up from an entry-level position. The work place culture was very friendly and as long as work was completed, everyone could talk to each other. the hardest part of the job was the days were you might be too tired and want to stop. the most enjoyable part is making your rate or going beyond that!"
good,"Management at my facility is great and very accommodating, especially since I have had to be put on light duty. The organization of the company is phenomenal and very impressive. I work at a part time facility at the sort center. It requires a lot of physical work in most of the positions which is very straining on the body. Definitely a company for advancement opportunity if you can stick it out."
good,"Challenging, fast paced, opportunities for advancement, and over time is available.  The hours require you to work either in the evening or weekends. Overall not a bad place to work."
good,I Love the work and I love my fellow co-workers.  The management is a great bunch of people of all backgrounds. Some days are tougher than others but they provide a great work environment.
good,"I was a picker, I walked a lot in a day..loved the physical activity."
good,"as a dock worker who is trained to do almost everything there can get hectic. As I am always getting replaced somewhere to help other stations with whatever they need help with. "
good,Be prepared to stand and walk for several hours. Have good shoes. The pay is decent and the benefits are great and offered from day one. The break room and cafeteria are pretty awesome.
good,It was very high stress work environment however the people and staff there were nice. They helped through thick and thin and provided me with the support I needed to do my job well
good,"Good Way To Start It Being My First Job, You Could Switch To Nights And Days If Needed, But Sometimes Your Hardship Transfers Are Not Approved Due To The Financial Team Of Amazon And Them Trying To Keep The Work Place Balanced. HR Sometimes Does Not Really Pay Attention To Some Of The Associates Situations And Most Of Them Have No Clie What Options You Have. But Not All HR Are The Same. The Job Can be A Little Stressful, But Overall  It Is A Good Paying Job With Great Benefits That I Feel You Wont Find Anywhere Else."
good,"I have worked for Amazon for over 2 years. I have always enjoyed my work there. It is very fast paced and a lot of physical work is involved. The benefits are unbeatable. The main complaint I have is that it does not matter how hard you work and prove yourself - when there is an opening for promotion - they always choose from past applicants and do not even look at the new applicants trying to be promoted. My rate there has been between 134% and 195% since the day I started. I have not had one single quality error. I train new employees, rebin, water spider, pick, and chase order through the database. Still I have not been promoted. I was told my a top person in the company that when a person works as hard as I do that the managers do not want to lose you so the promotion is harder to get."
good,"10 hour shifts .. learned how to drive and forklift, read and retrieve orders to be shipped out. The place i was at the managers showed favors to certain employees , I did work with some very good people"
good,"If you work hard you will get to do more at work, managers will notice you and they definitely play favorites. Part time is easy, the training process is thorough and we trained in small groups so that was nice. You do the same job for a month before you're allowed to do anything else though."
good,"I loved working for amazon. The environment, job, compensation, coworkers, bosses, even the schedule was perfect for me. The only reason I could not stay was that I was unable to find child care on the weekends and they were not willing to offer me a Monday through Friday schedule.. The only downfall in my opinion."
good,"I would love to keep saying amazon is great; but the biggest problem is their pay scale is not even close to competitive with other businesses. They say that there is a a focus on the total compensation package, which is great, but not if they do not pay people enough to live in the area."
good,"I felt like i was in jail ,The pay does not equeal out to how hard you gotta make the rate ,the pay increase was small amounts ,breaks was to short ,this is room for growth"
good,"i have learnt from amazon so many things like i have learnt how to stow, how to pick an item.during the busy time(x mass) i worked hard.  i made many friends and we where helping each other."
good,"J'ai travaillé chez Amazon en tant qu'intérimaire uniquement."
good,it was fun workplace but can be stressful if you are not making your rate in your dept. They have lots of moral boosters to get you motivated to work.  They have potlucks for the holidays or such as for Super Bowl.
good,"In general you will work with all kinds of managers. Some of them should be locked in the madhouse while some are amazing to work with. Amazon culture is great, only if everyone hired there would actually follow it. Salary is not great, average, but the benefits are helping a lot, especially when you want to develop in the current carrier or want to follow a different path."
good,"a typical day at work involved complete silence in the break room 10-15 minutes before shift starts. afterwards, we stretch, debriefing on how many packages in possession vs workforce availability and then we get to work. when working together, the job is relatively easy for the average person, but it requires a high level of teamwork and not many employees talk much due to lifting and focusing on their work."
good,fun to work there fast pace work lots of friendly people would recommend this job to job seekers. would like to return as an employee on fulltime basis. place for advancement.
good,Great place to work with great people. Lesser work-life balance compared to competitors. The work was great with impact and work times were flexible as well.
good,"expect to be trained well in the area that you will be working in. After training expect to meet an hour work rate, timed breaks, and a very fast paved work enviornment. The money you will make will be worth the hours you put in."
good,"Generally, a great, if physically demanding, place to work. Speed is of the essence and every day is a challenge to keep pace with the demands of orders looking for instant gratification. Holidays are pretty much limited to Thanksgiving(maybe) and Christmas(but likely expect to work half the day Christmas Eve. If you're fortunate enough to sign on for a shift that includes weekends you may even have a semblance of 'real life'. If not you may find yourself with a weekend in the middle of the week while the rest of your family and friends are working."
good,"Gute Kultur, nette Kollegen. Manchmal gibt es zu viele Arbeit."
good,"If you are lucky enough to find the right team.  The experience can be unforgettable and you will learn lot.  However, if you give them an inch then they will take a mile.  They talk about work life balance which sometimes didn't apply depending on the team or your manager"
good,"good place to start working at. you are trained in all aspects of the job. you are treated with respect from your peers and management. the hours are long, the work is hard, but you can learn a lot and come away from it more Knowledgeable and respectful for the people that work everyday to provide the best customer obsession i have had the pleasure to know."
good,My experience with Amazon was great just short.  Contract ended due to over spending bringing in new hires. Management lack of Human Resources experience caused this issue.
good,Nice environment to work in. Fast paced and busy. Very flexible for a second job and students. Benefits for part time workers. Pays for your tuition as well.
good,"Amazon is a nice place to work.  The management if very fair and helpful.  The other associates by and large are very friendly.  The hardest part of the job comes when we are low on personnel for a shift, which makes it very hectic at times."
good,"I like working at Amazon.  I didn't like when the work slowed down and they blamed me for being non-productive doing those periods. Doing slow periods,  employees should be moved to another area to work."
good,I work at a Amazon prime here in Houston. I been working there for a year. I applied at a official Amazon as a part time sorter. They didnt move foward with me so they offered me Amazon Prime. I been working there for a year. The head manager said theres no raises at all and I been working there for a year I excepted to get raise within a year of the company. I dont agree with that at all. And I dont think it has benefits as well. If only Amazon the company had a Union that would be awesome. Hopefully will have a union in the future. But overrall its a good job it just doesnt have a pay raise thats what ticked me off. And hopefully If amazon the company not Amazon Prime Now reads this I hope you can make changes in this company Im in. This is the first job i had without pay raise or benefits. I dont think that is right for employers that been there for two years or so. But overrall thank you Amazon prime for the support you offer every week.
good,The work isn't hard if you're in decent shape but it can get exhausting. you will work 4 10 hour days back to back.  Over all not a bad place to work.
good,As an Amazon driver you learn to become self-efficient and self-motivated. When you deliver with Amazon your sense of responsibility grows because you are in charge of 300+ packages and delivering them at their destined time
good,"On a typical day as an FC (fulfillment center) associate you will be required to walk briskly for miles a day, stand for prolonged hours, lift, pick, pack and sort thousands of items a day. You will also need to ensure your workspace is clean and functioning properly. You may have to respond to other selective tasks as needed. You will work with pallets, pallet jacks, other field equipment and (may) work around robotics. You will always be required to follow extremely strict safety protocol. Between breaks, you must very cautious in utilizing your time. It is an extremely fast-paced work environment that promotes based on attendance and performance. You must maintain a strict work ethic, be positive, professional and assertive. It helps to always be a respectable employee. You first have to prove yourself as a top performer to be considered for other roles and leadership. In my experience, the work environment is fair and our leadership is outstanding. They are very skilled (in many ways), respectful and helpful. Most of them are college graduates and former military/or worked their way up to leadership. It helps to always pay attention, follow command and be respectful of your peers and leadership. You must carry yourself well and are always answerable for your own work performance and quality."
good,"Working at amazon, when the shift starts you move to the work right away there is no down time. I've learned a lot from amazon, productivity, working along side with logistics helped me understand why it is so important to get the amazon packages delivered. Hardest part i would say it's a lot of hard fast paid work which will take a toll on your body. Enjoyable part of the job was all the friends I had made and for the most part the operations managers are really nice and understanding."
good,"Loved amazon. Only management needs to be change."
good,"Overall was a good place to work, fast paced for the most part. must meet individual rates each night. there was opportunity for advancement and different roles."
good,Good Company to work for.  I enjoyed to culture and the people that i worked with and for.  The pace was fast and the training was good.  They wanted you to succeed with the company.
good,amazon is typically a great place to work. It is very high energy and very fast paced. there are lots of moments when it feels like a competition. There are times when the fastest people get called over the loud speaker.
good,I worked in EDI3 as a temp Customer Service Associate over Q4 ramp up - it was a temp job that ended up being extended. Fairly good working culture but overly reliant on meeting quantitative goals rather than qualitative - i.e. cared a lot more about being 2 mins late to work over willing to go above and beyond for customers.
good,"Working in the warehouse was okay, and the compensation was alright. But I couldn't do the overnight shift, it started to effect my health negatively. Otherwise, it was a generally happy workplace; music playing, ambassadors lead stretches at the beginning of every shift"
good,Cool place to work. The hardest thing was a very long standing periods & very fast paced. Learned how important the packaging process is to amazon. Culture was a fun.
good,"I work for Amazon's Mco5 sort center in Davenport, FL where i love working. I am currently an Ambassador?/supervisor there and i love the people and environment. I have leaned a lot within the year that i have been working here and i have got to say that i love the management team and my supervisor team and also the regular associates. This is my first warehouse job ever and i never thought that i would like it this much. i think that it is the ideal part time job that also has multiple schedules to fit around your every day life schedules or hobbies."
good,"I had a lot of fun there and got a hold of everything really quick. Awesome work place.The environment is amazing and everyone is very kind a friendly. Really easy work, but long hours and only getting $14hr  then."
good,"great part time job"
good,"Amazon is a great to work if you need a job to get you back on your feet. Amazon is physical job, and you are going to be standing on you feet for ten hours. If you want to lose weight this is the perfect job. Since this job is physical, there is a good chance you might get injured from carrying something heavy or you move the wrong way. The way to keep you job you need to make rate every hour. You have to be at hundred percent or more. The people who do make high rates every hour, are most likely Favorited by the mangers and they will them move up in better position or tasks, which is sad to say. The one thing that everyone love at amazon is VTO, which is volunteer time off, which mean you are NOT getting paid. It can be a good thing if you are not feeling well or something happens.. but it can be a bad thing if need to pay bills and you have no money."
good,Good people are always around to help you and you can learn a lot from them. Good salary and benefits and good work is provided to learn. You will get opportunities to grow.
good,"The only problem is the pay which is below average compared to similar companies; otherwise, it is a good company for beginners and senior managers. Mid level and entry level employees seem to get a raw deal"
good,I was an intern at amazon and the technical aspects of the project were amazing. You are expected to ramp up quickly and there are several opportunities to showcase your talent.
good,"kinda steady pace fom the beginning after a few hours things pick up material volume rises which calls for faster work the task can be complete"
good,The work is interesting enough but lacks the community and collaborative culture of some of the other software and services companies in the Seattle area.  An the middle managers are where this is most evident.
good,"BEST PLACE to work ,but the pay is not justified at times"
good,typical day at Amazon Prime was fun with co-worker and we had a great management team. The HR team is really friendly and always communicate with employees .
good,"A typical day at work included a company warm up and quick motivational speech for all sortation works going out on the floor. It was a very competitive work environment, and sometimes stressful. The sortation associates were very helpful and friendly to each other despite the competition. The managers sometimes could forget to be encouraging and polite to sortation associates, but there were some managers who were very respectful. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the sortation quota. Yet, with much practice it was easily achieved. The easy part about the job is scanning and stacking boxes. Finally, I learned how to communicate effectively with managment about my needs as a sortation associate. I also learned how to work efficiently in a fast paced environment, by completing my work and going over the scan quota."
good,"Bonne experience , dans un cadre agreable , je recommande ."
good,"Manually took items out of containers & packed into different boxes checked for defects & quality "
good,Trabajo estable el cual me ha permitido ir promocionando y creciendo dentro de la empresa durante 6 años consecutivos. Realicé la apertura del centro logístico y mi formación la realicé en Italia durante 1 mes en las instalaciones de MXP5.
good,"Fast paced, flexible schedule, simple work, collaborative co workers, and attentive management concerned with employee safety first. Amazon benefits are advantageous."
good,Fast pace and enjoyable. Very serious about safety which is a plus. You're continuously learning something new about the company and it's procedures. Promotions are likely and possible to get if you work hard and you are dedicated.
good,you are responsible for your own sales and marketing and also your own success or the lack there of. you choose the method that works best for you for audience reach and conversions whether that be through Paid advertising or Organic means
good,"Very fast paced job. In order to advance in the job it is critical to meet and exceed expectations. Management is lenient, but it is important to follow instructions."
good,"Its a 12 hour shift job so you need some really comfortable shoes. Also if you are a social person make sure to speak to those around you. You are there for 12 hours a day, its best to make friends to help the time fly by. There are also people that just keep to themselves so no need to worry about that if you are one of those people. I always felt safe there and the pay is great, i would have like to stay but it was temporary. Ive heard people say the managers have ""favorites"" and you should try to be one of those people but i never really noticed it too much."
good,"Amazon is the good palce to bright ur future nd its also probode 2 days weak off nd 5 working days,,amazon always says that work hard ,have fun nd make hostory ..bt sorry to say that i leave it coz i want to search job near my home.."
good,"The typical work day on ship dock is fast paced and requires constant exertion. Ship Dock is vast and requires you to be able to multi task with focus. Team work is celebrated but you must also be able to lead."
good,Its fast past with room for plenty of overtime.You start out with a breakdown of what the workload looks like for the day and followed up by stretching. Management most the time was pretty helpful the culture of the workplace was pretty comfortable. The hardest part of the job was the redundancy. The most enjoyable part was the overtime and few things company does provide through year.
good,Good place to work.  work with people from different parts of the world. management is okay. the hardest part of the job is working for 10 hours standing
good,"Regular, everyday work expectations. Volume fluctuations occur as seasons/holidays come and go - as per usual in an environment such as this environment."
good,"Fast paced environment, where I moved and scanned boxes into the system. You could sign up for extra shifts, and sometimes overtime was available to work with time and a half pay."
good,if you can do 12 hours on your feet. it ok place to work. the attendance is not fair. and walking to the breakroom and bathroom are some what to far. o
good,It's a good place to work at to develop leadership skills.  It can be fast paced sometimes but if everyone works together the shifts usually run smooth.
good,Only worked there for a few months but it wasn't bad. It seemed like Amazon actually care about their employees were most companies I've been with just leave you on your own.
good,I enjoyed my year at amazon working in two different positions. I would have stayed longer if circumstances were different for me at the time. This was a contract position with the potential to continue.
good,"Amazon is a good place to work. They will keep having work and will pay well to anyone willing to work. There is a period 2 or 3 times a year that there is Mandatory Overtime. If you aren't used to standing and moving for long periods of time, it can be hard on the body for the first couple of weeks. If you want to move up any, you need to push what you want to learn, make sure higher ups know your name and face in a good reputation, along with make yourself available to helping your superiors. There are many committees and organizations within the company that can allow you to network and integrate into the community."
good,"I dont have anything bad to say, all I can say is this job is not for the weak and lazy. If you have a problem standing up for a long time this isnt for you."
good,"Working at the warehouse was usually a fun, but exhausting time. I learned a lot of safe lifting techniques. Management was always solid, a majority of them knew what they were doing and actually helped with the work."
good,It is a safe working environment. Good Leadership and Co-Operation. You have to meet daily quota. Sometimes there are slow days but that is either good or bad depending on your preference.
good,I liked the environment and learning about things in the  USA that south africa doesnt even know about yet. Its a very laid back environment and even though you have to meet targets you dont feel very pressurised.
good,"Amazon is an extremely progressive, forward-thinking company that always promotes from within. I had at least 2 meeting a day with management, discussing the metrics and the overall currently- shipped package quantity. Updates every hour on overall productivity.  The working environment is extremely dirty and LOUD. You are expected to give 100%, 100% of the time. It was a true 'team' environment where everyone had each others back and supported their fellow employees. It was great being part of a team where I know my coworkers knew I supported them and they supported me. We worked 4 days a week, 12 hours a day. If you sat down to rest you were fired, there was no inactivity. Toughest job I ever had but I grew to love it. I was sad when they laid my team off."
good,"great place to work.                             "
good,"I will recommend this job to others they offer you pretty good benefits such as health , vision , dental , 401k & life insurance . And there are pretty decent chances for you to move up in your career"
good,the atmosphere is joyful. And  can be encouraging to new employees to the work force. the fast pace keeps you continuesly moving. overage all think it can be a great place to work.
good,"youre preparing orders in a warehouse..so there’s lots of walking. It’s very fun and competitive because there are certain goals and numbers that have to be met. Very flexible schedule. You schedule your own hours every week, you are only required to work one day each month, and you age up to 24 hours to cancel a shift without being penalized for it."
good,"Im Either Guaranteed My Hours or Less Than 40 Hours"
good,"I was able to choose my own hours as a reserve agent.  So the work/life balance panned out.  It can get hectic around major holidays of course and any other time where online orders are high.  Must have the patience to deal with customers and diffuse the situation immediately.  Just imagine how you are as an online shopping customer and times that by 2.  But there are a lot of incentives, bonuses, and contest to compensate for the stressful calls. And you receive a small discount when you order from Amazon.com.  Training is self paced but you always have access to the knowledge base, teammates, and supervisors.  Great company to work."
good,I personally learned a lot working with Amazon.  This is a company that truly push you outside of your comfort zone which pushes you to be a better leader and think outside the box.
good,"The work isn't easy but the pay and the coworkers made it easier. However, the coworkers tended to be lackluster with their quality and it really bugged me because I usually had to straighten it out"
good,"Amazon is a fast paced, very busy place to work.  It can be fun at times but is very competitive.   Some work is very heavy and awkward.   Not a bad place to work but I didn't feel I could make the quota they wanted."
good,"I come in 15 minutes earlier sometimes and have a cup of coffee. My shift started at 1 am and ended at 5:30-6 am. I come out of the break room scan my card at 1 am or 12:55 am and then go over to the blue shirts to be assigned to an area in the warehouse. Start working, 15 minute break, resume work, and then clock out when everything's complete."
good,"Identify, order, receive and issue all common stock items, non-stock items, consumables, repair parts and equipment, including non-standard parts, supplies, & equipment including office and break-room necessities and materials. Although the logistics department was fast paced, the general culture in the data center was friendly and relaxed."
good,"Amazon is a good job to work if you are a full time student. They work around your school schedule and will give anyone shifts that they desire. Management could be a little better, but for the most part it is alright."
good,"Typical day starts with meeting to go over saftey and stretches. Then to your assigned area. You will be on a production rate in 90% of the jobs here. Accuracy is very important here. You will get wrote up if you are off your count twice in a week. "
good,If you have spare time or a desire to get a good wage with low hours between school or another job it's a perfect fit. Hours are flexible and can be adjusted after hire.
good,"i would love to work with amazon ,it has room to excell ,if you want to futher your career they will help you futher your education, they have stocks that you can innvest in as well."
good,"Long hours, questionable management. Good working conditions as well as advancement opportunities. Favoritism is very prevalent. Very boring and repetitive tasks."
good,"A typical work day consist of the following: clocking in, meeting time, stretching (twice each shift), 30 min lunch and 2 15 min breaks. Its pretty consistent picking for your 10 hours clock out. The management was great. The hardest part of the job was trying to advance to other positions from a temp position, very competitive. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the people!"
good,It was a fairly good company they have great benefits. However it is hard to move up. Sometimes they promote people I feel are not fit for the job. My new manager is pretty awesome though they do offer help with your resume
good,"Fun place to work. I learnt a lot over the short period of time I worked at Amazon. It was demanding,but it was a good experience. Great place to meet people and a very diverse environment."
good,"Overall the job was an excellent opportunity and great learning experience for me.  I had never worked in a warehouse and the job gave me insight that I normally would have never known.   It was obvious that ""management"" did care, at least to an extent, however as any large growing company there were intrinsic problems with morale and even technical aspects of processes that didn't make sense on the ground floor and seemed impossible to communicate or change.  Once I put an anonymous tip in the suggestion box by the HR desk.  Not sure if anyone looked at it but the fact that they even have an ""idea/suggestion"" box and a (I believe to be) actual confidential computer questionnaire system shows that they make a good effort.  The physically demanding nature of the work was made clear at the Interview (at least when I went) so the high turnover did not surprise me - there is a lot of hard work behind the scenes to make the ordering by customers feel easy and convenient.  Maybe all warehouses are similarly exhausting -  I've typically worked office or labs so difficult to compare.  On positive note were benefits, can stock options, opportunities for internal development and advancement, and ability to transfer shifts and geographical locations (requests often were approved).  This was a HUGE plus - especially for individuals and families who move around geographically.   Overall I'd recommend the company to anyone who is interested, based on my experience at one Fulfilment center."
good,"Management was good. the only issue was mandatory overtime. I had a good time working there but found it was very physical. "
good,"Enjoyed work with other people, work in the fast page line, global culture. Each year have discount coupon and draw prize for those people who working hard."
good,"Although it asked for VTO (Voluntary to Off), you don't have to go.  The worst bit is the warehouse is too big, you hardly to meet someone else. You got no one to say hello or talk.  Also no music or radio at background, you will feel like working in a dead prison.  Amazon is not interesting place, but if you like to earn steady income.  It is good and reliable place."
good,"Don't have too many complaints. I enjoyed my job. It is quick changing and fast paced, pay is decent. You really need to go in as a Tier III to enjoy your job though."
good,Azienda grintosa e stimolante. Esperienza positiva
good,"Good Pay With Lots Of OT Available "
good,"Appropriate compensation, excellent benefits package. I am happy  to work at amazon, I enjoy the work I do.  Moving within the company is challenging, but opportunities are available."
good,I found myself tired and exhausted after work and not having time to do much else but it is a good source of income. I do believe they have a great system for growth.
good,The actual location is a long drive from the city. The benefits were decent as well as paid time off. All the co workers were very easy to get along with.
good,"Don't join as contract employee"
good,You work hard they have great benefits i benefited from Career Choice program. Too much employee turnover dont always stand behind their associates. Management too computer driven.
good,"Fun place to work. Call volumes vary from high to low, especially during the holiday season. Can be hectic at times, but management offers ways to de-stress and keep productivity up."
good,Very good if you are in your applying for your first job after university. Can get very repetitive. Collegues are very good. Languages are not used as much as expected
good,"My Amazon employment was a seasonal/part time/ temporary PEAK SEASON position"
good,"The work culture is one of the best in the industry."
good,Its good to experience to know how the biggest eCommerce company in the world works.  The work culture is excellent and the job is not stressful. Good to star career with.
good,"I am never bored.There are so many innovations going and new projects that you can grow in ways that you didn't even think about before working with Amazon. A lot of career advancement is dependent on relocating, which isn't great. Also, there is very little transparency about how/what is happening."
good,amazon product delivery within 2 hours / workplace culture was fun /
good,"Amazon is a very challenging environment but if you put in the work and remember to have fun while you are doing it, you will do great there.  Great place to learn things at a very fast pace."
good,I would suggest to anyone who likes to stand and walk for hours. Fun place depending on who you connect with. They are very helpful understanding and supportive. I worked over night and was making 12.75  so I would definitely take it
good,"Atmosphere was great, facilities too. However, prepare yourself to a very demanding performance targets and not being able to take holiday from October to February."
good,Loved the people that I worked with but you can get burned out with all the changes. The salary you make isn't worth the hassle. Overall I learned a lot working there and they helped pay for my schooling.
good,"Le travail chez Amazon n'est en aucun cas pénible, les horaires conviennent parfaitement."
good,Was different from other jobs didn't even feel like i was at work that made it so much fun to be there. it was very fast paced and had to know your role
good,know that everyone at amazon is tired and wants to just get paid. but that also means that everyone works to make each others job easier. everyone is nice if you find your group to work with and there's always some cool little bonus if you do your job well.
good,"Is a great place to work with amazing facility provided by Amazon, basically you have a vendor machine where you can get free PPE, all equipment is brand new the environment is nice and worm when is -5'outside, mangers are always kind and nice trying to help as best  they can."
good,"At Amazon I met a diverse group of people, who generally were hard working.  I developed my professional and interpersonal skills throughout my experience in the Assistant Supervisor position at Amazon. The organization provided me the opportunity to further my professional etiquette and work in a team-based environment to organize and lead a logistical section in order to meet packaging and delivery demand on shift-to-shift basis. I had an active role on the executive board of each organization, which challenged me to strengthen my time management and effectively lead my peers."
good,Amazon can be a great place to work being surrounded by smart passionate people who are changing the world. Lots of challenges to really get behind but it will be up to you to carve out any work/life balance as management will not reign you in. You will end up with more work than you can possibly accomplish so you must prioritize and manage upward what can be done in a 50 hour work week.
good,great place for a college grads. the have a great hiring program for college grads. like every company there are some lazy people in management and some great people.
good,Amazon is a very fast paced physical draining job but you get use to it after awhile. I enjoyed working with my co - workers there. A lot of different personalities and very diverse. They set bar pretty high and sometimes too high. I would recommend working at Amazon if you can handle the physical nature.
good,"Job Work/Life Balance"
good,"This company is not employee friendly. They are absolutely customer friendly, no matter the cost to the employee. I would recommend this company only if you need  job and can't find another."
good,"Realizava Integração de novos colaboradores, coordenava 70 Brigadistas, aprendi bastante na parte de acompanhar o Assistente Técnico em Perícias Trabalhistas. Uma empresa familiar. Poderia haver mais investimentos em Proteções Coletivas. Fiz vários colegas de trabalho nesta empresa."
good,"Contrat de travail court et pas assez payé. "
good,"I learned no matter how big the company is and how much money they build, they will always be sloppy. Some management there was good and professional, but used there title as an advantage to be aggressive towards other, the workplace of the culture is interesting, yet repetitive which could get boring, hardest part was to maintain the drive to work by yourself, the most exciting part of the job was the learning experience and meeting new people through peak season."
good,"It's a large corporation, so the pay and benefits were good, but there is also a lot of politics.  There is a lot room for advancement, but there's a lot of politics.  The PTO was good and the overall work life balance was good.  I worked four tens while I was there which I liked."
good,"Decent management "
good,"The management took great care of their employees, providing equipment for the various jobs throughout the warehouse. The training could use some work, but I imagine it's improved by now. It was normally busy, so there was always something that needed to be done. That's what I liked about working there. Plus, we were given a nice break room, though I would have preferred longer breaks. Co-workers were mostly helpful, with a few exceptions. The most difficult part of working there is getting used to lifting heavy items and growing accustom to staying on your toes. Afterwards, it's a breeze."
good,I think it would help if we could listen to music at our stations. I feel that it would help overall mural and would make time pass by a little bit faster.
good,"great paid, 401k, they played music during shifts, karaoke during breaks, free T shirts during peak seasons, raises every 6 months, paid vacation ,fun environment"
good,"Keep it short and simple: Amazon is a great place to work. I loved my team, and my managers, and felt like I could trust them with anything. I left because the senior leadership at my site started making bad decisions that showed a complete lack of respect for their employees and paid lip service to safety, while enacting policies which made the work environment less safe. I spoke to the leadership about it, and was told that their hands were tied and the decision was from the corporate level. Regardless of who made these decisions, they were enough to make me want to leave."
good,"Its a great place to work, manageable hours and friendly. The job incentives are quite lucrative and motivating. I would definitely recommend it to individuals who are looking to progress in terms of the career's quickly."
good,Demand is ever changing for each department. Amazon continues to compete to become the #1 customer  based company. You will work in varies departments and learn new techniques to help provide the best customer support.
good,Good job not enough hours short break alot of work but very fun environment cool managers early hours cool coworker just not enough hrs it boils down to a reg minimum wage job
good,Good place to work on a daily basis. Good hours. I wish they would start a little higher in pay was well. They also need to provide lunch everyday. Lol
good,"Typical day/night busy"
good,"I enjoyed working for Amazon. Management was friendly. typically a work day would include clocking in, going to a brief team meeting and reporting to your assigned station . Work until your break, go back and before you knew it the shift was over."
good,"You don’t know the pain of an over-long phone call unless you work in a call centre. Whether it’s a customer taking ten minutes to read out their debit card number or a caller who doesn’t know how to find the Start menu on their ‘broken’ computer, call centre employees need patience by the bucket-load. That’s without even mentioning the world’s slowest computer systems which crash three times per phone call. To learn how to be patient in an environment which would make most people pull out their hair, call centre jobs can teach you all you need to know."
good,I have worked for amazon for almost a year. .everyone has been really nice. even management and our HR department is wonderful .the benefits are the best. and we don't get paid bad either. plus we get VCP for not using using unpaid hours. and we also get PTO and vacation days depending on how many hours a week you work. third shift is rough only cuz it's hard to stay awake Some Nights. and we get to half-hour breaks one is paid for.in all its a nice place to work. They also have several shifts and days that you can work or not. And I can't complain about our manager or PA they work great with us we're like family on our team.but it's not for everyone .that's with any job.and we have music and talk to each other as well.
good,Was great working at Amazon. Got learn a lot of things. Culture make you a lot stronger as a person and a professional. Management is always supportive and fair
good,Be prepared to work here. The benefits are great but the HR department does very little in times of desperate need and will look for any chance they can get to throw you under the bus.
good,"An excellent place to work. Very relaxed environment, where socializing is heavily encouraged. Everyone is very friendly and always willing to help. No rush during training, able to train at a decent pace to ensure proper learning."
good,"Amazon warehouses are always pushing to raise the bar every day which isn't a bad thing. It just feels like sometimes the amount that you take on in the day is more than you should and if you don't keep up (which might not be your fault), it's a coin toss of being yelled at for it."
good,"Exciting place to work. You have to be dedicated to putting the customer first. Once you accept that, everything else about the job flows. Have fun, work hard, make history."
good,"To work in a management like that it was a great experience because the surrounding of work is just familiar to every employee. Besides that sometime the work load is on it's height specially during festival time,at that time a little burden was felt but over all to perform tasks and schedueling the work it was fun....."
good,"Very fast paced, moved and trained in various departments. Equipped with medical services. On site school for advancement if you have been with company a year. 90% tuition reimbursement."
good,"Productive, fun, and positive workplace but for me I would just say bad timing. I have had up to 5 managers who would come and go which includes being fired within a 1 year period."
good,It's a cool relaxed job where you can advance in the future if you stay on task.You're able to improve as a worker as well and given chances to soar and explore different departments.
good,If you are looking for a fast paced and challenging place to work Amazon provides great benefits and a stable pay. Of course you will need to work hard an meet lots of metrics regardless of the department so keep that in mind.
good,Very physical job and on your feet a lot.  Walking on concrete floors sometimes up to 14 miles a day.  It isn't a hard job to learn but very physical.  If you are not use to working with a lot of people that will be a different challenge for you.  You don't get to know everyone you work with.
good,"Work hard get paid. Very fast paced. Can feel like a robot at times but that’s life. Pack a lunch, get good sleep in between shifts and you’ll be fine."
good,Amazon provides a free environment where you get to exercise creativity and enhance your  competitive streaks. A very motivated space where each and everyone expects the best of each other and motivates  one another to uplift the team spirits while ensuring that the end goal of productivity are met.
good,"Un journée de travail typique c'est : "
good,Amazon is a Fast-pace environment with good managers. Has nice Break room with good choose of food with a 2 video game and ping-pong table. not at all amazons.
good,I had so much fun working as a CSA at the Amazon Cape Town center. The place is amazing and everyone is friendly. They have helped me a lot. It's a best place to start as your first job.
good,"You don't typically have a manager breathing down your neck trying to push you to work harder. You work at the pace that's brisk, but comfortable for you."
good,"We get packages ordered from the site, sort them into routes so they can be sent to the buyer. Our Managers are fair and will be understanding. Fair pay for fair work."
good,"Every day at work is different, can bring some exciting tasks or boring day at work. "
good,A typical day is work at a fast pace to get your daily expected rate and not being able to use the restroom without getting time off task. Trying to find space to put your item that your stowing in fashionable time.
good,"You are usually working part time stacking boxes on a pallet, in five hours you get one 15 minute break which is definitely not enough time for working five hours."
good,"Realy a Good place to work also the best company to work with."
good,Mainly packed out items that were ordered online and made sure that they were properly packed in certain boxes and ensuring the package was in excellent condition when it left my station.
good,"Hours is very long, job can be very demanding. There are good benefits for working for the company, medical aid and leave days. Transport is arranged from and to work"
good,Worked for Amazon for about 9 months and enjoyed my time there. It was a new facility so we were the first batch of workers there. Work started off slow but picked as time went on. I would work for Amazon again if given the chance
good,"If you are hired as anything outside of managerial and administrative positions do not expect to work a whole shift, does vary on truck loads to sort and pack for shipment, but is very fast paced, physical, and simple."
good,"Had a very great time there. It was like a small town or a village where everybody got along well. We sometimes had what is called ""stammtisch"" where the team got to sit down and have a good time in a relaxed atmosphere."
good,"A typical day at work picking 90 items an hour I learned how to continuously move at a fast paste. The workplace culture was good everyone you see was working to improve the company, the hardest part was picking over 120 items in an hour"
good,I worked a lot of hours only because it was peak season but I enjoyed it very much! I worked overnights so yeah you should know how that goes. The manager was good if you talked to him but sometimes he seemed too busy to talk to.
good,"You have an amount of ""Work"" that must get done, or you are placed in a improvement plan to get you there.  Long term failure to achieve minimum results in being laid off."
good,very fast pace during peak season. Very good benefits and opportunities for advancement. HR team worked as  a team to support the operations and employees
good,"Pay is normal, free drinks, onsite parking, long hours, agency giving bs every single day, you have to run to make your target, simple mistakes are not forgiven."
good,This position was not the type of work I was looking for and my feet hurt while working for Amazon I suggest if you work here you have comfortable shoes
good,"easy jobs to work with them"
good,Amazon is an ok company to work for.  It xan be stressful its very fast paced and competitive.  The work can be physically demanding as well.  Its not for the faint of heart
good,"I was allowed to help contribute to the overall success of the site and had some good and sub-par leaders that I worked under.  We all worked hard to get the packages out on time to their proper destination."
good,This is a very good second job this will not work for many as a primary job.The Management is very honest and a fantastic group of people.This job is fantasic for those who only need part time
good,Was an easy job enjoyed working with other employees and managers challenging experience to pack the orders but also noisy and no air following on the 2nd floor
good,"I was hired for ICQA but in a typical day I may pick, pack, or stow. I am crossed trained so I do move around where I am needed. I even worked gift wrap over the holiday peak rush. Amazon is fast paced and will generally let you take on what work and hours you can handle. Management is generally hands off unless there are short term critical demands. The hardest part of the job is keeping rates up during slow times, which can be extremely challenging. The most enjoyable part is the do a good job motivating their people."
good,"The managers are very helpful with anything you may need. If you lose your job there, your begging to get fired. Its very physical work but nothing to hard to handle. The benefits are great. I love my job here at Amazon."
good,"Amazon is a good place to work, as long as you are headstrong and have the determination to advance. Decent hours, pay is fair, benefits are great, management skills vary from one department to the next."
good,"Mucha seguridad y buen ambiente laboral, buen sueldo."
good,"Excellent place to work. Lots of different shifts, and nice monthly bonuses. You don't get to pick the department you start in, however you can change after 90 days with no write ups."
good,If you are a hard worker and you don't mind physical work. Amazon is a good place to work. The pay is good and the benefits are phenomenal. They also meet pay rate for living expenses.
good,The hours for the job were not ideal for someone who wants to go back. To school and work a full time job. Job became to demanding of time and this is me choosing me.
good,"Fun place to work with great people. Management was great for the most part. Didnt like my shift, but they do give you a chance to apply to work on another shift."
good,A typical day at work was pretty calm things could occasionally be pretty fun. its a very relaxed place to work. I learned a lot of responsibility by becoming an Ambassador. The management is okay they're sometimes a little dysfunctional but that because it was a new facility and we were all learning together.
good,"Considering its only part time and they’re always offering vto the job was pretty good for a part time. Managers always have give aways and contests, co workers are really friendly as well. The pay rate is great the job doesnt feel like a job maybe thats why they dont have full time employees but for the most part i really enjoyed working here too. The only downside is that the chances of moving up or getting full time are very slim to none but other than that working here has been one of the funest jobs i had"
good,"Great place to work with some great opportunities. Great operational, collaborative, and interpersonal skill-building. I left to pursue a career in fitness specifically personal training"
good,"good steady place to work, lots of opportunities to move up or switch positions, "
good,"Work was wonderful and fulfilling, management left a lot to be desired. Hardest part of the job was being moved in the middle of a shift causing rate to drop below 100% required which in turn caused you to get written up for not making rate."
good,it was a very stressful job but im glad to have the experience and working in different departments. I enjoyed meeting the people I worked with. But for a person who is a full time student it is very hard to work those long hours and be in school.
good,"I had to scan packages to the correct pallet and at the same time , i can talk to other co-workers. Sometime i had the chances to sort package to the correct section of the build."
good,"It depends on your commitment, but overall it's a good job to have. The environment is totally friendly and cooperative, it feels like you can relate to anyone who works there, and they do fun and generous events depending on the season or holiday. But they could offer more hours, sometimes there is an hour of mandatory overtime, and you have the option to stay later if it's available. You also have the advantage to advance to higher pay if you can make it past the probation period."
good,The workplace is very inclusive and diverse. There were lots of contests to win prizes. Management was fun. The hardest part was standing for 10 hours.
good,I enjoyed meeting new people.  The work was always at a fast pace which made for a long day go by fast. Working at Amazon had many different shifts to meet all types of families needs.  The work hours shift is 10 hours a day four days a week.  It was nice to have 3 consecutive days off.  That was nice so you can actually plan to spend time with your family.  I really liked stocking the merchandise.  It’s a great way to see all the products.  I met so many great people.  I have worked in corporate most of my life and still enjoy the corporate environment but at Amazon I like the physical demands.
good,Very positive environment and great salary package. Stress-free working support but worst management. No path for future growth from semi-technical to technical.
good,Amazon was a very demanding and detail oriented job. On a daily basis i would stow books and organize shelves. I would work a maximum of 10 hours. It was an excellent teamwork experience that drew out the best of all our individual skills
good,"Not a bad job at all, but not something you want to be doing in your later life, the physical demand is kinda high."
good,This was the best job so far that i have ever had honestly. the cons were alittle annoying but overall was good job for my age 21. Amazon asks for alot but they pay well and benefits are effective immediately which is rarely found among other jobs. You will work alot if you start they will make you work 50 hours a week.
good,Management went above and beyond to show their appreciation for their employees with several incentives throughout the day. They took the time to get to know every employee individually
good,"Amazon was cool. What I liked was that it was a place to make money and lose wight at the same time especially if you're a stower or picker. The only thing I didn't like was the ""making rate"". I'd do great keeping my productivity above 100% but then on my last day of the week it's like someone intentionally reduced my rate to say 95% the last two hours of work so I'm stressing (the heck out) trying to get it back to 100% because I'll be waking up in the middle of the night on my days off worried if I still have my job.I know a couple of other people who were always stressed about keeping their job EACH week because of rate."
good,"Amazon is an awesome place to work. I have learned how to become a better manager. The following skills were quickly developed: time management, organization, team work, discipline, deep diving, and having  a back bone."
good,"While I say it is not for everybody; it is pretty perfect for me. I enjoy a fast paced, challenging environment. the workplace is very open; and it is what you choose to make it. I never had any issues working here."
good,I enjoy working for the time I was their. Meet new people and had fun. Learned different critical roles that I liked. Can get sometimes overwhelming but you will always get helped by some one.
good,"short hours, work load is excessive, and not enough benefits or pay for my position. however it is ideal for my school life and if i choose to get a second job. however i shouldn't have to get a second job if they paid me what i deserve or at least give us more work hours."
good,Its a good place to work if you just need a job and gain experience because they will train you on anything but there is no extra incentive as far as pay.
good,Good place to work wish hours and shifts we're more flexible for working parents and that it had better pay for how intense the work is . To much is expected of the employees with little incentive
good,"For what they make, they could pay more & have full-time employees. Not enough hours, no benefits. A few great managers. I learned how to manage inventory."
good,You must be fast or they will get  rid of you. when i worked in receiving the trucks would be so packed with boxes it was a safety hazard. a girl had boxes fall on her and she still had to come into work and sit and do paper work when she should of been at home resting.
good,you met a lot of different people. the job was what you made it . working at amazon was one of my best jobs and i enjoyed meeting a lot of new people.
good,"It is really nice place with great people, they pay good, but including overtimes especially before Christmas you don't have time for friends and family. You can earn a lot of money in a very short time."
good,"It is a great place to get work experience and learn a lot of new things that will benefit you in the long run. Although the pay is not so bad and work is easy, the job can become a little stressful"
good,"Simple but will work alot during peak. The benefits are great and they give you stocks when you hire in, and annually. They also give ample amounts of time off, and vcp plan."
good,"Good working condition, work-life is balanced, good compensations and benefits, job culture is great, decent management. I will put competitive environment at the top of the list."
good,"Not a lot of time to talk to people. Rate is fairly high but achievable. paid time off, vacation days, and unpaid days off are a few of the benefits. medical dental and vision. discounts on amazon.com, sketchers, and Nike are also a few of the perks."
good,"Not a bad job. Benefits, and stock were awesome addition. Work hour for night shift can be tiresome for parents. Although, working 10 hour days for 4 days does give you three days to somewhat recuperate."
good,"Nice working with amazon. Employes should be made to work in their trianed career field."
good,Training was good and management and personal you work with always willing to help you get your task done on time.The staff are friendly and do everything to help you settle in
good,Très agréable l'ambiance avec les collègues j'ai adoré de travailler chez Amazon malgré le peut de temps que j'ai passé
good,It's a very safe workplace. We had 2 briefings everyday where they was clear about the warehouse safety. My time being I haven't witnessed a accident or an injury to any co-workers.
good,"Jako servisní technik si nemohu stěžovat a myslím že i na ostatních pozicích ať už od skladníka počínaje tak pozicí manager konče každý je za svou práci náležitě odměněn výší platu v závislosti ke svému vzdělání,praxe,a odholání se dál prosadit formou pracovní snahy do dalšího kroku na lepší pozici a tím i lepším platem.Ale ten kdo si myslí že tady pouze stačí přežít a dostane za to velké peníze a když se mu nechce tak je prostě doma ,marodí nebo se jinak vymlouvá  a třeba ani nedá vědět pak ho čeká spravedlivá odměna v podobě malé mzdy a případně i ukončením pracovní smlouvy.Letošek mi pouze velmi zkazilo vedení Amazonu s jeho bez jakéhokoliv vysvětlení zrušení vánočního bonusu , který loni činil cca 20000 kč, což u takhle vydělávající firmy v řádech miliard zamrzí."
good,"At the start of the day your goals are outlined, and you are given the freedom to complete your tasks.  Management is always there to lend a hand if any situation should arise.  The hardest part of the job is working through the peek period.  You can and will most likely have to work 55 hrs."
good,"It a good good for those who want extra income! Do your job and all will go well with u. Follow company policies, respect co-workers, communicate with managers regarding problems, and this everything will be ok."
good,"Amazon itself is a very great company to work for. Unfortunately, the time at my home site was cut short since they didn't want to renew the lease for the building, but overall is was a very exciting job to have. There was always something new to do in the warehouse, learn new skill sets, as well as wage raises every 6 months."
good,They give you unpaid time off which is really convenient when your life can be crazy sometimes. They pay is great and the job is pretty simple. They offer more hours during peak.
good,It was a good experience and it taught me that every thing counts when working in the warehouse. I had a blast working here and I would tell a friend!
good,"J'ai travaillé à Amazon pour la période des fêtes de fin d'année. "
good,Peak hours are great its a new location so it will take time for it to build so the hours are low now that peak is over but once the building gets known hours will pick up the building opened october 25 2017
good,Amazon is an amazing company but you will not have a work family balance. The benefits they give employees are un like most other companies. Definitely above average.
good,"Amazon is filled with amazing people,wonderful benefits , and award one opportunities , but I feel I want to try more new things . I also work night shift at Amazon and it takes a toll on my body . I lack a great amount of sleep because of the job. The commute to work is also not fun,because it’s far from where I stay."
good,"great job great people to work with.  you get excellent staff benefits such as company shares, any development courses the company pay 95% of fees for the first year."
good,The company had an awesome wor culture where we had the freedom to think and work upon new ideas and implement the same if supported by relevant logic. The employees were imparted full freedom to take decissions and decide the growth strategies of the stake holders.
good,Typical work day is trying to solve problems for customers and follow policies set forth. I have learned so much about working from home and even got to help train a team of 40 associates just 7 months into working for Amazon. Goals are set with your manager and discussions on how to meet them and continue moving toward your professional goals. The hardest part of the job is talking to angry customers but this is a retail company so it is expected. I most enjoy being part of the part time flex program because I am able to choose the times that I can work in 3 week blocks to fit my family.
good,"My typical day was going over to my station and working."
good,it was fun working at amazon their was a lot of up and downs but we got the job done the most enjoyable part was when you won prizes it was a well organized environment and good well maintain company the hardest part was when you make mistakes on the job and you just hate when u make a little mistake the management was great respectful and kind and even when you were down they know how to cheer someone up
good,"a typical day is having employees wear safety vests, wear gloves, and hair must be tied up at all times once clocking in and having meetings to discuss productivity, then we start work. Despite a few strict rules Amazon does have flexible hours and full benefits. I learned many things how a warehouse is being run. And it was a fun experience but only for first timers after a while."
good,"A typical day at work consists of management telling us how much volume we had a day, tell us where they need us to work, and move throughout the day towards the work. Management is hard to work with because they don't get to know their associates well enough to distinguish who can get the job done or not. They are quick to judge when a person talks to another and then sometimes harass that person and are watched the whole shift without being able to freely do their work. Management is the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job is to work with people who know how to do their work correctly and love to get the job done all while having fun. The job itself is really easy and fun when management lets you enjoy your day at work. There are however some managers who recognize hard workers and are great to work with."
good,"Roles vary in this type of job. It is very demanding as there are targets to be met. Every worker has a target to meet and it can be quite difficult due to long hours and in some cases, isolation from others. However going into this job understanding that these targets are necessary for the company to profit and you are being paid quite fairly will help you to push to meet your targets. Managers do understand this and they try to boost workers satisfaction through give-aways, free lunch voucher etc."
good,"Entreprise assez correct, bon ambiance et beaucoup de jeune"
good,"They are very respectful and sensitive to people's differences. I had no problem moving up and changing positions, you just have to apply yourself and put yourself out there and show them that you want to be there and want to work."
good,Make sure you get rest and eat properly this will make your work experience better . This job treated me well until my manager changed and before I became sick .
good,"Good environment to work in, very good job opportunities. Good job for people who like a challenge in an ambiguous environment. Also good working ours/days"
good,There is a job for everyone here. You will receive benefits beginning day one and have extensive training before you are given any responsibilities to ensure you are comfortable with your job.
good,"I never had a problem with other work employees, but I sometimes had to deal with individuals who let their positions go to their heads.  But I enjoyed having flexibility within the work environment."
good,"Overall experience was the people were friendly and helpful. Some of the managers were nice, but the main manager wasn't helpful at all and played favourites."
good,it was a fun place to work and they train you very well. it wasn't anything to difficult to lean. its very fast paced and demanding at times but the people  make the job fun
good,"The typical day working for Amazon was upbeat. Everyone seemed to enjoy working there. I liked varying what I did so one day I could be scanning boxes onto pallets, other days I could be unloading trucks. I liked to stay busy."
good,Very fast pace and competitive. On you’re feet for long hours. Shorter breaks. Competitive chances for advancement. Strong security enforcement. Over all best place for benefits.
good,Its a great job. The only bad thing is they didn't care about me being pregnant &sick. I was told on my scanner that I cant go urinate more than twice
good,it is a sort center so everyone is part time. its a fun part time job. not to stressful but we are timed on everything we do. if you are not looking for an extra part time job or trying to get in the door with amazon so you can move up i wouldnt apply.
good,"Amazon is not a bad place to work in, contrary of what other people may say. It has a productive environment and there are always team leaders on hand to help and guide you. I do think though that the break times are quite short for the amount of work that has to be done."
good,"Amazon is a great place to work. The benefits are exceptional as well. However management needs just a little tightening up. Communication sometimes can be unclear, however management is very easy to talk to and to get along with. Working in such a fast paced environment can become stressful at times but the wonderful  co-workers and leads were fun to be around. The hardest part of the job was working mandatory overtime without being properly notified and this sometimes interfered with other plans and duties in your daily life. I have learned from all of this though, proper time management and self discipline."
good,It has been a great experience in working in Amazon.This company thought me many things.The work culture is very good. The co-workers are very friendly and came forward to help the new joinee. Work timings are good.
good,"competitive pay for the type of job. Monthly Incentives are phenomenal for a job at this level. Best Benefits in the Industry for this type of Job (Must work for Company, not Placement agency). Rumours of mass firings after busy season. You can see the research/psychology homework was done when placing incentives and policies in place. Bezos (CEO) is a genius!"
good,"Amazon can be a fun place to work at, but also depends on your position. My position had me do the same exact movement for 10 hours every single work day and it drove me and other people crazy, but the pay and benefits was worth it. Amazon is a very friendly work environment also. So many times people talk to other people while working and you can see people smile and laugh while working. Despite what people say about the pay, keep in mind that they give you very great benefits, its almost more than I could ask for. They are a good company to work for, just hope that you can handle extremely monotonous work."
good,a typical day at amazon would be long but all ways a good day. I learned a lot about amazon as far as skills. learning how to use the telxons and locate items in the warehouse. I didn't have problems with management although they will check on you if your not up to speed. the hardest part about amazon the long distances you have to walk. If you don't mind walking its not much of a big deal.
good,"Everyday was a school day, always informative and fun to work there. Great colleagues to have around and always fostered team work. Continuous incentives to motivate the workforce and a very rewarding career. Regret leaving"
good,great and flexible work culture that one can enjoy.  work hours scheduled to allow everyone the opportunity enjoy at least one weekend day in the week.
good,Being on your feet all day was hard but I liked it nice clean and organized place of work I've ever had would like to work for Amazon again in the future
good,"I was part of the AWS team in Amazon with fun people to work alongside. Work pressure is not high, the only draw back is the changing of shifts. Otherwise it was a good experience."
good,I typically do quality control and make sure the counts for the inventory is accurate.Our department make sure all of the orders processed are inspected before they are sent out to the customer.
good,"Die Einarbeitung hat sehr gut geklappt."
good,"Good management & nice atmosphere!  You were rated on speed & quality.  ""Rates were reasonable & attainable.  co workers & management very helpful.  Good training."
good,"I enjoy working at Amazon. the job is a daily challenge, time goes by quickly and they provide great benefits and pay for training/ schooling to advance in life."
good,Amazon was a temp job that provided benefits and provided decent pay. Amazon kept a fun and competitive work environment and on occasions amazon gave free lunch.
good,They pay great must be willing to stand all day and the breaks are short gave ti walk across a whole warehouse to get to the break room but they do provide shuttle buses
good,A typical day consist of speed and performance. Very detailed work and self explanatory. Management needs improvement and the company needs more diversity especially in upper management.
good,"Hi, I am updated/informed often by the company which I appreciate. This shows that Amazon wants everyone to be informed and are concerned for the safety of their workers. I enjoy the co workers' spirit to help enjoy the job more. The hardest part is traveling long distance and working 10 hours a day."
good,Job was decent in order to be an Amazon Associate you must be able to stand on your feet and move around all day. You get 3 breaks a day amd must make rate of items you collect everyday.
good,"The people of Amazon will treat you as a person once you've worked with them for 3 months. The company makes all employees meet a quota, and if you don't then you will get yelled at and written up. I would only work at Amazon if you are desperate for a job, or if you have nothing else to do. They do not work around fluid schedules, such as children and family unless you've worked there for 90 days or more. If you have a medical condition it has to be able to work around them, because they are so fast-paced you have to keep up."
good,Work is typical why because means we want to stand for 10 hours continously but i enjoyed the work and the office is good they provided transport facility also...good thing to say about salary is there we can get incentives good than salary if we regularly attend to FC
good,a typical day at work would go like did come in and look up at the TV screen and whatever your last name start with u go to either the west bound or east bound and then u will start your exercise and and go get a scan gun and log in n start work is a nice place to work and you meet new people and I learn a lot abt distribution and getting customer they orders out and the hardest part is making sure u stay on task and dnt get written up n the most enjoyable part of my job was that you meet some really nice people
good,"Working in a friendly nature "
good,Picking orders on order pickers to ship to customers in time for the holidays. The hardest part of job would be going through security for breaks and lunch.
good,"There are very few things wrong with working in the maintenance department at Amazon, the overall culture of the Chester facility is horrible however. I can not understand why so many people with a good paying, clean, air conditioned job were so miserable?"
good,it was fun workplace while working got to talk to different people the mangers were always there to ask questions or help out some day had more work than others
good,"Working at Amazon was very relaxed for most days, they treat their customers with the best of respect and keep everything very professional. They gave prizes and kept the workers motivated with nice shifts and offered overtime to those that wanted it, would recommend to a friend."
good,"I had a great time working for Amazon, it was fun. The negative was that each time when you request a vacation or shift change you must call a number to speak with someone."
good,Wish you were able to listen to music while working. Pretty boring. It would be nice to transfer to another facility with out having you put in a 2 weeks notice to get rehired again
good,"Fast pace, can be physically demanding. Management not bad but if you wanna advance it's about who your friends with not how well you do your job. Hardest part is peak but is only about 2 months, good benefits though."
good,"Productive and fun workplace. Lots of opportunity for advancement. Unsociable work hours, very difficult to change once placed on a specific shift."
good,I like the job. It's just. Unbalanced when it comes to scheduling people for the freezer. Co workers were fine for the most part. The short break was annoying. I usually complain about 30 but we didn't even get that it's a 12 minute lunch break.
good,"Being your own boss isn't as easy as it sounds. Giving yourself a day off because it's raining outside or you just don't want to get out of bed may sound fantastic at first. The problem you would encounter is not getting paid due to this lack of discipline."
good,"This started as a temporary position that I took while I was between contracts. It was a lot of walking at first but worked out well.  The job is fairly easy but can become very monotonous. If you pay attention to your work, and stay focused you'll be okay. I just hate time clocks but I know thats apart of the game."
good,"amazon is a great place to work at. nice fast paced environment and great associates. you get 40+ hours a week. you get paid time off, unpaid time off and vacation time, but manage that time wisely."
good,"Dobry system zmianowy, choć wielogodzinny. Indywidualne podejście do pracownika, szybkie przejście na umowę o pracę zależne od pozytywnych wyników, picker ze skanerem nie ma łatwo ale pozwala to oddzielić leniwych pracowników już na samym początku, wiele absurdu organizacyjnego, nienajgorsze zarobki, miła kadra managerów, dużo ładnych dziewczyn, jak ktoś chce pracować to polecam, przyjmują praktycznie każdego"
good,"Honestly it was great , despite the bumps in the road ....It was the best job ive had...Most of the managers were very nice and helpful, the hours were flexible.."
good,"Aside from management, most of the associates speak little to no English. This can be frustrating when your job requires you to cooperate with others."
good,Was fun while I worked there. Had to move to different part of town. Fast paced and friendly. Seasonal associate during holiday are treated well. Daily and weekly giveaways.
good,I enjoyed working from home for amazon however I didn't like being on phones all day long. Non Stop!! It very fast pace & the system has a lot of trouble and malfunctions.
good,It's a fast pace company and you have to keep up to quarter everyday. I really thought I was keeping up. It's a place I they have their picks for the job
good,"•	Team Co-ordination, Queue Management and complete the request with the SLA without any issues."
good,"While some days are more upbeat than others in any call center, management at Amazon do a good job of maintaining a level of energy and excitement that is conducive to a friendly work environment and helps to curb the boredom of sitting in a chair for 8-10 hours each day. Unfortunately, with nearly 1,000 employees, it is difficult for management to accommodate some employees where policy exceptions are concerned (especially regarding attendance), even in the case of emergencies, so expect to receive the short end of the stick if an emergency prevents you from making it to work on time. This is not meant to be a negative remark, just a fair warning, as enough paid and unpaid personal time are provided annually that it is fairly difficult to find yourself in this situation."
good,Good place to work at if your okay with standing in one spot for 10 hours. When they are not in peak season work slows down asks to send you home a lot.
good,"I was here for 3 months and got let go because I needed to take time off to take care of a family member after back surgery.  My manager gave me the okay to take the time off, but the HR team denied it and since I had already missed two days(that were approved by my manager),  they considered that I had abandoned my job and terminated me.  They wouldnt even let me appeal the decision, btw in my contract, it said if we are let go we can appeal it."
good,Amazon is a great place to work....So much flexibility. Fast paced environment. Learn hands on...Great managers and very easy to move up in the company.
good,"Amazon is a fast growing company and it requires one to be willing to learn something new everyday. Amazon is renowned to be a customer eccentric organization, however, it also ensures to keep a very transparent and democratic policies for employees as well. Overall its a very nice place to work at as far as you are fine to work for 1.5 HC."
good,"It was always fun to start the day."
good,"Environnement de travail agréable, travail d’equipe au top."
good,"Overall, it's an alright job, with long boring hours and a lot of time on your feet. If you can handle that, then it's great, offering good starting pay amd benefits, and allowing you to move up in the industry."
good,the physical demand for the job is very high your feet the whole shift. i feel like most the management listens but sometimes has too much going on to follow though. i enjoy that i dont have to communicate much but i also dont like how isolated i am sometime.
good,very comfortable environment with excellent facilities.The management team was always helpful and accommodating.the work was very fulfilling and to get the products to the customer always ontime
good,"great place to work for college students or for a temporary quick money fill  in for a few months"
good,Good place to work just needs better management. management is rude at times and don't appreciate when work gets done. Management changes to often and it doesnt give associates a chance to get settled into a way of doing things.
good,I did enjoy working at amazon but I was just not able to keep up with the companies rate an hour but was there to work everyday and it is a good place to work if your young or older and can work hard. managers are nice too.
good,"V.Good Job all togather diffrent nation working."
good,"Working at Amazon was a decent experience. The managers generally knew what they were doing and were always kind and respectful, but the hours per day were long and difficult. "
good,"Liked working there , liked the group I was working with . Looking forward to the opportunity to rejoin the Amazon team once again . I would like to have a shift for a 3 day or 4 day week ."
good,I began working at Amazon when I was 19 years old and had never had a job before. I planned on working there so I could make money before going back to college but that isn't what happened. I've been there for three years and the compensation and benefits are reason enough to stay but only if you are prepared to work. It is not a place to go if you have no intention of working hard for your money. Management tries to be clear about what they expect from their associates but can often be disorganized and lack communication.
good,"very productive , have to work at a fast pace and have a lot of time. there is plenty of opportunity for growth within the company. a lot of mandatory overtime."
good,"In my experience Amazon was almost like a dream job, at least for me it was. It is a lot of standing and walking so it can wear on the feet, I felt that the second day I worked there but the work is fairly simple to learn and if you can muster up the strength to work alone a majority of the time then the job is perfect. It was also very easy to make friends or just talk to people."
good,A fast paced job with good benefits.  I have an associates in arts.  I'm looking forward to there help with college tuition so I can finish my bachelors.
good,Work on equality with equal oportunities and no nepotism the company would achieve even far more success. The company should provide more time for employees to train their training programmes
good,"Amazon has a lot of great qualities, but they have a bad rep. For me, it wasn't a long term place. I was at Amazon for nearly 5 years. The biggest piece of advice to someone considering Amazon is this: Every team/department is different. Don't let someone's experience in one team, dictate how you think another team will be. Additionally - worklife balance is something employees need to own, not employers. YOU decided what you can give and continue open communication with your manager about it."
good,"In a typical day you will address about 4 hours of standard work processes. The remaining 6 to 8 hours you will address any operational barriers that may have an negative impact on your production. Training of associates needs improvement. With such a face paced environment, training is dependent upon tribal knowledge and ""trial by fire"". I suspect that if more time was devoted to a structured training environment, then the facilities turnover would no be as high as it is for both hourly and salaried associates."
good,"Amazon is a great place to work for those that buy into Amazon's Leadership Principles.  Amazon is a place where you should seek the opportunity to understand how you can become better, and realize your weakness's are not held against you, but everyone is willing to pitch in and help you become a better professional."
good,Intense highly competitive heartless world however you will learn a lot and if you bust tale you can be very successful but may not have much of a life
good,Amazon is a Productive and Interesting workplace. The processes are well defined and the exposure is good. The open culture makes it a fun place to work to at.
good,"If you love overtime and getting great incentives you'll love Amazon."
good,a typical work day experience stated off with signing in to system and starting off right away walking around warehouse locating items then carefully loading items into cart and delivering items to packer location then grabbing new cart and continue process
good,"For the most part, I enjoy my job with Amazon.  It has a lot of flexibility which has been good for our family."
good,During my time at amazon I learned many different areas of labor ranging from stock to shipping and wrapping . I enjoyed working for such a great company and if given the opportunity to come back I would .
good,"amerikanischer Flair, gute Stimmung, nette Kollegen"
good,"This job made me feel like a slave. Its a good place to work if you really need a job and it has great benifits,but they work the heck out of you. SMH"
good,"Team player, reliable and fast learner. I'm always willing to learn new things. I give 100% when doing a job. Safety is the number one rule I practice when performing my job. I also practice Quality and Quantity, such as accuracy, multi-tasking and productivity. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping to make customers satisfy."
good,Amazon is an faced paced environment and if you do not use proper body mechanics through out your shift you will definitely pay for it not only that your team managers are always looking to make sure your using proper body mechanics
good,Work place is very friendly. Job culture is also great. Enjoyment during peak seasons. Job is challenging sometimes. Lead and managers are awesome. Growth in  company is very fast.
good,"Great part time job.  I can pick my days and hours and make time for other activities such as studying.  The managers are fair and helpful."
good,It really was an easy job. I was a packer. The only down side to that was you do the exact same thing everyday. That's something that bothers me so I'm currently looking for a new job. It's pretty cool inside they have a.c.. And also everyone is usually pretty nice and open
good,Fun and creative place to work. The place develop many opportunities to growth skills related to multitasking and computer. The competition is also very challenge.
good,"If  you  are use  to  the  fast  pace  and  hard  labor then Amazon is for you. They have little incentives for you such as gifts, shoes,etc. I don't prefer the way the managers lead there teams but it's always room for improvement."
good,As long as you follow rules and don't be completely comfortable with people about your overall personality you are safe. If you don't follow things to a 'T' you have a high potential of losing your job. Human Resources does not have a heart at all.
good,Great company to work for always  opportunities  to better your career . Hrs are great if you have a second job . Great company overall looking for something fast pace amazon is the job to have .
good,"Fast paced, like 4-day work week, hard on the body. Managers change frequently, they try to add fun to the job, we drink lots of water. learned about the order fulfillment."
good,"The pay is definitely good when goin into Amazon, but at the start you are more treated like a number than an employee. sometimes thay will find any reason to fire someone"
good,State of the art work place. Nice place to work. I liked that the warehouse was well facilitated with drinking water access and restrooms. Building was well lit and equipment was fairly new.
good,"Being the biggest company I've worked for by far, Amazon.com has a huge following, and a very successful reputation. The shifts are a little atypical; ten hours long."
good,"it was Long hours,short breaks,crowded, independent, no social life but pay was great. They were very friendly,and communicated very well but rest is not what you get"
good,Very tight schedule to work on but it's a fun workplace.Rewards will be given as appreciation for good work.Lots of fun activities are also included..
good,"Amazon is a very secure place to work, nothing gets in or out without them knowing. They are very productive in work because there in no lacking in the jobs. At times it could be fun when your competing for prizes. Most of all the break room has video games that the employees can play while on break."
good,amazon is a great place to work for students and young people overall. while in school you have the flexibility to be able to be accommodated with a school schedule
good,you may be asked to preform in multiple roles or tasks in a day. Always moving to the work. Managers are good an listen and respond to employee concerns.
good,You meet with your managers with your group and stretch and then off to work. I learned to count items and pay attention to detail. I never really see my main manager. The breaks keep me up.
good,Amazon is a decent place to work if you're looking to make money. For college student it can be very tedious as you have issues with maintaining your school work load and working long hours with Amazon. Overall it's a good place to make money but not somewhere to stay long-term if this isn't your career path.
good,"we work 4 hours per day but sometimes they have high volume we can work 2 shifts in a day. "
good,"I had to pack items into their assigned boxes and ship them away, then I learned how to place the stickers on the boxes that labeled the address. I was ble to stand for 10 hours everyday."
good,"Fast paced and requires varied physical activities such as walking long distances, standing for extended periods of time and continuously lifting. However, management was very relaxed and tried to match your assignments to your strengths and weaknesses."
good,Fast pace ready to work and give your all. There are plenty of job advancement opportunities to live up in the company. A great work and school program with incentives to go back to school.
good,"Great place to work... You need to manage your time though as Amazon will take what you are willing to give."
good,"Customer focused, but lack of career advancement on the Reverse Logistics side.  Good benefits and compensation to lure in external hires for upper management."
good,"I would recommend Amazon to anyone that has integrity, a good work ethic and loves to build teams up. Excellent benefits and good overall work environment,"
good,"It's not a bad job. I'm looking to hopefully start working full time hours. Part time is good because I get the rest of the day to do whatever. There's really no time to do anything but what you're assigned to do so time flies, there's no time for chatter. You have to scan at a certain rate which isn't hard because I'm usually assigned several aisles to scan by myself and I can move quickly. The irritating part is loading up the delivery trucks but I've gotten better at it.  Breaks are short but with 5 hour shifts I don't need one. There's small errors with scanning that are easily fixed. High turnover rate. There's some disorganization sometimes as far as how the place is put together and where people are assigned but usually we get the job done by 8am. I leave feeling like I've accomplished something most days. The music they put on lately isn't good music for a fast paced environment."
good,"EMC3 is what drives the company and its employees!"
good,Showed up early to work and left once it was dark out. The hours were long but they kept you busy so time would fly! the Hardest part was definitely standing for 10+ hours a day.
good,"Its boring but you can make it interesting if you're self motivated,fast working invironment,they want fast people.They got rates so if you dont make their goal every week,you start getting write ups."
good,"It's a good ""go-to"" in a pinch. It's good for those without a college degree or a very young person with a college degree.  If you like to be told about your negative work performance as ""feedback"" , it's good."
good,I honestly wished I could have obtained a full time job here this was by far a great place to work. You have the occasional one manager you absolutely cant stand but truly a great job.  You will be orally drug tested!
good,The job was very fast paced at times and great for advancement. I did not like the night hours however I did like my position. My team was great and helpful.
good,"Good work culture and deciplain in team,there are many department to learned and also gave us opportunity to learn, Good management.Senior of company gave full support to associates."
good,Over all this place of work was very enjoyable. I was able to learn and grow from this company. it was very diverse only thing I had an issue with is the fact that the supervisors choose their buddies for permanent placement while the hard working other is released on to be re-employed weeks later. other than this it is an amazing work environment .
good,"All your work is measured by your productivity. No room for errors."
good,Amazon is a good company to work for with good opportunity for advancement and pay. The rate given would be the only draw back because as you improve it can get hard to meet.
good,"Some people touch your life for just a brief moment and over time you forget what they taught you. But, very special people come along and they make such a profound impact on everything you ""are"" - helping you see things in greater perspectives in your professional, personal, and extracurricular life - and those people you never forget. Some are great leaders, some are great managers - few are great at both; and, when you find one that is great at both... you've found a gem that you hold onto forever (even if it hinds up being only in your memory)."
good,"I enjoy my time working at Amazon as a Maintenance Tech. There is always something to fix, which is good for me! As a young Tech I've learned to worked around many different personalities and how we can all come together to achieve the same goal. There are a variety of cultures at Amazon which makes my time here interesting learning everyone's background and story. There are very busy days but at the end of the day I always feel a sense of accomplishment!"
good,It give's proper motivation to worker.overall one of the best co.Management system is fine also.it provide's proper tools and situation that an employee can do his best
good,"The best thing they have in Amazon is the benefits and nice people working there. I met many people and you can learn different things. the manager is very polite and he works with us as a team, we help each other."
good,A fun place to work with a very diverse culture. Amazon makes you deep dive into the handling issues and is definitely the earth's most customer centric company. The hardest part of this role was to work in night shifts.
good,"Amazon has a rate that has to be met every day for the respected departments. Management at Amazon is ok, except for the fact that managers are switched around every 4-6 months. The employees at Amazon are awesome. I've made many lifelong friends while being employed at Amazon. The hardest part of being a Tier 1 is definitely making the rate. The most enjoyable part of working at Amazon is meeting all kinds of people from different ethnicities."
good,Working at the amazon factory was stressful but very rewarding. It's a fast paced competitive environment that makes you want to give it your all. The hardest part of the job is keeping pace with their quotas but if you have the drive to succeed you will go far in the company.
good,"It's been nice to work with Amazon, the environment is good, getting benefits. Co-workers are supportive. I learned a lot of things. I have been gone through some trainings that will help me in any work place."
good,"I operate a order picker , picking up cages and stocking the items into bins , and i also use a scanner to scan in the items into the bins . very hard and strict business"
good,"Amazon is no bad place to work, some days could be more fun than others since it is... Amazon but whatever...it is what you make it and with whom...I would recommend."
good,"41k, bi-weekly pay, medical insurance and amazing benefits but picking product consisted of walking 30,000 steps during 10 hour shifts...roughly 16 miles for four days a week."
good,Really good place to work. Good payment and respect towards employee.i always loved to work with amazon. Before i moved to Houston I left that job....
good,"Working from the comfort of my own home is great, and the management that I've worked under has been phenomenal. The training for the job is very fast-paced, and much of it is self-guided, which is perfect for me, but leaves some others unsatisfied. Amazon has a no-fault attendance policy, meaning an absence is unexcused no matter what the reason. Once your schedule is set, there is very little you can do to change it. Managers are very flexible with students and will work with you to design a schedule that allows time for school and studying. After sufficient training, you will be taking phone calls, live chats, and emails. Time management and organization are must-have job skills at Amazon."
good,"Work was fun at amazon, but when it comes to promotions and career growth, there was a slight worry and the policies could be made transparent and easier."
good,"Amazon compensates managers quite well, but the hours are challenging and a lot is expected.  Definitely not for everyone, but if you can lead a team in a fast paced warehouse environment, you will do well."
good,"days ranged from 10-11 hour shifts 4 consecutive days a week through the early morning into the afternoon, and from the afternoon through to the early morning with a break pretty much every 2 hours, very easy fast paced job in some cases depending on the department, some positions can be dead slow which will require management to let you go home. when it comes to the culture, there is definitely favoritism and the higher ups will definitely choose helping their friends move up in the workplace as opposed to more competent workers"
good,Exciting environment with fast moving job.  Must be able to stand for 10 or more hours and complete work within the boundaries of a time limit and amount limit
good,This place is always busy must be a hard worker. Must be at your work station at time of start not walking or clocking in.  If it takes you 4 minutes to and from break room then your break is only 11 minutes and your lunch is 26 minutes.
good,"Amazon is a high paced, high pressure work environment. I must maintain a high picking rate with great accuracy. Amazon expects me to be safety conscious at all times.  While at Amazon I have learned to drive a Cherry picker and to use a scanner gun. I like my hours of 4 -10hr shifts per week,  the time passes quickly because of the fast pace of my job. I have a 50min commute each way from Cumberland RI to Fall River MA which is very costly and time consuming. I enjoy working for my immediate supervisor Matt Grubofski."
good,Amazon was my first employer. The company appreciates talent and has always been promoting on bringing new ideas to the desk. The growth opportunities are great.
good,"A typical day at amazon isn't to bad.I set up the assignment board, make sure everyone is in their correct section, make sure everyone clocks in, if they are any new hires give them a tour and than train them."
good,"Job isnt too hard if can work consistently"
good,"i worked as a part time rep, no complaints. the same as every call center except this position was at home so that was cool... just make sure you have a quiet work space !"
good,"If you want to advance in your career at Amazon, then you better be prepared to work hard, think big and know the company. No job is ""easy"" in an Amazon warehouse. It is long hours (10 hour shifts), with plenty of OT available. Amazon isn't the place for everyone. Clock in ready to complete your work, and you will not be bothered."
good,"everybody is friendly, from Team lead on down they are all approachable. Co-workers have all been friendly and help each other. The politest place I have ever worked."
good,"Great working experience with Amazon. Friendly staff. "
good,"Amazon is a fast growing warehousing company"
good,Amazon is great if you can walk 20 miles in ten hours and like listening to music the whole time (its your own music) They pay very well and give great benefits not to mention most of the people are pretty cool. HR and back office stuff isn't great though and problems you have working there take forever to get solved.
good,The hardest part about this job was having to be on the concrete the entire shift with no padding. I enjoyed being there. I especially enjoyed my coworkers.
good,Its Satisfactory to work in a Amazon kind of Company> The work itself gives lots of exposure towards developing new skills which would benefit us within the work and in our career growth.
good,good place to work if you do your  job has great benefits can give you good oppt.for further learning inside the company also helps with getting more education thru provided programs
good,"Typical day at work for a picker is to find the order on your scanner, navigate the warehouse, scan it, put the order on your cart and on to the next one."
good,Working at Amazon is like you are learning something new on daily basis. It's simply easy to work and working schedule is little different than other industries which is beneficial for employees.
good,"Amazon is great if your looking for a PT job for extra money."
good,Job was boring and easy however your always moving on your feet. The pay was amazing and thats what keeps you going. I learned nothing much here but wear good shoes. Management is good and bad it really counts on who it is. Hardest part is the walking however i was just bored of it. I enjoyed the money tho and thats what kelp me walking.
good,Work almost from sun up to sun down. You would stay busy there is never a dull moment. When delivering you learn about new places and explore areas you have never seen.
good,management doesn't know what they are doing. they need order besides that amazon is a great place too work. The benefits are great and they try to take care of their employees.
good,Working at amazon is straight forwarded and manageable for the most part. I learned how important timing and organization is to completing task effectively. Management can vary upon individuals. The culture is great and most people are very kind and helpful. Hardest part of amazon is the repetitive task. Most enjoyable part is seeing how well the team can work together to complete a task.
good,"It is a very relaxed place to work in terms of management (in most cases) clothing attire, and paid time off. "
good,The benefits and pay are good but the atmosphere and management can use some work. The expectations can be out of hand sometimes. The warehouse can fill warm and stuffy during the summer.
good,"I enjoyed working at amazon, it was fast paced and hard work, which is exactly what I enjoy. I learned to run the cherry picker, sort orders, and pack them out. Management was friendly although they didn't seem to work as hard as everyone else to get things out in time. The reason for leaving are the hours left me little time with my Daughter at home and the time I did have with her I was always exhausted."
good,"Working in the fulfilment centre in Swansea was tough work, it involves a lot of walking around. I had to leave because I was going to uni at the same time which was incredibly difficult."
good,"I have had my ups and downs within my Amazon facility. The paid and unpaid time off is well appreciated, and the schedules are easy to work around with. Management, although, is poor and not much trust can be assured from your piers. It is well known that if even the hardest of workers don't meet quotas, termination is placed on the table."
good,"Good as far as you want to enjoy personal and professional life."
good,That is good company. I worked there 6 months only. Good support from peers and managers. They use to organize various fun activities at regular intervals.
good,"The work isn't difficult.  Management is sketchy.  But overall if you go there and do your work without screwing around ,you will be compensated well with excellent benefits.  Do not work here if you have no work ethic."
good,A typical day of work started with 2 hrs. of labor followed by 30 minute breaks. I was taught to drive a forklift having never been in one. The work place is very friendly and fun activates while on break and lunch. Hardest part of the job is getting used to standing. The most enjoyable part of the job are the jolly people getting you through the day.
good,I know that there is a lot of negative reviews of Amazon out their but I think Amazon is a great place to work. The people I worked with were all really smart and pushed me to continually get better.
good,"It's a good workplace. I learned a lot there. Discipline, team work, etc. Working hard is very important there and I like that. I also like all of the benefit that they give there such as insurance, aid for study etc.."
good,The holiday season is very busy at Amazon overtime is often offered but once the holiday season is over a layoff is usually the normal .. I enjoyed working here and hoped to stay here a long time but once the season ended so did my job..
good,My review on Amazon its a great place to work for certain amount of time but when you they don't promote you it weighs on you and brings your moral down. Meaning in my situation I am one of the best problem solvers in the building recognized by both night shift and day shift management. They recently installed this points system and if you didn't make enough points you wouldn't be able to get an interview. I assumed with the resume that I have compiled and what I been through and done for this company that I would be automatically able to promote up but no I was screwed over. Now I see people who got promoted who I know have less qualifications for the job of PA than me and it has been bringing my moral down.
good,i was working for a 3rd part doing multi drop deliveries and my limited involvement with Amazon was when i was loading up my van and return their equipment and debriefing in the evening
good,It was great I'm glad I heard about the position that was posted.  I hope I get the job because I've been searching for a job for a while and I am grateful.
good,Its like one big family there. Everyone is so nice and lovable. The work is easy and the pay is ok but its more of a short term job. If there were more hours it would be a bit better.
good,It took me a while to like amazon but when i did my temporary position ended. The managers can get disrespectful when you do not meet the rate. The breaks are cool!
good,"Good place to work. A lot of benefits and room for advancement. The hours was also great and it was a god environment."
good,"Amazon is a great company to work for, If I could increase the salary it would be amazing, The schedules are very flexible. They offer career choices options in the building so that you can take several courses of study right in the building,"
good,"Work is simple! Hours are short! Flexible work hours provided! If at anytime during the holidays your are looking to make some extra money, then you will benefit from the overtime hours that will be nearly inexhaustible."
good,A typical day at work would consist of meeting up with everyone and getting the plan from area manager. I learned to be a leader and led a awesome group of guys and gals throughout my employment there.  The only thing that I didn't care to much about the management always kept there noses in there computers to micro manage everyone. For those who were making rate they were superstars. For everyone else who wasn't making rate there days were numbered if they didn't produce. The most enjoyable part about the job was being a leader within one of the largest companies in the World. It was awe aspiring. I miss the guys who worked there.
good,"Great culture good people"
good,"Excellent work but demanding and stressful at times."
good,"I worked for Amazon in the returns building at their Hebron location in several different areas. Pack & stack, kindle & outbound. I left Amazon to return to my own business after a few months as a full time employee.  After giving my 2 weeks notice Amazon changed their buyout policy from one year to one peak season. I made the mistake of taking the buyout on the way out the door. "
good,"Very hard on your feet, and hours are very draining for a woman. Benefits are amazing, and you get 401k. You work as a team which is great, but they time you and if you don't make the same time or more, you can get wrote up."
good,"some managers tend to to the micromanaging route, 15 min breaks include walking time to and from work area so amounts to 6 mins at best of relaxing time, not very climate controlled building can be very hot, great incentives and the staff work hard to keep a positive vibe for the work place with treats and various activities to keep employees engaged"
good,"Hard to move up unless you brown nose your way to the top, honest workers are left at the bottom. It does have good perks for Health, and monthly bonus (only if your whole building does well)."
good,"Anos de aprendizado. A empresa me permitiu desenvolver e crescer."
good,He aprovechado y disfrutado el tiempo que he estado en la empresa
good,"I loved working for Amazon, however a typical day was mostly energetic and sometimes stressful. I learned the management was sometimes cutthroat but other managers knew how to treat people. "
good,"Working at Amazon was a great chance to gain tremendous experience out of school. The challenging work, fast pace environment, and high expectations on delivering results was a great motivation to keep innovating and improving. You get to creatively come up with ways to always do more and do it better. One downside is the low quality of work life balance, especially on night shift."
good,My typical day was fast but productive.  I learned to multi-task at every turn.  Management was not quite up to par.  The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing I was apart of the top guys in my department.
good,"production planing backlog clearances managing studio matrices."
good,"I have worked in two companies before joining Amazon but never find a bad management like Amazon."
good,"Big warehouse, so expect to walk a lot. The key is to stay hydrated and get plenty of sleep. Definitely worth the hard work. Good pay compared to other places, and the people here are great."
good,"its a good place to work at / they pay good / i recommend people to work there they have a good management / the dispatch cooperative"
good,"Automatic benefits and great people to work with."
good,"For me the best part of working for Amazon Prime Now is the flexible schedule. Being able to select/pick the available days and hours you want to work makes it the best part time job to have. It allows you to be able to work another job (full or part time) or go to school and not have to worry about being locked into a set work schedule. Also I like the variety of work task, you're not necessarily doing the same task for your entire shift and you're able to keep busy. And another big plus is, No over bearing power tripping managers. Managers and Supervisors are pretty laid back. They do make sure you work but they assign or politely ask, not demand. You're constantly on the move walking, lifting, bending, reaching, pushing, receiving and bagging so for safety they encourage you to stretch during stand-up meeting before you start your assignment. It's pretty fun, everyone helps each other, works together and gets along well."
good,My current experience working at amazon is that it is very fast pace but not to the point where someone would be overwhelmed. Like any job there are its ups and downs but i recommend this job to most of my friends that come home from college during the summer and want to work this is a great place.
good,working as an FC Associate is fun and easy with average pay.  But the company doesn't stop hiring people and there ends up being too many people all trying to schedual work on the same days.  This is why there is a high turn over rate.
good,The company that i worked in was not amazon but a distributor on amazon and it was actually good i loved working there as the staff was nice.I really loved the working conditions
good,it was a temporary job where I learned to be a fast pace worker when I would pack items  and place them on the line. and as a picker I became skilled with my accuracy when retrieving items from the shelves. also while keeping a steady pace. Most days would go for longs hours. But we were given adequate breaks during work hours. and paid weekly.
good,Solid job. Just tough to do a lot of other things when you're working 10 hour shifts. The coworkers there make the job fun and entertaining. Sometimes the managers there can be a pain in the butt but overall its pretty cool
good,I have been working for amazon for about 4 years now. Typical shifts are four 10 hour shifts per week. The current building i am working for now is going through a lot of major change with buildings layout. Labor has become a lot more intense due to products now being a lot heavier in the building. The only thing i do not care for about the company is i wish upper management would be better at communicating things to the associates down the ladder. over all it has been a great work experience working here.
good,"- Amazon loves data documentations which requires RCAs and Program updates."
good,The jobs is easy to learn if you listened when you being trained. All you have to do is pay attention and follow the rules no cutting corners. Also I had to work fast pace.
good,"Amazon was fairly good job. The hours are odd, but the pay is great for the amount of work you will be doing. Standard warehouse job, scanning , packing and shipping. Most tasks are done with little supervision."
good,"A day working in an Amazon Warehouse can be tricky to deal with, but they are willing to attempt to work with you.  They have good benefits if you can stick with it for a while, such as their Career Choice program, and they flexibility with time off, but there's alot to bicker about."
good,Fast paste work and it all depends on where you are placed. But it's nice pay plus alot of overtime on holidays and good benefits. Is overwhelming at first but it gets easy as you get the hang of it .
good,It is a great start if you are looking to work only part-time hours. Typical average work day includes repetitive tasks that come with great benefits.
good,Delivery of 80-150 parcels....Hard work and lots of driving.....The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people every day....The hardest part was loading.
good,"working at amazon was alright, bosses were unfair but theres nothing I could do about that. it was always hot in the building also nothing i could do about that. oh and the break times sucked!! you only got 15 minutes meaning 5 minutes to walk to the break room 5 minutes to sit down then 5 minutes to walk back duty to station. how is that a break?!?!?!?!?!?!!"
good,"Great work environment not a stressful place to work, but must be in shape and prepared to consume a lot of water each day to stay hidrated. If need to lose weight great place for that."
good,"As we worked, we had a stand up to begin.  We picked up equipment, and we chose our Order Picker (OP), of which we had been trained in the beginning of our hiring.  At the stand-up, we were given the quotes for business of the day before, places where we needed improvement for being safe, expected backlog and desires for how to be as productive as possible for the day.  Management was always rewarding us for a good job done for the day, and they had a time that they told us what a good job we had done at the end of the day as we were walking out the door.  Meeting the quota was made difficult because of the expectations that the required for each day.  The management tried to make each day as fun as they could for the employees.  The best part of working for Amazon was their ability to praise the people as much as possible."
good,My typical work day was filled with multiple projects with tight deadlines. Everyone was a hard worker and very focused. I definitely enjoyed being around people that knew what they had to get done yet was able to still make work life fun and entertaining. I learned a great deal about time management and being able to work independently. The hardest part of my job was adjusting to the pace of each different team I was working with at the same time. The most enjoyable part of my job were the team members I was able to work with and the overall work environment.
good,"I enjoyed working at Amazon. It truly developed my management skills and forced me to think creatively and innovatively. Management has very high expectations but sets goals that are achievable. The hardest part of the job was work/life balance. Working nights and on the weekends, work days sometimes reached up to 15 hours. The most enjoyable part of the job were the skills and people i met to further advance my career in the operations industry."
good,"Fun job,but the pay doesn't match the work and requirements.  Depending on the shift and supervisor you get,will make a difference.  If the pay matched the work, it wouldn't be such and high turnover."
good,it is very fast paced but you are contantly on your feet for the entirety of your shift which was generally 10 hours a day so it will kill your feet but has decent pay
good,"c'est une entreprise qui traite bien  ses salarié, elle m'a permet d'acquerir de l'expérience en préparation de commande, et ça m'a donné la chance aussi de se faire des amis avec qui j'entretien une bonne relation ."
good,"Working at amazon you learn a lot of things and experience the magic and hard work on delivering the item, Amazon is an amazing company to work for you indure the determination workers put in the smallest item in a single package"
good,"quick hire time, good if need some income not good if looking for career. pay caps off after just a couple of years manual labor but not that hard. if you work hard you will be awarded different roles"
good,"A typical day at work was just picking with low supervision . a lot of other co-workers around . The hardest part of this job is being on your feet all day and walking, but you get good exercise."
good,"It's hard to find a manager when you need one. "
good,"I am an author of 5 novels at amazon.com."
good,"Great place, management could be better. Great associates who love to work. The job is great and pay is good. The only downfall is management. Lack of communication."
good,I cant say enough good things about Amazon. A very tough company to get into and get established but once youre in its simple with great benefits solid pay and amazing flexability in hours.
good,What i  liked is that you get to experience in many different electrical jobs. Good place to learn. The most enjoyable part was working with friendly people.
good,"Amazon is a fast paced job, lots of work load, nice co-workers, and"
good,Its a good place to work when your hired on instead of temp work. I would not know the full benefit because I was not hired on through the company. Its a nice and clean environment to work.
good,"Many opportunities are available if you are willing to work and participate.  Rapid growth with opportunities for advancement, especially is ==f willing to relocate."
good,"a typical day at work was fun if you make friends which is not to hard to make because everyone is nice. however, the work make get boring after a while"
good,"To what extend I loved working in Amazon, has been useful for my characther have learnt how to work as warehouse operative."
good,"Amazon has great benefits and great opportunities for advancement. I became fond of the high pace work ethic that is desired there. Also, the environment is very family friendly and family oriented."
good,"Better than average benefits (medical, dental, vision, 401k, life insurance, flexible spending accounts, immediate stock bonuses vested after 2 years, etc.)Monthly bonuses (up to 16% of your wages [32% during peak months]), as of 02/2017. Wide variety of fulfillment center jobs, and employees can transfer to any department after 10 weeks of work. Amazon offers great benefits and a friendly work environment where managers are always willing to help you if there's an issue. The work is fast-paced and it will keep you in great physical shape. However, this job is not for everyone."
good,"Amazon is a great company to move up in leadership. They offer numerous promotions and benefits. Overall its a great community with diversity and culture, Amazon cares about customer satisfaction and pushing sales each year."
good,"l'ambiente di lavoro era tranquillo, dopo un po che eri dentro a lavorare ormai sapevi fare tutto del tuo reparto perchè appena entri nell'azienda hai subito qualcuno che ti spiega il tuo lavoro."
good,"Bonne ambiance, travail plaisant, possibilité d'évoluer, horaires agréable,"
good,All about getting orders through to be packed and shipped off in a timely manner with consistency no time to chat until break time and lunch time but great place in general
good,I like working for Amazon but It can be a bit unorganized at times.  I am not used to this at all.  There is room for growth if you want it at Amazon.
good,Amazon was a good to work you get to see new people and the boss at the company are good people. Amazon you get to meet and see new things that are coming in and out.
good,The hardest part was keeping up with demands as Christmas drew closer. Management always kept us up to speed with consumer demands.expect to walk three/four miles within a day
good,Amazon delivery driver not worked long as work come to an end due to Amazon cutting routes Jo and included sorting parcels loading van and multi drops to different areas of customers
good,I feel every day new at Amazon. Learnt lot of skills and gained good experience. Its like vacation everyday. The most enjoyable part is having fun with peers and working along playing.
good,I enjoyed working at Amazon. Always a welcoming vibe and a comfort in the safety and work ethics. Inbound was fast paced and I enjoyed the harder levels of work.
good,"At amazon, one works 4, 10 hour shifts. Also, during peak season, there is mandatory overtime with up to 60 hours per week. The benefits package is great. (Medical, dental, eye, paid time off, vacation time, and unpaid time off)"
good,People are good to work with and managers are helpful.  Coming to understand operations comes slowly especially when it comes to understanding what is expected for you  and what the policies are concerning employment advancement and policies around benefits and details of employment.  Orientation was fast and vague.
good,"Clean, take orders... restock condiments. The hardest part of the job would be staying late to help clean after your shift. The customer are always a joy to be around."
good,Working in the pallet dock is not for the lazy.  So much goes on there.  You are respobsible for building pallets with all the same items with all the same UPC
good,Working in a fulfillment center is a demanding job. The shifts are 10 hours with minimal breaks. Amazon is a great company especially if you're in the right position. Find the right position!
good,"Great place to work if you don't mind being there all the time during peak holidays. Fun atmosphere, good people, and great compensation."
good,"Addetto al Recive, ricevimento merce, messa in carico del materiale in arrivo."
good,Amazon has great benefits and a flexible work schedule . However they switch up manager like ever three months and you will have no one to speak for you. If u are not in shape do not work there
good,Amazon is a decent place of employment. They have 3 different shifts to choose from and they are big on safety. Their is room for advancement here and they have good benefits.
good,"It is like any other single tasked work, with constant repetition in manual labor and basic knowledge in computer understandment."
good,Good job and good benefits. Warehouse work can get monotonous if you don't stretch and apply yourself in areas besides your own but that adds motive for people to be driven.
good,"While working at amazon, i worked as a ""stower"". Which is the name for associates who store products throughout the factory. An average workday entails clocking in, then gathering in your group to attend a bi-daily pep talk from your managers, one in the morning and one after lunch. We would then proceed to begin work by grabbing carts and storing products throughout the factory. The only real downside to this work was immense boredom from storing the same item hundreds a time a day for days on end. Despite the long dull hours and tiring work, what made it a much better and more pleasing experience was the managers and my fellow coworkers. Who went out of their way to create a motivational and pleasing environment. To which i will miss the fact that i can no longer work with them."
good,"Working at Amazon was great but also had some bad things about it. They pressured you a lot, you are timed when you have to pick an item. Sometimes I would be on the first floor and they would randomly send me to the third floor. When you had to find a small object in the very bottom of a bin full of other items."
good,"Overall a challenging, but good place to work.  Enjoyed the independence of the job and the fast pace.  Great benefits and pay.  Would recommend working there to others."
good,Amazon is a great company because they will take anybody in and help them learn their job duties. Amazon offers room to move up in the ranks. They offer great programs for school.
good,"A typical day at Amazon is always tiring, working 12 hours on my feet, but I always get high marks of exceeding productivity marks. I get noted by my manager for being at 170% of expected productivity regularly, and am rewarded for my hard work very often."
good,"Drove a forklift to pick customer orders daily for Amazon customers nation wide. The toughest part  was going 40 feet in the air and still having to lift 50lb items, but quickly gotten over my fears. The team I worked with was a out-going group of young workers."
good,We complained about the long hours and feeling like being on a slave ship but we enjoyed one another. I'd go back if the location was accessible by public transportaton
good,"A shift requires focus and constantly standing/ walking. Warehouse machinery are available to all who are certified. Management is NOT always easy to adapt with due to experimental changes. Pretty diverse environment and nice co-workers. As long as you can lift heavy items at times and are wearing safety gear, should be easy to perform at your best"
good,"Pay is good, management is nice, but the long hours and standing on your feet the entire time is awful. Overall pretty good job"
good,Amazon was a tough job but the pay was very good and there where a diverse group of people to get to know they also had a great set of people there to teach you if you needed help with something
good,"Many positions throughout warehouse and the freedom to choose where you want to be productive"
good,Very nice company to work and employees are very friendly. Very supportive Tech team and learn and be curious is one of best leadership principle. All the teams are very helpful to implement the new ideas.
good,i used to work there and i liked it but it was too hard for me they work you like a dog and my muscles where hurting they need to treat workers better
good,"Amazon goes with this rule where people work hard than they do enjoy and finally the hard work done by them pays off in the form of monthly rewards, appraisal, goodies. It is treat to work in Amazon."
good,amazon was a pretty good place to work. it just took some getting used to honestly.the physical exhaustion was a lot to deal with for the first week or two. but after i adjusted it was fun and i never had a minuet to be bored at work.
good,A day at work can be fast because you are working so hard you barely look at the clock. Working at Amazon I learned how to be grateful as in (appreciate) and I say this because at Amazon there is a rule if you and another associate get into a dispute while at work you both get terminated even if they know another person started it's the fact you reacted along with the person. The hardest part working at Amazon was waiting for break and on the other hand I would say working was the best part of my day.
good,Amazon is a growing company every day and is a very good place to work.  Good to there employee and has great benfits for employess
good,"Overall, Amazon is a good company to work for, if you don't mind working weekends. Other than that, it is fast paced, but a positive environment. They are also very flexible, which works out for a lot of people who may have other things going on in their lives, or who wish to attend school etc."
good,i thinkl it is a good place to work but the hours are not that long.and we can do better with the shipping time i am glad to have been a park of it.more hours  pay is ok.
good,"A typical day at work is physically demanding (no complaints here) meeting hourly, daily and weekly productivity is a must. If you are motivated, self driven and ready to work than meeting these expectations are effortless and become second nature. Management is very patient and helpful. "
good,Normally everyday is a typical good day as long as you just keep your work done. i learned to just not focus on others because other co workers can distract you. the hardest part is the ending of the day. you just gotta fight through it
good,"the work and productive is simple and fast pace but the communication between managers and associates is very terrible. granted i learned on how to use a RF gun more effectively, it doesn't make up for one on one conversations with management."
good,It's a really fun place to work at. Also you can learn new things working there. The point system is pretty good. And you start out with some personal time off.
good,"Great place to work in, Not enough opportunity for advancement hence employees with big dreams are always looking to move. the pay is not enough for the work"
good,Company is very good. Workculture is very good. I worked with amazon for 3 year as a IT support engineer. Company provides lots of benefit like healt benefit.
good,"I was only at Amazon for a seasonal fulfillment position; however, their training was very effective and their process and scheduling made every task simple to do effectively. In addition, employees have more control over the hours they want to work and over-time is almost always available. The hardest part of the job for me was that it was extremely repetitive and didn't offer much variety; I typically performed the same task every day. However, employees can trust they will receive the amount of hours they're promised at orientation and the pay is more than fair for the work that is required!"
good,"This is one of the leading work spaces in the world  and is a leader in the field of on-line shopping. It is a fast pace environment and it is a very motivating work environment. The staff is professional and very polite. management takes employee issues seriously and is always there for support, in terms of processes and on a personal level."
good,"Amazon was a fantastic company to work for.  It has an extremely talented executive team and workforce population.  "
good,"While the hours were long, most shifts were 10 hours, you were on a few day work week, which was nice. We did get two thirty minute breaks through out the day so that was helpful. It was very interesting to see the products that would come through the store. It was also interesting to see how the robots and conveyor belts worked to move everything around the warehouse."
good,"I enjoyed my time and job at amazon, it was challenging yet fun. I like most of my managers.  The hardest part of my job was all the walking it required.  Singles was my favorite job."
good,"Good overall job, work and deal with great people. "
good,"A lot of walking,and standing,. Fast paced and long hours, Managers were great , made A lot of friends and. Got to work with a great team."
good,As a virtual call center for amazon.com I enjoyed customer service however I did not enjoy the lack of leadership and inconsistent leads.In a very short amount of time our team lead was switched three times and there was a lot of inconsistencies with company policies. I am all for growth and change but too much change can be a bad thing. Leaders were clearly overwhelmed and under-informed.
good,"Great job, great work flow, good management, great schedule, focus on your work and quality plus quantity, be on time , pay close attention to what they show you"
good,they have nice break rooms they always encourage employees to offer suggestions. They offer incentives.. nice environment.
good,"It took a little while to get used to, as this was the first job I've had in a warehouse. But I love fitness & exercise, & working here was basically like being at the gym! Good way to stay in shape."
good,"Very fast paced work, I was sweating all the time working. I worked only seasonally and there was way to many people, very hard to get noticed by upper management. I enjoyed the culture and environment of amazon though."
good,"I enjoyed my employment with Amazon. The team I worked for was fun and upbeat. As a work at home agent, they encourage you to use your break and lunch time to get outside and be active."
good,"Started working for Amazon as a Delivery Partner in May of 2015 and though the job security and benefits aren't top class, I find it very beneficial to my work/life desires."
good,So I love my job at amazon. But the management of the company is horrible. The managers take all the credit for your hard work. They have the hr people at their beck and call so when you have issues the hr peoplel don't really care they just send you back to the managers. The job is a great one and I love it. Just wish amazon had more care for it's workers rather then making money.
good,would recommend this job to anyone staff are friendly and overall happy and enjoyable to work there the canteen and all areas of the warehouse is clean and nice work in.
good,Working at amazon was a great experience and I wish that I could have stayed there I did not leave because of the company but because of a personal reason would definitely recommend working here.
good,Packed items and put them in carts to be taken and put in shipping pallets. Made boxes for the items. Scanned them to be ready to go. Picked task and took them to the packer.
good,"Amazon has great benefits, such as the pay rate etc. however, for the pick department it is hard labor because of the fact you have to meet a certain rate."
good,This was a good place to work. work compensation for dock workers should be more then what is paid for the work they have you do.(we were over worked and paid the same as a packer) turn over for dock was very high. some of the managers didn't have good people skills.
good,"Great day at Amazon"
good,"great job if you have another job or in school "
good,Helps you to learn how to work in a fast paced environment. Teaches you how to please customers to a high extremity. This job helps increase your knowledge in business and you get to deliver packages to customers.
good,Working for Amazon is fast-paced from start to finish. Management does a great job of encouraging you to work hard your entire shift and also simplifies your job's process. Keeping a high and steady rate is the hardest part. The company does a good job of providing an enjoyable work atmosphere. You will learn to be efficient and safe at your job.
good,"A typical day at amazon was working 10 hours a day in a fast paced environment. I learned a lot from working with amazon. I learned how to be a team leader, how to accomplish my goals,I was an ambassador, I trained people and got along with employees. Management at amazon was a little different. There where experience managers and inexperience managers. We all had to work together to reach our goals, My co-workers and I worked really hard while laughing and joking so that the time would go by.The hardest part of the job was lifting heavy merchandise. The most enjoyable part of the job was the benefits, work activities, and having fun with co-workers."
good,Its a good pace job and a good enviorment. There are many different areas to work in so your not just working one area all the time.
good,"Take telephone calls from customers with issues concerning their devices. Including functionality, uses, installation, troubleshooting, setting up parental controls, etc..."
good,I haven't been there long enough. Typically the hours drag for overnight shift once it gets to 3 am... Be careful during hours that are late the tiredness makes you a bit unbalanced in the packing areas.
good,"This job is scanning,  sorting,  and moving packages.  It's not skilled work and it's a giant concrete and steel warehouse.  It's not a professional environment or workforce.  But,  the management tries very hard to make this job fun and as pleasant as it can be. They pay above average for this level of work and recognize good employees even though there may be hundreds of people working a shift. There are a variety of jobs you can do to break daily monotony. There is favoritism and people try to score points by kissing up but that's not entirely the fault of management. If you go in to this job with realistic expectations is not a bad place to work."
good,Highly goal oriented place to work.  Fast paced and demanding location where customer obsession is the number one goal.  Management has a high turnover rate.
good,Great place to work. Provided time off if you worked overtime and a decent amount of vacation days. They really believe in spending time with your family.
good,Typical day involved placing items into chutes for shipments or packing the shipments. The hardest part of the job was adjusting to the constant flow of new hires and meeting expected rates when a lot of people on the team we're new.
good,"Amazon is typically a large warehouse and when you are inside it seems even bigger. so much is happening at one time that is can be easy to lose focus, but can also teach so much about how things get shipped."
good,"Culture and livelihood of job completely depends on the team and the manager leading that team. Fast paced and challenging work, lots of autonomy and ownership."
good,"I learned a lot in a call center as an agent. Happy to mingle different kinds of people.At first hard to cope to a night shift, but as time gone by, i easily handled it. The management is good, they give what will be for the employee. Co-workers are different, but since I'm a flexible one I can handle different kinds of attitude. I cannot say that the hardest part of being a call center agent or a representative is to deal to a client, but dealing with an irate customer can give me to become a strong person on how to deal from another one. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I give the best answer and solve the issue of a customer, and how they satisfied to the solutions or suggestion that I gave."
good,really good with working with your schedule for school alot of room to grow and advance. plenty opportunity to learn different things management could be alot better
good,"working with amazon can be very tough but you have to be willing to do it and meet all criteria. especially during holiday terms. you have to giver your 100 percent. you also have to be willing to drive and pick and deliver packages to people house with a positive attitude. always remain calm, patient and positive."
good,"I learn a lot of things as a staff in amazon in how to operate and communication skill and using drive and scanner and with good quantification, is good working with the company."
good,"Seems like the Lead personnel let their power get to their heads. At times work can be uncomfortable. Its like they know it all by now, That;s the type of management that i don't look myself working for."
good,The job is fairly easy. I think that management could improve in certain areas. The most challenging part of the job is maintaining a certain amount of scans (productivity) because at times there is not even product.
good,It is a great job opportunity and they give everyone an equal opportunity. Work is fun and you will meet a lot of people. The days of work are pretty much the same so you will get used to it.
good,"Amazon allows its associates to advance and develop their career opportunities through different programs but the amount of work and mandatory overtime required makes it a very hard and exhausting place to work. The balance between personal and work life becomes difficult to manage due to the amount of hours required to work and the compensation and benefits are not worth it."
good,"Amazon gives you the option of working from home which is very convenient. The schedule is picked in increments of 30 minutes so it's really easy and flexible."
good,I love the people I work with so far. They always have a positive attitude. It's a great company so far. The manager is fun. I wish HR was more understanding
good,i learned here so many things now i am at ps post here and i am not satisfy with the salary for this post. the management of this is awesome but in some situation is not good otherwise overall management is good here .
good,Enjoyed the time i worked at Lowes. Very antiquated with the management and other employees. Job was very easy to a person that doesn't mind working and taking on task that were given by manager. Learned how to be sociable and find the needs of customers. Nothing hard about the job what so ever. Follow your daily assignments and work listed added by management of what needed to be done to make our department better.
good,Journée de travail pas trop fatigante. Beaucoup d’opportunité d'évolution. Peu de job etudiant.
good,"Audit  images on daily basis by checking through our style guides and quality basis."
good,"Working with Amazon is hard, because you standing for 10 hrs straight. There provided good benefit but at a cost. I love working for this company but the communication between employee and HR is the worse, it's very to get in contact with management or security."
good,"The hardest thing to get used to is all the walking but you do get used to it. It is a fast paced place to work but you can do the job if you work hard,"
good,"I loved the diversity of people that worked here. It made the whole experience awesome. I was customer support for the Kindle... So I talked to multiple people every day that had any issues with the device. I learned quite a bit here as far as technology goes. Things like data mining, trouble-shooting, and running various programs on windows. The hardest part of the job is when I felt it went ""corporate"". There was a shift in the entire company... we went from feeling like a family environment to worrying about every move we made and if we'd lose our job because of it. Deciding it wasn't for me anymore was pretty hard... feeling like a number instead of a person won't last long with anyone. I do miss the people, though."
good,They put you under a lot of pressure to make a certain rate and if you don't make that rate they will write you up. If you have three write ups and you don't make rate the entire next week they will proceed with a termination. If you choose to work there stay on top of your manager about your quality and productivity rates so that you can perfect your rates.
good,"Work from home an 8 hr shift "
good,"The Amazing Amazonian way is the motto of the company. "
good,The turn over rate is high due to seasonal employees but I was able to interact and meet a lot of people and learn different job functions.
good,"The day starts early morning or late evening and consists of power walking, squatting, walking some more, reaching, and lifting products weighing up to 49 pounds."
good,Fun job just standing up for 10 hours can be tough ! I enjoyed my time there and the people I worked with. Good job for both women and men and the pay isn't so bad either!
good,"Good place to work, fast paced, people are great, challenging environment.  I have enjoyed my time so far.  Work life balance has been incredible."
good,"good people nice manger good place to work"
good,Vending machines coffee machine refrigerators microwaves they're system is a little messed up due to background check in and the way they just be deactivating people need to figure and fixing that other than that it's a great place to work out great money
good,"In my time working for Amazon.com I loved it. Great environment with typically good people across the board. From human resources to the supervisor's, they were all there when you needed something.A typical work day consisted of coming in, finding your name on the labor tracking board (changes daily) signing off that you're there, doing our stretches together and than hitting the floor. Job positions varied from being a scanner on any line A-F, being in inbound offloading the trucks, operating the gaylord dumper and lastly would be on the sort slide, sorting each piece of mail by the line they are directed to. Amazon offers very flexible part time hours along with promotions during the busy season. For ex. ""Clock in to win"" for a certain shift, and one employee is picked to win the selected prize for the night just by clocking in they are entered to win. Other things include signing up to come in when you're scheduled off and they provide pizza and various other things."
good,"I come in every day, seeing many different faces with different stories. I spend much of my time assisting associates with any HR-related questions they have. What I'm learning most is prioritizing and knowledge of what HR does and how it works."
good,"Lack of communication from the staff, too much high expectations when it comes to training and desire for new staff to compete and complete work that is still new to them. Must document when taking bathroom brakes and talked down too as low person of estate instead of as an adult."
good,work culture is really nice i am glade i was part of my previous company. It will a great opportunity ill get a chance cross the path again. Great place to work.
good,"I have truly enjoyed working for this company, all my hard work and determination was rewarded and I quickly advanced in the workplace.Our management constantly changed so that was one thing that could be seen as a negative. The people I work with are the best we are under high stress at all times but we still manage to enjoy our job! The best part of my job is completing my tasks within the deadlines given."
good,"Typical day at work consists of picking up and delivering packages. Take them on time , goood tips, overall great experince."
good,"nice place to work."
good,is knowing at any moment that you feel like you cant go on someone always had your back and best intrest a job that you thought you couldn't do somone was always there...I loved the fact that they made me grow in to liking the job I was assign to it was always an exciment to go to work and strive for the best becoming much more then when you start that was my enjoyable moment when I was able to move up from what I was when I started as long as you push you will succeed.
good,"Lavoro completo dalla mattina fino a sera"
good,good management of the staff.. i loved to worked their .. but i need more efficient job for my future thats why i am searching for a new job...........
good,I loved working for Amazon Warehouse but it was a seasonal job and  the temp agency SMX Management that hired me on contract ended with Amazon. I enjoy my coworkers and management. I loved how fun and competitive management made meeting our daily rates.
good,"A typical day at work is going at a pace you feel is comfortable for you and amazon accepts, they typically want our rates at stowing 400 items per hour also depending on if we get little or big items. I learn new things everyday at work. My co-workers are nice and helpful even with out asking and if they see we are having trouble they will ask if we need help with something. The hardest part of the job is quantity, which is scanning the correct ammount of items and putting the correct ammount in the bins and you dont want to stuff the bins or the picker will be trying to get something out and stuff will fall out while hes picking. The most enjoyable part of the job for me is meeting new people."
good,good place to work safe area quick learning great management and good team good staff and friendly coworkers great hours
good,Started as seasonal help. Wish it could have been permanent. Would work there again if available. Team manager was very supportive and a great help.
good,"Place is full of hard workers."
good,Its a great job but does not fit my time frame. I have nothing bad to say about this job. But they could use better organization and communication between staff.
good,"Good working environment . I learned that the British system work knows stimulate the worker to achieve higher performance."
good,"A typical day for me started on Wednesday and ended on Saturday(7:00AM-5:30PM) - back half shift. A lot of my day was spent at a station, unless I was training people because I was also an ambassador or if I was decanting. Being at one station for 9-10 hours and moving, maybe, 10-15 steps per hour by yourself, unless you enjoy that kind of thing, really does get boring and allows a larger margin for error. Due to the task being fairly simple, feeling like your mind can wander really can cause problems. Especially when you disregard the one-piece flow that is very heavily preached. "
good,alot of different cultures work there which i thought was a good thing. i enjoyed working there it was hard work but rewarding to me. i got real well with the management team.
good,"Easy but fast past job. "
good,"being a warehouse its a fast pace but easy going job, and although it is really great with nice attentive leads I would seriously enjoy it more if they weren't hiring every time I turned around.  They have a high pool of people they have constantly coming in and its hard to have a constant work week. Its considered voluntary time off and you sign yourself up for it but they keep asking you until they are down to the number of people they need for the day. so sometimes I take it just so they will stop begging me. Like I said great work place, excellent benefits, and really great managers, all they need now is a different hiring process."
good,"Working at Amazon was rewarding and had a culture of hard work and  hard relaxation and fun. The management is on par with work that needs to be done but laid back at the same time Amazon is a great company to work for, with much space to move up the ladder.."
good,The job was fairly straightforward. Most of the co-workers were personable and easy to deal with. Biggest complaint is that your expected production is not adjusted based on the availability of space to store items.
good,Working overnights at a new warehouse location proved interesting for me.  I was still attending school and trying to do good at both work and school.  Working the overnight hours proved to be too much for me.  I was liked and asked to be on safety committee.
good,Everyone including myself gets straight to work in their own little area can be frustrating sometimes standing in one spot that's the hardest part but you get use to it with time. What I enjoy the most working at this job is being able to have your own space .
good,"good place for temporary work, but again, incomprehensible situation with career growth. The friendly staff that is always ready to help."
good,It is a great company that is beginning Successful as the technology improves and the employees/employees come up with new ideas to make goal.
good,The work is self is easy. I can honestly say that the worst part about the job is standing on concrete for 10 hours a day. We like to have while we work. Most of the employees are friendly and will make an effort to help you be successful. Overall its a great job but it is hard on your body. Make sure you drink lots of water and try to get your sleep schedule on track!!!
good,This was a great opportunity unfortunatly the company downsized and I was unable to stay longer. I really enjoyed my time while driving with Amazon Prime and would recommend the service to both customers and potential employees.
good,"Treat you with respect, safety is first priority. Most of the managers adopt your issues as their own issues and resolve them in a timely manner."
good,"It was really fun working in Amazon, meeting new brands, new sellers etc , learn new thing everyday understand E Commerce ."
good,"I really enjoyed working on behalf of Amazon.co.uk"
good,Demanding work pace; extremely repetitive labor. Staring at computer monitors with a beeping laser gun in your hand for ten hours a day.
good,Sehr nett Leute mit Interessante aufgaben. Manchmal probleme mit Management zu erklären wegen sprache. Doch sehr wunderbar erfaherung mit solche Team und leute .
good,It was a great work experience for me when I was their. A very hard working job. You have to be strong minded to work for this company. The pay is very good. The work hours are a little crazy but you will get hours.
good,"Secure place to work, a lot of shifts are four, ten hour days leaving three days off which is nice. Amazon gives great benefits right at the start of employment. The work is extremely repetitive, and gets boring quick"
good,"O horário comercial , tem o café da manhã , almoço ao meio dia e merenda na saída. opera maquina, ponte rolante e os cursos na área, a gerencia sempre esta buscando a qualificação dos seus funcionários . e a parte difícil do trabalho é o perigo no processo ."
good,"4 ten hour days per week, excellent benefits, hourly pay plus monthly variable compensation pay, annual stock grants.Fast paced work environment in a customer centric company. We also have a career choice program where Amazon can help with schooling costs!  Amazon is growing crazy fast! We also provide an opportunity to learn various jobs within the warehouse environment."
good,"As being a CSA and serving in India, I've learnt how to talk to various kinds of customer plus adhering to the rules and regulation of workplace."
good,"Hard,tough job everyday. Don't mind working hard but sometimes it gets a little old. I believe management treats me fairly and I won't complain. Benefits are great, people are nice."
good,"Everyday was fun at work"
good,"I haven't had much to complain about while working here, so far. The biggest problem I have is the lack of hours available at the part-time level. Other than that, the management is pretty good and the work isn't very grueling."
good,its definitely a great opportunity to advance. they give you experience. I learned a lot while I was here. If your union you have job security. if your not you don't.
good,"Wasn't too pleased with this job because it was my first job ever. The manager was cool but when he left, that's when things were starting to go array."
good,Company doesn't have any interest in its employees live or needs. It is Amazon first and foremost ob=ver everything in their view.
good,pays well to workers in a part-time hourly format. Also a great work environment with a great team of workers that are easy to get get along and work with.
good,"work place was fun to work in as well as being a productive envirorement to work at. Safe and clean warehouse was a plus for me,one of the safest work place I've ever work at."
good,Assisting customers with there parcels..How to handle irate customers from all walks of life ..Management can be great ..Love working with my Team mates..Hardest part if you don't make the cut to be permanent its hard to leave. Working with great people with a good vibe that Amazon alone possesses  ..
good,Amazon is a great job. I love the ability to be able to work extra hours and the opportunity the allow for you to advance. I would recommend Amazon to anyone looking for  a good job with great room to grow.
good,"My position is very repetitive, but I enjoy my co-workers. I learned that team work at this facility is extremely important in order for all of us to hit our rate times. In my opinion my job is not difficult."
good,Non ho molto da dire se non ho detto prima che l'ambiente é bello e che le persone con cui mi é capitato di lavorare (colleghi e superiori) sono stati gentili e molto disponili quando ho avuto bisogno di un'aiuto o di una spiegazione.
good,"Taking Inbound Calls , Checking Emails and Maintaining the day to day track of the Team."
good,"fun but too many hours on your feet, easy job, helpful supervisors friendly and respectful co-workers. Good salary and awards as well"
good,"Good Pay, good benefits, questionable management. You'll have a hard time looking to move up depending on whos currently a manager."
good,"not really a bad job, the management isnt the best but not the worst neither. I enjoyed most of the workers i worked with and i learned a lot about how too do a lot of different things and got to train others. you move up really fast at amazon. the most enjoyable part was picking and meeting my best friend!"
good,"The job itself is fun and engaging at first but gets very repetitive. You want to try and branch out to other departments or learn indirect roles as soon as possible. The hardest part of the job is getting to a point where you can make and maintain the required rate, which isnt hard to do at all, just takes practice. If anyone is going to give you trouble it will be the HR department, so say on top of your own time off, they would rather fire and rehire you again a week later then help fix a mistake that they admit to being the fault of the rgams they use."
good,"As a Stower, I enjoyed putting away assorted merchandise into various-sized storage bins. However, the rates requirements are very tough to meet, at least for me. Sometimes I was faced with sacrificing the quality of my work to try to make the quantities required per hour. There was no provision for transferring to another position if you weren't making rate in your current position (no cross-training available to employees that were deficient). If you can do well by meeting the rates requirements of the position, the benefits of being a regular employee are very good."
good,"Standing in one spot scanning items for inventory."
good,"travail intense mais plaisant"
good,"-Everyday theirs always and adventure and something new to learn. "
good,"Had a great time while at Amazon."
good,"pour ma part, bonne entreprise, le plus dur c'est de rester debout devant son poste, sinon ce qui prime c'est la sécurité des salariés la, le plus agréable c'est qu'on a l'impression d’être tous a même hauteur, si besoin de conseil toujours quelqu'un pour nous aider à rendre meilleur notre travail"
good,"Each day started with a small group talk for a couple of minutes then we got straight into work. I packed items for two hours and fifteen minutes before a 10 minute break, and a 30 minute lunch. I learned how to work quickly due to the hourly packing rate that each worker had to reach. many of the co-workers i encountered were pleasant to work with. the hardest part of the job was reaching rate on some of the older stations due to the clunky nature of these stations. I feel the most enjoyable part of the job was forming friendships with other workers."
good,On a day to day basis my roles include picking and packing and dispatching customers online goods and making sure work equipment is stored in the right place.
good,"I didnt mind working there, I felt they didnt use me to the best of my ability. Was best to be put in a more active role in the warehouse but was instead put in inventory where I didnt move more than 3 feet a night."
good,Amazon is great place to work for. A lot of great benefits offered and friendly people around to always help you. I currently am a problem solver and help the stowers fix any problems they may have come across trying to stow an item in a bin. I have learned how to use a laptop a lot more efficiently. The management is starting to go down hill but the people are all still very friendly. The hardest part of the job is the ten hour shifts. I really enjoy making everyone smile.
good,This place is great way to start in warehouse. You can learn a lot from this company.And you must be able to adapt to your envirnoment.
good,"Its really a fun place to work at and you get to learn a lot of new skills and meet new people, chat to customers and try and assist them as best you can."
good,"marketing, on a typical day i sell/buy talk to drivers to make their routes for the day, import from turkey and germany products for double glazed windows, very good co-workers, much to learn from everybody and a great place to evolve professionally."
good,"work from 8 to 7 in 6 days of week."
good,Good place to work decent money. lots of different jobs to do in one department.  advancement is slow and hard to do-- want only people in charge with 4 year degrees and some the people who would make good bosses do not have that degree
good,"Everyone worked together, got along great, very good homey type feel with the company. "
good,"repetitive wear and tear on the body but not that bad"
good,"The job was no the difficult itself more so the customer and how they would act, they would act as if they could be little you while you are helping them."
good,Amazon provides a very good job if you are interested in working a lot of overtime. Everything was fair and the management was great but the amount of hours is not very negotiable and overtime is mandatory.
good,"Work ethic was very Professional, and work area would be very lively and fun on the floor all the time. "
good,"fast paced warehouse environment. Not too hard, very accommodating management, very minimum opportunity for overtime, good bonuses and advancement opportunities."
good,Joined as an intern in AWS. Was amazed by their emphasis on quality of code and how much they stuck to best practices. I would recommend working here if you dont care too much about work life balance
good,Productive environment. Never new what area you would be working was great but also so stressful because supervisors of those areas expect 100 % not letting employee time to get acclimated into the flow of that area.
good,"very nice place to work we all work as part of a team, very genuine and honest people some drive can be rude but other than that its a good place."
good,Over all it was a very good experience. want to get into more technical job hence look for different job. working with them was too good. i completely enjoyed it. its on of the best company
good,Amazon is fast pace job. they have great opportunities for people to grow in different areas. They also count with a great benefit system for the employees.
good,i would pack items that come off the conveyor belt for 11 hours a day i would test myself to see how fast i could go and ended up being the 4th fastest on my shift within the first week i was there
good,"Typical work week was four, ten hour a days (changed to Five 11 hour days during peak)  As a picker we would have a start up twice a shift before our shift started and after lunch.  This is where different managers would tell us about our goals for the day and any other information regarding safety or events going on.  Once start up was over we would go on our way to a designated spot we received through our handheld.  The handheld would tell us where to go what to pick and in the time frame we needed to pick it.  Once we picked the item we then put it in a tote on our cart.  Once the tote was full we put the whole tote on a conveyor belt for shipment. The hardest part of the job is the length of the shift it require walking, standing, bending, climbing stairs for the entire shift under a strict deadline.  The enjoyable part of the job was you were always moving so it made time go by fast.  Also management gave out prizes daily for top pickers, attendance, staying for whole shift.  Co workers were all great to get along with everyone sticks to themselves and does his/her own work."
good,Don't have anything bad to say really they are what they are just have your feet ready for a lot of walking if you are a picker stowers have it way to easy
good,its a good place to. i loved it there but smx aint the best temp place to work for. i would never work for them again. amazon is a past past job but your co workers are fun to work with.
good,"Insurance is pretty good, life insurance is great. Depending on YOU, you can move up fairly quickly. Go in and actually try everyday, and you won't have any issues. Easy to be cross trained, easy to learn indirect functions, fairly easy to transfer shifts and departments."
good,"Amazon is an excellent employer. It offers a great compensation with plenty of opportunity for growth. They truly drive and stand behind the culture of being the most customer centric company in the world. They encourage risk taking in developing the business, keeping in mind the risk is centered around improving the customer experience."
good,"I enjoyed the challenge of working for Amazon, It was fast paced and very busy at times but fun, I worked night Shift 44 hours per week. Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday and loved the routine, the mandatory overtime was also very handy at peak season and was also a very big plus with Christmas round the corner. I learned how to use scanner gun's,maximize storage spaces. Management and Team Leads kept us up to date with progress and  volumes of work successfully distributed on site. The hardest part of the job i would say was getting to grips with working night shift for the first week or so, I quickly adapted to this though and enjoyed working with my other Associates to push forward and break several records of stowing within the pick tower."
good,Work consted of picking orders and stowing products. Very simple tasks. I learned how to problem solve inventory probems. Management was nice and respectful as well as the employees. Overal the job was a fun one just no room to advance and not of hours on a shift.
good,being my first job out of high school i learned most  of the essentials needed to be a success in the work force; such as completing work orders on time to meet the scheduled departure time. the ability to interact with fellow employees in a professional manner
good,"Good work enviornment, heavy lifting. Supervision was great, good company for part time."
good,"My typical shift would be making sure all products are in the right place and efficiency is key. I have learned that it is best to have a good eye for detail because if you slip for a minute it could cause other occurrences throughout the shift. As long as you have a good management in my eyes your team members would work well to get the job done well. The hardest part of the job is when we were delayed due to deliveries were late and it was waiting around then trying to catch up without making mistakes, but it made us as a team to get through it knowing we achieved our goal for that shift."
good,"Amazon is a productive, safety first environment. A typical day at the job can all depend on what they have you doing that day. It could be on the order picker for 10 hours picking or stowing orders, or in the docks unloading or loading the trucks. Either way you will be busy for 10 hours. The workers are all enjoyable to be around and management is always there to help you when you need it. The hardest part of the job is probably either in side the hot truck loading it or knowing that you have to stand for 10 hours. But overall I enjoy getting up at 5 to go to work every morning."
good,"Aprendí sobre la toma fotográfica dedicada al producto, que van desde objetos simples como libros hasta lo más complejos como casas de campaña u objetos reflejantes."
good,"A typical day at work includes clocking in, grabbing a scanner and starting to count inventory throughout the entire shift. As an ICQA associate, my job was to count inventory, check for damaged items, and fix any defects in the system. My management was extremely helpful, and offered many opportunities to earn advancement within amazon. My co-workers were friendly, although quiet, since our jobs were more set for someone who can independently work throughout their shift at a productive rate. The hardest part of the job was adjusting to the time difference, as I was working 12 hour night shifts. I would say the most enjoyable thing about this job was being able to work independently, but at the same time as a team, challenging each other to bring up individual rates."
good,it was a good workplace they always made sure you was good and made sure you had the right training for the work you was going to be doing .
good,"Awareness and readiness of the objectives and goals of the day. Assign people in their right place. Review with the associates about safety, quality, productivity, inventory accuracy and the constant improvement of processes. Constant checked and eyed to the productivity. Helping that everything is in place and materials or tools are ready and fuctional. Always in contact with other team like facilities and maintenance. Give reports to my superiors and colleagues."
good,Amazon.com believes in Frugality which is something that no employee desires when it comes to the salary quotient. But having said that Amazon has the best work culture along with Google & Facebook. Keeps employees relaxed. But again you have to do Overtime to earn the extra bucks. Also they provide free food but that amount isn't enought o sustain an employee for a month. Growth is slow but steady.
good,Long work days with short breaks that include walking time to and from break. Lots of walking and standing during entire shift.
good,"Fun work place with informal work place,no rules on how you dress or how you do your work all that they wanted is meeting targets and deadlines."
good,Pretty simple job. There is also a good amount of helpful coworkers. Its a pretty great place to work at despite some issues with the managers and HR.
good,"Excellent working environment and amazing policies."
good,Fast pace work place where you will stay busy throughout the day.my job was to count all items in the bins to make sure there is no overage or shortage.
good,"It's a nice place to work, even if you are on your feet all day. The breaks are badly managed.. you have two 15 minute breaks and it starts from the time you leave your area until you get back.. which includes getting through security! So your break could be 5 minutes if you don't get out on time. It has a nice mix of nationalities and in the main, everyone is friendly."
good,"overall, amazon is a great place to work at, the hours are just long. the benefits have been great and other employees all work together."
good,To  be associate with a firm this provides career development opportunities and contributes in its progress through my knowledge and skill.
good,"Travail assez polyvalent."
good,"We had a target everyday and it was a tough one and as a team with the support and guidance from experienced management we used to reach our targets at the end of the day. "
good,"Trained on Picking/Packing/Stowing/Sweeping/Instructor in both Inbound and outbound."
good,A typical day at work would consist of packing single items into boxes then putting them into a conveyor belt so they can be processed and shipped out to the customer. I learned how to work independently and in a fast paced environment. The management was amazing because they always were there when you needed them. The hardest part of the job is when the lines are down and I can't get my work done. I enjoyed my job at Amazon.
good,"Great Place to work but I feel we don't get paid enough for the hard work we put in everyday. Yes, we do have good benefits, a good 401k plan, and we each get our own stock of the company, but when it comes to our checks....you could say it's a bit pitiful."
good,"If you don't mind long hours and constant workflow then Amazon is the place for you. In general, the staff and management have a great attitude about the job that they do but you will have to learn the Amazon lingo if you want to survive here. There are hundreds of acronyms and terminologies to memorize and live by for the Amazonian."
good,A typical work day consist of loading trailers with different box size and weights. It gets very tiresome and it causes wear and tear on the body. My manager is awesome he goes far beyond to help us out that includes getting in the trailer and loading it. My co-wokers and I don't have time to communicate due to the high volume of work we have to do. The hardest part of the job is loading the trailers by hand for 10 hours a day. And the most enjoyable part of the job are the different activities we do on certain anniversary days we have.
good,"It's a good place to get some honest work done. The pay is good is you're looking to supplement your main job, and the sort center's hours are usually late at night so it doesn't interfere too much with your personal life."
good,"Great compensation and opportunities for advancement.  Work life balance can be a challenge.  High stress environment that is manageable but not for everyone.  Management is open to ideas and change is easy to implement, minimal yellow tape to implement change."
good,"Hard and Fast pace work! Good Benefits, Great place to work hard, fast pace, energetic leadership! Thanks for your consideration.  It was a good experience"
good,The Job was okay I thought that maybe it could pay the same and be less hours. I liked that sometimes the company would give out prizes and make you want to work more I thought that was a very good idea
good,"was hired to work over the Christmas season.  In Campbellsville, KY it was close to home.  Started packing items for delivery to the customer and then was moved to stow and then to picking."
good,12 hour workdays standing all day was not enjoyable. i Learned how to use heavy equipment jacks karts etc. best part of the job was the people would like to have small talk to make the job a little bit more easier. worst part was if we had a strict floor manager they would warn you to not talk.
good,"I enjoyed working independently after our Morning Huddle, great atmosphere, great people, wish it was more structured"
good,"Great Place to work, love my co-workers, great management, no micro managing, great growth, and love the business trips."
good,"I worked remotely from home, which is great for someone who likes to be confined to a chair continuously taking phone calls"
good,"*Spirit of handwork and desire to work effectively for success"
good,"As a picker, it was my duty to gather the items required so that they could be packaged and sent out according to orders. I would work an alternating shift, 7am-3pm or 3pm-11pm, every week."
good,Work is always fun at amazon but the salary packages they offer is very bad. Good team outings had a lot of fun but earned little
good,Enjoyed a great year learning a lot and developing as an analytical thinker and salesperson.  It was a great environment to work in with a lot of great people.
good,"I clock in at 7 AM. I look at the roster board to see where i'm located, then I sign into a computer and go to my station. I learned how to fix items such as damaged items, false items and items that just need to be fixed in order to be stowed. Management wasn't the best. Some of them were good some were a little hard to approach or they just didn't try to engage with associate a needed. I had awesome co workers. My co workers are what made the job fun ad exciting. W broke many of records working as a team to get the job done. The hardest part of my job was adapting to the last minute changes, but it became a routine and I got used to it. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping others and making sure that they were satisfied."
good,Overall working at Amazon under ISS was not that bad. They have great security and the people there are very friendly. I learned to use a scanner and replace labels properly. I would work for them again.
good,Very good place to work. Though we have work pressure we learn new things every day. Co-workers and People management needs some improvement. Very good pay pack and benefits.
good,"Amazing Company, great culture and leadership principles, good teams across departments and corporate culture, there  is a lot of multitasking to be done it doesn't matter if it is part of your job description you have to help"
good,Amazon is a unique and growing company and good for anyone trying to find a startup job.  They offer good benefits and competitive wages for warehouse work.
good,"Amazon.com is full of smart, like-minded talented people who give their all on a daily basis. Seattle is a beautiful city."
good,"A typical day at work was working in outboud/end of line ...palletizing...a lot of labor but good excersize."
good,"Recommended   , selected and helped locate and obtain out-of-stock product based on customer requests. Resolved product issues and shared benefits of new technology .Worked under strict deadlines and responded to service request and emergency call outs."
good,"decent job, but physical demands are high, so be ready to work hard."
good,"The best projects with the best people. Management is awesome, office culture is incredible. Very high turnover rate. Probably the worst interview process I have ever encountered."
good,"enjoyable work place, targets set to meet on a daily basis. friendly co-workers. Difficult part of the job was the 8-10 mile walking per day. management was ok could have been better, never tried to form a one on one relationship with staff. most enjoyable part was meeting new friendly people."
good,Amazon was always a good place to work. The people I worked with were very friendly and helpful. Good Christmas job. I learned to work within a team. The hardest part of the job was travel. Meeting new people was the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,good work environment your job and you should be fine. Clients and co workers are friendly in the city east transportation.
good,"A typical day is only for the strong willed.  Very fast paced, and you need to be in the best health to carry out workload.  Management is everywhere in a very large facility so speaking one on one with management is trying when you first begin.  After being there awhile you can predict where they will be.  Coworkers are very diverse.  The  best part of working for Amazon was both the pay and benefits."
good,"full of friendly co-workers that had all the right tools and procedures in place that enabled me to meet my targets and see out my full nine month contract. "
good,"Enjoyed the people, work load was balanced and management cared about the individual as well as the bottom line.  They also promote from with in which you don't see anymore"
good,This is a decent place to work.  Some of the rules and safety guidelines really hinder your ability to perform.   the co-workers are friendly.  Hardest part of the job is dealing with managers
good,Started each night with a brief telling us about quantity and ways to improve our times. Went off to work after receiving a hand scanner. The work is demanding but not too hard to get used to. Walking around with a scanner and trolley picking items into a tote box. I learnt to take charge and teach new staff how to be as good as I was at the same job. The rest of the staff and management are friendly but stern if you're not doing what's expected of you. The hardest part of the job was the constant walking as it got tiring. walking around was also the most enjoyable because of seeing your colleges around.
good,"During this job  work experince going good.But its a 15 hour job.We have to attand quiry of associates.Reporting to our manager "
good,"Amazon/Lab126 was a unique place. While the office culture is more subdued than most tech companies (less nerf and more khakis), the company always was organized and well planned out. There is an opportunity for one to self-manage but my experience was some what short so I can not expand on other aspects."
good,"the job was a learning experience, 10 hour shifts of being on my feet all day, waking up at 20 past 5, just to catch the train at 6 so i could get to work at 7 with an hour to spare and get breakfast in."
good,"I found it to have been somewhat the enlightening experience.  What stood out to me was the actual use of a water machine not a water-cooler.  It really did say something about the awareness of the management and their reach to accommodate the employee.  It overall was a fascinating operation of retail in its system to have been handling mail-order as I can recall that it was expressed that mail-order was very big in terms of living in America through Warner Bros. cartoon characters Bugs Bunny and Wild E. Coyote.  I believe the word amalgamation is the correct term as many people did not live in the big city yet and disagreed with traveling more than twenty miles to get to a department store.  So, I have to believe that Amazon is taking quite a challenge with continuing such service.  My hats off to them, they have the gung ho to do it."
good,Nice place to work if you only like standing around for 10 hours scanning product. Never got adequate breaks. Very clean warehouse with very strict safety rules. Pretty decent pay.
good,"good a lot of favoritism"
good,"I would pack all day or pick on foot or with order picker."
good,The day at amazon starts with weekly briefing. I learned to use time management effectively. The managers are great there and very helpful. The co-workers are also fantastic. The hardest part of the job  is to meet weekly target.
good,"Learn and adhere to strict safety, quality, and production standards in a fast paced work environment.  Receive products using radio frequency scanners, build pallets with outgoing customer packages, shrink wrap and stage pallets for outgoing loading shipments.  Major teamwork required within a culturally diverse work group."
good,They have great benifits but they go through employees so fast you never have a chance to get to know people and work wll as a team. The management is okay when you can find them on the floor. But all in all they do take care of their employees. I really did like working the 4 ten hour days. And the give aways they do are nice.
good,"A typical day of work consists of standing at your station for 10 hours packing out orders for customers. I've learned in my employment here that you are better off staying to yourself and your work. Management sometimes are not as knowledgeable to the task at hand due to lack of communication. Coworkers are fun and diverse, you will meet a variety of people as an employee here. Hardest part of the job is standing in one position for a long periodically time."
good,I enjoyed it. Its very fast paced though so if your a slacker or do not like to move around a lot this is not the job for you. If you enjoy getting reasonable exercise and meeting new people you'll enjoy this job. The co-workers are not judging people and the managers treat you as a equal. The most enjoyable part of this job was the breaks. Although the work is not extremely hard it does take its toll on anyone's body.
good,"work is not bad, it's a little repetitive, security is well controlled."
good,"a worked for amazon with a transportation company. Amazon gives transportation free to their employees, i was part of that team!  so it was very stressful, calls, you have to be quicky to solve problems, organised. work with lot of people and costumers."
good,Amazon was a great company to work for. All the employees were respectful and professional. I learned a lot about the professional workplace and the hard work it takes to be successful. The hardest part of the job was getting used to the new networks but after training it was fine. The most enjoyable part of this job was coming in and getting down to work and making someone else feel good because I was the one that helped them.
good,I've enjoyed working at Amazon. The work is challenging and the people are top notch. The leadership principles are more than just words on a screen they are talked about in almost every meeting. The people working at Amazon are some of the best anywhere.
good,A typical day consisted of packing and picking merchandise to be shipped to customers around the globe. It allowed me to pay attention to detail rather than speed.
good,"I would recommend Amazon as a good company to work for as a permanent associate, being a temporary associate you don't get any benefits the permanent staff get so it's not so great, there is also pay rises for the longer you work there."
good,Busy environment to work in. Targets set for meeting picks per hour.
good,"I scan over 100 bins per day and other 600 items, the hardest part of the job is that i need to walk 11 hours per day and i have a 30 min lunch break and another 2 short breaks"
good,"it was hard work and long hours, but the mangement is awesome!"
good,A typical day would be fast paced moving throughout the day. Some days may be slow but it is a never ending process.
good,"I loved working at Amazon.  The hours were great, 10 hour days 4 days a week.  They offered OT on a regular basis.  The benefits were top notch and they were affordable.  I was good at my job as a receiving associate and they promoted me to problem solver after 4 weeks."
good,I learned everything I needed to learn about being a leader from working for this company. Working with a such a diverse group of people in a very fast paced production environment. This company taught me about how I am responsible for my safety and taking ownership of every aspect of my job to grow and improve processes for productivity to meet daily production goals. This experience was instrumental in becoming a successful leader for any company.
good,I enjoyed working there its just unfortunate I had to leave because I was not able to work gravyards
good,"1. Great place to learn only if you are interested in discovering new things."
good,"Working at an Amazon Fulfillment Center is a great experience. Outside of the long hours and late nights, the pay is incredible, the work is never too difficult, and each employee is treated with respect and integrity. The managers are among some of the best that I have had the pleasure to work under. The hardest part of the job was standing for 10+ hours a shift, but it was enjoyable browsing the various aisles of merchandise while picking out product for shipment. Co-workers were respectable and everyone acted with dignity."
good,cool place to work if a guaranteed forty hr work week is what you need. Manageable pay. Raise every 6 months. Paid time off available. Always on rate (productivity monitored) Best part of the job is you'll meet really cool and diverse people.
good,Amazon was only a temporary job that I worked during Christmas. As soon as Christmas was over they let all of their temp people off. If you was hired on full-time it seem like a great environment to work for. I would go in at 7pm and get off at 7am. I was a sorter and stayed in one spot but was still mobile. You pretty much stayed to yourself and worked on getting the orders out. I much rather be involved with people.
good,"management in my are was awesome. co workers were excellent , the hardest part of the job was the shift i had. meeting new people was the best."
good,"If you're expecting a place to advance, I would look somewhere else.  Amazon works you to the bone, with no care for your limits. In some cases people are put in positions where the was no training. It seems like the difference between the temp and the hired on is impossibly large. And, in a way it is. But, with all of that said. Amazon is a good place to work. I did enjoy it, and that sentiment is shared by many. Amazon is either a place you like or don't."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of ten hours of stowing. While at Amazon, I learned how to stow and I also had got trained in the receive department. The management there was fair and I had great co-workers. I don't consider the job hard and the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work well with others."
good,I worked 2 years for amazon as a financial analyst starting in Seattle and transferring to NY.  For the most part I have had a good experience working for amazon with fair competition and hours.  Every department seems to be unique but my growth opportunities were not as plentiful as I would have hoped.
good,Typical day at amazon as a picker I would drive my order picker to different areas of the building and pick product that was in my scanner. I learned how to find where the product was .the management team was a great team to work with. some of the coworkers where great but you had those that would slack off and not do there part . there wasn't anything hard about the job .the most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that the job got done
good,"friendly place, hard worker people and motivated managers and supervisors. I  love the discipline  that the place required for associates specially the safety. I  work night shift and I love it, i love the physical task, walking and moving all the time."
good,Amazon in a very diverse company.  I process items that customers of Amazon have bought and no longer want the item(s) anymore.  The hardest part of the job is when certain areas of the building get backed up and there is nowhere to put the items in a safe location.
good,"Early morning start loading van properly so can easily get to parcels that are needed first "
good,Brilliant place to work if night shifts are not an issue. Learnt a lot and amazing growth rate.
good,Have got experience working with this company & good support from management.
good,Fast and speedy. Learned how to work a conveyer line. Awesome team management. Great team to work with. Hardest part is unloading those carts. The most enjoyable part is finishing those carts.
good,I enjoy working at Amazon. It Is a very large warehouse with a lot of walking. They do provide free water and Gatorade. We are sometimes sent home if there is not enough work available but that's not too often. We also are not on a point system if I had to miss work for any reason.
good,"A typical day at work is finding your assigned work and finishing the work in a timely fashion. Co workers were very friendly, cooperative, down to earth and very helpful. Management communicated effectively. Learned subtle skills in efficiency. Would recommend to people looking for short term work but not for long term work."

good,"Responsibilities:"
good,"They care deeply for their employees.  Management had an open door policy and I could always approach them with any concerns or ideas. Since it is a corporate environment it is very fast-pace and you do work long hours and put in overtime non-stop, so it may not be the right place for everyone but if you thrive in this type of environment then this is the place for you.  Management does not micromanage and will allow you to work independently and trust that you will execute and deliver.  They are also very flexible, you have work from home options and hours. My co-workers were the brightest and most hardworking group of people I have had the privilege to work with, always willing to help and you can learn as much as possible from them as they would from you.  That type of dedication and passion pushes you to do your best.  If stress is a factor due to long hours, you can bring your dog to work!"
good,A typical day at work would consist of shelving all the items assigned to an employee. It was a fun environment where you could socialize while getting the job done. Sometimes the management would frown upon it because they felt we were doing to much of one thing and not the other. In any way form or fashion did socializing affect my job performance.

After stretches, we then go off to do our assigned task. We work for two and a half hours between each break, first a 15, then a 30 minute lunch, then another 15 minute break. After a total of ten hours of work, we put away our carts, turn in our scanners, and clock out."
good,Good place to be if you are a self starter who thrives on autonomy.

good,Amazon has given me challenging responsibilities and that encouraged me to out-of-box.
good,"Amazon has a great amount of potential. There is a fantastic benefits package (insurance, 401k, stocks) but the corporate culture is very cutthroat. You must go into this place with you eyes open. Other than that I've loved my time there."
good,"The Amazon culture is one based on working hard and playing hard.  The workplace required attention to detail and time management but when the job was done there were great rewards for the employees.  The culture was set from the beginning by the leadership and was continuously strengthened by management on the floor.  Overall, a great place to work and launch a career, but if you are looking to stay and retire then be prepared to move."
good,Amazon has a very customer friendly environment. Amazon is a family based company. The hardest part of the daily routine in getting to know the different processes. The most enjoyable part of Amazon is the ability to learn every part of the Job.

good,"Praca z dużą odpowiedzialnością i perfekcjonizmem - lubię to."
good,"-A 10 Hrs a day shift its required for four consecutive days."
good,Work from home is always nice but the job security was non existent seeing as it was a seasonal position. I didn't mind my hours but would have much rather preferred 10 hour shifts or part time so I can spend more time with my 4 month old son. The pay was good and overtime was offered so I generally have no complaints about this position other then how short it lasted.
good,This is a seasonal job and is only busy during peak season. some Supervisors are great to get along with and some have a nasty attitude towards their employees.
good,"Its a 10 hr shift two 15 min break and 30 min lunch 4 day work schedule and 3 days off"
good,The job is tiring but not physically hard. It is rewarding at the end of the day to find out the fruits of all your labor by the number of packages you were able to ship.
good,"The days felt straight and you had to be hitting an impossibly high target, with in 2 weeks I was working at the top 5% but I still couldn't hit the 100% mark of work, only ever got 93% and that was me basically jogging every where."
good,Liked working for them but it was a temp job so didnt last long enough.
good,"At work we are measured by metrics of investigations /hour and the quality of our work, work well in a fast pace environment"

good,"Receiving orders through handheld device, accurately sourcing and selecting products for customers,"
good,The past one year has been great from a learning perspective. Amazon is a great company to work with.
good,"My day as a quality analyst started with a team meeting where i briefed my team of twenty Process Associates on what regions and product categories they need to set up marketing strategies on. Then the day involved meeting with clients, suppliers getting approvals on the marketing strategies suggested by my team. Handling the productivity and quality of my team was my prime goal responsibility."
good,"it was a fun job and I loved working out there, but the only down side to it all was the temp agency trying to pick favorites but other than that it was an amazing job to work at."
good,"It is a wonderful place to work,every day at work was an enjoyable day at work and the co workers are great as well as management too"
good,"I liked the work was difficult at first to get used to walking 10 miles a day but did help keep me in shape, only real complaint is the pay and the incentive pay. That a lot people really do not try because it is so low why walk so fast it's hard to walk at the end of the day if you only get a paper saying good job, do not get me wrong it's good to know how your doing it would be nice to make enough money to pay basic bills"
good,"My typical day at work is to receive all the boxes and scan in all the products coming into the building. I've learned good communication skills and to always make customers your number one priority. Amazon is a very large warehouse and there are many different type of co-workers there. I have learned to be a good team player and get along with each one of them. Amazon has a great management. They are always trying to do whats best for not only customers, but the employers too.  The hardest part of the job is to be standing in one spot for 10-12 hours a night. The enjoyable part is working with many different types of people and there's always something new going on."
good,This place is very beneficial to anyone in terms of gaining a better understanding of true leadership. The principles they live by everyday will help make you a better leader in any business field or company.

good,"Een typische dag bij the amazon begint met het openen van de winkel, daarna word natuurlijk de kassa getelt. We maken de winkel netjes en maken de spiegels schoon en de vloer, ook worden de kleren weer allemaal netjes gehangen. op dinsdag krijgen we meestal nieuwe levering, en moet dat allemaal gelabelt worden.Verder krijgen we via de computer 1 x in de week opdrachten over het etaleren van de winkel en interfilialen. Interfilialen houd in dat er onder verschillende filialen kleren worden doorgestuurd, dit moet je allemaal inpakken en wegsturen naar het hoofdkantoor. Wij staan met zn twee in de winkel, de werksfeer is erg leuk! Het leukste aan mijn baan vind ik het contact hebben met verschillende mensen en het helpen met de keuzes die ze maken in kleding."
good,I always felt that I was safe in the workplace as they took so many measures to ensure it. A typical day at work was to sign in to the pass card and have a meeting with the managers before we did anything so that we knew what was needed of us. We would work for 5 hours packing in a vibrant atmosphere. Then have a 30 minute break and then go back to work for another 2 and a half hours.
good,"Its a lot of work, a lot of time on your feet, but I really enjoyed it. Time simply flew by when you were working. You had strict quotas to keep per day, so you had to keep moving the entire shift."
good,"A typical day at work was to show up early, play ping pong in the break room for a few minutes. Clock in. Then report to stand up where we would discuss productivity of the day before and the goal for the day. Managers would assign us to a job depending on what we have been trained in then you continue that job for 5-10 hours. Management was great, everyone was lenient and understanding but still encouraged us to work hard. Co-workers were for the most part very nice and sociable though there were a few who you couldn't make happy no matter what you did. Hardest part was days when there was little work to do. The best part of the job was the management and the radio that played through out the building."
good,I clock in go to stand up where the manager gives us the news for the day and then we stretch. Then we go to work. I have learned that customers are important. The management is good and my coworkers are okay the hardest part of the job is trying not to have any shorts. The most enjoyable part of the day is break time and time to go home.
good,"Amazon does not emphasize on dress code. I learnt a lot while being an Amazonian which includes work life balance, working on multiple projects, team management etc."
good,"I worked from 7:30am-6:00pm...I packed boxes all day. I learned how to be open with others and express myself alot more. Manangement was always fun but firm they kept me going threw out the day. Hardest part of the job was just being on my feet all day 6 days a week not reallys seeing my family. The most enjoyable is the games we played at lunch or Pizza days , ice cream days. It was a very upbeat job."
good,Able to work in different areas and over time was available.
good,"I enjoyed working at Amazon, the only thing i didnt enjoy, was the fact you have an half hour lunch break. You work 8 sometimes 10 hours a day, and you get half hour, too get up too the canteen, get your food out of your locker, sit down, or heat it up, actually eat it and then have to get back down stairs.. all in half hour.. Which is slightly unfair and ridiculous. But other than that, i was happy with everything."

good,"Amazon is a very fun and comfortable company to work for. Taking calls and working with many customer is very satisfactory, I learned a lot of details when it comes to assisting customers in many situations. The co-workers were very helpful in all situations, and very easy to get along with. There truly was not much of a hard part in the job. They provided a lot of detailed training and assistance. I enjoyed all aspects of my work here."
good,long hours but great pay as much as overtime as possible. i love it
good,"Dans cette entreprise, les horaires sont en deux 8."
good,It isnt a walk in the park. The first week will be your make it or break it point. my co-workers were amazing. We kept each other uplifted. the hardest part is the strain on your body. The most enjoyable part is making it a competition.
good,Great place to work. Online and on site are good environment.
good,Warm up stretching then hard work fallowed by more stretching and challenging work
good,Only downfall was the layoffs. Great place otherwise. Pay could have been better.
good,"Hate they laid me off was making good money. worked nights, management was cool as long as you got the job done.. co- workers cool. The most enjoyable part of the job was payday"
good,While I was a employee there I was able to gain a lot of job experience moving from machie operator to maintenence technician and building a knowledge base for hopefully futhering my career in the maintenence feild.
good,"everything was strict there, make sure your in avail at exactly 5 min after shift starts."
good,A typical day was storing items on to selfs and i learnt how to store items properly and eiffently. the management was very good at amazon.com my co-workers allways helped me if i had a problem.
good,Very busy and high pace working environment.
good,"Excellent company and the working environment is safe and clean. Constantly seeking ways to improve the quality and quantity of the amazon experience for employees, managers and customers. The only issue i experienced was the lack of leadership experience at the site management level. Amazon hires extremely smart individuals but they then to lack leadership skills."
good,"Set up my pick teams in the morning, with specific areas to pick from and making sure those areas have work in them. Make a plan with my management team for the day, and communicate any changes. Monitor workflow throughout the day, to ensure all customer expectations are being met. Call for new trailers to pick up sorts that have filled up and need to be replaced. Depart trucks according to critical pull times to ship out customer orders on time."
good,"a typical day at work felt like it would fly by, you just would grab a scanner and work on your own pace but making sure you hit your numbers. i learned that being a picker you have to be very observant. the management is good, and actually dont bother unless your percentage is falling below average. coworks you really cant interact with since its a self pace job, and everyone has seperate orders. hardest part of the job i would say is reaching the percentage they expect you to hit just because the warehouse is so big and sometimes the orders would be very far apart to find the picked item. thr most enjoyable part would be the warm ups in the morning and the paychecks!!"
good,On a typical day I sell
good,"Two words: Hard work! It's truly an honor working with such knowledgeable people. The company does very well with teaching and broadening the minds of each and every employee. A place where goals are reached, and issues are resolved."
good,"It was a great job, until hours started to fade. Managers don't know how to treat employers."
good,"Amazon.com was a great job with great pay. Since it is a warehouse that hires seasonal employees often, the job security aspect isn't that great."
good,"I found working at Amazon to be quite and enjoyable job. There was always something to do so you never got bored. You recieved three breaks total, two 15minute breaks and one 30minute break for lunch. Overall I greatly enjoyed this job, the only down side was being laid off after the peak season."
good,"WELL run. And you do your job well and you will advance, Theres no BS there. Its a very congenial place to work, easy to make friends, and they treat their people  well. The Medical and Dental insurance are great. Its a place you stay at a lomg time. I couldnt because of Personal Issues."
good,"The Leadership Principles that Amazon follows are great; however, Some leadership (from Junior Management to Director) struggle to use the Leadership Principles to guide there actions and impact department culture."
good,Good place for freshers no dress code and no restrictions can watch youtube inbetween works chat and email job is quite good though but the voice process sucks.
good,Working in amazon was exiting and fun. Its been pleaure working there.
good,Fun place to work around othersGreat job fast pays management was great I’ll learn to keep up the pace a learn to stay focus and determination and keep moving forward
good,Entreprise Amazon c'est l'un des meilleurs entreprises que j'ai travaillé avec
good,Amazon was a great experience for me. Had lots of teamwork as well as great leadership reasonable hours And also had lots of great opportunity to progress my career.
good,The work was hard and fast pased.  The environment was hot in the warmer times of the year and cold during the colder times.  I would recommend this place to anyone.
good,"Amazon was a very nice place, it was new and all the equipment was new and not beat up. Friendly staff including managment would do anything to help. The only bad I can say about the place was that everyone got paid the same and I thought that was very unfair. You have people pulling 110% and others pulling at 70% making same pay."
good,"This job provides me great pay and great benefits. We get Paid Time Off, Unpaid Time Off, and vacation on day one. The work can be a little difficult on your body but you eventually get use to it."
good,Trabajar como en todos los sitios.Lo malo que me pidieron que pague yo el gasoil los primeros meses
good,"I miss the time i spend with amazon,i realused that its not how much you get from your employer but what you becoming from what you doing matters a lot"
good,"The warehouse felt like a fun and safe work environment.  There you'll perform simple yet serious tasks that will take up most of your time, helping the day go by even faster.  You are mainly assigned a task, but if there is task that you don't feel comfortable doing then you can immediately leave and request to do something else."
good,"work at Amazon is very hard but well paid. Superiors do not help in solving problems, they only worry about making as much as possible of the target. trouble going to the bathroom."
good,Great diversity.  As long as you work and do your job you're good to go.  Physically demanding.  A lot of walking.  Managers support the employees and rally for their success because when you succeed they succeed.  Great benefits!!! Actually I should say EXCELLENT benefits!!!
good,"I learned a lot from working for Amazon, knowledge that I could carry with me going into another warehouse job. The safety procedures put in place were good and the managers were always very willing to help me with any problem I had."
good,working at amazon you will find out quickly that it is very fast-paced. be prepared to work the entire time. You need to be doing something all the time. Some buildings are nice with air conditioning but don't be surprised if you have nothing and its very hot.
good,"As a part-time warehouse associate, for the most part, the job requires physical labour but is easy. I do enjoy my job, the hours and days that I work (Sunday - Thursday). Additionally, because this is a warehouse environment, the job requires a lot of walking and standing. Management is okay."
good,Was good for part time but I was looking for full time. When I started I got little to no training but that was to be expected since the site was just starting and when it got going the staffing issues worked out and got more smooth
good,It's a good paying job they really work with you and help you any way they are really strick the fact they have three breaks is good but it goes by too quick.
good,"Amazon is a friendly place to work at. The job is fair, you just have to stay consistent with a fast speed & you’ll be fine. Sometimes it seems like our managers are lost but the experience is still great."
good,"I am enjoying the job but the hours are currently not meeting my financial obligations. This company divides its job postings into its hourly, fulfillment jobs, which include its home-based customer service agents."
good,"Pressurized  work environment."
good,It's a good place to work. They have a lot of benefits the staff are really understanding. You get earned paid time off each paycheck. The other co-workers try to help out as much as possible.
good,This job is perfect for gaining the best knowledge in the workplace. Lots of learning and changes. Teaches you to adapt and be flexible. Every day is day one and there is always someone willing to help you and share knowledge. Friendly and fun colleagues.
good,fast and accurate work demanding by amazon but it’s nice atmosphere ... managers are good and hr persons are also very good.. sometimes it’s hard to be so fast and accurate but overall gd experience
good,"I am able to work only days I can and only need to work 1 day a month to stay a part time worker. The only downfall is that they say you have a 15 minute break for your 5 hour shift, but its really only about 10 minutes."
good,"All in all cool place to work I come in do my pre trip, get my route, load up and start my day. Some days you can have 180 stops with up to 260 packages to deliver."
good,"What I like about Amazon is the delivery experience and making contact with customers. That we fulfill the customer experience, within reasonable deliverable expectations."
good,Everything was just awesome as compared to the company's which pretends to be the best. Atleast they fulfills whatever they have promised. People are truly awesome and environment is best.
good,Great place for anybody to work if you want to work. Lots of opportunity to cross train and to work overtime when it’s available. Also they give out lots of prize incentives for associates as well as giving out treats on breaks.
good,j'ai beaucoup aimé travailler et m'investir chez amazon france
good,"Typical day at Amazon is busy and you have to work fast and lift heavy boxes and there is a sense of friendly atmosphere.  I learned how Amazon processes packages for delivery in New York City; it's a very demanding position, you lift heavy boxes and you are on your feet for the entire 6 hours you are there."
good,"I worked as a seasonal associate during the holidays. They paid really well with bonus money for signing up for extra shifts, the pay increase went from 15 to 18 during regular hours and up to 20 for midnight shifts. They broke up all shifts to 3-5 hours, usually we went the full 5 during busy times. They offered opportunities for some to go home early, if you're sick, tired or bored and want to leave, no bad consequences. The pay is weekly, including overtime and holiday pay as well. Staff and management are pretty laid back. Obviously, work and safety is priority, but they are fun people to work with. Unfortunately, I didn't make the cut after the holidays but neither did a lot of the seasonal hires. So don't count on staying if you get hired on as seasonal/temp."
good,Très bonne ambiance globale avec les collègues et les supérieurs.
good,"Productive work environment, fairly good growth opportunity, friendly workers and customers, safety is always first. Just an overall good work experience."
good,"I enjoyed working at amazon for the most part. I was hired as a seasonal warehouse worker. The pay is good, but be prepared to work long hours (10 hour shifts). They take safety very seriously so if you violate a safety rule be prepared to get a write up or be terminated."
good,"productive work experience, good pay ,and beniits. Feel employes should be paid more do to 10+ hour work week only complaint is lack of verbal communication between co workers."
good,"Ok place to work great for college students "
good,"Learnt how to work with a variety of clients from a number of fields. The person managing me was very open, encouraging and extremely target driven. All for the better, as we hit our targets."
good,its a very normal day at amazon inc a lot of work. i learned how to pack food and also learned to use scanners to identify products in the warehouse. the most enjoyable part of the job was the break room because it had videogames inside the room.
good,"Good job."
good,"Because of a back injury I was unable to continue to work with them. i enjoyed the work there, and if I had been able to feel I could ask for help in lifting the truly heavy items I would not have had a problem continuing to work there."
good,Working there was amazing the people were nice and friendly and the job was very Organized. I highly recommend it and would go back and work there again l.
good,I'm a really nice person and I could be your best friend. It's was fun and really cool. And there was alot of fun people there too. And I meet couple of new friends
good,"It was a fun job the first year, then the daily routine of delivery became to high in package counts barely being able to complete your route on a daily basis"
good,"Amazon is an amazing company to work for. they offer many benefits and opportunity to move up within the company. If you want 40+ hours along with the option of making your own schedule, I suggest it."
good,Fast pace work days. Learned how to manage myself and my time. Management was very responsive and supportive. Hardest part of the job was the physical labor. Most enjoyable part of the job was making people happy by handing them their package.
good,"Toujours à l écoute, convivialité, esprit d'équipe."
good,"travail agréable ,sans préjuger , conseil tout le temps , courtoisie"
good,Amazon is the perfect place to work if in a bind and need a financial relief. There are also many different resources that they other to their employees which came in hand numerous times.
good,"It is a beautiful community with a good job and full of long activities!"
good,"I worked there as a seasonal employee. It’s fast paced and requires a lot of energy and hydration. I liked it, but it just wasn’t a fit for me and what I wanted."
good,"A typical day would be very busy with different job duties. I always had support from my Manager to succeed and progress, Job demands highly motivated people due to industry competition. Relaxed atmosphere."
good,"Amazon overall is a good company to work for. Benefits are excellent and pay is great. They have a strict policy on safety. They want you to leave the same way you came to work...in one piece. If it's bad weather, they rather for you to stay home than risking coming to work. Management is below average due to showing favoritism."
good,Amazon is a very fast paced environment that challenges you to step up to the next level. Must be willing to be flexible and be able to help in all parts of the organization.
good,I overall liked working for Amazon. All of my coworkers were nice and i had no problem moving up easy. I learned a lot from working at Amazon I am sad i had to leave.
good,"It's a fun place to work. I like the fact that you are your own boss. you just have to scam the packages and deliver them on time, it's important to read what's on the guest gate before entering."
good,"Je me suis lancée dans cette aventure avec beaucoup d'aprioris ! "
good,great atmosphere. People are nice. This company has different schedules that could adjust to your ordinary life. A typical day at work depends on the hours of your shift it could be part time or as a full time employee.
good,"This company is really good. I worked there for 3 years and the managers/people are really nice and helping, if you don’t know something they will help you with a lot of staff.When I started this job I be honest about this, It was little hard but you get used to it and it will be easy, So I love it there. Thank you!"
good,It is a good company . I would recommend people working there. The work life balance is fine n Managers are fine to work with. No issues with the salary as well
good,Pay wasn’t bad at the time but the hours wasn’t ideal especially during peak season they should try improve working conditions adding air conditioning
good,Its fun getting to see all the different types of items they have. Management is there to give you a heads up and show you how to improve and work faster also at a safe pace. Hardest part of the job is that your on your feet a lot you walk around or stand for long periods of time its always leg day.
good,An easy going day learned how to track orders refunds and to helps customers find what they were looking for management was okay they hire to many people that doesnt have much management experience
good,"L'ambiente lavorativo in amazon è stimolante ma non è per tutti, occorre tenere un passo veloce ma costante e alla lunga è sfiancante."
good,A typical day at work is a great 10 hour shift. The management team is great. The hardest part is the walking the most enjoyable part is making our goals .
good,"Working for Amazon was not the worst job but its not an easy one. If you want to thrive you need to have the drive and want to be there. Most people quit after the first week because they can not take the work load but honestly it was not that bad. It is really labor intensive, but people can adapt very easily. Some of the managers were ok, but  its kind of hit or miss. Some think they are better than you since they are higher up and don't always treat you as an equal like Amazon tries to push. Other than that, Amazon is not the worst working experience. It is a good first job to start out at."
good,its an ok jobs for single people with no kids or older kids. you don't get to pick your job position. but the breaks are fun and sometimes they provide free lunches or they have an outside vendor provide lunch.
good,"It is a very diverse company to work for.flexible hours.stock , Advancement opportunity within. Transfer to different states.giving back to the community."
good,Four 10 days  gives you plenty of time off to do what you need to do. People are friendly an managers are very specific of what needs to be done. overall a no nonsense[lace to work.
good,"Hard work, feeling of accomplishment, good management with a strong workplace culture. The hardest part of the job is keeping documentation up to date. The most enjoyable part of the job is the constant growth, learning something new daily, and keeping current up to date knowledge of the ever changing environment.(s)."
good,"I will like to work there. But Amazon need people on they are busy."
good,"quite place, work hard, sometime fun, tv in all lunch room, raffle, good beneficies, games, short breaks, productivity, walk 10 hr. every day, opportunity for new position"
good,Amazon truly has a great work culture. I love working here and it's a great place to be. The people that work here truly operate by our leadership principles and are extremely customer obsessed. I would recommend this place to anyone looking to work for a great team with a great vision.
good,If you are physically fit and turn up with the right attitude and the right mindset you will be fine. The work is hard but enjoyable. They are a huge company and look after their staff well.
good,Reasonable work place not very exciting overall but the pay was decent I was very grateful to have worked for such a large scale company and it really helped me overall
good,"J'adorerais retravailler chez eux, entreprise dynamique et agréable"
good,"Breaks could be longer , hours are long but it’s worth it on payday. Work atmosphere is decent. Would recommend it to a friend. Night shifts are better"
good,"I am looking to work as Accounting.right now, I am working as delivery.  I complete my Bookkeeping Certificate last December, and I spouse to complete Public  Accounting in May 2020."
good,"I like the part time location, you come to work and do you job and go home. You really do not have to communicate with others if you don't choose to. I like the attendance point system."
good,Amazon is a job great for a variety of people especially high school  and college students the paid is great if you can stand and work for long hours on a lead floor.
good,"Only working for 4 hours a day for 3 days a week, with weekly pay. Job not difficult and is very manageable. Also optional extra hours during the week."
good,The work is very fast pace and demanding work because there is a lot of deadlines that have to be met. There is three breaks throughout a ten hour shift.
good,"The tag line says  work like its still DAY 1 and Work Hard, Have fun, Make History and the tenets are amazing, the work culture is good. The work is less stressful and Amazon really cares about the customer. That's one of the reason why Amazon is called World most customer centric company. Well as an employee, it feels great to learn, work and aspire to grow within the organisation"
good,It was a seasonal job. If you can work a 10 hour work day with no interruptions then you'll do great. Training is fast and confusing. Work culture is amazing. Same for benefits. But the training really needs to be more thorough or you'll never advance.
good,"Nice place to gain some experience and make some new contacts and enhance your communication skills,presentation skills"
good,If you like  problem solving and a competitive atmosphere this job is for you.  We do safety meetings every morning and our management team really cares about the staff.  Overtime is usually available  and we are rewarded extras based on performance.
good,Very productive and good work culture in amazon . I would recommend everyone to get started applying for jobs in amazon and i feel valued and stress less working in amazon
good,"As a Whole Foods shopper, you get paid for performing a perfectly normal activity like shopping. You are sent customer's orders onto your phone, and shop to complete the order. You get to sign up for your hours, you keep the job as long as you have at least one shift a month. The people you work with are pretty chill. Sometimes it's really busy with not enough shoppers, and sometimes there are no orders for at least an hour."
good,That its a 10 hour shift 4 days i worked through peak season so I was working 12 and 5 days but it was a Ok job it was just not as organized because its a new building but soon it should be put together really nice
good,Provided excellent work/life balance. The three day weekends were definitely a plus! The job was very fast paced with a heavy emphasis on high volume of fulfillment. Management was supportive and company culture was very important.
good,Long hours with hard labor but once you get the hang of it it’s a easy place to get accustomed too been here for about 3 years and the pay is pretty good if you work 4 or 5 days
good,"Hours were good and pay was reasonable. Management was friendly, helpful and understanding. I found the culture of the workplace to be exciting with many special events."
good,"I enjoyed working for Amazon, productive, fun workplace, good management, fast paced work environment, various shifts to meet your availability. ensuring quality of products along with marking orders in a timely manner while maintain a safe working environment."
good,Pay is good but not enough hours through the week. Great job for someone wanting part time work. Management at Jax 1 is okay but some of the Ambassadors wanna act like supervisors instead of an employee. Some are bossy and rude. I understand they have a job to do but respect goes both ways.
good,"i was order picker using the hand held scanner, with all the updates of what the customer has ordered, to put the item in the tote and then send them off on the conveyer belt, to be packed in the packing station and then posted off to customers and there other jobs available too, for example packing, labelling, loading and FLT if you have licence."
good,Happy Place To Work. My Experience Is That I Was The Wall Of Fame In AMAZON And Got So Many Awards In My Batch But No Increments Or Incentives Given. It's My Issue At Amazon. Rest All Good !
good,"its okay. A lot of hard physical work, if you aren't used to working hard and are looking for an easy job this isn't it. Everything else is good, flexible hours."
good,"In the break room they have a ping pong table, basketball hoops, video games. and other things to keep someone occupied and stress free for a while, plus free coffee among the vending machines that do cost money. With four hour shifts though, the lines for coffee build up fast and it is only a 15 minute break to stand in line for, so when the coffee is gotten, you have to drink it fast or you don't get it. lol"
good,"Pros: "
good,It was a good place to word it was an easy place they always made safety their number one priority. It was just an amazing job they showed you how to do everything to make sure you doing it right
good,I worked through a recruitment agency called Search so pay wasn't the best and was only for the xmas period. I enjoyed working there though it was a fast paced environment and very fun.
good,"Experience was ok noting more to add, I think that amazon is not a very good company they make you work many hours with little to zero break time or lunch time"
good,"Good pay and benefits, and a workplace centered around community and safety made it a good experience overall. The shifts were 10 hours at a time, four days a week."
good,"had a lot fun working there and learning new things to do like unloading the docks, packaging the mail and sending it out to the customers also learning to use a scan gun"
good,"no benefits, pay is good, alot of pressure and unorganized . most areas in the bronx aren't good areas to deliver. can be stressful at times. you aren't paid all hours that are suppose to be given to you"
good,"coworkers are kind, company may help advancement.  volunteer opportunities are plentiful. onsite food selection is pitiful. job security varies depending on location."
good,I would like to say that the environment of my premises was really appreciable. All of the employees have positive vibes which give energy to every employee there . Once there was a sale week in october named as diwali dhmaka and our target was to deliver max 6000 parcels in a day . With the help of our seniors and all my collegues we achieved our target
good,I learned that on a job that if you need help just ask don’t struggle by yourself is always people around that can help you learn more things Very helpful when there’s a lot to do I’ll get it done and I don’t hold back
good,"A typical day at work involved pulling & processing orders off of the delivery trucks that were scheduled to return each day. The work balance was nice as there was a break room equipped with multiple forms of entertainment for the downtime you had during breaks. While I enjoyed my time with the company, unforeseen events required me to relocate across the country where transferring to another amazon fulfillment center would not have been possible due to distance constraints."
good,The hours as for a part time job was good... Sometimes it was a little chaotic in there with trying to find carts to place your orders on but overall I liked the job.
good,"Flexible hours, good pay, ok management, only 4 hour shifts, dispatching and sorting, available to gain extra shifts.I had worjed at the fulfillment center previously."
good,"great place to work, would recommend anybody to join. little difficult to scale up cracking office politics. Technical profiles are very challenging."
good,"cooperative environment and friendly workers"
good,"This is a typical warehouse job, with fulfillment duties, including scanning, consolidation in pallets, wrapping of thousand of boxes, packages and envelopes, organized by zip codes of clients. This job requires team work to carry heavy boxes in a safety manner. Each line have a leader, who supervises the group performance, also have learning ambassadors, responsible for the compliance of best safety practices."
good,"Its a typical work day working for amazon. You come in the warehouse, you clock in, and you start your day. The most enjoyable part is the entertaining staff."
good,"The night shift is homie. It's quiet, peaceful, and no one to bother you while you work. Also, Nightshift lets you listen to music. Time flies really quick once you get used to the work load."
good,"It's never boring , always on your feet and love the training (wish there were more of it). The hardest part of the job is physically you have to be in shape."
good,The good part is that you still get paid for the whole 8 hours after your finish all your deliveries early. Communication skills aren’t that good. One person says something and any personal says different.
good,Fast paced and safe environment to work. There are many cultures that share the same goal to finish the task fast and correctly while maintaining safety.
good,Environnement de travail agréable une bonne cohésion entre les équipes
good,It's a good company to work with. You can easily seek a transfer to another region or country when you're eligible. So i like working with Amazon because of the above reasons.
good,evrry things good except when they give me delelevry irea too far i spend a gas and time higher than what i got as paid and some ties they give me  packeges i cant finish theme at the time of the block
good,"It's a great place to work. Set schedule. Only issue is when it's slow. During the holidays and peak the money is good. After peak hours slow down, which effects your pay check."
good,"Amazon takes very good care of their employees.  But, this work is very physically demanding.  So, you definitely earn what you make in pay.  HR at the local facilities are not very helpful.  I have been trying to transfer to a different position in a different state for over 30 days now.  I'm still not sure they can accommodate my schedule."
good,I have no comment at this time. I have work with Amazon for several years since it has come to southeastern Virginia. Amazon had great benefit package for maintenance medications
good,"he company is quiet professional in terms of working, perks and everything else that you can imagine.The managers are quiet supportive.The rest area is also quiet good."
good,I love working at amazon it’s easier and faster for me. And everyone seemed to be really nice to me I would recommend actually working here if I were you guys
good,Customer Return was different at amazon learning different stuff in different locations in the building sorting and removing items from packages in which the customers returns. Under loading trucks and checking computer of customers comments of why the  Items are being returned.
good,"Any day at amazon is always a rough day, time is of essence at amazon its fun when your working with people that's going at the same pace as you from the department i was at loading those trucks ensuring that the loads get out in time without a miss because we hate when a customer complain about not getting there package on time."
good,"I like the work, and management,plus the hours.just wished it was full time! They treat people good and have benefits that will blow your mind.plus they pay you if you go to school and then leave their company."
good,Buona esperienza per approcciarsi al mondo del lavoro
good,Okay employer. Flexible hours which accommodated my personal needs. The pay is okay. Not sure if I would ever work in this capacity for Amazon again. Thank you
good,"Expect challenges daily. Expect your expectations to be enhanced and upgraded. Fulfillment of each order will, of course, provide a roadmap with each process made at each facility."
good,"Pay and benefits are great. You'll see and meet all kinds of characters, but generally most of the other associates are easy to get along with. Security and safety are huge aspects of the amazon workplace."
good,I was there for 6 months. people are basically pretty helpful and managers are good. pricing team have deadlines and task that are set to be finished on a daily basis.
good,"If you don't mind working 10-12 hours per day this job is for you.  Promotes within which is great for those willing to go that extra mile.  Stock options are great with a 401K , fully vested after 3 years .  Fastest growing company in the world.  Amazon has it all."
good,A great work environment with great and nice leadership. Safety always comes first and its the most important like number one work ethics. leadership is always ready to assist. HR is a great problem solver too
good,"	Efficiently handled the pre-trip and post-trip inspections of the vehicle before leaving the company premises"
good,"Pros: Very Good pay, flexible timings, rotational shifts, Over Time work with additional pay, "
good,Safety is the most important thing in Amazon. Work culture is very high. All employees are treated with respect. Managers are open and happy to help in case of any problems.
good,In this company work culture is very good. If done with your work you can go home and they have 2 week off in a week. Also they have paid leaves and other benefits.
good,What I like about Amazon was they always kept u busy.But my responsiblity was to make sure I pick/pack the right products that the costumers order.what I dislike was we stand on are feet for 9 hours but after a while ...u get use to it.
good,The job is very fast paced. You can't spend to much in the restroom or you'll get a point. You get a 15min break and the walk to and from the break room is 6 mins away if you're working in the back. If your late going back to your lane its a point.  If you don't scan as fast as everyone its a point. Points are something you don't want.
good,"Good place țo work,good pay,days off,safety above all,good canteen services,good training. Its ok that You are asked to pasa an alcohool ANd drug test.Good experiențe after all."
good,My overall experience was good and got to learn a lot of things. The company environment was friendly and less work pressure. The opportunities in the company was great.
good,"Challenging workplace that does not accept mediocracy. The work, focus & delivery of results are expected. Tools for success are provided, but you to own your own development."
good,It’s a tough job but they pay great. I bought a car in 2 weeks of working there. I killed myself with overtime but it was well worth it. They also offer great health benefits.
good,"• Primarily dealt with Service quality with multiple Transportation services along with other operational issues and activities related to Transportation process and optimization."
good,"I have been working at Amazon full-time"
good,Amazon offer great working conditions and acceptable compensation.
good,"Day starts with a managers talk at stand up area, body stretches and day's plan. I have improved my time management skill at amazon. The work culture is too good there as everyone works with the team spirit. Sometimes a 10 hour shift feels like too long and tiring but with everyone working together, it's not that difficult."
good,Always a job to be done. Management was great to talk to and able to work with you. Good with PTO and Overtime. Able to leave if you had time on your card.
good,"My review overall is that it is an excellent workplace and great with time management. They support education and have educational benefits. Management needs work but overall, 4/5 stars"
good,It's a very good place to work where you'll have very productive as well as fun environment. You can work there as much as you want and also you can chill out. Work life balance is very high since there won't be any stress and pressure.
good,"A nice place to work with friendly people with a free work culture and lots of fun"

good,There is always room to learn more and to help more which is exactly how I love to work. Its easy to make great friends while working hard. Everyday is different from another.
good,"Amazon is a relaxed company. You dress as comfortably as you want and you choose when you want to work based on what’s available. Only one downside to this system. It’s first come first served. You are essentially fighting for a shift every week they’re posted. If you work in a facility with many workers, chances are you will not be able to pick up many shifts. You must take note of when the shifts are updated or there won’t be anything left when you try to sign up."
good,"A good place to start and the salary they provided is decent."
good,"AWS was a challenging place to work - in a good way. It forced me to constantly think outside the box, as well as keep current in product management theory."
good,If your willing to work hard and make rates they will pay you for it. Been here almost 2 years and the benefits are great plus they have a stock program that allows you to but stock.
good,Busy and fast pace.  Lots of walking on concrete floors; soft insoles are not enough.  Must always keep busy.  Nice to be able to select your own schedule.

good,"It worth to work for Amazon."
good,"If you need to supplement your income or want to go to school, this is a great place to work. It has an excellent life/work balance, you get hours to take off with no call-in, they help you pay for school and there are 3 shifts to choose from. Dental and vision plans are great. No medical; they supplement you in pay for that."
good,"good environment and friendly and feeling as team player. also good friend and time work flexible also benefit..."
good,Work place at Amazon is really pleasing and encourages the employees to contribute their best towards the growth of the organization in every way possible.
good,"Enjoy getting to the money and  work hard play harder ,until you reach your goals let nothing or no one hold you back  from being All that you want to be."
good,"While a challenging place to work, Amazon will constantly reward top performers with responsibility beyond their tenure or age. However, advancement and overall enjoyment is highly dependent on your broader team and your manager. Make sure you have a good rapport with, and trust deeply who you will be working for, including those up the leadership chain."
good,"its a fun place to work, at little tiring but if your surround around fun people, hours will feel like minutes. i learned how it feels to work in a team environment."
good,Very good culture and frenk staff in my office and whan I am facing any problem in my work very supporteble staff and good timing 9 to 5 or something like that every time I am responsible for my work and whan I am submit any report with my boss my boss feeling very happy with my work. Thanks

good,"................."
good,"Amazon is a great job to have. Overall, The packages are just heavy and you work part time hours! I would recommend this job to people who wants to gain mail sorting experience!"
good,"I love being a shopper but it's difficult to pick up hours.  The hourly rate is great, however shifts are few and far between.  So making money here is difficult."
good,"I enjoyed working there. I  learned how to operate a cherry picker ,build cages for storage, worked on assemly line. Got along with co workers and supervisors."
good,I enjoyed my job at Amazon. I was a dedicated worker always on time and a team player. I learned a lot doing my employment at Amazon. The most important part of the job was doing my job right and being a team player.

good,Amazon is a great company to work for they have many positions for many kinds of interest. At Amazon there is always room to grow in the company and learn the Amazon way.
good,"Was not here for long because I had to move, but it seems like a pretty good company to work for and succeed in. I hear nothing but good things about this company."
good,Management needs to take a stronger role in leading teams and defining objectives. Freedom to develop your own solutions to problems and gaps   that slow productivity.
good,"It was a great time working there, though for few  months. The management staff and colleagues are great, there isnt lacking behind because there is a way to assist each other on the job. Before the start of the days  job there' us alway a  briefing on the job and lots of encouragement."
good,"Working from home is great, but be ready to be bored out of your mind when call volume is low. "
good,"Flexible hours, you can pick and choose your days and hours. Very fast paced. Most people that like working there are because you only have to work a day out of the whole month and they won't let you go as long as you work one day."
good,"A typical work day, hate or love have to do what you have to do no matter what. I was a picker for my first time yes i dislike it but it has gotten better overtime and if you keep up good work. You may get offered to another position inside the warehouse. All up to each individual"
good,"Good place to work, diverse job opportunities.Four day weeks are good. You can arrange shifts around any family situations. There is a canteen which serves freshly cooked food and salads. The HR department are always on hand in house and on the phone. The management are always there to help you with any queries or problems that you may have."
good,It’s not that bad to work for them but you have to be aggressive when it comes to getting a shift. I was one of the people that my amazon moment account wasn’t working in the beginning. I just wish they had fixed my account problem as soon as it happened because then I would be able to get a shift and work. But instead I had to wait 3 days for it to work and by then all of the shifts were taken. So now I’m at home just looking at amazon moment every hour waiting for a shift to hopefully come through
good,"Amazon is a good company to work for. Only if you are ready for a fast pace environment. Great shirts to pick from, and can practically make your own schedule."
good,"Is a good company to grow."
good,tranquillo e sereno bel posto e stipendio adeguato. un po competitivo
good,"Easy to go to work, worked with great people and the schedule was great. Got to stay personally motivated but other then that it was nice getting paid weekly."
good,"Amazon is a very different warehouse for the simple fact that there is a lot of work to do and you need to be trained for every small job. It's good to ask to be moved if an opportunity comes because is a reason to learn new stuff that might help in daily basics, such as packing.. You never know when you have to pack something to deliver and it's good to know the way to pack it for the package to arrive safely. This was just an example,but you can find out a lot more, therefore if you want to have a diverse job to learn new stuff and build up warehouse experience, Amazon is the place to work in."
good,"Best and talented peers to work"
good,"Provide useful, constructive feedback."
good,"Amazon Fullfillment center JAX3. Awesome time working there. Money was good even at $13.50 an hour. Bonuses for work performance and attendance, and if you want to try other work sectors within the warehouse they’ll accommodate you. 10hr shifts 4 days a week and an option for overtime on the holidays. Why did I quit? Transportation issues. But now the terminal have bus routes."
good,Don't apply unless you want over time. Must be able to do a lot of walking.  Dead lines are by the 1/2 hour and must be met. There is room for learning different job positions.
good,great job fast and good people lots of ops to go prement and staff great canteen clean if want real job this place to go and your be happy if like to work
good,"Very productive place with lovely people around and to be a part of the fast pace environment was a lovely experience. "
good,"Working at Amazon was great to get money fast and or to stay part time, the work you do can be strenuous depending on where you are in the warehouse. You should dress comfortably for the weather, how the weather is outside sets the tone for how it'll be inside."
good,"Really a good place to work, looking forward to work again. I'm eligibleto work full time without restrictions and eagerly waiting to be a part of amazon uk again."
good,It was 5 day job and was getting enough time for my family. Learnt a lot of things specially leadership skills as I was taking care of the entire team.
good,"A typical day for me at Amazon would be walking in a well air conditioned building buzzing with energy from the people who are there and conversations going on. Use the stairs most likely if I don't feel like using the elevator and go to the cafeteria to get fruit or anything light. Sign in and log in and help customers from the UK via telephone or email with their packages but in between not being busy with calls, emails or chats the floor is clam but energetic to an extent. At first the hardest part of the job was to find creative ways to let customers know bad news or deescalating a situation but it became bearable after time. Most enjoyable part was working with different people and speaking with them which opens your mind up in your life experience."
good,Doesn't require much brain power. Very action-based. They care about numbers and safety. Everybody's in competition for numbers. Quick turn over from burn out and repetition. They lock your hours to 20 (24 if you flex up during peek) so get another part-time job.  Lots of opportunities to move up and learn new things. Stressful to move up. Very Physically demanding.
good,Was a great change of pace and is more mentally demanding than a normal warehouse job. Was able to have great coworkers and made some friends along the way.
good,"great place to work for the freshers "
good,"There is always new cutting-edge technology you can learn here."
good,I worked a seasonal position for the holidays. They do a shift bid type thing that is first come first serve. Shifts are usually in 4 hour blocks and go fast but if you keep an eye on their website or app and leave it open you can usually grab a few.
good,An innovative company that fosters a collaborative environment. The company invests in your growth and movement within the company.  Excellent benefits.
good,good and flexible work where you have the option of day switch . The management is very professional and helpful. Very clean and tidy environment . Over all  positive attitude  of all Amazon associates.
good,"Good, but very stressful. No growth. Understanding is there. But there's no opportunity much. Cant go with the same salary. Not much hike. Management should be look into it."
good,Amazon is a good company to work for they have good pay and good benefits they also like you to give them feedback to make the company better but if you don’t like to work at a fast past company this job is not for you
good,"The job was relaxed at first but steadily had gotten more strict. We had 3 days off, but because of the type of work, it didn't seem like enough. Unless you have no responsibilities this job isn't really suitable for those with families."
good,"here everybody work as a team and we handle a lots of packages everyday.  we enjoy while working celebrating birthdays, achievements, having fun, creating history. i am handling a large number of team. one who work here learn new things daily."
good,"Great place to work, very flexible schedule. Great people to work with and the environment is very professional. Helps increase skillsets for future careers."
good,Relax and enjoy the job good payment and flexible company. Lot's to walk around when you doing a picking buth you used to it in a couple of days overal good job
good,Bonne expérience professionnelle pour une étudiante.
good,Amazon gives plenty of benefits and good pay. But it's a hard job. It's both physically and mentally draining. You have to work 60 hours a week during Christmas which is called peak. They pay good if you can handle it.
good,"Its a vibrant environment at amazon, each day you have new challenges and lots of event in between to keep your morale high. I enjoyed a lot working for amazon and I would highly recommend to freshers that amazon really provides a kick start to a successful carrer."
good,It was a good place to work but i had to quite for school. That y i quite amazon but if i had the chance to go back i would. It a very good place to work very nice people there to talk too
good,"If you get stressed easily than this may not be the job for you. Warehouse life, rated type of employment if your working on the floor. Working with different walks of lives. Could be fun during busy seasons, but work 10 to 12hrs daily."
good,Assez agréable avec beaucoup d’aide entres nous beaucoup de contact entres nous
good,"Je travaillais de 17h à 00h30 , que ce soir entre les superviseurs , manageur et intérimaire il y avait une très bonne entente ce qui favorise d’excellents résultats"
good,scan merchanise and checked it made sure it was in good condition thenput it on the belt and let it go to warhouse goods 10 hours shifts but it was a very well exprierence job
good,"It's fun being able to walk around the store and acquire requested items. My first day was a walkthrough training day and my first order was split w/ someone else, which made it easier to accomplish the task!"
good,"I get paid to exercise! The work can be repetitive, but it feels really good to be so active. There are different shifts to work, so the jobs you do will vary. People are nice, and willing to help when needed. Management are always on the floor and accessible, but it would be nice to have a better relationship with them (when you're hard at work, you really don't get to talk much with each other). Warehouse very clean and organized, well lit.  It's a fun environment, and I enjoy working there. Hope they let me stay on past the holidays (hired as seasonal). Have enjoyed the flexibility, exercise, and meeting new people."
good,It is an awesome job to experience and it comes with many positives as well as negatives like every job. The positives were that it is a very easy going place as long as you get your task done. Negatives are that the hours may get very long.
good,it was just a job and place to work just like any other.  Nothing special was either right or wrong wit the place. It is just a place to draw paycheck.
good,Amazon is a good Company with different kind of personalities from individuals working. Sometime there will be people to be oppressive to others due to their origin and other. It is r the requirement to be safe for work and be safe at work all the time.
good,"Company culture was good and they have good managers "
good,Working at Amazon is fast paced and demanding. Perfect if you have a go-getter and positive personality. There's plenty of room for advancement and the managers are invested in your professional growth.
good,Management is great  And fun to work  and the customer service is great as well not much hours  but the team give out gift cards from time to time I would  Totally  recommend  This job
good,Packaging using rf scanner and working 10 hours a day for 4 days of you can work 50 hours for 5 days there a lots of amazon branches through Ontario ..
good,"Great experience , easy , environment, with multiple jobs. Fast paced, strict, minimum breaks . It's hard to come back if you mess up by disability or health reasons . But the job of sorting, scanning, and packing was ok."
good,"Fast-paced environment."
good,It was nice working in amazon because i gain a lot of experiences while working there as warehouse assistance  making now friends and able to worked there
good,I would like to work for this company Amazon is a big franchise and I'm quite sure we'll enjoy the people because I am a people person and I would love to live in this area
good,"Great work place. Offer flexible Scheduling for Employees. Pay is higher than most entry level jobs starting off, as a seasonal employee there is also opportunity for growth in several positions at Amazon."
good,"I have been working for less than a year.."
good,"Overall my experience here was great. I got plenty of hours, my job was explained to me and I was able to successfully fullfill my role as a packer. I would say the biggest struggle was the heat. Too many people and not enough AC units!!"
good,I would work for this company again. Amazon can be hard on your body at times but you are compensated well. The managers are caring and they are very understanding.
good,"Working in four Hr blocks is convenient. However, it's hard to have a consistent 40 hour pay week."
good,"Amazon has always been a good temporary job. There's always something to do even if people don't shop as much as they should. Safety is always taken into priority and that's one aspect of why it is a very worthwhile place to work. This new Warehouse has recently been opened, but as to right now, management keeps hiring people and leaving those who already have the experience, out. I have enjoyed being taught everything behind the scenes to Amazon's shopping system, but it feels like they don't help you grow inside after one puts in their overall."
good,Très bon travail. Environnement de travail agréable. Bons horaires. Bon Management.
good,Working at Amazon gives you great opportunities for advancement. The Ambassadors are very helpful with answering and questions that you have to successfully complete your daily task.
good,what i learned was organization skills and it was a fun place to work. we would do stretches before starting the shift and you would be able to try new roles at work not just one. The people were really friendly and helped out a lot most of the time. The hardest part is probably in the holidays because a lot of packages would get there over 45 thousand packages
good,"Pretty standard work for a large production warehouse. Decent pay, decent but not great communication between different shift managers. They do recognize those who really put in an effort. A good day's work earns a good day's pay."
good,"A typical day at work here would include a lot of physical activity, almost constant work, and the need to hydrate continuously. They had really nice break rooms equipped with video games, couches, and a bunch of vending machines."
good,You go in and stretch when you go to work.  You look at the scanner and you walk to that location and you find the item and scan it and put it into a cart.  Then the item is sent to pack.
good,I really enjoyed working nights in the factory. Everyone was very helpful and you can really learn a lot in one night. It is fast-paced and you will be moving a fair bit so be ready to move all shift.
good,"The hours are long, the workload is quite high. "
good,"I worked the ship dock in a fulfillment center which is not for anyone with health issues such as knee, back or hip problems. Lots of walking & lifting, often fast paced & you will be on your feet all day. Coworkers & mangers were very friendly and helpful. Offers great opportunities & benefits. Would not have left if I had better physical health."
good,It was a good experience. The warehouse had to close and I had to switch to another job. I would have liked working there longer and eventually getting promoted.
good,"Ho lavorato 11 mesi da amazon mi sono trovata molto bene é un ambiente dinamico ero molto stimolata a lavorare sempre di più prendevo il mio lavoro come sfida ogni giorno per dare il massimo, menager sempre disponibili."
good,It was great environment with a lot of good people and it was such a nice experience for me. I would have continued working but i went back into education.
good,"Dock work is hard on your body but you wont get bored. "
good,"I really enjoyed working there.  Fast paced environment,  but very rewarding personally.  My manager kept me updated on my progress just about every day."
good,"There a lot of work in amazon,"
good,Working nights was a very easy shift. The managers made sure that we got our work done but made our environment very loose and easy to work around the warehouse. The employees were very respectful and helped each other out to make sure that we got our work done.
good,It is a fun place to work with great pay and benefits. They hire students right out of college giving them an opportunity to began there careers in there fields. It was a great warehouse to work in the management and leads were very approachable when you had questions.
good,I lot of learning in a fast pace ecommerce environment. High ownership to own tasks and lead it to achieve the goal within the deadlines to enshance the customer experience. Customer obessed and perfect mix of excellent culture and work life balance.
good,"Flexible Shifts"
good,"I enjoyed working there, Supervisors were easy to work with. Supervisors always tried to help if I had a question. They would work  with me when I need time off."
good,"Enjoyable employment with great team enviroment, good people to team work with. the cons here could be the overtime paid only double per shift. I have learned a lot since i work in Amazone and grow profesionaly in my delivery driver carreer."
good,"Pros: Great pay. Fair vacation. Affordable, good insurance. lots of opportunity for advancement. "
good,Provide better work environment to every employees and the salary is also nice but he bad thing is that in canada Amazon did not hire directly employees to work for that reason we have to hire by the employment agency that did not provide health benefits.
good,"This job is designed for people who like to work on their own. If you like to work as a team with others, then this job will drive you insane. It definitely did for me."
good,I had an amazing experience working w/Amazon during their Peak hiring season. I learned and worked on more projects in one month than in my previous 3 years.
good,"most enjoyable part was socialising with co-workers"
good,"Working in the amazon customer service can be stressful and challenging, but you also learn a lot and grow with your experience. The communication with colleagues and the management is easy-going and friendly."
good,"If you can pass a drug test/background check and read/comprehend English, you can work here.  There is no formal interview.  They don't even ask about your previous jobs.  They just need lots of warm bodies to unload/load trucks and sort packages.  The job can be fast paced and physical depending on the number and weight of packages during your shift.  So far it's been a nice mix of fast and slow, but we are about to go into peak season in about a month.  Then it will be insane.  I went into this job expecting the warehouse to be hot, but it is climate controlled. If you weren't working and sweating, it might be a little chilly if you were wearing shorts.  The dress code is very relaxed.  Just keep all your bits covered and no offensive logos/graphics.  Most days I enjoy the job, but some days there are co-workers that just stand around doing nothing or they are doing things but don't care about how their actions will impact their co-workers.  Overall, it's a good job.  I just wish they would offer full time."
good,Amazon has a beautiful culture. They are very big on including everyone despite was your differences are. The company is built on change and wanting to reinvent the way we see the internet.
good,"If you want to learn about the world of ecommerce and logistics, there is no better place to be at. Needless to say they are the best in the industry. It is a very fast paced environment with high expectations."
good,"The hardest part of the job is that you have to be able to keep up with the packages they are bringing to you , be able to scan them in bags without messing up"
good,A typical day at work is me clocking in grabbing a phone and beginning my first order of the day. Also making sure that I'm moving in a timely matter so I can complete more orders before the end of my shift
good,"The Amazonian Team so far are wonderful, we work as a unit to get the job done and try to help each other if we need it (there are days when people have their mood but we're human its normal). On top of that the workforce is very diverse: age, race, gender, it is definitely an equal opportunity here. If you're an introvert this is a good place to work because we focus on work and getting the job done, extroverts may have an issue because sometimes it can be very hard to hold a long conversation especially if you're a very social person. I been employed at amazon about a week and so far everything has been well. They will train you and make sure you know what you need to know especially adhere to safety regulations (there definitely big on that). I try to ask any questions or try to learn more because they do talk a lot about moving up in the company and it can be very easy as long as you're a hard worker and take initiative. I intend to stay as long as I can and advanced to build a career from here. If I ever do decide to leave it may be due to because I'm still young and wish to try other things or that the distance can slightly be overwhelming (about 35-45 minutes for me). Amazon is a good place to work, they allow you to choose your own schedule from their list of what is available and for which location may be available. It becomes permanent for as long as you are employed (it may or may not work with your personal schedule but its something). You can choose to work a morning, mid-day, twilight, or even graveyard shift. Around peek time, they may add a few extra hours/shifts"
good,"The job is pretty easy,  but be ready to WORK. If you work hard enough for a decent amount of time and your verbal about your direction in the company, it’s easy to move up. You meet a lot of different people and there’s always a lot of non work related incidents. People will say it’s like high school. You will see different people every month because people are constantly fired or leaving."
good,Full time is a lot more demanding and tiring. It’s a Lot of strain on your body and lots of lost time with family if you have kids or people to care for
good,I love working at Amazon with a lot of co-workers and a lot of overtime going to work what's a joy for me working with Amazon love the over time I love my managers and they love me too
good,"I love working at Amazon. It has changed me in many ways. I am able to challenge myself daily beyond my wildest expectations. We have an open door policy, which allows me to express my opinions, ideas, & concerns."
good,"Aprendi el uso de hand held "
good,Working with Amazon has been a great experience for me. Great teamwork and awesome pay for starters. Benefits are beautiful and the best customer service I’ve seen.
good,If you can work long hours and like a repetitive work flow this would be for you. If you are not already physically fit then you will be while you work there. Happy Hunting
good,"It is a good job to have if you want exercise while your working, with good benefits and decent pay. You must be able to have a good driving record and drive a van"
good,It really enjoyed this role. Job was challenging with lots of room for acceleration and pay raises. The position began as seasonal with the posibity of becoming permanent.
good,travail debout depuis toute la journée de fois la pression augmente
good,"Amazon frowns on complainers - look for constructive ways to voice concerns.  If you don't want to work hard, don't apply."
good,"Physical job, very busy, but can be a rewarding experience. There's a lot more work involved in the process of delivering packages at Amazon than one would imagine."
good,"Great place to work. Lots of autonomy. Fast-paced and on the job training. Stress level is not as bad as they say it is."
good,Enjoyed learning different departments in the warehouse and management was always there to help you understand what you were to do and how you can improve. Coworkers become like family and in hard times they would support and help out
good,"I'm scared . I will do what I'm told . I understand that i am only a merchandise to be sold , until I am educated enough to become a formidable opponent."
good,"Flexible schedule...Working from home taking incoming calls for Amazon.com."
good,They were a good employer and had a great work environment. The benefits are good and the breaks are a good length. The people there are nice. The company is very pleasing to work for.
good,"I was a Pick/Stow Ambassador so i always got to teach the new hires how to Pick/Stow correctly. I thought the job itself was pretty easy, its just you always had to be on your feet and keeping up with the pace that Amazon wants."
good,Good MNC to work for with great work life balance. Helping seniors and managers and no formals required.Very good approachable. Seniors and helping colleagues. Fun to be at Amazon great india campus.
good,I enjoyed the training and workplace perks like snacks and drinks available for shift workers. It was a supportive environment with consistent training.
good,"This is a work from home position which allows for flexible scheduling. I also like that they even offer benefits to part-time employees. I think the training could be improved. But overall, I enjoy working for Amazon."
good,There was never enough hours given. We were only scheduled for 4 hours but most of the time we were let go at 3 hours. I did enjoy that the managers there were really nice and you were given the ability to switch jobs and try new things.
good,Amazon is colossal in size and what they do to get products to their customer.  The culture is one of growth. I am recognized for the work and work productivity that I provide to the company
good,"The environment at Amazon is casual and informal. You'll see coworkers dressed in tee shirts and jeans (sometimes even shorts). You learn to make connections, since the environment makes it hard not to interact with your colleagues, at Amazon. Some managers and SMEs are not as supportive as they should be, but are usually available and willing to hear your concerns. The hardest part of being a customer service associate is the randomness of customer complaints. One irate customer who's unwilling to listen to reason could ruin your metrics beyond repair by giving you a bad rating. That being said, working for Amazon has a plethora of employee benefits and perks, with gift cards and goodies being handed out on national/regional holidays. There are also Amazon-only holidays such as 'Shawarma Day', where everyone gets free Shawarma."
good,I had no issues with Amazon. There are plenty of benefits. There are plenty of growth within the company. Amazon is all over/transferable. I would not have it no other way.
good,Overall I enjoyed my time working with Amazon in the past. The management team were fair. Everyone had been treated equally no matter what race or background. Love amazon.
good,Was flexible sometimes fast/slow pace. Several days over time some mangers were mean. I enjoyed the flexibility of picking which dept to work in.  The drive distance could become issue if not having a very dependable car
good,"Positive experience, interactions with people with different culture and background. Focus on safety,quality of work timed delivery and customer satisfaction."
good,Its very fast pace and rushing work. have to rush all the time. Competitive with lot of movement. Communicate well with the managers to notify problem.
good,I worked here for several years.  Some teams are better than others for work/life balance.  Choose wisely!  some more random words to make the minimum
good,"This is a rate company & it's fast pace. If you like fast pace & long hours, I recommend this job for you. Beware, only 30 min lunches and 10 min breaks."
good,great place to work. management is great. the environment can be stressful at time however if you are aware of what you are doing you will do just fine overall
good,People are treated mostly like a number not like a person. So typically there are only persons who mostly can't speak English and have difficulty in finding another job
good,"Demande de rendeent assez importante, mais formation au sein des different poste."
good,the work was fairly easy. of course the training should have been more productive then it was. hopefully they have changed the policy for how training is setup.the hardest part of the job is they want you to be on the phone during training when you have learned any information.
good,Operations ran 24/7 and I was able to attain alot ofundersatnding in Operations Management. I learned so much in such a little time and am thankful to have been abale to get experience like this.
good,Overall great company to work. Was very fast paced. Duties included to lyft stack bend load unload reciente pull push and lots of walking. Very physical demanding!
good,"Supervisors care about your wellbeing and are very accommodating. The worksite was arranged comfortably, although the warehouse was very large and required a lot of walking."
good,Good place to work if you are a hard worker. If you are lazy then this isn't the place. Good benefits. If you are married or in a relationship this may not be the place for you. if youre good at rejecting temptation then it can work you. There is so much temptation out there.  The women walk around wearing yoga pants or really short shorts with tank tops and they are very flirtatious.
good,"Very fast pace during peak season, quota's where expected to be exceeded.  Enjoyed the family environment and we all worked together well. Lunch and breaks could've been longer."
good,"I enjoyed my time there, but the commute was too long, especially considering the fact I was working another job. Its stressful to keep a high work rate. They will fire you if your rates are constantly too low for them (which makes it hard to go to the bathroom)."
good,Package on time to ship thru amazon trucks/cars. Management was organized and reasonable. I learned to scan and match order numbers to the correct shipment trucks.
good,I loved working there for about 2 years. The pay was nice and my hard work was recognized. Some nights I was tired but pushing through felt rewarding.
good,"Fast pace environment with attention to teamwork and safety. Have a positive attitude, help others and increase your learning of different opportunities."
good,I am a third party seller for Amazon and work when I want to. I utilize the Amazon platform to sell a variety of products that are available to Amazon customers all around the world. It is a nice way to supplement income.
good,I was a great experience to have been a part of.  Amazon is a very diverse company and has a wide culture of employees.  Benefits are really good considering other similar employers in the field.
good,"active place to work always people looking to help you, nice pay rate good overtime and always something to do and also a lot of promotions and nice staff"
good,The work was not difficult and the pay was decent with slight increases every six months to a year. During the peak season everyone has mandatory overtime which can make the holiday season difficult.
good,"Fun exciting, happy to have something to do. It's clean so it was a comfortable environment. People are nice and polite and happy to be at work. Intresting"
good,Good company work for very fast pase a lot of people to get to know and great place to work for and always able to around your needs and available and your at home life
good,Getting there fore was a struggle but it was well worth it the pay is good n the work isn't extremely hard and as long as you do your work there will be no problems
good,Hard working standing on your feet 10 every day 2 30 minute breaks fast paced environment. Easiest thing about the job scanning the packages. Management is still needs some organizations going on.
good,Long work hours but very fast paced. It can get stressful but the daily meeting before the shift starts helps keep everyone motivated. Everyday is day one
good,Easy job to do over the summer. Just gotta look at for how some people can't stack the packages properly making the job harder. They give 15 min breaks every hour due to the heat.
good,"- A data-driven company with tight deadlines. "
good,"I really enjoy working at Amazon.  Very fun environment and one of the first jobs, other than the Army that don't micromanage. I hope to stay here for a long time.  Great pay and benefits."
good,"Możliwość poznawania nowych ludzi, super atmosfera"
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job was working from home. I basically could work the hours I wanted. This was seasonal work. The training was good. If you've worked as a customer representative taking inbound calls, you would enjoy this type of work."
good,Amazon was a great place to work because of all the walks of life that came through the doors. It was the opportunity of a life time to meet and train so many people from different cultures/ethnic backgrounds that showed me how to adapt to different ways of teaching.
good,The job was really easy to apply for and get after the initial application there was a two week waiting period until my first day and after the first week the job was really easy to get the hang of and do everyday.
good,"At Amazon, it is always a busy workday. You will always have something to do whether it be stacking, water spidering, truck unloading and other things."
good,"This is a great place to work, but if you do need help with statistics they can fail at providing you with the proper tools to be successful. The co-workers were great."
good,You deliver too customer carefully and fast  your out all day on the road an different locations . If there was any problem while you were out delivering amazon was a phone call away with help sent ASAP .
good,Great place to start a job and work your way up to a career. Lots opportunities to progress in many different fields within one company especially if you are willing to relocate.
good,Amazon was a good job to work at...it was just a temporary assignment to work. I would still be working there if it wasn't for it being a temporary assignment...Needed something full time!
good,"The staff are great! Everyone works as a team to get the job done. Pleasant work enviornment. The only problem is rhe scheduling sometime work hoirs are hard to come by, but overall a great place to work."
good,"You'll love it. a very great place the work is always there ,they treat the employees very well they also offer to pay your tuition if your enrolled into college ."
good,"I only worked there because i had to, it was fine. They work you hard and are very strict but pay is weekly and u only work 4 days a week. which is pretty cool i guess"
good,Ho imparato il lavoro come operaia picking e pack con una buona esperienza sono in attesa di cambiare per migliorare la mia posizione  comodita' piu' vicino a casa
good,Working at Amazon you will meet friendly people. The managers always encourage everyone to work hard and to be safe. The benefits are great and competitive and the pay is great.
good,"As a TPM in Amazon we are required to start with a high level business requirement and put up a architecture of systems/services  to meet the  business requirements. The role requires the person to be capable of dealing with ambiguity, influencing stakeholders without authority, diving deep technically, demonstrate bias for action and back bone."
good,"Good place to work, great benefits, and work experience.  ample opportunities for advancement. friendly atmosphere. Hard work but fun. hated to have to leave but would so like to have the opportunity to wok there again for long term"
good,Punctuality is the major part which I learn after joining this company. Dedication and hardworking were rewarded. Get a chance to learn about management. Customer satisfaction was the topmost priority.
good,Great mentors and overall people. There is a level of responsibility given immediately when you walk in and it is amazing to be able to take that and run. They let you sink or swim on your own.
good,It can be easy some days depending where you work at. You get to meet a lot of interesting people as you work. Managers are great when you’re on their good side.
good,Amazon is a very busy and fast paced environment. The only negative aspect is the turnover of employees is high. This is a very physical demanding job and requires being on your feet for twelve hours straight.
good,Amazon is a great place to work I would love to apply again to work there again. The pay was great for the work I did I wanted to learn so much more but didn’t get a chance
good,I worked from home and it was great. The breaks were short and the workload was heavy during the holiday season. The work environment was great and management was supportive.
good,"Loved working at Amazon. I had a great experience, the managers were great. The people I worked with were helpful and respectful. They just wouldn’t work around my school schedule."
good,If you are looking to stay active and work hard to make sure that customers get their packages on time; then Amazon is the place that goals can be achieved every single day.
good,Management is just picky choosy which makes things harder to actually move up and get promoted but overall the experience working at Amazon is amazing.
good,"The company offers benifits to you "
good,"I got an internship opportunity to work at Amazon, as a Data Engineer - Intern. The team that I worked for was friendly and helpful. During my internship period, I learned Business Intelligence and reporting, improved my database skills, and got hands-on experience with ETL (Extract-Transform-Load)."
good,It was an ok experience.Was fine when it came to pay and hours and was cool to work with. If had to come back to it I wouldnt mind. All and all it was a good experience
good,Laid back and a fun place to work. Any position is easy. Very flexible with hours and days. Easy to get hired. There is really nothing more to say. I recommend...
good,Very good work place if you like keeping busy. A good team environment. Routine work so not too much change to have to adjust to. I liked the work and the culture.
good,Its like the saying goes 'You Get Out What You Put In' as if you go in with a positive can do attitude and prove you're not afraid of work then there is lots of chances at progression.
good,"this job was really fun and taught me a lot , the experience was great the management and the organization, everyone was a family and worked well as a group."
good,Amazon is a great first job. You learn to adapt to different work place scenarios quickly. You learn leadership qualities quickly. Advancement is mostly based on your performance and favoritism. If you stay long hours and are willing to kiss some butt then the position is basically yours. It's a very simple job that anyone can do. You meet very interesting people and make friends quickly. There isn't really a typical day at Amazon since you are never permanently assigned to a specific area. You'll always be moved around to different areas.  You can be scanning packages into bags one day and the next be at the dock unloading trailers and inducting packages. Pretty fun job.
good,A great working environment. Can seem like a jail depending on the warehouse you pick to work at. People are friendly but most stay to themselves. It’s very fast paced so if you can keep up or if you have horrible stamina in general...I’d definitely work on that. Other than that this is a really good job that pays.
good,A typical day is assembling and sorting orders in a timely fashion and paying attention to detail. I've learned to be extremely careful to avoid mistakes and accidents. I follow manager's orders and recommendations. I am polite and respectful to my fellow employees to maintain a peaceful workplace environment. The hardest part of my job is standing on my feet and staying focused on my safety. The most enjoyable part of the job is working for a good company and earning a respectful paycheck and working with my fellow workers.
good,"A fun, productive but pressurised environment where tight deadlines need to be met "
good,Enjoyed working at Amazon would do it all over again given the opportunity.Recommend anyone giving it a go.Only issue is the pay can be a little more.
good,you end up using your car for the job. a lot of driving. the hardest part of the job is finding the address in the dark or the customer has no address on house.
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, biuen trato al personal y proveedores"
good,"Great environment, great management. "
good,"It was production and fun at the same time, everyone was very helpful in accordance with the work and help but sometime we get bored if there is no work."
good,"As a fulfillment center associate, you'll be expected to WORK. It's a physical job, so be prepared. If you're lazy, you won't like it and won't be there long. If you look at it as getting paid to work out, it's awesome."
good,Right now I'm working in school as a teacher.I assure you that whatever work is allotted to me I will complete it on time and take the company to new heights.
good,"4 days a week, 10 hour days"
good,A lot of good people and I had many opportunities to grow and learn new skills. The fast pace was something you really need to get used to and can be daunting at first.
good,"Amazon is best company to work with they pay well, working hours are flexible, no strict business wear rules very relaxing to work there.management is very helpful."
good,"I really enjoyed working for Amazon in Barcelona, I have learnt a lot and developed my professional skills."
good,Great company to work for. i enjoyed the people I worked with I learned a lot about the company. they have the benefits from a company that i ever work for
good,"All around not a bad place to work. I've worked warehouse before and Amazon is pretty normal warehouse work. My only complaints are no sick days (all days off are unpaid and deducted from a set amount off allowed time off, and a Dr's note doesn't count more than once), except for bereavement time off. Some of the managers are amazing while others seem to have no clue/don't care."
good,Fast pace and hot environment but pay is decent compared to other warehouses. All benefits for full time and some for pet time. Move up chances are competitive.
good,"It really takes a toll on you physically if you aren't used to working such a physically demanding job. I was also told during my hiring process that the place was air conditioned but it is not. It has been especially hot in the warehouse during working hours so much so, I've never been sick so many times working somewhere."
good,The job was okay seems like a lot of work.You has to work very hard and go from one end of the warehouse to the other in little time without getting time off task
good,Fast paced work enviroment. 8 hour standing usual breaks. clock in ready to work for the full 8 hours. really no overtime low hours when you are seasonal
good,"Nothing is ever communicated to the workers unless you ask. You show up on time and your made to wait until they dole out work for the previous shift that was there before you and then whatever is left is handed out, who ever is left without work will be asked to either work in the warehouse or take unpaid PTO."
good,"Picking customers order using hand scanner, wraping pallets, packing items into the boxes"
good,"As a employee of amazon the company do look after you the benefits and salary are very good compared to most company's"
good,"Working at Amazon was a great experience that encouraged people to be on their toes at all times. At the start of every shift and after lunch, we would do stretch routines while one manager read announcements and I was usually the one who helped lead stretches even on extra shifts that I volunteered to work overtime for."
good,I deliver parcels as an independent contractor. It allows me to take initiative and develop my skills as I work alone as part of the Amazon team. It motivates me to be hard working and lets me acknowledge my potential.
good,Had fun working at amazon very cool people I work with made good friends job was easy but stressful at times but other then that it was a very good place to be
good,"I enjoyed working there,  because it was fast paced, kept you busy. But I I had to work my weekends, and I prefer to have my weekends off. Saturday and Sunday.  I would like to be paid at least $16.00 an hour. Because the starting pay was only at $10.00 an hour. Cannot survive off that amount of money."
good,"Driver job at amazon helper in West Covina California"
good,I really enjoyed my time in that place. Co-workers were incredibly friendly and helpful. If you have some problems you always can ask for help and you get it.
good,"Fast pace work environment, great training, paid breaks, great incentatives, competitive,  overtime is available during certain times of the year, relaxed"
good,"The hours didn't fit with my schedule. I was hoping for morning shift but the only thing they had was night shift. "
good,"My shift was daytime 7 to 7, I loved working there, everything was good, good pay as a day shift worker. the management and team leaders are very helpful. The job is simple but if you like to move around and variety, then this job ain't for you, you will find yourself standing in one spot for 10 hours doing the same task as a permanent job which at the end gets very repetitive. the job is target driven which is achievable if you work hard, however, sometimes productivity demand is high when asked to pack over the target number. The breaks are timed, if you want a job with decent money then Amazon is great, also there is flexibility to work fewer days if you are a student."
good,"enjoyed working for amazon liked the tasks of picking orders enjoyed the black boxes tasks particulalry "
good,"Ce qui m'a plu chez Amazon, c'est qu'on a jamais l’impression d'être seul. Nous sommes toujours entouré quoi qu'il arrive, soit par des collègues ou bien par des manageurs. Nous sommes d'ailleurs souvent coaché afin de nous améliorer chaque jours, ce qui créer forcément des liens avec tout le monde."
good,"- You can learn a lot very quickly in a very short time - Surrounded with nothing but incredibly smart and driven individuals. - Compensation is well beyond my expectations, and more than suitable. - Exciting projects all across the company that keep you interested and focused. - Amazon is changing the world"
good,Working in the warehouse loading trucks moving around a lot sometimes the job can change but the people there are really nice help you if you need it.
good,"J'ai travaillé en tant que préparatrice de commande en inbound et picker en outbound. Il faut être en bonne condition physique car on est souvent debout. Sinon le salaire n'est pas très élevé mais selon les périodes (Noel), on peut avoir des bonus."
good,"Walk in and greet fellow employees, grab a snack if they had them for us that day. Sit at my desk and log in. Calls would start coming in sometimes right away and sometimes would have long gaps in between."
good,I got trained very well and it was a very exceptional workplace . I enjoyed working at the warehouse it was one of the best jobs I have ever had . I loved it .
good,"I have over 5 years experience as a driver, ensuring that all my deliveries are efficiently and safely delivered in good time. I also have SIA Security Frontline license and worked at Amazon as Security Officer. I am a self-motivated hardworking person and I can work independently or in teams."
good,"- Hard work"
good,"I’ve seen only negative reviews for this job so I wanted to share my experience which was overwhelmingly positive. Something important to know is you don’t work directly for amazon as a driver, you work for a subcontractor. The transport company I worked for, FTA Transport, was great to work for. Routes were fairly engineered so you could easily finish them in under 8 hours and I would usually get paid for a full 8. My boss gave me time off whenever I wanted whether I had the vacation accrued or not. . Only reason I left is they only pay $15/hr and you never get a raise."
good,The co workers i worked with made the job a great place to be. Made u want to advance in ur job. Most of all great place everyone treated equal. Very easy
good,"Amazon is a very busy, lively place to work, requiring physical fitness, we cover over ten miles a day, and an open minded friendly character, there are many other nationalities here and being respectful soothers is a must."
good,"I didn't hate amazon I only hated that they gave you every opportunity to leave without getting paid, or you could stay to make your hours but they might run out of work."
good,Most of the time you are walking. There are many different lines. You are basically grabbing packages off the conveyor line and placing on the right pallet. you can choose whatever line you want to go to unless they ask you to help on a certain line. you are timed every so many hours of how many packages you do.
good,Fun place to work and plenty of people to make friends with. The hours are long but manageable when working with team players. Smoking area outside and canteen indoors.
good,Work culture is comforting compared to most of the companies out there. Sometimes work can be redundant and impact-less especially in operations field. So do enhance your skills and make yourself stand out of the crowd.
good,"The hardest part of the job would be the weather. On summer days its very hot to keep cool. In the winter, its very hard to keep warm. Some boxes are very heavy that you would need some help."
good,"A good experience and a great time to work it. Work in logistics is a not stop work with lots of very stressful time, but overall I did enjoy it and love my job"
good,"I am a part-time FC associate at RNO4. Part-Time workers strictly work weekends with no VET or MOT, but we do receive a $3.50 shift differential, along with free dental and vision insurance with a $500 medical allowance spread over 52 paychecks. We do not receive paid time off, however we do receive 30 hours UTO at hire, plus 20 hours UTO quarterly. Management seem understanding when you need/want to take time off as long as you have the hours to cover it. My overall experience has been excellent. The management team seem very personable and approachable, and seem to value you as a worker. This position is great for introverts. The job is not easy though, you will leave tired at the end of your shift, which is why I enjoy being only part-time because you have the week to recoup. I highly recommend working at RNO4, especially as a part-time associate, great pay, benefits, weekly pay, and especially are not subject to mandatory overtime (it is a perk for me)."
good,Great place with a lot of great employees! Enjoy working here and helping my co workers. Amazon is a great company and the position is straight forward.
good,The people were great they made share i felt really comfortable everybody was truthful peoples person love-talk made me feel very welcome to b workomg there
good,"Ambiente di lavoro sempre in evoluzione, molto stimolante e accogliente."
good,"They compensated you very well, and also they definitely worked with you, to help maintain a proficient work environment. More so, the atmosphere was extending to aluminate their employees."
good,"I loved it there and if they were hiring I would definitely reapply. I regret everyday having to quit because I got so sick I could not perform. I loved my co-workers and had some of the best managers I've ever worked with. At Amazon when they say teamwork they mean it, you could really sense the team effort and everyone helped. It wasn't about competing with each other but helping out others so the team all performed well together. However, this is not for those who don't have thick skin. Amazon customers rarely call to tell you that you are doing a great job. Expect to start negative and do your best to find a resolution and have the customer smiling at the end of the call."
good,"Great culture! I love the dynamics of this place. On the downside, if you have bad managers it can be really stressful. But overall its a great place with good benefits."
good,"I enjoyed working at Amazon and would return there as soon as possible if I were given the opportunity to do so. The hours were long, however with the shift rotations it made them possible to complete."
good,Learned multiple skills and typical days were normal hard working. Management was nice and they were always willing to help employees with any matters.
good,if you are looking for a job this is the place but expect standing for ten hours with short breaks and short lunches but great benefits  and easy to work with staff
good,Amazon has great pay but they fire you quick if you don’t stock as fast as they need you to stock. But other then that it’s cool it’s a typical warehouse job.
good,"Great and enthusiastic management. Customer support role was interesting because you  never knew what kind of call you would get. Driver support was easy but customer support for shipping and delivery lead to my burnout. Escalations was TOUGH. Yelled at all the time for missed deliveries that were beyond my control. Amazon may pay more now, but it was not worth it for $10/hr even working in my PJs til 1am."
good,"Was fun,got lots of experience,competitive and great people."
good,"its a very good work environment , a lot of space to grow, i personally think its a great job to start of with. i learned a lot from amazon and until this day i use all those tools to progress"
good,"Daily work includes running reports, auditing workflow, and coaching peers. We partner with client sites to provide HR Support on daily reporting duties and we audit risk for the site."
good,"I liked the job, it was crowded with all the trainees though... I wouldn't have left if I could have continued unhindered at my position... Working for the transportation team and driving the Yard Trucks was cool."
good,I believe the summary header says it all about Amazon. This is a very fun place to work where you get freedom to work and implement your plan. However this depends on the team and attitude across them.
good,"The working day starts before 8 am, the change takes 10 hours. Management is of great importance to keeping idle time low. Working as a Temporary Team Leader during the peak period you can get to know the many mechanisms and tools that work in such a large company as Amazon and most importantly learn how to use them."
good,a typical days work was making sure all parcesl and deliverys left they building on time to reach the customer on time .I really enjoyed working as part of a team and  on my own.There was many challenges like lost parcels that i had to find on time.I learned alot about customer service and customer care and to meet deadlines on time and work as part of a big team.
good,go to your assigned task for the day. finish an go home. management is good they listen to what you have to say. Its a fun place to work and goes by fast.
good,"This was my first work from home experience and if I'd stayed with my initial department, I would have been fine. It was a very flexible job opportunity."
good,Wear comfortable shoes and be ready to work hard be on time and have to be a people person because of the space you have to work in but overall it was a good experience.
good,I wouldn’t mind working there again was a fun and competitive with many benefits that help you and your family as well as flexible with letting you take time off
good,"Amazon gave me the most independent experience as an employee."
good,"15hr "
good,Enjoyed the workplace with having an 8 hour shift squeezed into 4 to 5 hours. Lots of Walking and Exercise. No need to join a Gym. Friendly co-workers and Benefits with clock in to win and Pizza Parties.
good,You can pick shifts around your everyday schedule and not worry about having to miss a day. Easy to get along with the people around you. Safety is bigger than productivity.
good,Nice people collaborative with ideas open minded.Friendly staff looking to motivate you more for the current position you have.If you have any problem you can discuss it with the line manager and they try to find a solution about it.
good,"I love the fact that the job is part-time, Why?? because it is a 4 hour shift in which you don't get you tired. What I love about my job is that i get to be almost anywhere on the floor, you are always doing something different whether is to be unloading trucks to scanning packages to moves pallets across the amazon warehouse. You get to interact with many people and management as well."
good,"Amazon has a lot of good qualities about it. They move fast and are very firm about getting things done. However, they make a lot of decisions that are counter intuitive."
good,"Best work I've ever been able to do. I love being a part of making the ""Amazon Magic"" happen. I always have a sense of pride when I see an Amazon Smile on anyone's doorstep."
good,"Work and workplace was a lot fun, great work culture as well."
good,"This is a decently simple job, the hours are consistent and the workload while sometimes very busy, is relatively tame compared to a manufacturing environment. The pay is solid, stock options were taken away for a base pay increase, which is a welcome raise but still not up to the rate at other warehouses in the area. The benefits however are very good( I never actually use them). There is sometimes a large amount of room for advancement, but other times it is quite difficult to find a position available...especially for the department that one is already in. Getting a promotion is mostly due to being able to interview well and spending time learning the computer aspects of departments rather that pure labor skill, not unlike most other jobs."
good,Amazon is a fast paced environment. With many requirements regarding tasks. Can be fun place sometimes and other days not so much. The pay is very good however they make you really work for every cent.
good,Maintain a good attendance. Keep your productivity level high but accurate. Try to learn new jobs within warehouse. Keep up with the safety tips that they teach you.
good,"A typical day at work was quick paced and competitive, I always knew what my job was and what my day would consist of. I learned how to work well as a team member with other people well. The hardest part of the job was standing in the same spot for 12 hours. The most enjoyable part was on lunch break when I could meet new people."
good,It was easy to find the application on the indeed website. I just looking for another job. Working as an Amazon associate  was fun a first it just going downhill i just hope with a new job. I can refresh and start over building myself and learning new things.
good,"Fast paced workplace, but an good environment to work in, as the people who work there want to work and want to get things done."
good,"All day mainly working"
good,"The company is very diverse. The work is fast-paced. The people are fun. The pay is good. Vision and dental insurance is provided, but health insurance is not provided. There is no paid time off nor vacation time."
good,I enjoyed my time at Amazon. I grew a lot within my profession. I was a photographer for Amazon. I was able to use those skills when I moved to CA. to with for Gap Inc. and Levi Strauss.
good,"Amazon stands for working hard having fun and making history. "
good,Job environment is decent but management no so much. I was constantly harassed even though I was one of best workers by one individual. The work really wasn't bad.
good,"Best part of working with amazon is the freedom to put forward our thoughts nad ideas, its amazing work culture, management and safety of the employes."
good,"You can grow with Amazon if you show initiative. Long 10 hour days 4 days a week on your feet is pretty brutal. Won’t give a raise for 3 years."
good,"Meet lots of people from different cultures, hard work but your day goes fast"
good,Large work load but manageable with sweat and effort. Mandatory breaks for a reprieve and to refresh the mind. Highest wage for entry level work requiring almost nothing to start
good,I worked a contract with them. It was a great job. The pay was decent and we learned and did really cool projects. The business intelligence engineer role is ambiguous but this role fit me perfectly for the team i was on.
good,"My summer job at Amazon's Warehouse in Etna was a well-earned experience. I was paid well for working in a fast-paced environment. There are warehouse limitations like not bringing cell phones into the work area or playing your own music, but the manager did try to compensate by playing music in the area. "
good,Amazon is great Company to work for! Amazon truly believes in its leadership principals and gives a lot of weight age to the leadership principals while interviewing candidates!

good,"Productive and fun working environment."
good,"Fast Paced work atmosphere, 10 plus working daily, 4 days a week work, training will be provided for all the departments, a competitive salary for the job you do."
good,It was a fantastic job but wasn’t for me I didn’t get to work with other or really talk to anyone.and with rate going up a lot of people were losing there jobs
good,"Very chill environment, very fast paced but nothing too complicated just hard work. Expect a good workout pretty much your entire shift. The work is easy to grasp once you have the hang of it."
good,"A typical day at work for me is fun, friendly and very busy there are some things about the shift that I work that could use some attention especially the management but hey what job doesn't have it's short comings. Overall, I wouldn't change this job I don't think for anything else most of the time the people that I work with are fun, I've also had the chance to learn some new skills which would help my resume and like any place else hard work can be rewarded in the end."
good,"Empresa sólida, com bom ambiente de trabalho e com possibilidades de promoções."

good,"Working at Amazon was a great experience, very fast paced position. If you're looking to find something that you can make your own schedule, I believe that this would be great."
good,"Every day at Amazon was a new challenge and learning opportunity. I got to experience vendor, resource and people management along with daily operations. Your leaders are cooperative and will keep pushing you forward to learn and grow. Culture was always safe and full of learnings. One can learn from downline as well as senior leadership. Everyone is given equal opportunity to express and improvise processes. Every challenge was hard and critical but we wnjoyed resolving the issues. Major issued faced were vendor and manpower challenges, which were resolved by discussions and operations understanding."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Amazon and wanted to move to full time. The issue was being scheduled for 4 hours working PT and the shift only working 3 hours. Hoping to get at least 24 hrs a week and ending up with 18 hrs, I couldn’t deal with. "
good,"Customer service, shipping totes, and conveyer boxing and moving inventory to trucks for delivery. A typical day consists of 10 hours graveyard shift. Meeting deadlines, placing toes in various departments, and induct."
good,"You're constantly moving. The job can range from building pallets, doing customers  returns, trouble shooting.  Validating labels of packages for accurate shipping."
good,"Amazon was a great seasonal job.  The shifts(seasonal) were only 4 hours, and face paced.  The environment was up beat and your role varied so it was never boring."
good,Working at Amazon as a Customer Service Representative is a stressful endeavor that will require patience but they have flexible hours but are very strict on maintaining on task.

good,This place is nice for people who are in between jobs because they hire everybody and give you every opportunity to succeed. There is plenty of time off allowed.
good,Was always aknowlede good for the hard work and effort I showed at Amazon just wasn't given a chance to earn full time position and needed to make more hours to provide for my family full time had great benefits and was a awesome work environment
good,"Very competitive work environment,  they expect your best at all times and there is the opportunity to receive incentives for achieving  or surpassing work goals. Teamwork and safety are the top things promoted at Amazon."
good,"Operate carts, dollies, hand trucks and other moving equipment to move large quantities of merchandise. Manage the receiving of truck deliveries and packages"

Ever shift we were assigned a Line Letter such as (A)lpha, (B)ravo, (C)harlie, etc. end of the shift every re turned the scanner and charged their batteries."
good,I loved my job. I went in different areas and met new people. I enjoyed my music and snacks along the way. The only thing I didn't like was when you left packages the customer could say they never received and it was a mark on you. Even though you took a picture of where merchandise was left.
good,"Amazon is a huge company with a variety of different organizations with their own styles, pros and cons. However its Leadership Principles are the core DNA at the heart of Amazon and permeate everything it does. Amazon's culture encourages strong ownership among all its employees and a drive to better just about anything, particularly when backed by data."
good,a typical day of work at Amazon would be long and tiring. but he pay is worth it management was good the each department had their own area manager. but the hardest part about the job for me was the hours and rates that you have to meet. Being a college student and going to work graveyard shift is not the best thing to do.
good,"Travail d'équipe et bonne ambiance."
good,"Good place to work, Don't get involved in others drama. just work, get paid, go home. People over stress when it's not a stressful job. With the 4 days on and 3 days off is amazing."

good,"If you’re hard working and like working to targets this is a great place. I loved every minute, all staff were friendly and helpful. There were plenty of opportunities for development which I acted upon. The only downfall was this being a temporary position. I was working nights and was required to move to days which I couldn’t do due to personal commitments. So had to leave. "
good,If your looking for a job with high production demands and plenty of walking then the picking department would be a perfect fit for your lifestyle! Wear comfortable shoes and clothes!

Working at Amazon has allowed me to use my organizational skills, my teamwork and collaboration skills, and my troubleshooting skills. The workplace culture is casual and open. The hardest part of the job is being able to be flexible and respond to changing requirements without missing a beat. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the various vendors, contractors, and employees that come through on any given day."
good,"Nice working place. Work is little monotonous. With careful planning, work can be made more interesting. Staffs are quite helpful. More training and career growth is expected."
good,"Amazon is a good place to start for anyone who is entering the workforce for the first time. They teach you a variety of skills to do your job that you can take with you to other employers.

good,The hardest part of working for Amazon is dealing with ambiguity. It is a positive challenge nonetheless as it forces you to get better at your craft.
good,"Team work comes in clutch. I have learned to work in large amounts of group go to work with an positive attitude, given daily task i make sure to finish my work load by the end of my shift. My work place is an friendly working environment , we all help one another. . Time management, working with groups of 3 or more can be tough, its always best to be at the same pace. The tough part of this job is when i end up doing scanning most of my time, as it can get really stressful and boring at times. The part i enjoy is working as an team because it gives me experience to know about one another."
good,a typical day is you are mostly on you're feet and going around scanning items. 10 minute breaks and 30 minute lunch. full time is about 10 hours per day.
good,"•	Trained and mentored 25+ new hires to excel in the process & build a good workplace environment."
good,they will let you move up as fast as you want when the position is available.  The managers are very friendly. You either spend a lot of time standing in one position or walking a lot.
good,"Amazon is a very good place to work.  You are allowed to work up to 30 hours a week if you can pick up more hours. The atmosphere is laid back. Some of the leadership could use more training. They don't discriminate. They pay a decent wage for the work that we do. You can advance but you have to go through different roles to get where you want to go. There are many different areas of the center where you can work which makes it interesting, not boring.  You can work with your friends side by side. They also have different activities at the beginning of the shift like name that tune, hoola hoop contests, best costume, trivia, etc.  They try to keep it interesting.  We don't get health insurance but we a little over $9 each pay period for health. 100% paid dental and vision."

good,"I worked at Amazon for 4 years and loved it! The schedule was very consistent, and there were lots of opportunities to earn overtime. Great career mobility as long as you are willing to put in the extra effort and work hard. Site leadership saw a lot of turnover & many inexperienced managers, but they were balanced out by the managers who were promoted from within the company. Love the company values and leadership principles. They still drive how I perform my work now that I'm with another company!"
good,"Working in a safe place, excellent working cultures"

good,"Before the day starts, everyone in my department is friendly and make conversations with other coworkers. When it's time to go into the mods we grab a scanner to use, pick carts and totes. Everyone's pick path is always different from everyone else. We have to reach a rate of 100% at the end of the day and shipping goal. I've learned that we are all here to help each other out to succeed in our jobs."
good,"At the time of working from home for Amazon, I was making $10 an hour which was not a livable wage. However, I am not sure if now that has changed with the minimum wage increase."
good,"great place to grow and learn, this really is a great comp. to work with and for. for the economy in this area the pay is now   note worthy.but the hight of all this is the education value, and the vast level of growth both through training and ed."
good,I love working at amazon it a good job just the managements and the hours i dont like. The way they run the building i just don’t understand. But it is a easy job.
good,When I worked there I really like it because I had a nice team even the manager would understand any situation and would work with you and your station.
good,"productive, compensation and benefit, time off, vacation, health insurance, exercise before work and breaks. Focus on work, great and helpful team mates."

good,"I love the culture of Amazon, work hard, work smart, hun fun and make history. Besides that, the leadership principles and hiring, performance review process taught me a lot during 5.5 yrs working with Amazon"
good,"Not every building is the same. Never the less it is fast pace, and stressful. You are upheld to a rate and must keep busy to achieve that rate. Ont 5 is a very laid back job and I love every bit of it."
good,My temporary assignment was good work experience and very competitive. It gives fair pay wages to survive off a weekly check. i learned how to use a skill taught and become faster by focus. The work culture was very diverse. Management was fair with understanding. The hardest part of the job continuous overtime. The most enjoyable part was my paycheck.
good,"made sure i was always early clock in get my shift started. I learned how to work with a scanner,  utilities and totes there wasn't really nothing hard working at amazon just got my work done. I really enjoyed working there because time went by fast and the environment everyone was so helpful."
good,"Worked in packing, order picking and stowing. It was a good experience. Good setting to work in. I learned how to package boxes, and order the drop in items to start packaging. I found this work setting a good way of earning experience and decent salary"
good,"its a very nice place to work,  you work hard and have fun. If you like  to stay busy at work then amazon is the best place to work. fast pace environment."
good,"Good job for part-time work. Laid back, casual dress code. Good benefits for only being part-time. Easy work for the pay. Quite a bit of chances for time off and extra time to pick up."
good,If you don't mind spending over 12hrs (with travel a day) for 4 days out of the house. good wages and benefits and if you don't mind moving around the warehouse.
good,beginning stretches then how much we have to do on our shift be a slav e for 12 hours amnd go home do ity for 5 to 7 days and u have a new car ebvery year
good,Long days with high pressure. A sink or swim environment but success is rewarded highly. Progression to move to other sites is encouraged on a monthly basis. But it has its challenges.
good,"Was my first warehouse job ever. Was super excited despite hearing mixed reviews .Loved the work even though it was repetitive. Lots of clubs and committees to be a part of. One thing i was surprised at is how serious they take quality. Its like almost illegal to make a mistake there, yet extremely easy to do so. They were always trying to change the process even if it was working just fine."
good,The hardest part of the job was just making sure you stay on track to finish before three. You also have to be ready to help other coworkers finish their routes as well.
good,"Amazon is a global company, quickly approaching 1 million employees, and looks to continue expanding. It's a place where you can strive and enjoy yourself if you look for an environment that encourages continuous improvement and innovation. The pay structure is top loaded in cash; first two years are base pay+sign on bonus, after first two years it's base pay+RSU (stock) vesting. Advancement can also be tricky, depending on the field you work in and if you're willing to move. As they say, if you want to move up you can; own your own career."
good,Great Company. I would advise any young leader to start at amazon the structure of the business will mold you into a great leader and enhance your skill set.
good,I enjoyed the busy nature of the job as well as the challenging times where you had to sort different areas and items. I learnt about the intensity of a warehouse job and how technical certain parts of the job can be
good,"Pros-"
good,"Every night I come to work, I feel great and ready to work. I learned a lot from experience people showing me around the place."
good,"This job has a very competitive learning curve. I reached this learning curve fast which is required. You learn most things on your own which makes or breaks you in an environment like this. Because most employees have also learned this way, it is a very type A, and competitive culture."
good,Great flexibility that allows you to select when you are available to work. Good concept of flex app with minor adjustments needed to app. to help in productivity and with navigation.
good,"I liked working there. There need to be more breaks for hours worked. I liked the location, some mgmt. Wished they knew about the wage increase before I decided to resigned."
good,"Pas le temps de s'ennuyer, le travail est constant mais intéressant."
good,"Amazon is a great place to work with the right manager. The manager turnover rate is extremely high because in the almost four years I've been there I've had 9 different managers. Lack of recognition is a huge issue with the company as a whole. They have programs in place to keep this from being an issue, but the managers ignore them and don't appreciate the work their associates put in during the shift."
good,"The pay raise to $15 per hour was very nice and it is refreshing to see a corporate company that hires with equal opportunity. Safety is talked about constantly and my building made changes for the safety of the employees working there. While it wasn't a perfect work experience, I do have to say it is a job I appreciate and are thankful for working at."
good,I could recommend this jib to anyone trying to get a nixe career started. The hours are great the coworkers are great. I stayed near so it was convenient for me.  But it's also on the busline.
good,My opinion is that Amazon is a very dedicated to getting the package to the customer to make everyone happy. Amazon Flex drivers are also usually friendly.
good,This was a great place to work. I learned a ton about working in a warehouse environment. The work was steady and never a dull moment. There was plenty of opportunities and good benefits.
good,keep people working one spot for 10-12 hours is heavy on the body should try to move people around get their blood flow going besides that I really working for the company while I was there
good,Very helpful management team and great work environment. Leadership is very supportive of ensuring work life is in harmony. The team wants to make sure you are happy with your time at work and at home.
good,I worked there for 1 or 2 months and it was a nice experience but the only thing is they don't offer full time and at that time I was looking for a full time job and that is why I left...but I am looking forward to work with them in the future
good,I learned a ton at Amazon. The culture is famously intense. The people who thrive in that culture are a joy to work with. This was the period of fastest behavioral and technical growth for me.
good,Fast paced work environment. Expected to meet expectations after 5 weeks on the job. Various positions available after being employed for 90 days. Room for advancement if you can handle the monotonous job.
good,Fun work place and a free workout. You have to walk long distances I. A short time. I was a picker and had to push a cart through aisles and sometimes use a step ladder. This was a very easy but very physical job.
good,ambiance agréable et sans pression.................
good,"good place to work at , also the hours aren't bad at all you can change them after 3 months. and in 6 months you get a up pay depending on where you work at in the warehouse"
good,"many wil tell you not to go work for a,Amazon but i say if your somewhat of an athlete or like exercise then amazon is definitely the place for you congrats!!"
good,"You must be able to think for yourself. There are managers and leads in place but most of the time, they have no further knowledge than the employee. Stressful around the holidays, especially when the customer was clearly wronged and you aren't allowed to fix something in time."
good,I love that Amazon is a fast paced work environment and is very flexible to my schedule. Also great perks and benefits to working for the company. Managers treat employees well!!
good,Me encantaría ser parte de ese equipo de trabajo ya que es tremenda oportunidad de crecimiento y a su vez muy buena Experiencia en el area laboral
good,"Good learning, lot's of opportunities to advance and move up and around within the company. Some politics, office drama involved. Bad management also."
good,The ability to deep dive processes in order to work on Continuous Improvement initiatives is the most challenging and rewarding part of the job. Great people working here as well.
good,"I enjoyed my time working at an Amazon FC but felt it was time for me to move on and focus more on my education. It was hard work without a doubt but well worth the pay and benefits. "
good,"Working at Amazon is fast-paced and physically demanding. The location I am at works four ten hour days, which can be a lot, but allows us to have three days of for our weekends. The pay is competitive, but still not enough for someone to comfortably live in my area by themselves. A second income is usually required. My experience with management has always been positive. There are promotion opportunities, but they can be difficult to get as everyone usually tries to apply. They do offer great benefits, which is the reason I took the job in the first place. Medical, Dental, Vision, 401k, vacation days, paid time off, bereavement leave, and discounts are all things that Amazon offers its employees."
good,"A good place to work, but a continuously fast paced work environment. There are a lot of dedicated staff who will train and provide us with valuable suggestions."

good,A fast pace exciting work environment. Very team oriented.  Various positions to do so never bored. Very active mentally and physically. good management style.
good,"As a picker in the Amazon warehouse you will be expected to meet a certain quota ever day. You will be expected to hustle during your 10 hour shift, and there is little room for error or leisure. The pay was above average and they offered a solid amount of benefits."
good,"Working for Amazon as a Receiver was a great experience as it required to be fast-paced, have a strong work ethic, and be up on your feet for the entire shift. I've learned the responsibility to stay on task which the management team does track your progress through the day. The workplace is a friendly environment with co-workers to have a conversation with: fun and enjoyable. As long as you stay focused and on task, you'll be alright. At the beginning in learning the system it might be overwhelming but with patience and consistency, you will get the hang of it. Give it time."
good,i liked workimg for amazon the work was fast and it kept me from falling to sleep. it actually taught me alot i moved around to alot of different parts of the factory the most enjoyable part about the job was working in the loading dock

good,amazon is fast paced ambitious company. think big and outside the box. they expect alot out of you but it will be rewarded when you make it o the next level in your employment. management is always striving for bigger and better. no two days are the same. everyday is something new. the company is constantly evolving and growing

good,"high paced environment."
good,"A typical day at work included engaging with associates to provide feedback, positive or constructive, in order to ensure cohesion and accountability with regard to standard work. Amazon works to create daily production related competition and give-away's to boost morale, and motivate continuous productivity and quality behavior, to ensure a positive customer experience."
good,"It was a good job and had opportunities to grow, but it was just a seasonal job. I worked almost two months during the holydays and then it was all over."
good,"Not a bad place to work friendly, good team work, nice place to meet new people and have nice exprenices they have team leads who are very supportive."
good,work with sort and scanner where that locations areas...doing to fill up that boxes to put that on the boats so will transfer to location and will put that on the pallet to scanner..
good,"fast pace, heavy lifting, heavy loads, special projects. items inside boxes shift and become unbalanced not good for safety. packers need to understand ."
good,"Management was questionable at times, some of the management team would hassle workers with demands that was near impossible to complete. The people you work with make the job the best."
good,it was very hard work a lot of lifting boxes and you had a certain amount of time to pick and pack so you had to rush and make sure you're hitting your targets
good,"Productive workplace , fast paced and team work . Everybody work together in a systematic order . Made good money but you definitely worked for it and made a living"

good,"The management team is great always willing to help"
good,pick up and deliver packages on time to the customers. its a good place to work with managements willing to help you pass through the daily tests and giving you great insights on where to proceed.
good,"This was honestly a fun and somewhat easy job. You either stood or sat all day taking calls from customers, who have an insane amount of accounts that you at times need to check everyone of them, to help on any issues with their account, devices or finding the right product from the site. Other than the unholy amount of time they allot for you to relieve yourself of waste or urine and the temperament of customers it's a fine gig to work at. Just have tough skin."
good,"Once you get there be preprared to work and drink plently of fluids."
good,Fun place to work at. However boxes are extremely heavy and there is a lot of lazy people that work this job so some have to pull a bigger load then o
good,"Not bad, good environment. Even though it gets packed to get packages loaded into the vehicle. the staff there is fast enough to get things going in a good time."
good,I am very interesting to do these company . I am hard working to these company . I like picking and packing and other work. I am trust to line leadership.
good,Its an okay job. Its easy to work there with no experience. If you don't make rate after A cretin amount of time of being there you are likely to be let go.
good,Great place to start a career. They really help and want the best for their employees. Enjoy the Management listening to their workers and helping on the floor is need be. Always clean and safe.
good,Very fast pace but very efficient work place. Get things done and always have more to do. Very professional and fun job. Every one is nice and got along
good,Amazon is a nice place to work. They offer VTO when their work is slow and they offer UPT an PTO every 3 month. It a great place to start if you wanna make $15+
good,"The days are very repetitive and you never know what location you’ll end up in. The station has only been running for about 3 months now, so they’re still making changes and new policies as they go. Youre allowed 2 incidents before you’re terminated. They also go off of a points system instead of requesting for days off."
good,"They offer alot of things cross training to other departments once you"
good,Good to work at amazon it was a good experience to work in warehouse with clean and safe environment. Team works can lead any company to the desire level that I have learnt through out my working period in amazon.
good,I choose not to answer.  I'll keep my opinions to myself.  In a nutshell great place to work if your a good hard worker........................................................................
good,If you're one that is there to actually work and get things done this is the place for you. When I started management was totally awesome until favoritism became into play it totally turned out bad. Other than that it was a good experience working there.
good,"I had a great time working at Amazon's manufacturing facility. I really wish I could have stayed there longer, but I missed the chance to do a shift change for full time. I'd like to get a better opinion of the workplace, because one month of work experience just isn't enough there."
good,"We hold a stand up meeting before we start to work. First get the order that I'm going to pull , go look for the order and pack it into the bag take it to the front,. slam order and give it to the driver start over again."
good,pero salario bajo y la contratacion es por agencia
good,Working for amazon was a great experience. I learned new things daily. There was a lot of room for advancement and their benefits were wonderful. I was able to move around and learn different process paths. I wasnt stuck doing the same thing every day.
good,"Amazon is a fast paced environment, The ideal candidate is focused on the customer experience, quality, safety, and productivity.Fulfillment associates are expected to understand aspects of production; adhere to strict safety, quality, and production standards. Dependent on business need, position may require for associate to be willing and able to work on powered equipment (i.e forklift or cherry picker)."
good,Dress up days making it fun for stuff lots of activities people are fun very helpful and assisting coaches motivate you to do better on  a daily basis.
good,"I truly do enjoy my time at Amazon, I have been working for the company in the fulfillment center for the past 4 mo. In the time that I have been there management has given the opportunity to learn more and improve on any skills in which I needed to advance."
good,Great company  fast paced with daily goals .      Would recommend this as a job for younger male or females due to the fast pace and nature of the work
good,"bonne ambiance, esprit d'équipe, accès au parking difficile"
good,This job was very stressful because we were constantly being pushed to move faster & faster but overall loved the job & would work there again. I’ve never worked at a warehouse but would again.
good,travail agréable mais la cadence de travail est forte
good,"Full training giving for the job that you are about to start. "
good,was very friendly and disciplined environment to work with. they provide you with necessary equipment needed. only thing that while packing you had to remain always quiet not really have conversation with anyone.
good,"Fast paced, always moving, meeting new people and having fun. i enjoyed working there because it kept me fit and also there were different jobs to do and not just one thing which made it interesting"
good,My work with Amazon company was perfect and i like my work with then
good,"though the rates where demanding, I really enjoyed the work environment, the people, and the management team. They were challenging but fair, Most of all they were encouraging."
good,It’s a great job  to work they pay well they somewhat help  you out   They look out for the people that they want to look out for.  One error puts you at 10
good,"Mail Sort Facility . My experience was good.  Break room updated with games and fresh choice food / snack options kiosk self serve stations. Each shift has a "" stand up"" meeting to share instructions, directives,  goals , safety tips, and does stretching exercises together. Each job has a measure / qouta of productivity. 220 packages per hour for stowers is expected zero mistakes.  In my opinion the course are unrealistic. A team member was promoted to next level ambassador job and stated her rate was 150 packages. It's unclear to me how the qouta \ six sigma methodology is calculated?   Culture is unique...Work Hard , Make History, Have Backbone.  The Seattle corporate office allows dogs to accompany owners to work."
good,I enjoyed my time with Amazon for the most part. I enjoyed the people and there were good working conditions. I picked and packed and drove an order picker and worked in hazardous material as well as non hazardous
good,"Typical day you stretch and make sure your body is ready to work overnight or day, then make sure you go over how many packages you're putting away, then have two breaks throughout the day and one lunch. Average day is about 40k boxes, lowest i seen is about 16k or 24k boxes."
good,It has been a fun competitive environment but due to so many people working there now has caused a lack of shifts to be available causing to quit this job and look for better opportunities.
good,"A typical day usual consist of picking, sorting, and packing to insure that customers receive their order on time.Working at Amazon is very fast pace and challenging."
good,"Great place to work, you meet new people, learn to work in different areas. Management team were on top of things, some were not so friendly though. "
good,I often left work sweating. Scanners have hourly quotas to meet. Everyone else has to keep up with the volume of packages constantly coming down the conveyor belts.
good,Amazon has everything. It has a strong culture and identity and will challenge you enormously. It provides enormous opportunity for personal development and does not suffer the normal problems of large organisations.
good,Work place is fun however work is repetitive and feels boring. Mostly you need to work in night shifts. Sometimes you need to do post shift OT goa an hour or sometimes 6th day OT. These OT's can be compulsory or voluntary.
good,"It’s a great job if you like a good workout. There are plenty of things that you can do being an FC associate I. As long as you work hard, it’s easy to become perm."
good,Amazon have high expectation and expect 100% commitment at all times. I was there for there busiest period over Christmas and the lead up to it. They drive you hard and expect results.
good,Amazon is a competitive faced paced environment. I learned a great deal of lean principles at my time there. I would recommend Amazon to people looking to jump-start their career.
good,"Wrapping, Standing Long periods, lifting, placement, incoming, outgoing packages and parcels, scanning, biracial workplace, welcomes male and female staff."
good,Fast paced work. Hardest thing was to contact management when off site. Loved dealing with packages. Enjoyed working here. not to kind to problems that arise.
good,"Pros: Input is desired. Continuous change for the sake of improvement is constant, and mandatory. Great ideas, and the support to implement them, come from every level. You are rarely if ever denied the tools, training, or support to improve the experience for a customer. You can start anywhere and your skills are noticed if you are dedicated, tenacious, and persistent. Talent is recognized. Hard work, and smart work, is rewarded. Working amidst great minds is the constant. "
good,I have learned a lot of  new things at Amazon which has made me grow and be in a better position in my work experience.  I have a great team and team lead that helps and is always there in a pinch even when it is her day off
good,"fast paced job with good pay, training is quick and easy, all the managers help when you are unsure what to do. coworkers are friendly and easy going."
good,"Awesome place to learn and have fun to keep yourself balanced at work and home."
good,The demand for work is high.  We are graded on our monthly productivity and if it's below 100% we can be written up.  I work from home and as long as you make your productivity you get left alone.
good,"Pros:"
good,"The work is based on meeting targets - everyone needs to make sure to put their best efforts to satisfy customers demand. I learnt the importance of everyone's input and the proper management of the resources. Although there are harder times, physically, closer to Christmas period, the job can give the satisfaction of working in team as well as an individual. There are also many perks connected to the job which makes the time spent more rewarding."
good,"12 hours shifts, delivery driver,multi drop, management used to be bad,do not care but now  there are new people much better,at least they do listen to"
good,"I enjoyed working at Amazon just wished they had more hours to offer, hard to be able to sign up for hours and the offer hours in increments of 30 minutes."
good,"If only I can stay working remotely and do not have to relocate in Seattle, Amazon is my dream company to work for. The best company I ever worked for in my career."
good,overall this job was good. I wish that I didn't have to move but I had to move forward. but I would recommend this job to anyone that has interest to work.
good,"The hours are long, but it's a shorter work week which was nice. The stock options and monthly bonus more than made up for any hardships I ever encountered."
good,You will see this slogan all over the building and it is very true. As long as you do you work like your supposed to you will never have a problem. Slacking off is not an option.
good,"I worked as seasonal operator during Christmas period. Good management, nice people. Im working again for this company as KYC Specialist. Is a company where you can grow"
good,Good job that always has something to do and keeps you busy. I would recommend it to someone who likes to stay busy and be productive. Not very tough work but never really run out of work either
good,Mon avis est plutôt bon malgré des règles strict le travaille n’est pas le plus compliqué à faire avec toujour une bonne ambiance générale pour ma part j’ai travaillé de nuit le rythme est correct mais il ne faut pas se laisser aller car les manager savent tout se que vous faire
good,Amazon is very wonderful place to learn more about principles and vales and work environment makes you feel like home. Its good for fresher who want to feel like college
good,Very competitive and athletic.  Would recommend being in shape before working here. It was fun for me because of the team's competing against one another for the same prize. Or trying to beat you high score every hour.
good,"If the job was closer to my house, I would've gladly stayed."
good,Good company to work for with lots of personal growth potential. Company encourages creative thinking and I've had to think outside the box to resolve most of the day to day situations I encounter.
good,possibilité d'évolution au sein du site. Et toujours opporitunité de faire des heures sup
good,"Am happy work in amazon staff is really very kind and helpful."
good,"At Amazon we have a day filll with hard working, Fun time to enjoy."
good,"fast-paced, depends on what area of the warehouse you work in. unloading can be hard depending on your shift. Managers are friendly for the most part."
good,"Sorting was easy during peak. A lot of different people working in that building. Not much more to say. Managers were cool, employees were fun to be around."
good,I honestly had a good time working there. Met many hard working people but had to relocate due to education. What I really liked about the job was that it was perfect for college students and if you live locally. Really flexible times.
good,"working at amazon was sometimes stress, but it wasn't that bad. coworkers. were very welcoming. although no matter how hard you work. sometimes your hard work will go noticed, by mangement."
good,"It was a good experience working for this company. Engaging and knowledgeable managers and a clean, safe place to work for employees. Very Flexible schedules and managers willing to help."
good,I’ve worked at amazon for a year now. They have guidelines that’ll like drivers to meet everyday. You can move at your own pace with no over your shoulder all day.
good,"I was very happy to work with Amazon, one of the largest employers I have ever worked with.  The duties involved as an Associate very challenging with good environment.  All staff work cheerfully and happy all the time.  Although, I used to work only night duty but I gathered same fun working environment with the day duty job."
good,"I enjoyed working for Amazon but the schedule couldn't worked for me "
good,"this place is really good to work "
good,"The only downside is they can be unrealistic to hourly quota's. They want you to work at such a pace that can cause mistakes. You can also be wrote up continually if you don't make rate and could lose your job within 3 weeks. It's no wonder they have so much damaged product on the floor. Employees are trying to make rate and not putting the product back in the bins properly and they end up falling out and robots run over them. I think one day they showed us $80,000 in damaged product in yellow bins they had to go through. Otherwise it was a good job. Oh, music needs to be worked on. It should be all day and when played mix it up. We heard songs over and over again that drove us crazy."
good,"Amazon is a fast paced, place to work. Depending on department you will work, you will be on your feet 9-12 hours a day. Fun environment, with PTO, OT, VTO all available."
good,"general packer in warehouse "

good,"average days throughout the week were not bad, decent pay, good benefits. ability to get overtime during peak and nice accrual of PTO/Vacation time. great atmosphere"
good,It was a great working environment. The managers were nice and work hard to ensure their employees learn how to do their jobs productively. The hours and pay were great.
good,"Long days when you have to work, but the people around you make the time go by faster. They try to make a stressful day seems easy by playing music doing the work hours to keep and motivateyou"
good,"The work requires you lift up to 25 lbs Really its like 50-70lbs. "
good,I pretty much learned the ins and outs of things. I tour the whole place . Its very spacious. A typical day at work was basically answering the phones assisting customers with their orders and interacting with other employees while I'm at work. Management was great they were thorough in their training and I learned quickly. It was a great experience.
good,"- Learned how to manage big volume of packages in a very short time."
good,Amazon is a great place to work if you want to sell your life away. Although having 3 days off it wasn't the kind of place to work overnight because everything was closed if you want to do something when you get off at 6 in the morning.
good,"Ottime persone con cui lavorare. Educazione e rispetto, sicurezza prima di tutto."
good,"There are great benefits at Amazon. Their pay is good. The hours can get long, but there are many different areas to work in. There is also opportunity for advancement."
good,I enjoyed my time at Amazon. My co worker and managers were good to get a long with.  My only complaint was because of my position I was cut off from the workers on the floor.
good,I liked the active moving around and the fast paced work environment. I also liked that I got to multitask and meet new people everyday. Amazon is not the best company but if you need a job they will hire you.
good,Very good job to have first job that i love i would love to work here as long as i can i would love to tell people about working for this company great peole
good,i felt like i was targeted by management for speaking my mind at an all team meeting and was fired for something that was not life treating to me or others.
good,"Great company atmosphere -Fantastic coworkers -The work is so enjoyable -The clientele -Wonderful communication and transparency -Benefits "
good,I enjoyed working at Amazon even though it is very fast paced. I would work there again! They make sure you stretch so you don’t hurt yourself during work.  They answer any question you may have Or if you’re having trouble with something.
good,"Great place to work for someone young needing a decent job. The benefits program is the best I've had. Unfortunately, changing shifts and career growth is near impossible."
good,"très bon environnement de travaille"
good,Amazon is a highly productive and performance based job. Be prepared to work and be open to new things like being trained in certain departments or roles within your own department.
good,"Overall workplace was fun, but very demanding. One good benefit was no one looking over your shoulder while you worked. Most of the employees were friendly and courteous."
good,a day working at amazon is very fast paced. but its an okay job. if your driving for them its mostly the traffic that gets to you. other than that if i can i will go back

good,Amazon was alright to work at. I wouldn't say it s the best place to work at. some days were more stressful than others. I made a few friends there which made my work days go by faster and easier.
good,Its an awesome place to work..management is great...get to meet new people on a daily basis...get to do different activities to complete the days goal
good,"the job itself is generally quiet interesting and easy to understand within a short period of time and the pay is great. the only fault with the company is some poor communication issues, especially evolving to peak and ive had a few days with lack of work. however, overall, generally very good."
good,Decent position but pay wasn't great while I worked there about three years ago. I would have continued to work there had the pay been more and had the commute been more reasonable.
good,It's a fast paced workplace but it has so many benefits that make it a good opportunity for people to have a secure job. And also there is a chance to raise your salary after 6 months.
good,"In this work space, either you got the job done. Or it will be done by others. The company has great benefits health wise, and holds a conpetitive environment. Overall the cleanest of work spaces i have been in for labor work (warehouse wise)"
good,Like any job the work has to be done but alongside that there was a level of good fun and joviality. I also found the full time workers friendly and helpful.
good,"Over all fast paced, 100% level is hard to achieve and keep once you make the mark. If you don't achieve the mark, you will be terminated after 3-4 weeks"
good,"I enjoyed my co-workers at Amazon.  The Christmas holiday was a super busy season but other than that, it was busy.  They work 24/7 including all holidays."
good,Amazon was a well paying job that I enjoyed. But I had to travel so I had to leave the job but the work conditions was good. I learned  lot of dispatch skills that they trained me on.
good,I am currently on work comp and due to quota because managers will tell you different things one will tell u 2 worry about quality another about quota
good,it's good . the work environment is good.  the management is good too. the work culture is how you want it to be. it's refreshing and different from other it sectors. the work load us also not so heavy.
good,good organization at work and good comunication with costumers
good,i love working there i wish i can go back i want to go back so bad..  they dont have one in alabama. I love   the people and i love my boss and  they accept as we are deaf
good,"Great company to work for!!, very knowledgeable, collected and selfless. A positive work environment where people feel valued and appreciated, Amazing culture, great benefits, great pay, good opportunity to learn Salesforce and awesome people and management."
good,Amazon is a great company that has many opportunities for employees once the season is over. The managers there worked hard to insure that the consumer gets their package on time.
good,"I enjoyed working at Amazon, dress code was flexible which I appreciated,the mamagers are friendly and understanding. I liked working the night  shift and the mood was a conducive one in which to work in especially during the night time. I appreciated the free transport we were given to go back home late at night ."
good,"Entreprise exigeante, microcosme impressionnant!"
good,"Amazon was a great place to work at from the management all the way to the custodial crews. Nothing ever negative about working at this place, I enjoyed every hour working there."
good,"A typical day at Amazon includes receiving inventory, consulting and teaching customers about our Amazon products. Merchandising and Marketing methods are changed every week based on promotions.  Everyone is responsible for checking their emails in order to stay in the loop of all the updates. If things get a little slow, play with devices and create something cool with the routines feature so when customers come in, you can demonstrate."
good,"Las horas de trabajo son buenas.  Pero el trabajo es pesado, la meta de realizar 540 envios por horas.  Aunque el ambiente de seguridad en el empleo es bueno."
good,"This company provide some benefit like 401 K , paid time off, and career choice that are very good."
good,Fun place to work at when you need a quick job. You can meet great people. Vto is the great thing they have to offer at amazon pto is another thing that is good.
good,"I have been working for Amazon as a picker for a 1.5 years. I started as a temp hire in PA and eventually advanced into an Amazon employee. I recently transferred to Florida at a brand new facility. I am an ambassador, and can be utilized in most of the facility. I am a hard worker who is always wanting to learn new things. Management is great and has been at all locations I have worked at. Hardest part of my job would be the amount of times I have been denied the Managers PA position."
good,"Business driven working environment, very competitive."
good,"The managers want you to do your best and some are friendly. Its a competitive environment which is fun in my P.O.V., they offer rewards for hard working people and I always got second place. I would recommend working there, especially during seasonal."
good,Amazon is a fast paced workplace. I am always busy so that makes the day go by quicker which is great beacause who doesn’t like a quick work day. The shifts are great with my daily schedule.
good,Amazon took very well care of their employees. I enjoyed the brief time i worked for amazon. they would occasionally provide meals to employees. Would recommend my friends to work there.
good,"I would say the shifts they have there are very flexible. So if your looking for a good part/time job or even a full time job, Amazon is the right place for you."
good,I believe this position would be great for experienced and inexperienced interns alike. I was surprised with the amount of responsibility they gave me.
good,"I would keep myself busy. I was working with a company on building their new warehouse in Salem, OR. My duties were to operate lifts and other heavy equipment to build racks."
good,"At Lakeland, FL location, packages can weigh up to 50 lbs.  Lifting, pulling and pushing packages for 10 hours per day gets physically painful.  Not all locations have packages that weigh this much and some locations have packages that weigh more and require using fork lifts.  Before committing to employment, be sure you know what type of merchandise is at the facility and that you can handle it.  During the 10-hour shift, you stand.  Get shoes that have good cushioning and are at least a size larger than you normally wear.  Your feet will swell into them as the day goes on.  Many changes are going on and communication with non-management staff is slow.  Often we hear of changes on the news rather than from management."
good,"I learned how the shipping process works, and how inventory was kept track of. The management was great in the departments that I worked for. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people."
good,"Great company to work for with good stock options. Great medical, dental and, vision coverage. Get assign special projects to help elevate your advancement in the company. Stocks growing fast"
good,"amazon was good to work for but long hours and unreliable contract."
good,"It's easy, fun and more experience I have learned working at Amazon. The supervisor and staff are very nice and they always helps you whenever you have any questions about work. They inspired you to work because of there positive attitudes towards to all the employers."
good,"Good place for everyone with good intent."
good,"The journey at Amazon teaches you a lot. From the front level agent to the Program Manager, my journey in the company taught me of many lessons and get my dream position and still it throws the challenges everyday"
good,"If you want to work, come there. It is fast paced, yet fun. You will find plenty of people to ask questions if you have any, and you will always have something to do. Indirect roles are a must to learn and work your way towards if you don't want to be stuck doing the same thing everyday, and so is cross-training into other departments. Some of my favorite days were working in other areas."
good,"easy, fast paced environment, great pay, would love to go back, would definitely recommend.  I was a warehouse worker for a couple of months, I really don't have much more to say than what I have said."
good,job opportunities as far as advancement come depending on friendship with higher ups . also when it comes to managements in my experience favoritism has a lot to do on how your work experience will be
good,I found this position to be physically demanding I'm very demanding all my time but they also financially compensated very well including better than most similar positions at other places in town.
good,Keep all my workers on task .  Paper work in the office as well  handling organization or work being passed Recomending out new ways to do work  better an faster
good,"Souvenir agréable même si la cadence et la rigueur sont aux rendez-vous."
good,"Picker/Stowing Picking items at fast and efficient pace without making errors. Rewards for picking at a fast, efficient pace without making errors. Time at work goes by fast."
good,Amazon has a very laid back environment and a very learn as you go way of working environment. The Management is very cool and laid back. Just do your assigned job and everything should go well for you.
good,They have paid time off. A very fast paced work environment.  A very up beat and competitive work zone. They also have a very relaxed dress code that makes it easier to work.
good,i enjoyed working for this company i wish they had more full time positions. If they did i would come back to Amazon. The best thing about this company is you got paid every week.
good,"Awesome place to work"
good,Amazon has a very fast pace work environment. Very well organised and there is a standard for every kind of work.  There are some managers who have there own perspective to promote people.
good,"Good working place, very comfortable, teachable, skills of hardworking ethics, very relaxed work place. Treat employees very appropriate.............."
good,"The management usually is respectful. Often encouraged to work independently, help peers, and achieve higher productivity."
good,"At Amazon, you have to keep up with picking. If you fell behind at picking, you have to be retrained and you will be given a write up. If you are given more than three write ups, your job at Amazon will be terminated."
good,I love this job and the hours are always there and always a chance to do overtime. Managers are great leaders and the warehouse main priority is the safety of its people.
good,"You can move up in Amazon, if you are willing to relocate. When you do move up to L4 and above, that is when a person can start making good money. But you have to move, in order to move up."
good,"bonne expérience, sa répondait a mes attentes certes certaines jours c’était dure car c'est du travail d'usine mais l'environnement et le mode de travail était tout a fait adapter."
good,"I have been at Amazon for 4 years, they have provided me opportunities that i never thought possible, i have worked in different departments under several different managers, which is a good thing and a bad thing sometimes"
good,"I would set my station up with empty boxes, bubble wrap and dry ice for packages."
good,Nice work place. Need longer breaks and more overtime opportunities. They make sure you stay cool and hydrated and there is a medical staff there. I would suggest working two back to back four hour shifts.
good,I really enjoyed my time at Amazon. Learned a lot and meet a lot of great people along the way. Great company to work for and have a lot of growing facilities and perks.
good,"As you would expect for a big company as Amazon, and starting from a position as a Fullfilment Associate, an important amount of physical effort will be expected from you."
good,"It is a very flexible job, it’s part time and you get to make your own schedule within the posted schedule. Just make sure you checking for the posting because it goes away quick"
good,"Average Pay"
good,"Start of the day with stretching, asigned workstation prep your area by  stacking totes and making sure you have all your tools to begin your work to begin sorting  and unload packages on the line that you’re assigned to.Productive and fun environment and great employees to work with as a team .  You’re  trained the proper way to lift packages without injuring your back or knees also  The proper way to open packages away from your body etc.The management team concerned about your well-being and work safety. The hardest part of the job is standing for 10 hours. The culture of Amazon is work smarter not harder stretch before during and after your breaks and to make sure you stay hydrated water water water ."
good,"Management could've improved a bit, but overall this was a fun place to work. Over time it just kind of seemed like they would hire anyone, and have no standards. We would get very ""gray"" people who just move around like zombies in an environment that should be fast paced- and who wouldn't want to move around a lot in a refrigerator?"
good,"Amazon from my point of view is a very beautiful complex, good, and reliable people,"
good,"hard, but good for some. on your feet all day, no time to sit. long days, long pace, great benefits, good healthcare plans. discount doesn't even cover the cost of prime."
good,I enjoy working at Amazon because the management is very understanding and the schedule is very flexible. It is a job you can easily work around school or another job.
good,"I worked for many great managers and have been promoted consistently and often. However, it only takes one poor manager to make work unbearable. Overall, great culture and work benefits. Safety is paramount."
good,Its a good place for first job. You working only 4 days per week and have more free time this way. Amazon has always work and when you convert to permanent employee you have even more job security. But the HR department is low and have low opportunities for a better job position. Unless you have friends in high places.
good,"Amazon has fostered the reputation of having high employee burnout."
good,"Typical warehouse functions, operation of the warehouse split between workers and machines. Management made work atmosphere easier and cleaner than other warehouse jobs."
good,"It is extremely fast paced work with little to no breaks until lunch and the payed 30 min break. Non-stop repetitive, but can be rewarding once you've reached level 3 and above. No sitting, 10 hours of standing and walking. Extremely high expectations. Can be rewarding for those who are focused and hard working."
good,"It was a good environment with nice staff. The job functions where easy for anyone to learn.   i would work there again, but need full time hours. They need a few more ways to process overflow."
good,It a place I would return to work. I had family issues that caused me to leave.  And I'm hopeful I can return soon. I like the people I worked with.  The job is close to my home.
good,"Amazon development centre India was a great place to work with, has learnt lot many things both personally and professionally get to become a lead and handle team as well."
good,Amazon is a good place to begin a carrier especially for freshers. Starting from training to operations every day you'll experience new things  in Amazon.
good,"typical day scanning packages mostly but if your skilled enough you could move to different parts of the building, like auto sorting which is the same as kinda the same as regular scanning but at a much faster pace. management is evil some manager are absolutely amazing while others just want to see you fail, watch your back."
good,"Amazon is a great company as far as their benefits, advancement and career options but their lack of acceptable management takes away from the company and makes working conditions unfavorable, stressful and creates an unwanted tension across the workforce."
good,"Nice place to work but the company is publicly becoming more and more anti-Christian, probably because most tech companies--and their high-tech workers--are that way.  This is frustrating when you are a warehouse worker because nobody cares about your opinions.  It keeps filing amicus briefs in favor of positions which hurt the practice of the Christian religion."
good,"management is fine, having to due a triler is time consuming but its alright, I learned so many things it helps me further into the job position.hardest part is to deal with everything"
good,"The warehouse was fun and very Busy at times, The management was great and the training was very efferent. The associates was good, The pay was good and the Merchandise picked was good"
good,"Great part time job to work at because shifts are short and job provides dental and vision insurance. Also Amazon is very team-oriented and there are a lot of opportunities to meet new people. Work tasks may be labor-intensive and fast paced to most, but exceptional for people that enjoy moving constantly."
good,i would like to work here. but this job is part time job. i am looking for full time job and that's the reason i want to switch the job. benefit wise it is good.
good,Amazon tried to ensure they were meeting the employee needs to keep turnover at a minimum.  Doing your job the right way would take a little longer.  Some employees would take short cuts giving them better numbers at the cost of another employee having to deal with the issue they caused and a lower production number.
good,Amazon Flex is an amazing gig if you can keep up on the maintenance for your vehicle. You can work when you want and know exactly how much money you're getting.
good,It was a great place to work and learn how to solve problems. Great chance to be among talents in which everyone is very supportive. Collaboration was less than I expected.
good,"It has a lot of favorit ism and "
good,"typical day at work is like day one alwayz."
good,"Regardless your color, race, age, disability, and etc., Amazon is the best discrimination-free employer in the world and they provide the gold opportunities if you are smart (not on papers), working hard, and passion for the customers. Most of the privates and publics employers they fail to comply with the law even you have qualified for the job. Amazon warehouse job may not fit the most of people, however, the flexible working schedule with other benefits are perfect, but you have to perform the constant repetitive motion in 10-hour working shift a day and 60 hours (max) a week and make sure you have strong strength. The process of hiring is simple and straightforward. After one 2 three weeks, you should receive an email to start your first day and first 2 weeks of training if you pass all basic job application requirements. Management and site leaders are professional and knowledge and they always help you to solve the problems."
good,For workers that come off a leave get penalized for attendance and puts job at risk. But the job itself was fast pace. Training opportunities are available
good,very great place to work.... great pay. lots to do on your feet so if u dont really like being on your feet Amazon isnt the right place for you sorry to say..!
good,Very good environment. Good management and organized. working hours are flexible and there are overtime hours available as well. Paid time off and benefits
good,"The hardest part of the job was trying to reach rate, and to not make any quality errors."
good,If you’re a hardworking and competitive individual this place is for you! Amazing benefits starting on DAY ONE! Always room for advancement as long as you keep rate in the beginning!
good,"Its a good place to work, just be ready to do hard labor. Other than that, an overall great place to work. Stay away from drama and trouble and just work and youre fine"
good,"The company is well run with very tight security for the work floors due to the services and products they provide. This can be a bit unpleasant due to the limitations of what you can bring to your work space or not."
good,"It was fun and interesting working there, everyone very nice and very team oriented. Very fast paced and physical work. I liked the exercises before the start of the shift to help us warm up"
good,I have learned to drive a forklift while working here which is an accomplishment for me. They do provide training in various spots but it is limited to a few tasks
good,"Amazon is full of opportunity. It can be an exciting, dynamic place to work where you learn a lot every day. Many teams at Amazon are flexible and provide supportive work environments with ample opportunities for career development and growth"
good,"Productive and fun place to work, hard to maintain work life balance but lots of opportunity to grow if you believe in hard working, not a job place for lazy people."
good,"Amazon is an analytical, kpi driven company. You always know where you stand. In order to be successful, you need to not only work hard within your role, but truly embrace the leadership principles."
good,"Work like a machine it’s really hard and there are some spot better  "
good,"Our work was very demanding during peak season and there were complex issues to be resolved. The people I worked with demonstrated much willingness to provide needed information and encouragement to one another in resolving problems and keeping our morale up. Our team leader even used little trivia games and such to cultivate a sense of team work and fun. There were times, though, when all were so busy with their own calls, reports, etc. that a question submitted to the chat room was hard to get answered as quickly as one might prefer with an impatient customer on the line. Mainly, the more each of us was familiar with policies, blurbs, research tools, etc. the better we could help customers and drivers. There was a lot to learn and apply in a short time, but training was mostly very thorough and useful. Sometimes there were technical glitches, but the help desk did a great job when we got through to them.  I appreciated the cooperative spirit of the folks I worked with."
good,"What I loved most about amazon was how quickly employee and employers had to move. There was always something to do. Amazon is such an huge organization you couldn't help but meet new people, from all walk of life. Which I enjoyed as well. Not only are you surround by great people but amazon offers some great incentives to working with them."
good,"I loved being able to work from home for Amazon.com, the biggest company in the whole wide world. I loved being able to spend more time with my son, the hourly pay, and the benefits."
good,"You're working 10 hour days, expect you to hit a rate as soon as you can. Days go by slow, but not too bad of a place to work at. Money is alright, you don't move up in the company unless you've been there for years and or a woman who likes to flirt with managers."
good,A typical day is mostly scanning packages on to pallets. Simple and to the point. Can get fast paced and overwhelming at times but overall not bad. Management is always clear on expectations. Hardest part of the job is very often being reassigned before quite settling in to current task.
good,organized place to work faced paced production line very team oriented. My original shift was 12 am to 6 am which was perfect due to my school schedule but the stopped offering that shift
good,"we walk around all day, fast pace, 2 15 minute breaks. The walking is the hardest part of the job, I go through allot of tennis shoes. The best thing I like my job is I get to meet new people"
good,A good company. Because the schedule helps a lot for a person who attend to school or have children. The benefits of the company are good. Also the company help the people who decide to continue study providing money help.
good,adquiri experiência recogiendo productos para que puedan ser enviados internacionalmente.
good,"Amazon is very productive I enjoyed being able to come in and do my job it was very relaxed and laid back as well, I also really like the fact that amazon helps with tution also that's a great thing I believe almost any company should do"
good,Overall amazon was a great place to work. They gave proper training and wanted you to move up in the company. I have to say it was one of the best places ive worked.
good,Is all about rates rates and rates. Work quick and don’t mind anything else. Fun people to work with. The pay is good and the chance to get promoted is there if you’re focus enough.
good,"This job could really be interesting if you are a motivated person to work in a high paced environment. A lot of benefits such as dental, optic, etc are available to employees."
good,"Very busy schedule throughout the day. The shift starts with simple warming up exercises followed with few announcements related to work safety and improvement. Employers head back to their assigned jobs and work continuously until break time."
good,Amazon garantisce un posto di lavoro alla base della sicurezza
good,"As a  candidate  the employer suggestions, have fun, enjoy your work and excel as much as you can do"
good,"Good to work, work life balance, great culture fit, most enjoyable projects,, good team management,  learning to new technology and new skills along the line."
good,"The give full space to enjoy the work also all type of facility that an employee need .very good environment to work."
good,"Come in 10 min early to put your personal items in your locker. Amazon provides you water bottles, lockers. Meetings before every shift, stretching. Very fast paced and competitive. You gotta meet rate. Warehouse is huge so it takes 5 min to get to break room or outside but thats why break time is 15 min. Your working 10 hour shifts for 4 days. Your able to choose your shift and days you want to work. To get hired on, just be on time and make rate. Best part, they give you unpaid hours to use for emergency and paid time off, voluntary time off. Manage your time wisely. Over all, I loved it. I managed to move up and learn different roles. I was able to do something different everyday. Pay is decent. During Peak season you'll work up to 6 days. You get bonuses and double pay! Worth it during holidays. Always drink water!"
good,"Die Arbeit ist gut. Vielseitig und immer interessant. Selbst in der Weihnachtszeit fand ich es nicht sonderlich anstrengend."
good,Great company to work in for both fresh graduates and experiences professionals......lots of learning professionally to add value to your experiences!
good,"Very good and laid back place to work. It was temporary for me but it’s not a bad job to start out at. Great benefits, has plenty of opportunities for overtime"
good,"Working at Amazon is bad at all. You end up meeting pretty cool people, everyone is friendly and helpful. Managment is the issue, in my opinion, it does not seem like anyone has any common sense when making decisions."
good,Easy job to do. Supervisors are easy to get along with. Friendly and diverse coworkers. Rates are easy to reach because they train you in your path that you are doing
good,"i worked overnights from 6PM until 5am you'd think you'd have at least have the day to sleep and wake up and do what you need, but i also lived an hour away and i have a one year old waiting. so sleep was something i looked to do when i came home. the job is very physical (because you are walkong and standing for long periods of time) but if you put your mind to the task, anyone can do it. i dont advise dating anyone you work with"
good,"Amazon warehouse environment is fast paced, physical, and competitive. Workplace is cultured by effort through perseverance of all associates and management to meet goals.  One mind one body one team.  Hard part is reminding yourself why you do what you do and where you want to go.  Safety is the utmost importance here.  Staying hydrated and stretching constantly are super important.  Values of Amazon principles are very real here.  Most enjoyable part of the job is meeting and greeting people especially those on your team.  The workplace also makes it easy to be anti social simply by doing your job and not socializing."
good,"Journée spécial "
good,The job was great. They really care about their employees. I wrapped pallets. I also was a splitter on the conveyor line. I was also a line lead. Management was very understandable and they made sure that you had everything you needed to do your job.
good,Everyday at Amazon is fast pace for the most part so everyone stays busy with the task at hand. Amazon is also a great environment to meet a lot of new people and understand cultures of others that work there. I enjoy working because it keeps me always moving and is a constant challenge everyday of the week.
good,"Is the same routine every day nothing changed, Management overall not that bad but not as good as they should be, We had fun in the past prime day ,,,,"
good,"good place to work, with OK benefits but cost of living not in tune with cost of living in Jacksonville, FL. If pay is low then there should be a chance to find part time job but no chance with schedules as they are now."
good,"I very much enjoyed my time at amazon. Unfortunately I had to relocate to an area with there isn't an Amazon fulfillment center nearby, which is why I'm not currently working there again. Highly suggested workplace!"
good,"Great place to work, wish I was still there blah blah blah fick off already I've said enough it's a great place to work if you have the balls to handle it"
good,"This is a very fast-paced work environment. They have good people to train new employees, as well as great people to work with. The only downside to working at Amazon is that they don't give you enough time to get your your body used to the pace to where you can keep your quota up."
good,if you want to work in a fast paced area and be moving heavy objects then I think this will be a right place for you.you have to be able to come in on time be able to move objects fro trailer to the right place.and etc....
good,A typical day is long due to the type of work. I've learned to work in a fast-paced environment under pressure as sure as stocking and stowing items in shelves.
good,Hard work nice pay would recommend. You work the early shifts in the morning and get off in the afternoon with a 30 minute break in between. Would say go for it
good,"Overall lack of heat during the Winter and no air during Summer"
good,"Amazon is a very high paced job, amazon offers really. Great benefits to their employee's. Also get a *30 minute break which. They offer pto, and other great career advancement opportunities."
good,Working in receiving inbound I scanned thousands of product and loaded them onto robotics to be counted for company inventory. I learned that scanning product and stocking it into the correct bins helping company productivity. Management walked by few times to check on your accuracy. The hardest part was meetimg the company numbers per hour for inventory and the most enjoyable part was that a lot of the staff was friendly.
good,"Management seem dysfunctional at times but overall productive, work, life balance was talked about a lot but turn over rate was to high.always hiring, job is fast pace little or no rest constantly on your"
good,"the job was okay, I had to leave it, though, because the long hours I used to work. I used to work about 10 hours a day and sometimes we had to work over time which is 12 hours."
good,"Learned a lot about warehouse work and how orders are processed."
good,"A typical day at work, where at times can be overwhelming, stressful and some fun at times.  sometimes you feel  over worked and underpaid for the heavy bulky work you do."
good,"The company was great. enjoyed the people, a lot of cross training and a lot of incentives to work hard and do a better job. did not like the inflexibility with parents."
good,"even you feel like hard in beginning , you can adjust later. everyone are helpful and supportive, nice place to work even though sometimes it gets busy"
good,"Walking around staying busy, make sure to tell about spills and messes. Most enjoyable picking. Hardest part about the job is sorting or loading. This is a fast paced job."
good,My experience was positive but wanted off night shift. A typical day involves walking all around the warehouse.  Whether inbound or outbound there is always lots of work and some overtime.
good,very fast paced. some days were harder than others. work environment was interesting. First call center job. Manager was great and everybody worked very hard.
good,Work at a fast pace to keep up. Supervisor seems not to have must interest in helping you make production. Breaks don't seems like break why? by the time u get from one end to the other you have used up most of your break.
good,"Well a typical work day would be is, we would all come prepared ready to work. Also we would clock in and then get our safety vests, and other safety things and get ready to started with the boxes. I learned that teamwork is the fast way to get things done. The management was pretty good. There was no hard part about the job. And get to win free things."
good,Some coworkers worked bad and some worked very good. Management was good to me and work with me to do the job right. It is a fun job to me because you can learn and grow
good,Working at amazon was cool I had nice hours and days off during the week. I learn how to move at a steady pace 10 hours a day I got use to it after 2 weeks. The hardest part of the job was probably staying up at night but eventually you get use to it.
good,"Enjoyed working for Amazon, job was only seasonal. Would like to work for them again under a more permanent basis."
good,Awesome place to work if you like a fast-paced environment. Staff and the Workers were great to work with. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the Competitive numbers that you had to get each day.
good,Management was very friendlt and helpful. Hardest part was being onyour feet for long hours and doing the same thing all day. The most enjoyable part of this job was meeting new people and great benefits.
good,Get to meet and work with people from many ethnicities. Team-work is very much encouraged and have opportunities come to move up but very little. Better future if one can stay longer.
good,"Started with loading shipment , checking inventory and logging travel miles to and from destination.  Traveling from location to location was the best as it was my time."
good,Great place to work for a beginner. A lot of stuff to learn. People around you are either hardworking or intelligent which helps us to learn a lot. I enjoyed working and will definitely recommend someone.
good,"It was a good experience for a first time warehouse job, learned a lot about working as team. Team work makes the dream  work, also learned how to quickly work in that type of environment everything was rated so your had to catch up."
good,"I starting working in warehouse, and money was good, I applied for logistics as a bilingual speaker and I got the job. Good money less stress but the position was only temporary (maternity cover) I would like in future to work again for Amazon. Selling everything from A to Z with a smile in your face(:"
good,"For me it was temporary however it wasGood for extra money and is fast pace , being late isn’t acceptable.Overall I wouldn’t mind working here for entry level or any."
good,Worked at Tenmarks. Great people with incredible knowledge about mathematics and education pedagogy. It was a shame they closed TenMarks down. The content was amazing.
good,"The benefit t exceptional, and the production incentives are outstanding. I just believe that I was not placed in the department that I would be most productive."
good,"My typical day at work was not asking for help when it came to lifting heavy boxes. I fractured my wrist really bad, and the manager was actually a big help when she saw how my wrist looked. Ive learned, to never be afraid to ask for help. The work place is very fast paced. But everyone there worked as a team. The hardest part of the job is lifting almost 90-100lb boxes. The most enjoyable part, was that, everyone had positive attitudes."
good,This job was extremely face paced and very competitive and I enjoyed working over night. It can be stressful just because you have to meet a quota daily and it can sometime be challenging
good,work place very laid back very fast paced must meet quota  i worked night shifts much better then day also the provided water and let you used the bathroom when needed
good,I work at DFW2 a new plant. The workplace was huge. Most everyone was friendly and helpful. I worked there for only a week. They were already asking me to apply for there equivalent of a supervisor if I hadn't be called away with a family emergency.
good,"My 4 years at Amazon has been a roller coaster journey with a great number of learning experiences and way too many fun filled events. When i joined in 2013, recruiting was still a growing team and we have managed to evolve our team and our hiring practices in all these years."
good,"I enjoyed Amazon as a place to work because it was a productive, happy environment. The employees are nice and happy usually because it has good benefits and they treat you like a real employee, which is sadly, hard to find. The work roles also provide a nice sense of responsibility because it feels like everybody is needed to get the job done."
good,"Amazon Fulfillment provides a relaxed fun environment. They dress code was relaxed. A typical day @ work involved using your training and skills to fill orders and return orders that were incorrect. The management crew was accessible, friendly and most of all Professional."
good,For the short amount of time I was with Amazon it was very fast paced. I worked the weekend off shift. the boxes keep coming and you keep moving. Made for the night to go by fast.
good,"The typical day at work is to arrive on time, clock in, warm up, and wait for the packages to be receive in order for us to properly scan and organize the packages. Overall, its a team orientated system that works well if you have  good relationship with your team members. Rewarding job if you are able to finish on time and great way to develop social skills."
good,"The work at Amazon is very easy, it is not hard. The only CON you have to be mindful of is the managers being authoritative and rude at times -- talking to you as if your a child. However, for the most part, Amazon is not a bad place to work at."
good,"Hardest part of the job was keeping up with number of packages. Everyone there was very friendly and supervisors were helpful with  "
good,"But they can do better with the human resources and other managements,need ore break time and be compassionate to your employees."
good,The job was fun and had plenty of opportunities to do things it just at the paste of it will slow and some of the people was in as productive as I would say they needed to be and the management wasn't as good
good,"It's a fast-paced job with a cool and relaxed environment. This helps counter the tedious work. If you are willing and do not mind the work, then it is a good job with good benefits."
good,AMAZON is a nice job it very easy and fast pace. It’s a very nice and friendly job. It’s basically grocery shopping for customers with one and two hour delivers. While doing your basic job of stocking the shelves. Removing item that expired did recalled.
good,Technology warehouse with decent pay for entry-level workers. Dependable management with opportunities for growth.  Hourly workers were given a lot of opportunities for over-time.
good,wszystko ok tylko poswiecic uwage na tym co robisz
good,Working for Amazon is fun but it is hard work. Upbeat and variety of people. Amazon tries to be fairly relaxed but it is fast paced and you have to keep up.
good,"heavy physical labor, good health and common sense necessary!!! this is not a fly through job! you need to work, be fast and know your limits. management trusts in you to do the right, safest thing possible."
good,"Great people, hard work,fun atmosphere, good managers, Amcare services, The job consists of meeting customers needs that are purchased online and are shipped out daily"
good,"you are learning something different everyday. I enjoyed working with my team members, while waiting on production which was the hardest part of the job"
good,"Mostly dedicated team members who work towards the good of the department.  Working at Amazon makes you more of a responsible individual because you are responsible for your own path,"
good,"Pros"
good,Great learning experience. Many great managers. Definitely a decent place to work. Would recommend to family and friends. Really grateful for the opportunity.
good,Management needs to work harder on being more organized and the right way to communicate with employees. I enjoy the space to improve & more up to different titles.
good,"on a typical day at amazon as a picker, you will nee plenty of energy and water to be able to keep up with the rates to ensure that the goal is met by the end of the night. its a fast pace job and is very cultural and diverse. the fun part about the job is that its fitting for a good workout."
good,"I liked,working at Amazon at first then I got hurt from an accident then I,was on disability for over a,year. I returned to work in January then was moved to a different department then I hurt my back. I,would go back if I,could."
good,The 10 shifts on the concrete floor kill your feet and the lifting will make you break a sweat but the pay is great and so are the benefits. Management kept upping the required package amounts but that's because the staff was low so your job is pretty safe.
good,"Amazon with benefits I said the best place to be given  they give associate a front consideration after the customer."
good,"this a Job where they think that you will be doing 170% all that time and they work you a lot, you must meet your rate every time or you will get fired after a few talks."
good,"simple tasks but if not completed asap it will become too much."
good,day at work start we hawe meeting after ewry body goin in them work places ewry day we learn somthig new we workin white all difrent coutry people all difrent culture the hardes part of this job is walkin the all time antil you shift finish but iam enjoy this job
good,"Great employees and work environment. Working overnight night shifts to meet up customers expectations for delivery. "
good,Great fun culture in a fast moving company. Sales role where you are responsible for managing the entire process from end to end. Responsible for managing your own portfolio.
good,It was fun and relaxed but fast paced and went by quickl.  I had fun every day and the managers treated me well.  I had to relocate to Florida for family
good,I would like to go back and work from amazon .i enjoyed working there the management team was great if you had any questions they where available to you
good,Amazon was a good opportunity. Plenty of room for advancement. You can pretty much dress however you want. They were in the process of implementing more event and incentives to engage employees more.
good,Amazon is a fast paced always evolving company. If one way does not work think of a way to fix it and move forward. The hardest part of the job is the walking. But once the you get use to it the job itself is easy.
good,"Some management is awesome and another's not so much.sometimes to many big boxes and not enough help to lift heavy boxes, the space between pallets is to small. Associate's don't build pallets correctly so pallets can fall on you."
good,"It was a deadline driven, fast paced environment that involved putting out a lot of fires. Keeping this in mind, it was generally a good place to work with a generous benefits package and attendance policy."
good,"I like most of the people I work with, I love being an ambassador cause I get to help people succeed at there job.I like the managers cause they are helpful and caring and try to make sure all the workers are safe and thier doin thier job the proper way."
good,"I enjoyed working for Amazon"
good,A great company to work for. Many things to learn and explor. Allowed me to develop my leadership and knowledge of ecommerce. Development is one of the company's main priorty.
good,"fun, creative, responsibility, always learning something different , very accurate treat people with respect, always protecting the work ethic with very helpful co-workers they have specific people who are always willing to help with anything is a great work place,"
good,"Working at Amazon was a good time for me."
good,"The hardest part of the job is getting stressed because your picking up someone else slack when they drop the ball. However, getting throughout my day with a positive attitude and team players."
good,"i really dont care to write this but amazon was pretty when i first started then it bacame way too much. youre always moving around, better hope you even have time to sit down for your 15 min break"
good,"While in connection with Amazon, I was only a freelance consultant on a video documentary project.  However, all interaction that I had with the Amazon team was positive."
good,If your looking for a fast growing company with good benefits and good team members than apply. Easy to grow within the company as well. Fun and quick paced days.
good,If you are able to be reliable and follow instruction this is a great place to work. There is room for advancement. The people are nice. The place is very accepting and culturally diverse.
good,"I work the RT shift. Three days a week, 12 hour shifts. I'm somewhat happy here. I just find that advancing is very difficult. My shift alone probably has more or less 1k people so you can imagine when there are a few openings for getting promoted, it's super competitive, and that's just my shift. There also day and night shift also competing for the same positions. "
good,"Some days were busy, some days were more relaxed. Everyone can work at their own pace but sometimes it gets a bit rushed. The pay is good, every shift has at least a 15 min break and dress code is whatever you’re comfortable in. Would definitely work here again."
good,Worked hard stay busy don't talk to much room for advancement learning training work with a sense of urgency helping with lifting heavy packageing have fun
good,"Amazon is a great environment with friendly yet driven people. Flexible hours, you can bring your dog, people management is great, and provided needed tools to succeed."
good,Great place to work. Can give you a starting point to build on. Fast pace and it will challenge you to push yourself. Very flexible shifts and days to pick from as well.
good,"I really enjoyed the job. it was just too far from or else I would've loved to stay, the rush hour traffic each passing day was cumbersome because of the location. And this only got worse once peak season came around. Overall the environment was great everyone was pleasant to work with and there was always room to improve."
good,"Productive and fast paced work place. Long hours, great pay, hand work and mostly alot of work. Great people, easy to work with people. Great management"
good,"Good Working Environment, Support with the management,  Good Incentive. But no technical skills required and nothing to learn extra technical. But can learn the internal process of e-commerce. Various internal job postings."
good,I got to learn many new things at working at a warehouse. There were many different people there and new experiences that I got to learn how to do that I never did before.
good,"A typical day at work consists of scanning and sorting packages until the building meets is goal which changes on a shift basis. I've learned about how fulfillment processes for companies work and I learned how to take lead on projects. Most of management are easy people to talk to, however some are lazy and expect nearly impossible things to get done. The hardest part of the job would be working in inbound because you'll likely be unloading trucks which can be hard physical labor for anyone who isn't used to that kind of work. Plus being inside the trucks during the summer makes it harder because it becomes hot and muggy the deeper inside you go. The most enjoyable part of the job is the interaction between associates as most are friendly individuals."
good,"it was a regular work from home job, i enjoyed the environment and the team work, The hardest part was working on a day your supervisor was off and trying to communicate with someone if u had issues."
good,Great job for highschool graduates and young adults to start off and gain great experience. Great managment. Managers are active and train emplyees well.
good,"Fun place to work, very flexible schedules for students. Managers are cool. Clean environment , safe place to work with great be efits and ability to move up in the company."
good,I am not interested in giving a review at this time. I liked working there and would be willing to work there again if given the opportunity to do so.
good,"neuskutecnitelne pro nějaké lidi, dobry kolektiv.."
good,You must pick up the boxes of the belt and put them on a pallet like a square then put the yellow envelopes in the middle of the pallet then it gets wrapped up and taking to the trucks to be delivered to the post office... You get a 15min break for part-time and full-times get a 15 mins and half an hour for lunch...
good,"cool place, they just weren't bringing people full time and that is what I needed."
good,"Should the opportunity ever arise to work at Amazon again, I would."
good,Overall a good company to work for. I liked working there overall. Yes I would recommend a friend or family to work there. The turn over is high though.
good,You must work with your co-workers in order to get your job done as well as keep alert of your surroundings because everyone is working at a quick pace in order to get all the orders sorted in the allotted time.
good,The managers are great and I lve to work there I just cant handle the long hours. I love the place. A typical work day is you clock in and go do your work you know what your job duties are. the most enjoyable is that you see alot of smiling faces.
good,"Not too crazy just a hassle if you're not a night person. Overall nice experience, good if like concentrating on your work without much interference or distraction"
good,"Good management team, always busy, no complaints. Was able to work different areas and flexibility was critical. Management challenged productivity standards daily- that was good. Co-workers and staff were a treat to work with."
good,"good work place"
good,"Dealing with customer complaints, missing parcels, replacement items, defective items, returns. "
good,"I was hired for Christmas help.  The time was busy.  Good, friendly working environment.  I did a lot of walking as I was a picker.  The hardest part was you were on your feet 10-12 hours a day, but you get used to it."
good,"A really fun place to work with lots of people, management and products even you might have to keep in mind for purchase later on in the day. I recommend working at Amazon Warehouse 100%!"
good,"If you're a college student looking for easy money, and want enough time to do all the other things you wanna do. Amazon is literally the perfect place. Easy job really. I recommend. HR though...could be better."
good,"Unless you are looking for people to talk to, in which case there are tons of people in your work areas you can talk with, people generally will keep to their groups."
good,Flexible hours get paid every two weeks good company. A lot of walking to and from apartments/houses. I like best about the job is the driving and customer service.
good,answer calls through computer for customers and drivers delivering to address delivery issues and other issues.  2 15 min breaks and an hour lunch for my position and hours.
good,Fast paced with oportunities of advancement. The further you climb the ladder the more stressful it is. I love the people I work with but I need to find a job with a shorter commute.
good,There are lot of best facility such as talking behaviour & good environment according to outer climate conditions. Security and transport facilities was perfect. But working hours was more than normal.
good,I enjoyed working at amazon. everyone was nice and it was very repetitive which I love because I like to stay busy while I am at work. The job was very easy.
good,"It's a relaxed area, nice associates, managers are awesome feel like if I could work there again I would only thing I see wrong about it is that's it is always hot"
good,Great for a college student looking for cash. Flexible hours. Good management as long as numbers are being met. Dressing casually is always a plus and other co workers are nice and friendly.
good,"Responsible for the supervision of inventory control.  Receive incoming freight and inspect materials.  "
good,Mostly deliverling packages for most of the day. There was nothing wrong with working with the previous company except the fact that I had to re-locate otherwise I'd still be working there.
good,A typical day at work would be to process all merchandise in a speedy timely manner with a 30 minute brake and 30 minutes for lunch. Everone is required to keep their area tidy and safe. If you find anything unsafe it should be reported to the Safety Chief right away. From time to time we are able to rotate and proform different positions where the company needs help in a different area. I learned the importance of completing shippments by the end of each shift.  Management is always available when needed. They are helpful with answers to questions of your concern. The position is easy not hard at all. The mosts enjoyable part of working with Amazon is when there is compitition with other co-workers. We are able to perform in an outstanding manner by packing more than 300 items for shipment in an one hour period. If you are one of those speedy packers you will be recognized and given a gift for your performance.
good,"Great company overall however there was poor communication between internal peers at times. Policy changes ignored by co workers making it very difficult at times. Some managers are amazing others not so much, just make sure you personally are aware of who to go to for issues."
good,Very productive place to work! Numerous ways to move up in the company. I learned a lot about logistics from the company. The culture is pretty relaxed and comfortable.
good,"Amazon is definitely very demanding, but if you expect that going into it, it's a fantastic placed to work.  Great training and development, the best benefits of anywhere I've worked, and very competitive compensation."
good,I want to be a successful professionals by applying invoatotive ideas and skills ii the industry.where i can use my skills and abilities to achieve excellent profession and growth.
good,It is a fast paced company and job. You are on your feet for 10+ hours a day and you have to reach a quota. The job is not for everyone. You are constantly lifting and moving
good,"Man hört leider viel schlechtes über dieses Unternehmen. "
good,"The pay is fair, there is advancement opportunities you just have to be in good standing with all the higher ups, management could be better, time off is good, including paid vacation and paid time off, plus unpaid time off, regular over time. The benefits are also pretty good. Overall I would recommend this company, just be ready to work, like any other job."
good,"a typical day at work is very fast paced and competitive . when you first walk in you put your things away in a locker and than you get straight to work . "
good,"good place to work and the management staff were fun to work for"
good,"It is a relaxed environment, with a lot of cool people, and in addition to this, more hours during peak. part-time during the regular season. flexible scheduling hours."
good,Very fast paced job .. time flies because you are always busy doing something. very friendly working environment.. the management was also very friendly and seemed to care about their employees..
good,"Amazon was a pretty interesting expierence. there is alot of people there working with you so you meet new people everyday. the work wasn't crazy hard, you just have to stay onyour game."
good,If you are a hard worker you can easily excel in the company but you have to be confident and work your way to the promotions. Nothing is easily handed to you but then again what really is.
good,Open or closing the store as a manager was great. Store opened at 9am closed at 9pm. Being the manager in the building I had to oversee day-to-day operations.
good,Azienda molto attenta alla sicurezza e alla qualità del lavoro
good,Love working but unfair rules. Good options on schedule and days off. Great on dress code. Good on vending machines. Good ppl to work with and good trainers
good,"Each person is focused on their work to make it as fast and as fast as possible."
good,"its work cool place to be i dont like the fact you have leave your cell in a locker "
good,"A typical shift at amazon was pretty straight forward. However, complicated at times due to overwhelming amounts of product that had to be placed or lack of space for said items. It required a lot of walking, but all in all  working at amazon was great and id do it again and recommend it to anyone looking for a good job."
good,Working at a Fulfillment Center is physically exhausting the first time since we are not accustomed to all the walking.  Your body will adjust and you will have so much fun working there.
good,"Fun place to work. Numerous projects with very exiting and advance features. Good team spirit. Personal achievements are being noted and rewarded. In most cases, good communication between teams."
good,"They were able to work around my school schedule which was something that I was looking for in a job. It was somewhat of a fast pace work environment, but not enough to stress one."
good,"Amazon has a very fast paced environment, so there is always scope to learn and excel better. The managers and process assistants are always available to help.I learned  excellent time management skills here."
good,Amazon is a great place to work the culture and the team is what makes the job so fun. There are somethings though that can make the job seem like a daily chore and worried about any little mess up like your always looking over your shoulder. You have to drive your own personal car for every job appointment you have so a lot of wear and tear on your own vehicle.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Amazon, the company culture was great, the people are amazing and friendly. The hours can really get to you if you have something like school that you have on the side but for the most part it is a great company and the benefits are a a great  cherry on top."
good,"Nice place to be employed at, They like to keep it fun but serious. keeping up with the rate standard was hard at times and a little confusing. My favorite department was Incoming docks."
good,Good company and job and environment to work at. the managers and supervisors are good and hard working just as the employees. it is hard working and worth it.
good,Working at amazon helped me internalize the externalities of an efficient workflow process. I learned as I watched several problems come up and be solved. In my short time there I was cross trained in almost everything which proved to me that if you were willing to work there then getting advanced was only a matter of time.
good,"Like any labor job, you're expected to work...your entire shift. You are not to be time of task (restroom break, water break, etc.) More than 10 minutes a day. I think they should give more time than that. However; I do enjoy working at Amazon most days. Attitude is everything, stay calm, relaxed, and keep moving! Make the best of it. The pay is pretty good, the managers are fairly good, dress code is very relaxed. I enjoy doing different things, as a packer I pack shoe boxes into boxes for orders but this job is extended to other tasks as well. I sometimes make the boxes ( put cardboard into a machine and stack the made boxes together), I bin the shoe boxes (scan and place boxes in appropriate shelf for the Packers), and even sweep when there's no work left."
good,Working at Amazon has been a fun and educational experience for me. The work environment is also very professional and strict but yet at the same time if you need anything then you don't have to hesitate to go to management and ask them for what it is you need.
good,"A typical day was clocking in, a team meeting, get supplies, find your station and lastly stack your pallets. we also ha to make sure our areas stayed clean throughout your shift."
good,It was a little steady work would run out quickly management was ok they checked on coworkers often was a clean facility hardest part was having work to last most enjoyable part we got to go home if work was low
good,Working for Amazon was great It was only seasonal but the hours and money was decent. I worked in the part time Building which was only 5 hours a day with the option to work more.
good,Amazon was a fun place to work! It was fast paced and many hours to work there. The people that worked there where good team members to work with and would have fun he tting the job done.
good,"Operated forklift,tall reach truck,double reach truck,turret,order picker,using As400 inventory system and Rf unit. Arranged bulk locations and created liscense plates for inventory..."
good,it was a ok job but it require a lot of walking. The shifts varies and the pay was good. Can work overtime if available. This job is usually always hiring.
good,"My job as an ambassador means  that i train all new hires in my department, amazon has many different departments which will give you a chance to move higher up. Managers are great and willing to listen. Everyone is there to work as a team and to get the job done. Its a great place to start at , if youv never worked in a warehouse before. They go through alot of training to make sure you are prepared to operate or drive  a machine."
good,You need to build up some stamina in order to keep up the pace of amazon. It is just a lot of walking but other than that i thought it was a easy job.
good,"I need full-time employment. At the Amazon Logistics Center you only have the opportunity to work part-time. Otherwise I really, really enjoy my job at Amazon."
good,"The years I worked at Amazon were some of my better ones, I truly loved it.There was always room for improvement and one had a good chance to get ahead if one wanted to. There was plenty of overtime available as well."
good,Last two hours of the ten hour days.  But three days off in a row after the four day work week was great. Mandatory overtime fifth days were really tough.
good,"awesome work and life balance, never did i think of not going to office u don't have to think about work after office hour until u become manger. Awesome work culture"
good,This is fast and you have to keep up with the changing environments. Many business to choose from at Amazon. I place to be ahead of the market for all different business.
good,It’s fast paced lost of packages to lift to scan and don’t forget about the bags to put into the cubbies . I can say I like working at amazon but it does get stressful and you have to be rest to deal with the flex drivers it gets overwhelming at times and some days then go by smooth.
good,The work environment was employee friendly. The managers and supervisors were very interactive with the employees and they showed they cared about us.
good,The graveyard shift was never going to be very fun. Long hours in the dead of night and tired and angry people all around. Amazon made up for that with a pretty good pay and a very fast paced job that left little to no time for goofing off.
good,"I learned a lot at Amazon. Mostly what to do and in some cases what not to do. Overall, good place to work at. I would definitely recommend it to anyone."
good,L'ambiance au sein de l'entreprise était trés agréable ainsi que les managers
good,"Great Organisation to work with."
good,They update you real time on new system updates and they provide benefits according to UAE law. They also provide you good feed backs about your work and motivate you to do well
good,"it was ok place to work for the most part. Only issue i had as wheni was let go, i couldnt come in cause i had to deal with a family emergency and was busy so i mussed the emails they sent about me losing my job and when i called and spoke to someone about doing a leave of absence i was put on hold and no one come back on and spoke to me or the number i called would just ring and have noone come to the line."
good,Amazon was fast paced and self competitive. All positions and employees work together seemlessly and the managers are always ready to help. Your job is explained pretty well and if your confused someone will lend a helping hand
good,Not as bad as everyone would think. It's worth it if you want money. Yes they shifts can be long and boring but it's a job. Management can be very supportive and it's a great place to not just earn money but make friends.
good,"Good work environment,"
good,"For a position that didn't require a college degree or work experience, I thought the pay and expectation for me there was fair. I found it hard to transition into other positions even if I was qualified.  Management was okay.  Co-workers were very competitive due to the nature of the work; couldn't really blame them.  I'd love to work for Amazon again, just not as a fulfillment associate."
good,"I was part time on the TOM team. Great job. Management was very good. I took the job as a temporary position to help pay off some debt. I would still be there, but the debts have been paid off."
good,The Job with Amazon is very easy for me and it helped to learn how to deal with the customers.I really enjoyed working there because I have to handle multiple customers at a time through email and it is quite challenging one too.
good,"Everyone in sortation will scan no matter what. But if you show promise and skill they'll move you up if you ask. When it comes to people around you, people halfway care for sure."
good,"Hard work none stop have to focus on your work, none stop keeping up our rates, able to follow the screen, keep your eye on the screen while you are putting the merchandise in the correct tote."
good,Amazon was a very active and fast pace job. I did not mind the changings because I would adapt to them very well. The managers and supervisors are really nice!
good,Management is great.  People are wonderful. Guidelines are set and easy to follow. Policies are acceptable. Benefits are excellent.  No complaints at all
good,My experience working in an Amazon Fulfillment Center(warehouse) was good. Aside from the late hours it was fairly easy job. A bit robotic in it's nature but that's ohkay. Management was good. They were really tight about safety which was awesome.
good,"The job is 40 hours a week, nice and friendly people, there is a rate you must meet on a weekly basis. Productivity is taken very seriously at this workplace or you will be penalized for not making it"
good,Brand new warehouse with latest technologies and many resources for the employees. It was a good experience after all although the long commute from Manchester.
good,"As an Intern I was brought quickly onto the team and was able to fore fill all roles throughout the Fulfillment center. Which allowed me to meet a lot of great, smart, and hard working people throughout the company in my 12 week internship."
good,I learned a huge amount while working for this company and continue to grow intellectually with more various tasks. I love working for this company and have nothing bad to say.
good,It was very interesting. The benefits are awesome and there is  probably not any other like it. I just wanted another outlook because I did not see myself growing career wise there.
good,Overall the job was manageable and the management was pretty good. Sometimes the work hours can be not favorable but pay was still okay for someone without a lot bills.
good,"When I started small building, than moved to New building where they should have had air conditioning before we started working in the building.  But I survived the heat passed out once taken to hospital.  But came back to work when allowed. "
good,It was a nice working environment and multicultural which was nice! All the employees are friendly and are willing to lend a helping hand if you are struggling with anything related to your job. Like being unable to reach the top shelf or even giving tips to perform well at your task.
good,"Currently been here since the 12th of March, and I love it here. I am a seasonal employee. The training process is long, classroom wise, however after you actually start on the calls.  It becomes a breeze.  Time goes by fast when you are continuously taking calls.  My experience with the calls aren't always bad. We really do have nice and loyal customers.  But the bad calls create thick skin.  The training managers I have are EXCELLENT!  These 2 women really have a passion for their job and is very eager to show you the same passion they experience.  They really care about the hard work you do and give you recognition. We get to play games called Ice Breakers and the most recent one we played is Spot It.  Gives your brain a rest. I am worried about job security. I put a lot of trust into the fact that if I do my job well I may be eligible to be converted.  I quit my last job for this opportunity and I don't regret it.  I will soon be going to Treasure Truck and I am very excited.  I love it here....i actually cannot wait to do my regular shift of 12 hours. If I could I would do it 7 days a week given the chance!!!!"
good,ambiance super agréable et manager trop attentifs .
good,"I loved working at amazon! I had never worked in a warehouse or done any job like it. I came from the healthcare industry so it was a totally different world. "
good,"I was working at the Springfield location and it was slight. The coworkers are pretty laid back and get the job done. The ""ambassadors"" (managers) are okay. Some are a pain in the a** and take the job too serious, but a few can work with you. Just be careful and try to work with what you can. $200 a week was smooth, but choose your hours wisely. If you aren't a morning person, then don't choose the morning shift. That's where I F#*#*#ed up. lol "
good,"You would be required to work longer than average shifts if we were backlogged, but depending on the managers, if it was slow, there would sometimes be an option of going home early.You could also accumulate personal hours, based on hours worked, which was nice."
good,"a hard place to work, a fast paced work area, its not very clean and you are expendable so they won't fight for your job even if you were a hard worker, but overall the pay is good and you'll get the full time hours"
good,"I enjoyed working at Amazon and taking on new challenges seemingly every day.  However, the work never stops and it can take a great deal of self-discipline to not get burned out. "
good,"Good place to work but was not for me. Did not fit with my personal life and barely had any time off to rest, constantly on feet for 12 hrs/day/4days w"
good,It was my starting job in my carrier and it was an fantanstic company and the work wise learned a lot in starting of my job about the professional and balancing the life.
good,"It was such a good job and such a good paying job within a month I had over 1,000 that’s incredible! but I couldn’t stay at amazon because I was currently enrolled in college and was not getting enough rest the next morning I worked full time shift and didn’t leave until 5 in the morning .it was difficult if I had the opportunity again yes I would take it hands down!"
good,The job pays you very well and you get 3 days a week off. It's just kind of difficult working those hours while being in college at the same time. You have to be willing to work hard if you want to be able to handle working there.
good,"Nice place to work.nice management with clear goals, open communication, good growth opportunities, good pay structure, work flexibility,............."
good,"Good benefits, good pay. Very very fast paced.  U will definitely be moving very fast if anyone can't perform at a fast pace shouldn't apply.  Good pay, free giveaways."
good,"very good and fun place to work.not competing and also a good place to start and get a feel for the workplace, it's really fast pace so it prepares you for the world of labor and intense work."
good,I have learned a lot of technical and management skills while working at amazon. I had hands on experience on latest technologies such as voice automation and home automation. From my managers I have learned a lot about leadership skills which I would like to implement wherever I work.
good,One of the best places I have ever worked. Even if you work on a holiday they always find a way to make it fun by providing free meals or snacks and a game room in every breakroom
good,"typical day at work was being on your feet entire shift, at a very fast pace, especially at holiday time. Very physical environment, moving constantly. I learned labeling, computer, and packaging skills. Management was very helpful and friendly. Most people were very friendly, and easy to talk to or ask for assistance if needed. Hardest part of job was mandatory overtime during Christmas season. Mandatory 60 hrs a week and I was working overnight shift. Most enjoyable was staying busy, which I like to. As well as great benefits, decent pay, and employee discount."
good,"amazon saran manager très agréable, ambiance de travaille vraiment bonne."
good,Productive and fun workplace; Hard working but encouraging moment; Very challenging at times. It can also be very awarding with the opportunity of winning prizes and raffle tickets. Amazon gives you the incentive to work harder.
good,"Trabajar en Amazon fué realmente enriquecedor, fué un cambio radical en mi desarrollo profesional, pues venía de administrar empresas de contrucción y allí aprendí lo que es el comercio electrónico y de que se trata vender online, de la mano de los mejores!"
good,"You have to meet quota. Very fast paced job, working with returns, reboxing and deciding if it was good for resale or not, and also did refurbishing. Not a bad job just working with people's used products."
good,A typical day was fast-paced but the days seemed shorter. I learned the importance of meeting quota and the big picture of how Amazon works. The management did well at their job but was rude at times. Culture was diverse. The hardest and easiest parts were both the amount of walking because I do not like to walk but I like the exercise.
good,Amazon is a great company to work for because of the management. From top to bottom the managers and supervisors make people feel like they are more then just employs. They take the time to engage with everyone and make sure the work environment is a safe place to work.
good,Working at Amazon is a great experience.love working there I learn a lot of different things.A typical day at work is when my feet starts to hurt it lets me know im getting the job done.
good,It was good work place to work however there was not enough work there for them to keep me so therefore they laid me off and told me they would let me know when they are hiring again.
good,"The work is as easy as you make it Each warehouse is different You can have fun, you can have fights The pay is ok Pending on who you get, the managers are ok as well-sometimes you have to teach them"
good,My role gave me a good learning across multiple technologies though work timings were lengthy. Management is really supportive and helps us in improving careers.
good,"Working for Amazon is a great place however if you're not a competitive person, I would not recommend it. Amazon only wants the best of the best. If you aren't able to work mandatory overtime, then you shouldn't even apply. But, they do offer great benefits and the overtime pay is good as well. So there are advantages but plenty of the disadvantages."
good,i think that over all amazon work force is very successful and is willing to help you grow within and outside of there work place and help you grow as a person.
good,"une journée de travail physique"
good,I enjoy being an associate with amazon. The pay is competitive and schedules are flexible. I love the peak season and knowing that im apart of delivering smiles to our customers faces.
good,It was a temp job over the holidays. The pay was weekly and decent. The hours were long. Mandatory and voluntary overtime. No talking was the only problem I had.
good,The typical at at amazon was ok. We first started off with an annonoucements and sometimes stretches. I woul begin my work and everything. The only thing I hated is how dusty the trucks were and hun unsanitary it felt.
good,"A fun place to work, improved my typing speed working here. Learned responding to e-mails. Enjoyed working in night shifts. Lot of activities on the office floor."
good,"My role entails providing high volume customer service and data management support to the workforce throughout the United States. Responsibilities include providing payroll support by maintaining high level of accuracy and speed while working across multiple systems. This role works directly with the employees maintaining successful partnerships with Benefits, Recruiting, Payroll, and business operations throughout the company."
good,Amazon is a great place to work at if you’re multicultural or bilingual because you meet a lot of diverse people at the job. It is also a great place if you like to move around and not stay in one place.
good,"Definitely a unique tale on 'Warehouse work'. Great morale boosting supervisors. Pre-shift pep rallies. "
good,I like  working  at amazon and i work night sort at amazon parttime and its a nice place to work on a daily basis.during the seasonal hours great off days
good,"Amazon has great benefits but they don't pay enough. They also give benefits, and company stocks on day one and its always room for advancement.  They even pay 90-95 percent of college after one year of employment."
good,"They expect a lot from their employees, their employees produce. you only get one chance in the first three months then your allowed to switched departments."
good,Fast paced environment  a lot of people fun and cold breakaway are cool mangers are nice daily work out was needed always someone around if you need help
good,"you could make a career out the Amazon Fulfillment Centers. you could start and get promoted within a year. it's alot of standing and sometimes you have nothing to do, other times you aren't sure what to do. everyone job effects the other parts of the building so if one thing breaks, it effects the flow. people are cheerful and happy and supportive but they want better production rates and less mistakes of course. they focus on safety heavily. there is security and drug testing, you have a locker to store things. one 30 minutes break for lunch and two 15 minute breaks."
good,"Over all I enjoy working at amazon its fast past and I enjoy the work that we do."
good,"The hardest part of this job is that it can be hard to deal with the climate and negativity of other employees. It is a great way to exercise (especially in Pick) and to meet amazing people who look at you as more than coworkers. At Amazon, you're family and the upper management acts as the parents you rebel against."
good,"Amazon was a fast paced environment. The requirements were not too demanding. I would've kept the 20 hrs a week, however policy dictates that one must be employed 90 days before a shift change is allowed. Once I found a full time job, I was left with no choice but to resign."
good,Amazon always have something fun for their employees to motivate them to work even harder and to make us look forward in coming to work everyday. We are always rewarded whenever we do exceptionally well.
good,This job was enjoyable. It was challenging but offered a lot of advancement and the ability to work extra if you so desired. Only real concern I had was the management seemed young and unprofessional.
good,"It was 2 a.m. to 11 shift. I came in the early morning and loaded my work truck with groceries. Deliver the first route which would end at roughly 5 a.m. Begin lunch at FC then go out for the second route. Some of the stops were attended deliveries to where the customer was present at time of delivery. Management was good they did what they could. The hardest part of the job I would say is the start time also some of the timed stops. I love being a fresh employee, interacting with customers and being at different parts of the city was very enjoyable. It was unfortunate the company went with private delivery companies and opted out the delivery driver employees such as myself."
good,"Really nice job, but just needed to relocate, Amazon was located Jefferson Indiana, which I had no transportation to and from after peak. Nice pay ,nice hours just inconvenient for me"
good,"The work place is fast paced. Depending on your FC and your managers it could be a good, productive day or it could be a bad, slow paced one. Some favortisim."
good,It was a good job and I might go back one day if it's possible.  It was okay. Enjoyed some of the people there.  Might work at a closer amazon facility.
good,it was a great place to work great employees.only thing was there wasnt alot of hours and we had long lunches sometimes are lunches were two hours or longer.
good,The time I had was nice there got to work with different people everyday. Working great with others.. it was a fast past jobs it kept u moving. Have to work well with other of all culture.
good,A typical work day at amazon is long but successful. You learn how to work in a timely matter. Some times management can be very poor. The hardest part of working in a warehouse is standing on your feet for a long period of time. The most enjoyable part of working at amazon is that you learn something new about a warehouse everyday and you get to work with all different type of people.
good,"Upon reentering the job force once again, I found the experience gratifying, but incredibly physically demanding.  The work was tough, but at the end of the day, the pay was worth it!"
good,"work we did was efficient and long hours had lots of walking, stacking and replacing and placing thing in trucks and shelves.as well as group working."
good,"Travail organisé et pratique"
good,"Typical Day at work involves ""Stand-Up"" (Daily Briefing) and stretching to get us ready for work.  We then move to our assigned station/assignment for the day trying to get get off to a ""Fast-Start"".  We learn different roles from unloading on the dock, processing on the line, or solving problems that need special tools and apps in the computer.  Regular Breaks are every few hours.  Hardest part of the day is to stay mentally focused for 10 hours.  Work is not hard, but becomes routine."
good,hardest part of job was hoping you didn't go home before your scheduled hours and being challenged to be well equipped in more than 1 position. sometimes the machines would shut down and had to do the work manually
good,"I enjoyed my time at amazon for the most part. It is a fast paced environment and quite the work out but it is easy enough as long as you stick to the tips from training, keep a decent pace, and follow the safety guide lines."
good,Best place to work with.
good,Good place to work and you have the camaraderie of coworkers learn something new walk around a lot and you have 15 mins breaks and you get paid sick day and paid holidays
good,"Es una excelente empresa , con los medios necesarios garantizados para un mejor trabajo , calidad y buen ambiente"
good,"meet a lot of people,great managment team, its nit a hard job as everybody thinks.learn alot if you willing to,great activities during each month......"
good,"Rien à reprocher de cette entreprise mais seulement le fait que j'ai été mise en ""black liste"" pour avoir eu un arrêt de travail et un accident de travail, bien entendu pas sur la même période."
good,"super esprit d'équipe "
good,the tyical day at amazon is coming in and being assigned to specific areas. And working in my designated functions. The management is great. The workplace is very diverse. The hardest part of the job is dealing with some of the business decisions they make but you learn to slowly overcome it. The most enjoyable part of working at amazon is the fun that we have while working there.
good,"This is a good place to work, it's fast paced and they offer great health benefits. The only complaint I had was that it required heavy lifting continuously."
good,its a great place to work but its not for people who dont like fast pace things.Its also a great place to learn new ways to do certain things. the workplace culture is a mix of different people and different backgrounds.
good,"I loved working at Amazon, it was an awesome atmosphere. I would have stayed had it not been for going back to school to finish my degree. Also, I wouldn't mind working in their media department."
good,The only thing I have to complain is about how the rate people and if you don't have a good rate they fire you. They don't care about keeping their employees. The management is good. I enjoy it the people around .
good,"Amazon is a  great company.Had  trainig at packing and picking, health and safety.Amazon always required 100% work from employer,my target always was higher ."
good,"There is a lot of opportunity at amazon for internal advancement, as well as opportunity for time off to yourself. After a couple years at amazon they offer stocks as well as day 1 benefits and a 401k"
good,"A typical day at Amazon is a 200+ processing units per hour, face-paced day. I learned how to manage my time and prioritize events in my personal life."
good,Amazing is an amazing company..with good work culture and great leadership.. it provides a good work / life balance . I would recommend everyone to be part of it
good,very fasted paced and i was surprised how fast i was taught many more things in my department. the managers where young so they dint know how to manage people just yet.
good,"If you need a job immediately apply to Amazon, they're constantly. Part-time benefits, laidback work environment, weekly pay, and flexible work schedule."
good,"Amazon provides plenty of opportunities to be trained in various skills that will be useful for furthering one's career. What confuses me is why they do not adjust pay for skills acquired and utilized. Specifically those who perform training and those who drive PIT (powered industrial trucks). It is a demanding job, but not necessarily difficult. There is opportunity to move up, but to do so takes time. For these reasons Amazon is a fantastic temporary job, and for some it can be a great career."
good,"The best thing is can work whenever you want and as many hours you can."
good,"Amazon is a great place to work provided you have comfortable shoes, plenty of energy, and some patience. I enjoy my time at Amazon and recommend you apply."
good,a stressful place to work you have to make rate every time in order not to get written up it would be a good place to work if there was no rate and you have to be fast
good,Fun productive fast pace  working environment picking pulling sorting scanning  and working at a steady paste is highly recommended and to be very alert
good,"The work itself is hard on the body, so working there long term is not an option; however, the people I worked with were nice. I would recommend it to someone young or someone looking for a seasonal job."
good,I have a various jobs there . I always make my productivity as required. My managers are very nice and are willing to help me out when needed. I am available to labor share to different departments as needed.
good,"I work thursday , friday and saturday 12 hours a day. i learn there how to work fast and safely with roberts. Enjoyable part is working with a big team."
good,"Overall, decent workplace. Pretty clean, lots of open space, nice bathrooms and break rooms. Embraces technology to expedite many things, from an auto sorter for packages to chipped badges for easy building access and punch in. You use hand scanners for a variety of tasks, filling pallets, moving pallets, scanning packages, closing container id's. Lots of moving around, very large building. Management is approachable with concern, HR is usually available in person, whiteboard put up to be able to voice concerns. Hardest part is that there's a lot of moving decently weighted objects and heavy pallets around as fast as possible when flow is heavy, and when flow is light finding things to do to justify you being there. Usually people will opt to leave early with manager's permission when things get slow. Overall a very nice working environment- But remember you are in a warehouse. Remember your training. Remember your interview and your orientation."
good,un travail typique une bonne ambiances des managers au top
good,Great place to learn and get promoted. you are surrounded by smart people who are driven and willing to put in extra hours beyond what is required. You will be expected to do the same
good,"Amazon hires alot of people,when it comes down to hours and time management they don't have enough hours to give everyone,so I really like the work and environment."
good,I loved it. My colleagues were the best people I could work with. The package that Amazon offers is fantastic and they are very flexible and understanding too.
good,"Lavoro che richiede molta manualità, precisione, attenzione e velocità ma soprattutto costanza. Svolgendo questo lavoro ho imparato ad essere più precisa e attenta anche ai piccoli dettagli e ad essere sempre più motivata al raggiungimento di nuovi obiettivi per una crescita costante. questa azienda ha delle regole ben precise da rispettare in fatto di sicurezza e di attenzione nella gestione degli articoli. La parte più difficile è stata forse sul lato fisico perché nella mansione svolta da me era necessario essere sempre molto scattanti e rapidi durante tutta la durata del turno in modo da riuscire a raggiungere gli obiettivi ma la parte piacevole è stata il fatto di essere sempre motivati positivamente dai manager all'inizio di ogni turno e al rientro delle pause."
good,"Spend some time here, learn the skill sets. Take it elsewhere. Regimented well planned but long hours and youre just a small gear in a huge machine..."
good,"productive and fun workplace with ping pong table."
good,A hardworking individual with attention to detail does well here and has opportunity to be cross-trained in multiple departments.  Advancement can happen quickly.
good,"Working from home you don't have to worry about annoying co-workers, or managers breathing down your neck. You don't have to worry about traveling, or trying to scrape up lunch money. You don't have to worry about who is going to get your child off the bus, you don't have to worry about weather or dress code. Amazon is an amazing company to work for, it can get a little stressful at times, especially around the holidays but that is to be expected."
good,"I do enjoy working at Amazon, however, I am a person who is eager to learn and I feel ""stuck"" in my current position. I am currently in school and growing"
good,"Relacion excelente entre managers y empleados y entre los compañeros . Comunicacion excelente, oportunidad para promocionar, los instructores muy bien preparados y muy motivadores con los nuevos empleados. Nada que mejorar."
good,"Everyday is day one something you learn in Amazon. The company is changing and growing very quickly, you have to be able to deliver results and be customer obsessed. You need to do you own research and go the extra mile to be an expert in the area you work in. The hardest part of the job is to manage large teams you need to ensure that everyone is working in a safe manner. The most enjoyable part of this job is when as a team or as a site we achive certain goals, metric or nominations."
good,Very fun place to work. Learn new things all the time. Supportive management. They are to see every one is being treated well with respect. I have learnt a lot on leadership and organising skills. Courses offered  helped me learn a lot n grasp the concept of what it takes to be a trainer coach .
good,"A basic day at Amazon would be that I would show up and begin working at a conveyor belt that I was assigned and proceed to scan the packages that would come down the belt. Afterwards place them on the pallets that was next to the conveyor belt station. Management was really productive and did their jobs as one would expect them to do, such as being straightforward and direct with their praises and/or criticisms they have of one performance. What I appreciated most from management is that you weren't heavily evaluated, such as being a surprise one. The workplace was fast, but at the same time not as hectic as one would think when working in a fulfillment cent/warehouse that handles packages and that is on a tight deadline  to give their customers' their purchases. The most enjoyable part of the job, without a doubt, is the breaks when got in between shifts. When it was time for a break you got relax and eat your lunch in the break room where you could also play video games or watch television for about 5-10 minutes. I would say that the only hardest part is that making sure that you correctly put the appropriate marked package on the correct pallet and also those who was responsible for the forklift and wrapping the packages on the pallet. "
good,its a very good company to work for. I would recomended it to anyone thats looking for a good starter job. Hours are great and they also work with you if you ever need anything.
good,"I honestly liked the job, lots of walking but other then that it was great for me. Lot of competition and friendly people there. Great management also."
good,One of the fast growing companies in America and they are steady expanding ... Take advantage when you can to become part of there company. This is a great place to start if your new to a city or first time working or looking for a part time job . The growth with in this company is amazing
good,"Amazon has the mission of being earth's most customer-centric company in the world. The atmosphere at Amazon is very welcoming, the culture promotes and emphasize on helping out customers, deescalate rough situations, and handle packages."
good,"Excelente ambiente laboral, era lo que necesitaba en el momento"
good,A typical day at amazon involved 10+ hours of being on your feet. You'll met so many people from so many different walks of life. Some of the work is fast paced and can be challenging.
good,Steady employment with great benefits and opportunities for advancement. Huge warehouse with robotic technology. On foot all day handling product or customer orders.
good,Its a mixture of organizational to customer service with some improvisation in completing some tasks .. excellent job opportunities .... The hours were just not enough at 20 hours a week ... Work at this company was awesome and i really enjoyed the interactions between the supervisors and the workers. If they gave more hours they wouldn't have regretted me working for them ..bottom line but the bills need to be paid ..
good,"Job is hassle free, Everyone is trained well and exactly knows what is required of them. "
good,The scheduled work day was very unpredictable as a seasonal worked depending on the work load. Towards the end of the season sent home often voluntary leave w/o pay due to lack of work.
good,"Learned that if there was not enough work they sent people home (VTO)"
good,"The working environment is very fast paced, busy and can also be physically demanding. There is a lot of walking, bending, and reaching required to work at amazon."
good,"Good place to work for long term career goals."
good,The average day at amazon can be very fast paced.  You will first go to stand up where your managers will give you  a basic summery on how the day will go.  The days can be long and it may be boring but it is a pretty good place to work.
good,"Not much to say really it's warehouse work, you get a list of things to do and you just get to work. Of course I worken in packing which is the easiest to do, you stand in one spot and put stuff in bags or boxes."
good,Amazon was a very productive place to work. it helps out with a lot of skills. It can be challenging if you aren’t trained right but when you are trained right it is a very easy job.
good,"A typical day at work would include a stand up meeting at the beginning of the shift going over statistics and process placement for each associate. Depending on the process, it can be quick paced or relaxed. A process called stowing can be difficult at times because you are lifting items and placing them in bins. The items can weight up to 50 pounds and you must do stow these items at a certain rate otherwise you get written up. This was the hardest part of the job in my opinion. However I do enjoy the culture and it is the most enjoyable part of the job. They have competitions and contests that you can participate in which is a good way to get to know your fellow coworkers. Also, we are rewarded for productivity sometimes with free lunches like pizza, tamales, or hot dogs. And we are given a holiday meal around thanksgiving time. On top of that the managers are nice for the most part."
good,"What does a Warehouse Associate do? "
good,Easy to move up if you work hard. Keeps you busy and will allow you to work at a pace in which you can succeed. Very friendly staff and friend management.
good,"The job is enjoyable, except for being written up for performing lower than their ridiculous rate you have to pick items at.  I have a fairly quick pace at how i perform without burning myself out to early. They expect a somewhat unreachable goal for picks per hour when if u don't have multiple items on an order is very hard to obtain this rate. Other than that one down side its enjoyable going from aisle to aisle picking items that your scanner tells u."
good,"decent place to work, gets a little stressful around the holidays with all the mandatory overtime. pretty much just drive around on PIT and stock shelves. the hardest part is the nonstop standing for 10 hours but the coworkers I had made it more enjoyable to me."
good,Hard work but always find a new skill to learn and step up opportunities . If you are a person that want to learn more and like to work in a big team is a good place to work
good,"Quick fast-paced job, no a tough job if you consider yourself a hard-worker. Pay better than minimum wage but still not good enough of a wage. Good, friendly environment."
good,I enjoy my job  I learned new things to do at the job...different things within the job so you don't do the same things every night .I enjoy the team of management .
good,The work is not unreasonable but it can be challenging for some that is not willing to work constant until break. Working their can teach people communication can be key when working with other people for a same goal.
good,"Managers are ready to assist you with problems or concerns. This was a seasonal work from home assignment, so basically your encounters with others were via telephone, chat, email or instant messaging."
good,"Came in around noon, clocked in, looked to see which section i worked at for the day, lined up and stretch, then off to work. Usually i scanned boxes, but sometimes i sort the box down the lane, wrapped up palates, or sort the boxes coming from the trucks to the lanes. I was always one of the top 5 scanners, pay was fine, but management lacked. There were clearly people getting hired that did not meet the requirements to work there. One of the requirements to work there is to scan at least 3 boxes per minute. so every hour you should be scanning at least 180 boxes, and in our roughly 4-5 hour shifts, you should be scanning 720-900 boxes. I've always hit around the upper 800s to 1.3k boxes. There were people not even hitting 100 boxes and management did nothing about it."
good,"Overall a great first job work experience. Night shift was challenging at times, however, I was able to handle all tasks successfully. Supervisors and co workers were helpful to new hires."
good,"Having a professional mindset with innovated ideas can get you far, and very fast. My best advice to make it in Amazon is having amazing people skills"
good,Na it was a temp job and it was just through the holiday season. It was an easy job if you know what your doing and follow instructions. You also have to make your job fun.
good,Amazon is a thrilling and hard environment.  Your co-workers are smart and talented and will keep you on your toes.  It is a challenging place to work but it can be a true growth experience with the right attitude.
good,"im not a warehouse person but it's a great learning experience and benefits and oppurtunities are good it's a very fast pace environment which i like,"
good,Daily routine on conveyor and carts. some welding and basic hand tools. Bosses were great but was laid off abruptly with no warning at all and right after Christmas when moneys needed the most
good,An excellent pace to work. Had great experience working with HR Hiring team. Good working conditions. Induction was good and colleagues were all nice.
good,"- overall the job is stress free"
good,a very friendly work place management sucks though the works is very easy a typical day at amazon laughter sometimes anger behind no communication within the managers and the workers
good,i have enjoyed the 3 years i have been employed and everyday was a fresh challenge and there was always something new to learn to do. management was very fair and approachable. workplace culture was one of hard work and playing hard.
good,Amazon was a ok place to work for I just didn't like how management was running things at the place I worked at things could have been so much better.
good,"Best part of working at Amazon is learning opportunities.  It's also very good if you want to move across divisions. If you're a good performer, you are encouraged to learn many different parts of the business.  "
good,Great place to work but when you do extra work labor you should be compensated for working and learning new trade. Working 10hrs a day for four days a week isn’t so bad either.
good,Learn how to ship the product i would stand on a line for 10 hours has prodct came to me i would pack the product put shipping lable on box put back on the line
good,Not bad as far as retail goes.  If you have never done retail this will be an adjustment.  Hours are long but nothing out of the ordinary.  Lots of opportunity.
good,"Amazon pushes you to your limit and expects you to work faster after going fast but they want to push you . Amazon is slavery ! They get mad when people slow down , when they take a short break to catch air , they push you until you can't go no more"
good,"Amazon is a good company to work at, there’s a lot of different opportunities that will come your way. There are so many very different outlets to choice from."
good,"The pay was good, mandatory breaks were reliable and management was nice and understanding. Really hard on the body, physically, but the benefits of getting stronger are worth it."
good,"Fast paced.  It seemed that management tried to meet the needs of the workers in providing a good work environment and salary. "
good,Fast- paced environment. Interaction with a lot of people from various backgrounds. Compensated fairly for a day's work.Flexible in and out times. Great company.
good,"same competitive faced paced job scanning items that come down shoot, put in the correct pallet, and wrap the pallet and pallet jack and bring to destination"
good,I enjoy  working for amazon. I just don't feel like I am  reaching my full potential  as i do the same thing over and over . I don't have a full drivers licence and that makes it a difficult to get to work .
good,"You start off with goals and deadlines, but once you are used to them they quickly become easy to attain.  Afterwards you develop relationships with your co-workers that make the days less stressful.  The management is not as experienced as you would hope, but they do help you attain your goals rather than punish you immediately.  The culture shifts drastically from department to department giving you either a fast pace to make the days go quickly or a collaborative experience that allows a more personal interaction with those you are working for.  Through all of it you'll be busy, learn how to do things efficiently and help Amazon.com's customers get their packages in one piece and on time.  In the end an overall good experience with great benefits for just about anyone who can keep an overall view of the place in mind."
good,"Amazon is a great company to work for. The time zone is different when accepting your schedule.  I did learn how to provide excellent customer service. Management is great, the only thing is you have to make sure a customer requested to be escalated to management before transferring the customer to management. The hardest part is pleasing some customers."
good,"A day begins at 7:00 AM. After performing certain procedures drivers load out the van out of station. There are 120-130 packages each day which consist of 80-115 stops. some time day last till 6:00 PM. so by the time I reach station, it is 7:00 PM when the day ends."
good,"Ce travail est très intéressant, de la réception à l'envoie des articles, on apprend beaucoup. Amazon vous forment a tout les postes de manutention au seins de l'entreprise et les manager sont a l'écoute des employés."
good,"I've been there a long time but I had to leave due to the fact I had child care issues and my daughter needed me, I wish they were closer to where I lived when I was still living  in Philadelphia"
good,"Not a bad place to work. Nice if you like to stop."
good,"My typical day would start at 6:30pm with huddle and stretching and job assignments. I was amazed on all the new technology that is used to make sure someones order is delivered on time. Also the individuals that managed me also wanted me to succeed and helped me in every aspect on my job. The atmosphere and the culture was way above anywhere else I have worked at it was awesome. The hardest thing about my job was my body getting used to fast pace of my job, but once it did I was fine. The best part I enjoyed was the karaoke in the break rooms."
good,This position requires dedication and hard work. It can be rewarding when you understand how the system works but it's a little difficult to get in contact with HR.
good,"Amazon is a good place to grow, and one of the best companies to work for. The management is competent and is making the best to create a nice work environment."
good,Great place to work and if given the opportunity I would come back since the environment here supports your development and different paths to transfer into.
good,The hardest part was walking all day. I enjoyed work by myself. every kind of culture. Big place for lunch and bathroom. I learned new things everyday.
good,Nice place to work and learned a lot from this company. Very good work environment and pick and drop facilities are available.Facilities provided by this company is very good
good,"it was a fast peace environment.  I enjoyed working there at the time. Ive learned how to work as a team leader, also how to communicate with my team or better outcome. Most challenge i had at amazon was peak season, longer hrs and way more boxes."
good,Kept coming back even though I was a Shift manager got laid off. Still enjoyed working here. If I could be hired on full time I would probably stay in this position.
good,"Ich habe im Team so gearbeitet, dass Team-Verantwortung und Rolle des Einzelnen sehr gut bekannt sind. Lernte die Arbeitskultur von Operationen. Arbeitete unter Druck."
good,"If you are a college student looking to build up your bank account between semesters, this is the job for you. Long hours and lots of overtime, but that means more money. I personally could not see myself making a living out of the job, but in my 4 summers' worth of working there, many of my coworkers have easily climbed the ladder and become cross trained in various departments/processes, which is nice because the workday can get pretty boring if they have you doing the same thing all day. Culture-wise you truly feel like you are part of a team primarily focused on the customer. Management between various departments always seem to be on separate pages, made prevalent by the lack of communication. Overall, working in an Amazon Fulfillment Center is a great experience for people looking to gain work experience or temporary employment, able to work well in a fast-paced environment (and boy is it fast paced!), and work between 40-50 hours a week (they always seem to have overtime, whether it be mandatory or voluntary)."
good,"I worked 4 days at week 10 hours daily my duties were check the inventory, check for damages, missing items. I learned how to see really quickly what is wrong and resolved the problem. the hardest part of my job was the stairs because my knee. the most enjoyable part in this job was when we stared working because we stretch, we have the time to tell our boss what do you think about everything in the department (ICQA) and in the company in general."
good,I liked working at amazon. The way things where done could have been done a little bit better. The people I worked with really maid things fun. Management was good but should have given more awards for excelling in there field a little more.
good,Fast paced environment but great opportunities to advance. The work schedule is great because you work only one weekend and instead you have 2 week days to take care of appointments or whatever chores you have.
good,Its a great place to work at with the benefits and the payout. Only thing is if not use to walking that long it would get to you at times. I wish the time you go in and clock out change
good,It make people feel the same we all have same work experiance but there different ones that we can work from but all treated faor if a worker dont eat pork they have both or just one so all can eat but work periods are the same or different.
good,"nice place to work, stay busy, great people, learn many things, good team structure. Most enjoyable was the good people nice workplace good benefits from day of hire"
good,"Day available -tuesday(morning , evening shift)"
good,"Working at Amazon generally is fun. Each day I mostly had a variety of roles which I liked. At times, it can be either dull or stressful, depends on what area you're working in that day. The people were nice, nobody really was negative or hurtful. I enjoyed pushing myself during those times when there was a lot of boxes/packages coming in and it made me feel good about myself that I was able to push on through and giving it my all. Although, sometimes I felt like the shift would go on forever, especially during those dull moments. But, yeah overall I had a good time and maybe I'd consider working there again."
good,"Amazon is just an average warehouse job that requires you to stow products and put them away. As well as packing, picking and receiving. It makes you feel comfortable to work and there are benefits included."
good,Was a good job when I was going to school. Taught me skills I could use in normal everyday life as well. Had great benefits for healthcare and stock options.
good,"Amazon is fun to work at but your legs and feet start to hurt after a bit as your standing from start to finish until you go on break and can have a sit down."
good,Good place to work.  The work is very fast paced especially during winter holiday.  Always have work to do and have the opportunity to try different things.
good,"Very Fast Paced Organization, Physical work. Company tries to keep things fun and provides incentives for high performance. Performance driven culture."
good,There is a lot of physical work and the breaks are pretty short. The good part was we worked four days a week. The breaks were split up to two fifteen minute breaks and a thirty minute lunch break through the 10 hour shift.
good,"Standup meeting each shift, production work, great employees to work with, sufficient breaks and lunch, potential to learn more skills, promote within. Managers are concerned and interested in their employees, go the extra mile to be supportive in and outside of work."
good,It is very hard work and very tiring but the pay is good and the people are nice. They give you hours of paid and unpaid time off and also they give you all the required breaks.
good,Bonne ambiance de travail et un travail trés physique.
good,"At amazon is really easy to make friends, your tasks are not even bad. It is a relaxed place to work at. Most of the managers and people in charge are extremely fun to be around."
good,"One thing I liked about this job was that some days we would be super relaxed and other days it was like the customers were challenging us to see if we could actually get the order to them in an hour. while the job was at times very demanding, the environment was kept light, making the job much funner."
good,"Amazon is a great place to work, if you like physical work, that is the place to go, management is great, the schedules are so flexible you can work around your lifestyle with it or if your looking for another job Amazon has shifts that work around your schedule."
good,"Amazon is a great place to work. If you are looking for a place that offers a world of challenges then Amazon is the company to work for and anyone looking to advance in life with a rewarding career, Amazon is the place."
good,There are many areas you could focus your attention on. If you know off the bat what you are really interested ask to spend time with those teams. If you are not sure then they are open to letting you nest with different groups to see what you really like.
good,MY time at Amazon is fun there is always something going on that has to be completed. If you like the pressure of deadlines this is the place. I would recommend trying this place out.
good,"This was a great place to work and was easy to complete tasks stay focused received positive feedback daily"
good,"une entreprise axé sur la cohésion d'équipe, la sécurité au travail et sur l'engagement personnel."
good,"Environment that require fast pace and working together as team of 14-20 people. Challenge another associate and self  to make production at 100% by making a little fun game ""like who ever do not make rate has to buy lunch""."
good,Meeting everyday before the work day began from Management to provide any changes or updates to the daily work flow. Received guidance to perform new duties effeciently.
good,"I liked the idea of working for Amazon. It seemed like a cool place to work. But, If you aren't apart of certain cliques you wouldn't advance in the company. I do not have blue hair nor do I wear house shoes to work. I just wanted to judged by my own merit."
good,"Práce je náročná někdy na nervi,hekticka, stálý shon."
good,"This was a fast paced environment. A typical day at work would be clocking in, meet with assigned positions to hear the news for day. The culture is like a family. Everybody works hard and stays on task."
good,"I really enjoyed working there, coworkers were fun to work with. The pay was pretty good for the required work I was doing. Good work hours, great benefits."
good,Amazon is very mostly Pvt Ltd company and the company associat is security power and the short center associat no money problem for the job of Amazon company.
good,"The whole staff is good .I wanna work there more.But their way to end my agreement without any reason was not good seem to me. My overall rating was good.But they end my agreement because we were new there.Their way to end agreement was a kind of disrespectful as we need their for bread and butter, not they need us.Once their need was fill amd after that they end us directly."
good,this was a nice place to work but I don't think it the right for me since I'm going to school and have a three-month-year-old baby boy. but other than that the pay is really good
good,a great place to work for if you like to work in a fast paced environment bosses and coworker were always willing to give you a hand on any given situation
good,"Management flexible with schedule"
good,"Fast pace environment and crowded places, but I enjoyed working there. management was okay and a lot of favoritism  only way to move up is to get good whit the boss or know someone higher up"
good,"Had spent a very lil time here as an intern, but hv the best of experience."
good,Many great people in the company. Both associates and managers. efficiency is key in everything. Sometimes this impacts negatively on the experience of employees.
good,"Overall  good place to work, great team atmsophere, chance for advancement and learn other departments, rewards for hard work, good time off program, great breakrooms"
good,"The hardest part of the job, for the most part, was keeping up with rate personally I found at times that their system was not at all an accurate representation of the work you put during your hours"
good,"Overall good experience and management and culture, HR team is too supportive and other departments like Admin, recruitment, facility, C&B, training & quality is working like a team"
good,The work is simple. Taxing on the body if your not in shape.  This is indeed a fast pace environment where you can always find something to do.The pay could be better but there is a lot of potential growth through the company.
good,Working at amazon for it's almost like going to workout. The level of competition is productive and the team work is concrete. It's as real as being part of soccer team or a football team.
good,I like working at Amazon because it is not hard to do but it is busy work and makes the time go by fast. I think the breaks are set up at the right times. It helps with the long hours.
good,"I loved working at ONT9, Everyone was so fun. We all worked together in a team without leaving anyone out. I believe warehousing is a fun and easy Job if you want to have steady income."
good,it was great but I was a seasonal job. I had to put customers boxes of their orders on pallets that will be taking to their orders.  I liked making the pallets look good so they ready to ship out to the customers.
good,"All different with the passion I've though still gave good opportunity to learn new things. Interaction with different people made it more adventurous and fun. Worked as hard I could, but it's always recommended to look for better opportunities and keep ready for further challenges."
good,"really enjoyed this work experience.from the associates to the managers ,this was a very productive work enviorment.The only issue I had was with the integrity of the management from a moralistic standpoint."
good,"very quick paced. long days, long weekends. opportunity to cross train and move up in responsibilities quickly. I love my time there but the holiday season is a real crunch"
good,Amazon is a fast paced environment job which has too many managers are placed in an area that they do not have experience. Money is decent but pit driver deserve to get paid more.
good,It is a very stressful job for me because you have to work at a fast pace. It is competitive and the supervisors will be o. Your neck always. You feel terrible after your first two to three weeks then you start getting used to it. I don't wanna be part of that anymore.
good,Constant lifting and placing of boxes. Very straight forward. Either you keep up or u don't  (which is monitored). Full time was only available to management
good,"Cool to work from home, hire wage needed to increase but the company culture was great, alot of help when needed and support from various people. Team environment"
good,"When I initially applied at Amazon, I did not do so expecting to make a career out of it. I had recently given birth to my son and my job at the time was not accommodating to me being able to continue to breastfeed once I returned from maternity leave. I researched the best companies for nursing mothers and Amazon was one of them. A warehouse had recently been built where I lived so I applied and got hired. I was able to choose my shift (4-day work-week, 10 hours a day) of Mon-Thurs nights. It worked for mine and my husband's lifestyle with a newborn. Amazon has a Mother's Room on-site specifically for nursing mothers and you can use it when it's convenient for you. You can also earn PTO and use whenever you want. The work tends to be repetitive, but it's not hard to do. I liked my managers (had about 3-4 during my 8 months). I considered staying, but ended up finding a higher paying Mon-Fri 1st shift job that was better for my growing family. I enjoyed my experience there and would recommend it to others, whether you're just passing through or looking to make it a career."
good,Its not a bad place to work the pay is worth it only thing that will get to you is the 10 hours shifts and being on your feet a lot other than that i think amazon is wonderful company to work for
good,Work is laid back. The pay is good. Management is fair. There really isn't anything hard about the job. I would tell many people to apply. It could be fun working in amazon. They really give you a lot of time options for time off. There's no other better place to work at. Amazon is number 1.
good,Well it’s not a bad place to work but you gotta be determined to get your targets done or your gone so make sure you got a fresh head for this job okay
good,"amazon is a fun productive work place where work gets done anywhere and everywhere you turn. A typical day of work starts with a team meeting, boss explains what we need to do and what we've done the previous day. A time for encouragement and safety reminders."
good,I have had an excellent time working at Amazon since I started there. The pay could be a little better but I guess it is typical for this type of work.
good,It Was a very smooth job and very easy.Everyday was something different but i enjoyed it and my coworkers was awasome we just needed longer hours and breaks
good,This is a fun place to work. I have learned a lot from here and the have sent me to other states to help open up new Facilities. It is always a new challenge when I walk though that door but it is always exciting.
good,good place to work for. good management.good pay . training and too much test must be done in 2 weeks. I learned how to maintain the machniches tag out/ lock out
good,"gutes Arbeitsklima. "

good,"Work Hard Have Fun Make History"
good,It is great at Amazon. There is nothing else to talk about. Anyone who is interested in working at Amazon has to try it for themselves because their experience would definitely be different from mine due to preferential differences.
good,High energy workplace that is accommodating but also a no- nonsense environment that rewards productivity. Physically demanding. Provides great benefits and promotes independence and accountability.
good,".Great place to work. Customer centric approach towards work, offers satisfactory work life balance. Yearly appraisals ad related hike has scope for improvement."
good,Job was decent in order to be an Amazon Associate you must be able to stand on your feet and move around all day for 10 hr if you are full time. You get 2 breaks a day and must make rate.
good,Repetitive daily functions with limited room for errors due to simple tasks. Break schedules were given so that strenuous work did not seem to last too long.
good,"I am really happy here. I love that we are given the independence to make our own decisions for customer queries. Tension free environment, opportunity for growth. HR department very efficient."
good,"There was equal opportunity among all worker at Amazon more specially the clocking system at Amazon it always make you to be on time. We have a very clear breaks room nice toilet that were always take care off, very clean building that people will alway like to work in."
good,"Ive been working for amazon for about 4 month till now.Payment was verry good, 40 hours per week/4 days + overtimes.Its been awesome but its hard to get a contract with them cause a lot of places are already busy so you dont have alot of chances other then that amazon was good."
good,Nice job to know about area...best experience.. nice way of talking with customers.. best delivery boy.. and learned about office work also.. I got best recognised...
good,"Amazon has great benefits and competitive pay. Although it’s lots of standing, lifting and walking this is a job where you won’t have to worry wether or not your getting enough hours. There tends to be lots of overtime especially during peak season."
good,at amazon I would pick and pack customers orders. I would go and look for the items they wanted and scan them then I would pack the order and ship it out. I liked this job because it was fun and something different.
good,It is pleasure working here but only the concern is growth as i have done my MBA in marketing and believe the growth in my career is not appropriate . My job role is not satisfying me as i need to grow in my career . I need to learn new things . Every organization has pros and cons I have learn a lot but I am unable to diversify my talent and skills .I think i am not doing justice to myself i can explore a lot .
good,"It was good for just a temporary job, salary was good, The environment was good, just the lack of management made it kind of hard to move around, Overall it was a nice experience"
good,"Be ready to work fast and in sometimes stressful situations. Create and organize a plan to get your work completed daily, and make your shift easy and productive. You receive paid time off, unpaid time off, and vacation, all build up the more you work. The management teams reward you after certain busy peaks of the year. Peak season during November-December is extremely busy, so be ready to work either 12 hour shifts, or 5 days of 10 hours. If you keep the job fun and simple for yourself, you'll be fine. Everyone that works there is on the same page as you. Also, be ready to be on your feet for 10+ hours daily, and make sure to drink plenty of water."
good,This is a great place to learn good work ethics as well as how to maintain a positive attitude in such a high volume field. The hardest part is being able to constantly beat your quota.
good,"I enjoyed working in the ICQA department at Amazon. Never boring, trained in many areas including customer returns, amnesty, damage control and others. "
good,"This building was always busy, fast and active place. Safety was very important to our manager. Everybody had to be on time, you only get two chance to be late and our job on the line."
good,"We get to learn a lot of things on the job. It really depends on the individual employees to maintain the work-life balance.Amazon encourages people to understand themselves and really work hard to their potentials. Also, the Leadership principles are so beautiful and encourages to the generation to thing Big."
good,Enjoyed my time there. Fast pace work environment. Packed during holiday times. Met alot of people from all over. I did have to commute 1hr each day but they did fix the traffic jam issues
good,This job is hard and I would not recommend it to someone who wants and easy job. They do however pay really good and although I was just seasonal from talking to others they handed out raises pretty often.
good,was fun and I would work there again because its pretty easy straight forward and you will get use to it really  quickly and it is really easy in my opinnon
good,fast paced environment with a busy workload. Managers tend to be cool as long as you keep up your standards. Hours are very flexible and make it an awesome PT gig.
good,"Stock any and items according to available shelving and area assigned to with a  handheld go in scanner system. Be ablt to identify scanner codes and their meanings, Help others among the way, daily exercises and physical exaserperations through shift and break change, Walk up to 5 miles and bend an stand often."
good,"Working for the biggest online retailer in the world does has it challenges. And at time the work life balance can be a issue, but the experience has been invaluable. Within the Amazon culture the customer is at the forefront of all decisions and the effect these decisions will have on the customer experience and I have really enjoyed my time in helping to deliver this experience.The Outbound operation is key and at times the challenges can be daunting, but the culture within the company is strong where associate engagement and teamwork are also key in delivering the success. I am team player and my motivation is seeing the team develop and I am proud to have been part of the growth and success which Amazon now enjoys."
good,fast paced job. on your feet job at all times. clean environment . secured place. lot of people doing peak season. get there early for good parking spot
good,"While my time there was short, I feel as though Amazon is an excellent stepping stone for workers. While it may be demanding, it proved to be financially fruitful. It was a physically tasking job, due to being required to constantly moving around in a fairly hectic environment. The hardest part of working there were the long shifts which would gradually wear on you. Management went out of their way to ensure associates were properly trained in all areas of work, however. Meeting new people and learning new things to better my worth ethic proved to be fruitful in the long run."
good,They have a lot of good benefit to help all their employees such as bus passes and paid babysitting programs. 2 I didn't think much other companies have.
good,Amazon is a very flexible company that tailors your life around the work schedule. You will have the ability to learn various jobs to help promote your career.
good,a typical day at work is just scanning boxes. I didn't learn anything new as yet because I do the same thing every day. The hardest part of my job is lifting heavy boxes and the after effect of being there all day
good,I was in ICQA and it was defiantly fast paced but VERY easy work. I loved the break rooms because of all the food and snacks and free coffee and water.
good,"typical day is fast paced but safe"

good,This was an amazing job until the warehouse closed down. So it was back to grind finding something new...................................................

good,This warehouse is competitive place to work . You are on rate so therefore you have make a certain amount rate done before your week is over. Great pay and benefits also.
good,"I manage the inventory of the inbound trucks and login pertinent information into the database.  I have learned the basic skills of logistics,  Management is down to earth with an open door policy, but could change the dynamic of the atmosphere by having more confidence in the skills of the employees instead of engaging in micromanaging. The workplace culture is very diverse which allows you to work with individuals from different areas of the world.  The hardest part of the job is the yard driving training which consisted of backing in the trailers for docking.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the team in which I work."
good,assisted with a variety of duties.  Performed patient rotations and rounds. assisted with development of medication safety regimens and monitoring guidelines
good,overall a great place to work. had wonderful coworkers and work environment. Supervisor was always available and helpful. nice incentives during quarterly reviews.
good,I really enjoy working at amazon. i get along with my co workers and we thrive to get things done. the managers are okay there are tweaks in the system that need to be worked out but overall everything runs smooth. the hardest part about the job is standing all day your legs and feet hurt.

good,"very stressful at first but came to be enjoyable. but everything else was okay. There was a kitchen, they had coffee machines set up. You could work long hours and have a lot of days off wwhich is very good if you are a student,"
good,"Amazon has many different positions that have different functions. working for Amazon in the past as a picker was fast paced exciting work that kept me moving, but working for Amazon as a stower, made me never want to work as a stower again, mainly because I stood in one aisle for at least an hour trying to find space to put things. Time just felt slower and not at all like picking."
good,"Good employer, good benefits, good opportunity to advance, travel opportunities, stock options, employer willing to assist in paying for further education in specific fields."
good,"Great place to work if you just want to go in, chat a little with co workers, get work done, and then go home. Everyone is pretty much in their own lane so no-one really gets in anyone's way. They have benefits and paid time off that can allocate over time just from working."
good,"Working at Amazon was a fun and educational experience.  I learned to work in a fast paced environment and with people from different cultures and ethnicities.  The best part about the job is seeing the process of receiving, processing, and fulfilling orders for customers.  The hardest part of the job would be keeping up with the fast pace, but with proper training you'll get used to it.  Everyone's job is essential to the major goal of providing the best service for their customers, so the culture is one suitable for anyone looking to work there."
good,"This job is cool. It provides a side income. Unless it's a full time position, I would not recommend it to anyone that is looking for a substantial source of money coming in. Amazing environment."
good,"not enough good work life balance, people go to work early at 9am, and many people leave work at 7:30 pm. Maybe it depends on the team you are on as well."

good,"Amazon was, overall, a good place to work and a enjoyed my time there very much. I would still be there if I would of been able to transfer to the New Castle location but since Middletown was such a great distance from me I decided to leave. However, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who was not afraid of a little hard work because they will compensate you if you do work hard."

good,Amazon is a great job for anyone willing to work hard. It provides opportunities for growth and learning for everyone. Amazon is a very fast paced environment.
good,"This is a great place to work. It is very quick paced which i personally love because it makes the day go by fast. We are getting VTO every day right now because the trucks can not get to us but other than that, when we have the work, it is a great place to work."
good,it was a good job becauze they could always find work for you in a another department if you didnt want to go home. also there was alot of interaction and making new friends.
good,"Very easy job, well at least the job that I did which included scanning, wrapping pallets, and moving pallets. You get to where whatever you want and schedules are very flexible."
good,Get paid $54 to deliver up to three hours worth of packages. You decide when you want to work. Make sure you have a car phone charger with you. You will need it.
good,Amazon is a diversit company fast working place long hours good pay with benefits paid vacation and sick time management are helpful they Movitave you
good,Phones aren't allowed understandably so for security purposes but working alone gets somewhat boring at some point. Would be nice if we had some form of entertainment such as allowing us to listen to music while we work makes the time go by fast.
good,Its a very friendly place to work in. The employees are very supportive. They help you in your betterment and growth in your career. Gives you the desired help.
good,"Not a bad place to work for a call center. They provide lots of training and resources to assist with your work. The customers can be difficult and trying, but that's how it goes."
good,"Amazon is a fun place to work at. If you're willing to relocate, there are tons of opportunities for advancement. They do a great job of promoting from within and promoting the hard workers."
good,Amazon probably offers the best working environment to any individual. There will be absolutely no pressure and the Managers are helpful. Every challenge becomes easy with the system being the best.
good,"While it is incredibly fast pace and a lot of physical work, it's a great place to work.  The people there are wonderful and the work itself is very easy to grasp.  If you can stand for a long time and lift consistently, it's a great job."
good,"Good Benefits and insurance (both vision, dental and normal health care)"
good,"Ideal place to work if you are a fresher."
good,"Amazon is great work place for beginners."
good,Looking for something that i like to enjoy. We all get paid the same. Even tho the loading team is more labor in the work we still get the dame as someone who doesnt do all at work.
good,night shift : half six to half four. learned to sort parcels . management all right. there were 20-30 nationalities in the same team. some of the parcels were hard to  sort . some of the parcels were easy to sort.
good,"I really enjoyed working at amazon nice place to work.  Amazon was my first experience with forklift and scissor lift which I was afraid of heights, but my manager helped me overcome that."
good,"I work in one of Amazon's data centers, so for me to advance my career within Amazon, I have to move.  Which is good as I don't particularly enjoy working in the Oregon desert.  (Work) life is laid back.  Almost no dress code - which is a huge plus.  By and large, as long as I get my work done, no one tries to tell me how to do my job.  It's just that after working here for 3 years, I need a new challenge.  That could either mean in a different job role within Amazon, or another company.  In spite of that last sentence, I would still highly recommend Amazon to someone as a place to work."
good,its a fast pace job with great benefits the only problem is u on your feet or walking all day if you want a job that will keep you in shape and make good money this is the perfect job for you i really like pack so if u guys ever get a chance to work pack try it its very competitive and fun to do and you get so many different items you didn't know exist
good,Typically spend 10hrs a day lifting and inspecting products before stowing them. They will teach you proper methods to lift heavier items and if needed may train you for different jobs such as a picker. The management is great they interact with you. The hardest part of the job was finding space for the bigger items. The most enjoying part of the job is meeting new people.
good,"If you're lucky to get in a with a good team and manager, you've got it made at Amazon.  I enjoyed my time there and felt I was compensated well and given a decent work/life balance."
good,"Good learning opportunities across multiple domains and teams, , Good focus on people engagement, development, workplace culture is fun oriented but work life balance is bit off"
good,"As a contract worker you may be asked to perform at the same level as fulltime employees and even go above and beyond to prove yourself, but you are definitely paid half the amount with no benefits. While that is understandable, the one thing they should provide contract employees is access to their transportation benefits. Getting to work in the city can be a huge hassle and Amazon provides a ton of services for their employees to get there, unfortunately they don't provide that to their green badges."
good,I go to work to work not to make friends but once in while it would be nice to talk there no time always on the go rate rate . We're stressed maki g sure we don't messed up and that we make out rate for the week . Our job is always on the line
good,"The company has a strong company of growth and opportunities.  You are rewarded for being flexible with new projects and being able to relocate.  It can be tough if you want to stay in the same place because opportunities can be limited within a location, but growth is very fast-paced and is exciting."
good,"As with any other potential employer, anyone considering applying to work for Amazon should first take the time to learn about its workplace culture.  It is definitely not for everyone."
good,"It nice working and meeting different people in the friendly environment like that. No serious challenges working there and spirit of oneness also played out , particularly if there is a job you alone cannot do, you called for assistance."
good,Management takes their time to help you out because they care about your success there. Amazon has many opportunities for advancement and they give you heads up on how you are doing.
good,It's was a great leaning experience and I would  recommend others to go to amazon. They pay good and you get a lot of  benefits. They only thing is you have to work hard.
good,"Buen ambiente,compañerismo,cafe gratis,trabajo facil y bien pagado pero se hace robotico al hacer siempre la misma tarea"
good,For the short time i worked at Amazon i thought it was a great work environment because employees had a lot of freedom to do their work and they definitely motivated us to do work.
good,"I worked 7am to 4pm daily, I took inbound calls as well as was trained for chat as well. I was Customer Service mostly helping customers with helping them late packages or lost packages."
good,In the beginning i was a lol lost due to all the thousands boxes and everything was a challenge knowing your quote and picks but after all the right ups u get passed all that and know your job
good,I was an intern and it was an awesome experience. I got to travel to their warehouses and those are filled with robots. It was cool to see how technology is improving our lives everyday.
good,"Amazon is a great place to work. I started at $13.50 as a full time employee with benefits starting day one. I've been here 2 months and have already moved up to Ambassador. Its a fast paced environment with a heavy work load and nonstop overtime but it pays the bills. Managers are friendly and work offers giveaways, and free food on ocassions. Especially peek time."
good,"Amazon Fulfillment is a great place to work. The work hours are fair and I really enjoy the benefits that Amazon provides that I haven't received from my previous jobs. I like the idea that I""m able to help people who have placed their orders on Amazon."
good,"I have been trained on many types of work within Amazon  Picking- Pack - Rebin - water Spider - pup Enjoyed my. time there because can do many different types of work,so i was not just doing one particular job but many other. Was trained in different rolls which was a advantage to me"
good,This was a great company to work for very upbeat willing to help and make sure you are trained to be advanced in to Amazon if completed with training.
good,"A typical day at work will be 10 or 11 hours, but it will go by fast. The working environment is very safe but can be loud at some points. I enjoy that I am able to meet new co-workers every day and every one there is friendly."
good,the day are shorts and it a fast pace job so you need to know how to keep a steady pace and need to know how to change it on some days like Christmas have to ware gloves
good,"Always running & always making rates, cant leave your station to go to the restroom without telling the managers because they will put you on time off task & they wont care unless the managers like you so you ca get away with it"
good,"Enjoyed everything in Amazon, Culture is amazing , Learnt a lot in amazon, Great work culture, Hardest part of the job has become stagnant , the freedom"
good,"Working for amazon was not a bad job at all, the only and main problem I had was being home all day. I mean it saves gas and a lot of money you'll be spending on food if you don't work from home. But it was just very draining"
good,"I absolutely loved working for amazon only reason I left was personal reasons at home... They were laid back and well put together, very fast paced especially during peak"
good,"Great job,  great people but just not enough benefits and  hours,  pay is great.   can use a new ice machine and more beverages to stay hydrated during work"
good,"Good company to work for. I just did not want to work full time at the time, I needed to take care of my mother at the time they wanted me to work full time"
good,"Rushed training, last minute coordination. Job culture is number one, though! Supervisors were very understanding, but not always knowledgeable. Agents were thrown into the water and told to ask for help when needed, rather than adequate training."
good,"Enjoy the work and company culture.The professional associates strive to get the job done. It can be really physical but, that can be to your advantage."
good,"A day at work entails completing the tasks assigned. You learn to get along with people of all different cultures."
good,"It is a nice place to work, but specificly my department it was not my perfect place, as the progression it is not what I am looking for (it is difficult to progress also)"
good,"Fun workplace and great benefits but stressful hard work.  See comments pros and cons. The pros are cafeteria w/food to purchase, Good Managers, Positive Motivating Culture, Good Pay for type work, Equality & Fairness, plenty of hours, excellent benefits, two 15 min breaks.  Cons are Lunch is 30 min and long walk to cafeteria and back takes 10 min at least of lunch time, can't bring cell phone on floor,  have to make numbers or written up, strict w/time clock in/out/time off"
good,Ive never been one for competition but it grows on you.  Love the benefits and definitely love the diversity in the work place.  Great place to work for if your looking for growth and promotion its available along with great pay.
good,"Amazon Warehouse - the production requirements are acceptable and easy to maintain with adequate effort. Benefits are great, advancement is obtainable with in house promotions. Peak time is a lot of Overtime Hours but paid well enough."
good,I like the people that work there. You have a wide range of employee's. It was good to learn as much as I could. Wish the pay was better for the work.
good,The building was made so employees could relax from stressful calls. You are on call nearly non stop during the day. but you do get relaxing breaks...
good,It was a decent job until I got injured and my rate started going down to the point i was getting in trouble everyday. It was always hot when you were on the third and fourth floors and the restrooms were in the most inconvenient places especially when you were on a time limit on everything.
good,"i enjoyed working at amazon very much sad it was only a temporary Christmas job wold of stayed on i i was asked, targets are easy to reach and staff are easy to get along with."
good,I have learned a lot working here and only wish it was longer. Breaks were always at a good time and just long enough to stretch out for our next few hours.
good,"Pay On Time, Nice place to work, Great with working around your schedule. Nice HR Staff. I would go back to this job if I did not live so far away from the plant."
good,"Amazon is one of the best ware house u can work."
good,"Amazon is a fun place to work and gives many opportunities to move up in the company. Promised hours and good benefits. Great company to work for, they are always good about reaching out to their employees to find out what they can do to give you a better work environment."
good,"Diverse workplace, learned a general overview on the outbound packing department, management was friendly, Amazon associates were provided with fair benefits"
good,There is lot of competition internally. Everyone works long hours. Teams are really good and you will learn a lot here. Dogs are allowed here as well which is really good.
good,"A typical day was to pack and ship orders out as fast as you can. I learned to be very accurate to fill each order complete. Management I seen was very fair and helped in addressing any issues that would arise. The work place culture was very interesting. I met people from all walks of life. Some were very good workers and some very slow and not willing to keep up with others. I enjoyed every department I was assigned to, I am always up for a challenge to learn different jobs."
good,"Super easy to get in once you get an interview, after that it's up to you if they keep you or not depending on your performance and speed. The job is very easy but very boring. If you began to lose track of what you are doing you might possibly make mistakes so you must stay focused. You can be faster than your scanner so it becomes tedious when you have to be fast, yet wait for your scanner to catch up. I know a lot of people complain about the job but it truly gives you the opportunity to grow. They offer incentives, health insurance after 90 days, help with tuition for school, mock interviews, Etc"
good,"my first step into the corporate worl with the E - commerce Giant Amazon is a very good and an enriching experience .Gained alot of expertise and skills like vendor management and applied project management skills on ground , It gave me a sound platform to take part in lat mile operations and aim at complete customer satisfaction"
good,Good place to work .. Excellent Interview process . Results  will be announced immediately . Fun to work environment . Salary good .. Other benefits are excellent .

good,Mi experiencia en amazon fue buena muy buen trato con la gente pero ahora mismo no están haciendo a gente de empresa
good,"Fast pace buf of all the fulfillment centers Lexingtons Hr team was the best.   Does need more bathrooms. "
good,If you can make the requested rates you will have no problem at amazon. The management is very helpful on making sure you can succeed at your job.  I enjoy that if your a high performer management will reward and recognize it. Altho to be a high performer it will be physically demanding. The random overtime can be overwhelming as well.
good,Great place if you like challenges and can work at an extremely fast pace. Great for singles or young couples but can be a challenge if you have kids.
good,loved working here. the people around the workplace were great. great pay and benefits . guaranteed hours . very competitive and hard to make weekly rate goals.
good,I feel amazon is a good place to work if you like being busy. I have learned a new system in a  new field of work. The people are easy  to work with and are willing to help. I like it so much I'm trying to return to work there plus the wages are good.
good,it was a hard workplace your constantly working but it kept me motivate and always kept my mind occupied and taught me the meaning of hard work. i loved my job.
good,Amazon a cool job to work at only to work you like a slave but besides that the money is great . If your rate not up to speed they will end up giving you write ups than they end up terminating you just for your rate.
good,Enjoyed working here. Nothing to it I was a picker so I jus picked orders to be shipped no telling what u will pick they have everything. Its alot of people sometimes can be difficult to move around but thats really during peek season which is mainly during holiday season.
good,"Możliwość awansu, dobre zarobki na początek, miła atmosfera pracy"
good,If you are looking for a fast paced environment and no stress to bring home with you this is your job. It is a work out without having to go to a gym. They offer gifts and prizes for a great performance
good,"Work is great and easy to learn. It can get a bit hectic schedule wise due to a lot of overtimes and peak season, but the pay is so great along with day 1 benefits, you will want to stay for the long haul. You will meet a lot of people some will stay some will go, then replaced by more new recruits. Just come to work and be productive is all they ask for."
good,"Amazon is cool place to work at. I got to learn a lot, Amazon is very fast passed, up beat and high energy. hard part is making quota when you are tired or sick."
good,"A typical day at work is fast paced and always something to do."
good,I love the fact that we do exercises before we start working...pay is good the only complaint is that we have short time to eat...in there you walk a lot since I think it's ok help you out to be in shape...it was a temporary job I was sad when they let me go but I had fun
good,"Providing Amazon sellers support by responding to their queries, resolving any issues by interacting with other departments via emails."
good,"Great work environment.Treat employees with the utmost respect. rewarding, good pay room for growth.Very fast paced  place to work. Self rewarding and fulfilling."
good,Best company to work with and also have fun while working. Good growth career and very good guidance from senior staff. Builds you as a professional from inside out.
good,I liked working at amazon.  I learned a lot while working their.  I also miss driving the forklifts.  I've attempted to work at other warehouses but none of them are as big on safety as Amazon was.
good,It is a fast paced environment and you get to meet many different people. The managers I had were very good and reliable. The hardest part of the job was when someone left and moved on because you can become very close to people working in the warehouse.
good,"I liked working at amazon, aside from the long hours I really enjoyed customer returns. Some items were huge and awkard to handle, but as long as you took your time and followed safety precautions you would do just fine. My bosses were alright as long as you stayed on the line and meet your rate and time they would do complement you and promote you. I would really to go back and cant wait to."
good,great place to work ; unloading loading sorting / packaging ; benefits dental health ; you will get your 40 hours plus overtime .  management treats you well
good,"Working for Amazon is one the best things happened to me. As the company's quote says ""earth's most customer centric company"", for me it is also employees centric company."
good,"Overall job is great, welcoming atmosphere. The hiring transition is smooth. New Hires go through intensive training to prepare for the long term experience. Management is great and welcoming, always around to assist. Team work is valued, pay is great. I personally did not sign up for the benefits but I have heard nothing but good news about that as well."
good,"Other than your feet and back killing you after 10hrs, its a nice place to work. The culture is nice and management as well. Benefits are awesome pay could be better."
good,Great experience working for amazon. Great leadership and really enjoyed working there. Meeting new people and learning new skills was part of every day.
good,being here you have to be upbeat ready to work. the hardest part of the job is the length of ta shift especially during the peak seasons. the easiest part is getting to know the associates alongside you.
good,Pretty easy job is you know to talk to people.Nothing too hard. Can get busy at times but it was easy work helping people look for their packages. Would reapply here.
good,"Amazon.com is an awesome place to work. Except you're are not ready to advance in your field, it forces you to and encourages you to. Apart from that, the remunerations package are quite encouraging"
good,"My project experience with Amazon was amazing, though I highly recommend them to update their hiring process as a culture fit is perceived by the interviewer may not be the best way to look at future leaders"
good,"I've been working there for a while now. I love the fast pace that everyone has to be on , the break room is awesome free coffee free tea. Its like a second home."
good,Working at amazon is really cool there many things to learn there. They have trading for forklifts and center riders. They have very good benefits and time off.
good,"Very great place to work with opportunity for growth in the company, but management rotates every few months and leaves great associates with a impossible chance to move up in the company."
good,Team work is a very important while working at the warehouse. My fellow associates were very productive and quick while multitasking. Every day we hit our shipment goals to make our customers happy. Amazon is a very huge workplace and obtains a gradually friendly community.
good,I was a night person and the front half of the week so i got to enjoy having Friday and Saturday most of the time with options to work it came often and depending on which department you were in it would always be a good challenge to meet the days goals.
good,"I considere my self as a productive  person  and hard worker, I work as a teacher  teaching mathematics and spanish, as warehouse associate in pack, sort and picking department."
good,"The warehouse might be a very large building, but because of the hundreds of pickers and stowers, the one-way aisles, and operating limitations of the machines, the work day is frustrating and not efficient."
good,"- shift changes every 2-3 mongths"
good,"This was also another place that I worked at before moving into town to start the new school year. It was also for a short period of time., and I knew I wouldn't be there too long."
good,"Good work environment, Great support by Managers. Learned many things such as how to be productive, managing time, interaction with colleagues. Amazon gave many opportunities. One for example where your manager shadow you to learn the pain points of associates, which were like a moment of truth for us, and they would implement required changes."
good,"Amazon is a really great job if you're actually willing to do the work thats assigned to you. It got painful,but I enjoyed my time there with my fellow employees and managers!"
good,"Responsable,puntual aprender día a día ....y busco un trabajo estable y serio"
good,"At Amazon on a normal day, you are expected to arrive on time and with a positive attitude. Once you clock in for your work day, you start your day with a group meeting with your department to talk about your goals for your day and to receive any special messages. You then take a few minutes to do some stretching then it is off with your day. "
good,Mon avis sur amazon est que le travail est bien mais ils en demande beaucoup trop pour le peu que nous somme indemniser.
good,"Each day we'll get a packet of orders to pull out, there were 10 pages in each packet we had to knock a packet every hour. Each page contained 10 sections to go to. The employees there were fun and outgoing the job was pretty easy but it was non stop picking and pulling."
good,"Long days starting from 7:30am - 6:00pm "
good,"There is a great working environment with good pay. Amazon employees have great benefits, as an integrity associate it is a little more challenging. The job is not secure if working with integrity."
good,"I have a scanner with information that tells me where to go and what to look for. Once i find the item i scan it and place it in my tote. I do this for 10 hours a day. Management isn't really seen around the warehouse much but they are helpful when needed. The hardest part would probably be working from 6:30 pm to 5 am. The most enjoyable i would have to say is knowing what to expect throughout the shift, however i do enjoy a challenge."
good,"Working at Amazon is very Interesting, it provide a relax atmosphere; There are many great opportunity for advancement."
good,"Everyday was a new day at Amazon. I didn't know what I was going to do when I walked through the doors. I had a lot of fun and it gave everyone the opportunity to be apart of a team. Management was always changing,"

good,"Amazon is a good company which tries to do big, innovative things which are not easy as well."
good,"While there is ample opportunity for movement within the warehouse, you must be motivated to go above and beyond your current position. The management pushes you to be your best. I was able to learn skills that are transferrable to other departments. The hardest part of the job is, at times, meeting your rate.  The management really cares about working with and not against the associates."
good,"The company is good to work with. The company culture is cordial and perfect. The managers, coming from the same background(Mostly), are fun too work with.Fr"
good,"I only spent a short time at Amazon for the holiday season. During my time there, I had the most trouble with hours. It was my first job and we started out at 10 hours a day, 6 days a week. On top of that, it was a rotating schedule that changed weekly."
good,It's a pretty easy job. I just picked packages and scanned them. The breaks are for a decent amount of time and the pay is really good. Its a very warm environment because there's no AC but there are large fans and areas for water.
good,"Working in shipping and receiving, stowing and stocking at a quick pace was challenging and fun. You have to turn around and go in path to complete customers orders for delivery. Always adhering to quality assurance for customers and safe work environment policies... Very exciting work culture where all members are committed to positive change through problem solving. You were recognized for your contributions.."
good,"Always ensures employee satisfaction."
good,"fast passed "
good,Had fun working here. Shifts were easy to go through. Did overtime quite often. Had cab services on time. The company had better job culture. Growth in the company was the point to be noticed.
good,this job requires a lot of walking and close toed shoe. on any given day you will walk 10 miles. the temperatures are very hot during the summer. so dress accordingly
good,Amazon really helps their workers excel when it comes to showing them how to do the job and what the job entitles. Even though it is a time consuming job it is also a job that gives you experience and opportunity to move forward.
good,"Amazon as far as pay and benefits go is very good however, working for Amazon is not for everyone. It's a very fast paced, very stressful and high demand job that requires you to preform at the highest standards at all times or you can risk getting in trouble at anytime for even the littlest things. there's almost no margin for error despite the good caring attitude that the managers have while working there. It is both a physically and mentally stressful job."
good,"Typically I look forward to my work day. I love meeting and interacting with new people. I am a very hard worker, and give every task I'm taken or I give myself my all. I believe that you can work hard and get the job done while also having a good time."
good,I had great experience while working with Amazon uk nice and helpfull management. Got handful of experience in different departments of the company. Very nice working environment.
good,"Fast paced and hard work, but family fun environment.  Benefits are good.  Management is approachable.  I work 10 hour shifts.  The hardest thing is walking on hard flooring for so long."
good,"Typical day is on festival season when receiveing more orders, eventhough it is fun to work. Learnt dealing with all type of customers in resloving their queries. Enjoyable part is on receiving appreciations from customers."
good,Keeps you busy to the point time goes by pretty fast. Long work hours but it's definitely worth it. Co-workers and managers are easy to get along with.
good,"I like the overall working with Amazon, would like to work again!"
good,"Management is great, they worked with me when they saw me struggling in one department. If you're into manual labor and warehouse work in an caring environment I recommend Amazon."
good,"Safety, it’s more than wearing a reflective vest. We’re committed to providing one of the safest work environments, which means stretching, safety tips, and yes… following the rules."
good,"Bonne équipe "
good,A typical day at work requires you to walk a lot as well as pick a lot of items off  bins and shelves. You must be able to stand and walk for long periods of time
good,"The work is fast-paced and keeps one busy throughout the day, which I find preferable to other jobs that include a lot of sitting around with nothing to do. It allows one to focus on the work rather than the clock. The management is polite and fair when requesting for an employee to move from one station to another to keep control of the work load."
good,"No wonder why there are people who are working for 5-8 years. Fun at work, friendly management, good salary and great chances for growth. Feels like day one!"
good,"I work AFE. The job consists of packing multiple items per box. You show up, have a huddle, then go to the wall assigned to you for that day. The job is pretty straight forward and you do the same thing every day. Management is pretty chill and easy to talk to. They really care about your safety and health - making sure you're stretched before work and allowing you to take time to relax if you feel tired or overwhelmed. People seem to get along for the most part. Hardest part is the fact that the job is physical, but that gets easier. You do have to hit a certain rate, but that's pretty achievable too. You get some down time every now-and-then. The break rooms have food and snacks for purchase with an easy self check out and several TV's playing different channels, as well as some games like basketball and PAC-man. (Two 15-minutes and a half hour break) Everything is pretty routine. Same clock in time, same clock out time, and same breaks and lunches every day. Mandatory overtime is also included sometimes, but there is also opportunity for voluntary time off - where they ask people if they want to take the day off or leave early. So far, nothing to complain about. :)"
good,"I enjoyed working for Integrity Staffing, working for Amazon warehouse was always fun. Amazon was a great place to work, pretty good hours and pretty good pay."
good,"Good place to work at. Long hours, but you learn a lot and able to advance within a short amount of time. Management is a little micro-managing but ok."
good,The hours were long and silent since I was unable to bring any devices into the warehouse. The work is hard but the paychecks are very rewarding. The break rooms are also very large and have a large selection of food to choose from during lunch.
good,"fun place to work at times.jobs are easy to learn and comprehend.working  in a production area means fast paced and lots of lifting.times passes quickly when we are busy processing orders.plenty of room to advance and flexible schedules.company provides lots of bonuses and work incentives including all that are listed including  gift cards,bonus bucks,televisions,work days off with pay,stereos,cell phones etc.insurance is provided to part time workers also."
good,Amazon is a very fast paced work area. You start off your day with stretches and review of how the day will be as well as whats to come. Then you proceed to your station where you work for 10 hours with two paid 15 mins break and one 30 min unpaid lunch break.
good,"Amazon is an organization where they provide training to their employee as per their competency for each and every dept. "
good,a typical day requires lots of walking so comfortable shoes are a must. I learned that work can also be a workout.Not sure about the management as most of the day and day was dealt through regular employees. hardest part was transportation to and from work. and the most enjoyable part was the in work perks.
good,Hard work.  Great benefits.  Do not like to pay short term benefits. Long hours.  Hourly production rates must be met.  Stressful during holidays and on Prime Day.
good,"Good place to work. No complaints. I am able to work and be happy."

During their Thanksgiving, the company gave us a Thanksgiving dinner.  "

I learned a lot using Microsoft excel and powerpoint, how to work hard and efficient under pressure, the importance of the customer while putting safety first, and how to supervise multiple people doing various tasks in different locations.  Most of the management team is friendly and enjoys teaching and helping others to become successful.  The workplace is very diverse and tries to incorporate fun into the work place through games, snack, and special employee events.  The hardest part of the job is getting used to standing/walking for ten hours a day.  The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that you did your part to get the customer their package on time."

good,"Great company as long as you don't have technical issues.  As all places, it depends on the management you get.  Customers can be challenging.  Training is a little different than most companies.  Overall, I highly recommend them."
good,"Working from home is great. I can work at my own leisure. My boss is myself and all I need to do is follow Amazons rules. I list the item I want to sell and wait for it to sell. Once it sells, I order more product from my source and do it all over again. I learned it takes time to find good items that will sell well. My management is making sure I dont run out of product, no inventory means lost sales and you cant get that back. The hardest part of the job is knowing whats going to sell. The most enjoyable part of the job is the flexability. Work at my own pace."

And also keep a 100% productivity every week witch your manager will be keeping up with if you cant keep your productivity up eventually you will be fired. But it all depends on were you are located some managers will help you and move to to another function were you can possibly do better.

I just didn't get the work life balance due to long hours which made me feel as if i have at work all the time and didn't spend much time with family.

good,I was a forklift driver for over a year. you would work 12 hour days and get 3 days off. It was a good decent job. The temp hire service they used was silly and probably used to keep people from getting benefits and claiming unemployment. I ended up getting converted from the temp service after about a year of working for them it was supposed to happen after about 6 months. I don't blame amazon for this because they probably didn't know this was happening at this location. I was really proficient at about everything I did there but they always needed forklift drivers. I wasn't really a fan of doing it but I did it anyways. I put in several request to be put in a different area none of them ever went through
good,amazon.com is a place which is very famous for its work culture. it helped me to learn the etiquette of being in a professional atmosphere. I leaned to interact with the customers that helped me boost my self confidence. I also learned the flow of money as the role i was handled was related to the transactions. i even used to work overtime ever weak for 20 hrs.
good,"Overall, it's a pretty good place to work. But, the hardest part about the job in my opinion is standing for the majority of the shift. Very Tiresome."
good,"Loading and unloading of product. "
good,"An exceptionally fast paced and ever changing business. No day is the same."
good,Job was easy enough if you can learn/adapt quickly. I would still be driving for Amazon Flex if shifts weren't impossible to get.
good,"Fun and learning, managing diverse people"
good,A typical day at work is scanning items into containers and scanning them onto shelves. Lifting heavy box's that can weight up to 45 pounds and meeting your requirements for goal
good,Peak season is kinda crazy. But after peak work is pretty usual and steady. Overtime is also great during peak. They also have a pretty high turn over rate.
good,"A typical day at work requires driving and delivering packages. I learned that everything is at your own pace. Management is pretty cool and outgoing. the culture of the amazon is very diverse. The hardest part of the job is when the weather gets bad, or you have a lot of packages. Finishing early, making customers happy and pay every week."

good,A typical night meet at stand up area answer safety questions talk about the night volume . Learned new things when you move to different areas of the warehouse. Learned how use pallet jack
good,"The work is sorting packages, after a shift you will feel tired because of constant movement but it's still easy. Enough work to keep you from thinking about anything serious but not enough to fully occupy your mind"
good,Overal working with Amazon was a great experience. It is a tough Job and long hours. However it pays well and anyone can pick up overtime hours.
good,"dont let them feel to powerful, they were cool but got big headed. I dont like big headed supervisors they think they know how to talk to and handle employees but not really my guy."

good,I thoroughly enjoyed working for amazon i enjoyed meeting different people and working in the different parts off the company
good,"Amazon is such a great company, but I really feel like they don't care about their employees as much as they say they do. Just my honest opinion......"
good,"A typical day at Amazon normally runs for 4 hours of warehouse atmosphere at it's finest. Morning stretches to limber up and meeting with all employees and management to confirm volume and safety measures taken for the day and weeks to come. We then proceed to  designated areas posted for each employee individually and process all freight incoming from the online orders made previously. Volume changes day to day, you have to be flexible and ready for anything. I've learned to take each day as it comes calmly and efficiently while maintaining production excellence with as little down time as possible. The job is very fast paced and no room for error. There are employees from all different backgrounds, cultures, ages, and genders. The diversity in the workplace allows for many approaches to common issues, and communication is key to harmony in the workplace. As such I am comfortable working with people from many backgrounds and walks of life. The hardest part of the job is only how fast paced the processing is, with next to no downtime. It does tend to get frustrating at times; however, as previously stated i have adapted to this atmosphere. I have even thrived and become a top performer in my position. Easily the most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and learning about other employees cultures and backgrounds. I consider myself a people person and am not shy about sharing my life experiences with others."
good,Wasnt that bad the money was good.Your garenteed at least 40 hours a week and overtime is either 50 hours or 60 hours depending on customer need.The only time to not work here is peek season
good,"As expected, you are on your feet all day. It is a fast paced environment, and you have to maintain a daily rate to ensure your productivity meets the company's expectations. The hardest part of the job is maintaining your rate and productivity if your replenishing team can not keep up with your work pace."
good,Amazon is a good company the management is good and most of them are very friendly and helpful i have wokred for them for 7 months
good,"I had a fun time working for Amazon and lots of professional growth, but the culture there sometimes is unbearable and completely unfair. I would recompensed working there but not for a life long experience."
good,"always like to interact with new people, so it was a very good chance for me to work in the front as a warehouse, but sometimes, we always do not see the good people around us. I loved my job but I was in the wrong neighborhood, but I still managed to work almost 1 years over there."
good,"You meet very good people, with much to say about their lives. Other than only working 4 hours a day and getting hounded by management, it is a great job overall."
good,"Every day on Stow."
good,I think amazon is a great place to work if u like a fast paced job there is a lot of walking involved in picking the warehouse is huge
good,At amazon we were split into groups during parts of the year. While there i learned about teamwork and leadership. Being able to coach others to make them a stronger associate while working and making the numbers i needed to make my job successful. The best part of the day was when I was able to make others successful in the positions they were in. The hardest part of the day would have to be not being able to help other associates that I couldn't focus on to help.
good,"i learning very fast everything i like everbody they teach me very nicely. its lot a fun place enjoy my job i learn lot stuff new things to do ,management so good appericiate."
good,"Day goes by fast"
good,It's average work; nothing too exciting. Amazon as a company is great to work for. Nice overtime paychecks during peak season. Sometimes management is iffy to deal with but what place doesn't have iffy management? Pay is decent but definitely could be better. Benefits are really good.
good,"This account is one of the simplest account on a BPO company and during my short period as a loan agent from Expedia, i really really enjoyed my time on Amazon. I really don;t have something to say about the account just nice! "
good,"Amazon is a fast pace work place, so many different job titles and I have done many of them. From stowing, dock, ICQA, and being part of the safety team. You definitely get your exercise, make lots of friends and get lots of overtime."
good,"Co workers are friendly, enjoyed meeting new people. work load was not hard, but boring at times. Lots of mandatory overtime during holidays, Benefits are good pay was ok,"
good,"All incidents, accidents and medical emergencies to law enforcement are reported whilst at the same time resolving customer complaints on de-brief desk."
good,Great place to work with very good benefits. Hours are unorthodox. The job can be rewarding but exhausting. The pay level is not alignment with duties and responsibilities
good,"Brilliant company, safety and discipline to get his target of operation."
good,Working at amazon was a very cool. The people that work there are very easy to get along with if you're a social person. Management were very funny and annoying.
good,This place is the place you work when you need hours and aren't afraid to do your job. It can be fast paced as well as layed back just like any other job. They order food and stacks for employees they actually care. I rate it a good place
good,"I worked in amazon about 3 months. Generally job is ok, is not very hard.Possibility to earn well and to learn many functions.Good atmosphere."
good,"buena empresa, seguridad y cuidado de la salud de los empleados."
good,"It's fun place to work "
good,"when working for amazon you'll build team work skills , lifting , scanning things, loading an unloading packages all sorts of great things, Also everyone is respectful."
good,"Gute Organisation der Belehrung von neuen Arbeiter."
good,"Bonne intégration, suivi de l'employer, considération et écoute sont de mises."" travailler dure"" = satisfaction personnelle.Esprit de challenge poussant à l'action qui est trés intéressant à vivre dans cette entreprise humaine."
good,Amazon is a wonderful place to work. Great benefits and paid well. Requires lots of walking. It is a very friendly place to work.
good,"i picked, packed did a lot of walking. "
good,"I absolutely loved working here. The pay was great, and the management was very good. The culture made it fun to come to work.  They make sure that you are cross trained in all areas of the job. I just wish I had not gotten on as a seasonal employee because the lay offs were horrendous.  Although we knew there was a great chance that when the season ended we would be let go, it was still very hard to go through it, especially since we were told that if we kept the absences low and productivity high, we would most likely be hired on. Otherwise, I would gladly go back if the job was offered, I just would not do it as seasonal or temporary."
good,"Did shipping and receiving for amazon "
good,There were plenty of rotating shifts that were sometimes great an d then bad at times. there was not that much interaction with coworkers due to self working areas which was fine with me cause I enjoy working independently.
good,"Exellent place to work at, people are great, can get a little bit over whelming when you get a lot of packages! Managers are great, they listen to your input"
good,"i work as transaction risk investigator for amazon. de, this  one the finest companies to work for, fun to work environment."
good,"The work isnt too hard, pick an item and repeat. No music what so ever. Its insane how quick they want you to go though, stay away unless you can walk 15+ miles a day"
good,"Had to constantly stay busy, compensation was awesome but breaks didn't make sense, like they gave two 15 minute breaks but it always just seemed like 10 minutes cause you would be wasting it just to walk to the break room or to use the facilities first, but everyone there was friendly"
good,"I enjoyed the fast paced environment of the company. "
good,"The place has a great work environment, great management, the work is physical, related to walking or standing at one place, lifting heavy things, but thanks to all the safety measures the percentage of incidents is taken to minimum."
good,"Overall good place to work, management can be a little overbearing during fast paced days but their not unfair or irrational. Most packages in 1 day is 203,000 but usually no more than 150,000. Must be ready to do physical labor for at least 4 hours. Only downsides are parking and short breaks."
good,The job is a fast pace constantly on your feet moving at all times. There's always room for advancement if you want to move up. They have a great break room which caters to the employees.
good,"The job was fun and easy, never had a problem with any of my fellow employees, shift leaders or managers. If I had the chance I'd probably work there again."
good,"Very positive and good place,althought there is a lot to do about the security.Place where you can make good money.There is good politik training culture."
good,"Warehouse work, mostly, but it feels pretty cool. Plus, the employee discount for using Amazon products is not bad at all. If you start there, you have just as good of a chance for higher positions as someone with a 4 year degree, even if you do not have one. Your tenure in the company counts for something."
good,"Good Company just stay knowing your Paid, Vacation, and Unpaid hours. They will let you use your PTO for when your late for work. They have no point system which allows you to manage your own time. I feel like it is a great system."
good,"loved working at amazon, no drama, everyone was friendly and nice. If you needed a question answered the managers would answer it the best they could or they would ask someone if they didnt know the answer themselves."
good,"Great Company, Great People. It's an engineer-driven company without a doubt (that *is* changing, but it's still very engineer-focused). You can't find a more well-regarded company that actually deserves the hype it gets."
good,Handling many packages a day. A lot of walking is required and at times heavy lifting of boxes. Learned how to organize packages. Management is not too strict on associates and are friendly. Co workers are diverse and friendly. The most difficult part of job is having to walk back and forth to get boxes. The most enjoyable part is that the warehouse has ac and does not get too hot.
good,I have fallen in love with this place. But I am sad to have to look for another job just because its a part-time position and the shifts are changing after peak season is up.
good,I like how I was always busy doing something. I liked how there we're different people that I could work with. I didn't like that I had to get on the pit. I also didn't like the short breaks.
good,"I enjoyed learning new things at Amazon. The co-workers were nice and had strong work ethics. My experience at the ship dock focused on teamwork and eliminating congestion. The job demanded extra effort on some days, but the management was understanding."
good,"amazon provides a comfortable environment for employees .people comfortably reach their targets "
good,"Although at times the work can be overbearing and the hours can be draining, I loved working at Amazon and would recommend it to anyone seeking employment."
good,"Every morning before we were assigned to our designated working areas, the Supervisors made sure we all did our morning exercises and stretches to get us going in the morning. Even though we had a lot to do we were able to have fun while doing the job. There was a lot  of different people through out the warehouse it was guaranteed nobody was left behind or left out. 10 hour shift 3 days a week and offered some overtime. Vison/health/dental when hired fulltime."
good,Great place to work with and good inviorment.Solid company great staff and coworkers. Everyday work was easy light and enjoyable overtime was good paying hours.
good,"Amazon is an amazing company. The work culture however, may be improved. "
good,the job just have you on your feet for 10 hours a day but the work is easy and some of it is fun!!! what I do is pick on the op and you have a time limit to get the next area!!!
good,"A typical day was boxing items that people have bought to be shipped out."
good,I love working at Amazon get place lots of great people that you meet but I do not agree with their employment agency that they go though at their Jeffersonville Indiana location.
good,It's a very chill place to work. Managers are very reasonable managers are friendly and HR is amazing colleagues are friendly picks are easy. Fast pace environment so day goes by fast. I'd recommend it to my good friends and family.
good,I loved working with this company. It was a great stepping stone and learning experienced towards my career goals for the future.
good,"You do daily stretches before work and after lunch.  Then the managers would give out announcements about the previous day and upcoming events.  Then, you go to work.  One hardest things about the job is meeting the quota of 300 items an hour.  Some workers can really fly on this part of the job while try their best."
good,"Great atmosphere and people. Many opportunities for career development and advancement, Training and Learning teams provide great insight to help you succeed"
good,"A typical day at work consists of constantly moving (picking up carrying, pushing) products going on break and then doing it again."
good,"It's great going to work in your jammies and taking calls. You feel very connected to everyone you work with--even though they are far away. Your team lead is very supportive, and you have all the tools and knowledge you need to get the job done and help your customers. "
good,"Working at Amazon feels like an exciting oppertunity to begin with, free WIFI, free hot drinks, prize draws, this week we had a waffle and hot chocolate stall in the canteen, pool tables, ping pong tables, jukebox, arcade machines, and a reasonably priced canteen meal. "
good,"Amazon ""was"" a great place to work.  Work From Home Seller Support Associates in Grand Forks were permitted to give Amazon Sellers the best possible service and go above and beyond normal routine to resolve Seller problems and concerns."
good,Most enjoyable part of the job was that it was fast paced and unpredictable.  Never a boring moment.  The days went by very quickly. The safety standards are extremely high.
good,"good job good hours reliable pay friendly people"
good,"It's a great place to work. They have an amazing staff that will help you with anything. It's been an amazing experience. I am currently in the process of getting hired on at one of many amazing companies integrity deals with. I have advanced within my company while still being considered Integrity. It's great wages for the work you do. They're definitely many benefits to working with staffing company. It's definitely the best staffing company I have ever delt with. I recommend them to friends and family members looking for a job. They give you a second chance, and a new lease on life. If you have the opportunity to work for this company definitely give it a try. Stop reading my review and try them for yourself. What are you waiting for? Get your second chance at life now."
good,"Learned that I didn't really like talking on the phone that much, I don't like being stuck in a cubical, my coworkers were amazing."
good,"Amazon is not for everyone. It is a tough, fast paced, environment. The days are 10hrs long and during the holidays there are lots of overtime opportunities. I love the fast paced atmosphere and the benefits offered. There is always opportuinity to further your career and Amazon even offers a program to help pay for an associates degree!"
good,"This job was interesting and if it wasn't for the physical demands of this job had I would probably still be there."
good,"Mir gefällt am besten an diesem Job, dass man immer in Bewegung ist."
good,I worked on an interestine project during my internship. I implemented a service which helps developers to keep their services and applications up-to-date. It a very useful service and I learned a lot about how to as a software engineer during the internship.
good,Good pay. Good benefits. I like the work environment. Having three days off every week instead of two is awesome as well. I would recommend this job to others.
good,"The work is tough but it's never been as bad as some claim it to be. I find a lot of my coworkers to complain about everything even though we're never overworked or treated poorly. If you're afraid of hard work then this is not the place for you, but if you can put up with it, it's a very friendly atmosphere. My mangers listen to me and always greet me with a smile, although some managers are not the same way."
good,Loads of rewards with loads of expectations and demands. Very paced pace environment were each manager is responsible for their own department like it is their business. However maintaining a healthy work-life balance is very difficult.
good,Great company. Fast pace. High demand. Quality is the gain. Costumers always right. Great benefits. HR is always there 24 hours. Supervisor are very supportive
good,"1. Happy journey"
good,Challenging work with good benefits. Will hire anyone willing to work hard and will train people on all the warehouse tasks that they will be assigned to.
good,"the"
good,"Good work place, good money, :) :) :) "
good,"Amazon is a really decent company to work with and they offer such great benefits. It's a really energetic environment which is great."
good,Amazon.com has provided me platform to start off my career and helped me learning all the process starting from accounts payables to procurement.
good,"Amazon is a place where one gets to learn a lot. One has to be prepared to work long hours, willing to learn new things every day. The company holds true to its clarion call,every day is Day1. An exciting workplace."
good,I work very hard to make my rate everyday that I work. The managers are very good with the employee. The hardest think at work is make the rate. I love when the manager go and tell that I'm doing a good job.
good,The Management was great and so the benefits. Almost everyday safety team comes out to remind us our safety is their priority although we have to surpass their expectation in our productivity. Managers and HR are always on the floor  and very approachable.
good,A typical day at work is working by yourself music playing in the background to help you vibe with working. you go to lunch and after lunch you have like 3hr until work is done
good,"Good place to work.  Difficult job because of the constant standing.  1 - 30 minute lunch and 2 - 15 minute breaks otherwise you are on your feet the rest of the time.  15 minute breaks include travel time to the break areas. 10.5 hour days - 4 days a week sounds good but it is really exhausting because of the standing.  "
good,great environment to work in I WOULD LOVE TO GO BACK. con was it was a seasonal position hopefully I can get back into the job and go full on hire. amazing experience
good,"le travail me plaisait malheureusement les opportunités d évolution étaient limitées , après presque 4 mois mon contrat étais terminer et lorsque je suis revenu en Belgique il m ont rappeler"
good,A typical work day is picking a cart full of items and scanning each item to put in the correct shelves. The co-workers are from ages 18yo and up. I liked the management are the managers would work with everyone in the warehouse.
good,nice people clean work environment friendly management. long commute big facility not able to transfer to other locations. stand in one spot for more than an hour at a time. wish I could listen to music.
good,It's a fun place to work if you like to work in a fast paced environment. You get paid time off an paid vacations. You get good health and dental insurance 4O1K
good,"I really enjoyed working at Amazon the people are grea"
good,I really liked this job it was an amazing experience and fun job as well.It was an awesome job really felt comfortable working at this job.
good,they have you running like race horses and if you don't beat there favorites you will get fired. plus the mangers don't solve problems because they don't know what to do
good,"Manual  hard labor. Very demanding but I made good money .The hours were long .Nice team , great management.Nice promotions and great holiday pay....."
good,"I have worked for amazon for 18 months on the PM shift. "
good,"Working with one of the top retailer with good work culture."
good,"Great place to work, but has a high turnover rate. I loved the fast pace environment and all the staff. This is not a job that is very long term, but the pay is very good"
good,"I like the system over there. "
good,"I recently quit working with Amazon and had many reasons for leaving. I had a difficult commute which was the primary factor in my departure. During my time there, my leadership team was always vigilant in making things better for our associates and our customers. I have had the opportunity to work with some really great people and the culture and internal advancement opportunity was great. The majority of my managers were really wonderful people that worked hard to support me and help me develop in my career."
good,Not a bad place to work installed air conditioners so it was a little better temperature wise from when I first started. Managers willing to help you and work with problems. Great people to work with and work together to reach goals. Health insurance was better than most places.Time off was easy to get for dates you want for vacations. Over all one of the best places I have worked.
good,"typical day was very busy and sometimes frustrating, I learned that I liked that kind of warehouse work, management was alright I guess cause I was hired in as holiday help so I didn't have to deal with the stuff that the full timers did, some of the coworkers were alright but the holiday help they brought in from all over  and some of those coworkers were rather uncomfortable to be around(scary), hardest part of job was just working with those coworkers that was brought in from  other places, enjoyable part was the type of job and getn a pay check"
good,Great company like it a lot good money management runs smoothly you mostly work by yourself when you a driver an I like working at my own pace so I can finish early than expected .
good,"I found it to be a very good place to work and I enjoyed it."
good,Amazon.com has been a highly motivated and fun place to work at. All employees were always positive and willing to go the extra mile. As an employee you were always excited to get to work and start your shift.
good,It's helps give you more insight with warehouse experience. I would subject this job to anyone that likes a well rounded work field and that likes dealing with just employees.
good,Amazon is a good company to work for. the pay at the lower levels for employees is kind of low for high cost areas such as San Diego or New York City. Great culture though- they would keep more lower level and mid level management with higher compensation.
good,Obviously I have been making a lot of fun and hard work without any complication. We have a very good open door policy for all employees. Amazon recognize hard working employees and reward them.
good,I was happy there. Management was sometimes disappointing but there were overlapping shifts with overlapping managers. Work load was often fluctuating and the rate system often unforgiving.
good,"The work was flexible so you weren't doing the same thing all the time and I really enjoyed that. Also, the management was extremely helpful and great to work with."
good,a lot of walking back and forth through the warehouse. learned how to code orders. coworkers were great and helpful. hardest part of job was the constant standing for ten and a half hours. managers were very respectful
good,"Predicable work day but can be stressful with some unrealistic expectations from management. Easy going associates, but can become complacent."
good,Project based scenario. A good starting point for engineers who need to understand business and client requirements. I enjoyed the learning and the huge network base at Wipro
good,"The work was physically demanding, but it was a fun place to be! The took great care of the staff, offering plenty of games, sweepstakes and even holiday dinner during the Christmas season."
good,"Not a place to work, treated not fairly. Used to be a fun place to work since management as change. Co-workers make the day go by faster. But i have learned to be more independent and more open to speak in front of people."
good,productive and fun workplace learned how to properly load trucks and delivering of packages management was nice and professional hardest part was the loading of company truck and most enjoyable was making sure customers received the item they have been waiting for.
good,"I learnt many skills such as time management as we was only located a short break, I was able to leave my break at the right time to get back to working on time. I was also set targets which I was able to achieve, such as picking a certain amount of items per hour."
good,I enjoyed my time here. Ch1 works really hard at making your time as a peak season worker fun. Parking and traffic is CRAZY !! It can be a mad house of sorts so they take the extra steps needed for you   to enjoy the work environment.
good,"Working at Amazon is very challenging, its built up my speed in working in a fast pace environment. The workers are friendly & easy to get a long with. The hardest part of the job is that you have to always be on your feet for 10 hours, but apart from that it's a very interesting & challenging job to do. The most enjoyable part of the job is receiving good feedback after reaching & exceeding my targets & knowing that i have improved which makes me feel proud of myself."
good,"very nice work culture, nice management. only minus point is very rarely  heavy packages to be lifted and limited working hours.."
good,"You have managers who will help you succeed and you have managers who have never done this job but tell you that you are working wrong and your rate is too low. They never look at the fact that you may ; be having a bad morning, got to work late or not feeling well."
good,Fast pace needed to maintain required quoted.  10 hours days are long with only two 15 minute breaks.  Lots of walking needed for job.  Great benefits and good working conditions.
good,"first off the place was HUGE, secondly there is zero sitting everyone is standing even the area managers. which was brutal i went from sitting all day everyday to standing 10hrs a night 40hrs a weeks thursday-sunday. "
good,"It's an outstanding place to work. The management and HR are more than willing to work with you whenever you need something. Benefits from day one such as Health, Dental, and Eye. From day one you receive plenty of time off and personal time racks up extremely quickly."
good,"I would pack for a quarter, tape for a quarter, and load trucks. I learned that it was something that I enjoyed doing. Management took care of me when I hurt myself. The hardest part of my job was doing the CPTs, which are the priorities that needed to get out the door because you had to do it in a certain amount of time."
good,"I packed for a quarter, taped for a quarter, loaded trucks, and I learned that it was something that kept me busy, which I liked."
good,"Amazon is a fast paced environment, where systems, teams and requirements change almost daily. Adapting to the speed of change and executive ahead of it is one of the challenges of being at Amazon."
good,"•	Picking and packing"
good,Have been working in this company for almost years now and all I can say is Amazon is simply amazing. I never become what I am now if not because of leadership trainings Ive gone through. Theres a lot more to say
good,The people there were nice and respectful i just couldnt do all the standing all day and night. They paid good
good,"Awesome managers. Great work hours especially for students. I learned a lot from management and my coworkers. Honestly the only downfalls are no benefits, paid time off or that management didnt really engage personally. My favorite part was the meetings we would have before every shift. It helped us to know things and we clapped in like a true team. Didnt like that there were some people that were very lazy."
good,i worked at Amazon as a costumer return and i love my job  it was fun working at Amazon ..... i love my job because we worked together as team and it makes our job easy and more fun ......
good,Amazon is a great company it has really simplified the order selecting process. The people there are great and I have fun most days while on the job. However it can be boring at times especially if you do only one thing everyday.
good,"Managed & trained a crew of 95 shipping agents with duties to include daily schedules, nightly goals and procedures. Assessments to ensure orders were prepared for shipment per established estimated contractual intervals for production. Operated electric forklift and pallet jack as needed."
good,A better environment to work in and learned excel and e mail skills. The most exciting think is i never found any thing hard to work in amazon .
good,"Starting off with group meeting; which include any updates that employees should be aware of. "
good,"The people and work environment was really cool. "
good,i enjoyed working for amazon.com they gave me all training that i need to learn and move forward into the company they have great staff helping you all the time in what you need
good,Una buena experiencia con una empresa de las lideres en su sector donde prima sobre todo la calidad y puntualidad con los envios
good,Great company. Infact feel proud to work with Amazon. Great learning experience. New industry for me. Provide space to learn and execute new ideas
good,a typical day was fun and fast i learned good leadership skills management was good co-workers were good people the hardest part of the job was hitting the quota daily the most enjoyable part of the job was the items you will deal with every day .
good,The work is really simple and its not back breaking. Its good pay and the people are great. you basically have a different task every day so it allows growth. it also helps so you don't get bored with repetitiveness.
good,"Long days and very structured. However, there were great benefits and  compensation packages. Very #s driven place and however upper management is concerned about the safety of associates' safety first."
good,"I learned how to use the RF gun and how to scan boxes, I wrapped pallets and also staged them, on a typical day I would always scan and wrap. The people I worked with were quite interesting and kind. The most enjoyable part of the job were playing ping pong during breaks. The hardest part of the job was to keep up on scanning boxes quickly because it would start to get full and crammed on the conveyor belt."
good,Amazon is a good place to work. Some of the work is challenging but it makes you want to work even harder. All of my managers are engaged with the employees throughout the day. I have some pretty cool coworkers as well.
good,worked hard stayed busy like that it was fast paste had a chance to move up in job title like being around alot of people. worked alot of hours and days.
good,"Good place to work but takes very much time and hard work to grow."
good,"I was always working it is never a boring day. the people are friendly."
good,"With such a large amount of employees it can be difficult for outside hired managers to handle and run a department they know as much about as the new hires in the summer. A very uplifting and positive environment is provided from the co-workers and veteran managers. Spending 8-10 hours on phones being berated by some very angry people can become taxing on a person, more than most think. But, at the end of the day, I loved every minute at that job and would give up a fair amount to be given a second chance with the company."
good,I work mostly in receiving and decant/bulk receiving into the building. Sometime stowing those items as well. Best times of the day is working with the best co-workers ever. They was the best for they have fun but on  a professional level.
good,"The positions offered were quite reasonable and easily learned. The expected work rate varied from task to task. Management was always attentive, present, and paid close attention to employee work methods, and relations. The atmosphere was sociable and productive when work moved smoothly and employees were kept busy. "
good,"I worked for these guys seasonal, and boy was it both fun and tiring at the same time! During my short time there, I got to meet loads of different people who were for the most part, very nice and helpful when you needed it. "
good,"Good steady while finishing high school.  Again, loved the customer interaction. I took pride in being the Head Cook.  Got along great with the management."
good,Amazon has been a great opportunity and experience thus far. There is a lot of career paths and ways to move up in the company. The benefits package is wonderful. The management and co-workers are all on a level playing field and there is an open door policy with all associates. The 10hr work day is ok and there is a lot of manual labor involved and pacing yourself is required. The hardest part of the job is the 10-11hr work days and the mandatory overtime that is required during peak season. Being a single mom of three the hours make it difficult to balance work and home life. This job is a fantastic opportunity for the right canadites. It is fast paced with plenty of room to move up very quickly.
good,"overall great company, some shifts are a lot easier to manage work and school. Management overall is good and work with employees."
good,Work 10 hours a day in the same spot. The job is very repetitive. No room for growth as a temp. Takes too long to get hired on. Friendly environment.
good,I would work a 10 hour shift.  Daily warehouse work required lifting and walking all day long.  Good communications.   Lunch room appeared to be clean.  It was a good place to work
good,"great company"
good,"moving 30 to 50 thousand packages a night is hard work and everyone must work together to get is done. it is hard to work with people who do not understand English, who really do not want to be there, who do not care about the rules or safety."
good,answer phone calls most of your day. management very helpful when you need training or think that you need help understanding a different way of doing a process
good,Work was easy to learn. Co-workers were friendly and very talk active. I was able to learn packing boxes with customer orders and sent them to shipment. The difficult part was maintaining pack rates per hour either due to lack of orders or equipment failure. What I enjoyed most was meeting co workers and Amazon's break/lunch sessions
good,good work very god work i use to work for them and everything was good i would work there again they make sure you work hard.
good,"I am a hard worker and can work in a team or on my own. You can be sure I will not work hard throughout the whole weekend, so what have you got to lose? I am so excited about this opportunity and really want to work here. I have heard really good things about the exciting opportunity and want to experience it for myself."
good,"Co-workers are very friendly"
good,">Better"
good,"My experience at Amazon was a good experience. A typical day at work for me is walking in at 6:00am, I clock in at 6:30am and then begin my work until its break time. We all get 15 minutes a break and get 3 depending if you finish your job giving to you. After my breaks I like to finish the day off strong complete as many assignments I can and clock out at 5:30pm. I learn that I can stand on my feet for long long periods of time. Me and my co-workers were cool never had any conflict or disagrees with them. The hardest part of this job is standing on your feet for long periods of time. The most thing i enjoyed about this job was the breaks cause everyone in my section that I became friend with would take a break and we would all just chill and enjoy are 15 minute breaks."
good,"this place was great place to work. i had a company truck, cell phone and gas card. started on bottom and after 10 years was was higher rank."
good,One of the best things about working at Amazon is the opportunity to work on really difficult problems alongside really smart people
good,"Amazon was a great working experience, their motto work hard have fun was true to form. Learned and enjoyed being a great leader. Management was awesome very hands on.  Overall great company, sad to have left wanted to finish school full time. Thank you for a great experience."
good,My day started early if i manage my time the day went by short the hardest part of the job was making rate but i loved havin three days off.My co workers keep my day going by laughter smiles and helping it was a helpful environment
good,"Great Place to work for defiantly care for there employees also Great Managers, with very motivating people to be around and work for."
good,"El trabajo consta en la distribución de paquetería, fletes, mudanzas y comisiones. Aprendí a tratar con la gente y a manejar mis propios horarios. Mientras mas rápido resuelva los asuntos puedo llegar a resolver otros que tenia pendientes."
good,fast pace enviroment and working for the company is good. the most enjoyable part of working for the company is meeting lots of new people.
good,Learned how to locate an idem then pick and pack the items ready for the customers to receive on time. time keeping and meeting targets that were set.
good,Working at Amazon is cool but is not a long time place for some people. I found that it was kind of hard to move up for some reason. but not for some. Its a great place to earn money. its also easy to apply and get hired. I didn't like the fact that the turn over was so high and frequent. other than that its a cool place to work if you can do 10 hrs. or more at times.
good,A typical day at Amazon is talking communicating with other while processing to get threw the day. Oh and the Fun incentives.I learned a lot about back logs and 401k.The hardest part to this job is the long dragging two hrs left in the day for the 10 hr shift.
good,"Amazon is a great to work if you just graduated high school or retired. The typical day flies right by because of the engagement with co-workers, managers, and the enjoyment of the job. The hardest part of the job was getting up in the morning."
good,"Its one of the best company to work."
good,"Always a meeting with the supervisors to start off the shift at which time they'd talk about goals for the shift. Afterwards, there would be stretching exercises and then it was on to the work of packing and during peak season (November to December 20th), there was always  plenty of work. The 11 hour days were a bit much but the bonuses made it all tolerable."
good,"Pros"
good,"Amazing company with challenging tasks. Pros"
good,A lot of work each day but it was worth looking back at the end of the 10 hour long day and seeing that you did a substantial amount of work each day.
good,".Really good place as stepping stone...many opportunities..good management..good scheme of benefits, pension programme..."
good,"I worked there through Integrity Staffing. I didn't really like it, if you weren't working directly for Amazon, you didn't qualify for some of the games and such they had, which was unfair to me."
good,"Friendly Environment."
good,Amazon is a great place for anyone who is driven. There is a wealth of information and knowledge. This really is a company for self starters who is comfortable and looking to drive their own career path.
good,"Amazon is great place to work and learn all different types of work. I learned many areas such as; Stowing, receiving, dock roles, packing, etc."
good,No complaints. Had a nice time working for amazon. Everyone was really easy to work with and i made a lot of life long friends there.
good,A typical day at work was very busy and I enjoyed the pace. I learned a lot about distribution. I also learned a lot about inventory control and quality assurance. My management team was a great team to work with. I enjoyed working with my coworkers. I met a lot of great people. I also trained employees coming in the facility. The hardest part was probably the long hours. I enjoyed the people. I also enjoyed training new employees. I enjoyed the challenge every day I came in the facility.
good,"A typical day at work consist of maximum 10 hours"
good,Excellent opportunity to learn how to properly manage customers complaints and concerns and offer a resolution that best suits the customer and represents Amazon in the best light.  Managed at least 50 telephone calls per shifts.
good,its a great company to work for! Teamwork is a big part of making everything happen. I would definitely recommend this job to others.
good,"This is an awesome company to work for and learn from. The main focus of Amazon is customer obsession. Amazon values the opinions of its employees and provide clear direction for goals and will help you move forward in the company. The management staff above me, were the best leaders you could ask for. Management always would listen to potential ideas for improvement and would implement what they could."
good,"Although I worked there for a few months, I can say I enjoyed my time there. Every day felt relatively smooth aside from a system error which postponed things for maybe an hour or two. Our breaks were about 10 minutes long, 5 minutes if you count the walking from place to place, but it was enough time to do whatever it is you needed to do. A few things could be touched up on as far as leadership and making things alot more smooth during operations, but over all it was a pleasant experience while it lasted."
good,"The work days were really long, and I learned how to pick and pack. The managers were good, they always found ways to keep us up beat and going. Most of the co workers were nice and very helpful if you had questions about the jobs. The hardest part of the job was the long shifts, and kind of short breaks for the ten hour days. I really enjoyed the fast pace work."
good,"Friendly people, fun environment, pay is decent, long hours, easy. Room for growth. Not boring. Learn many different functions."
good,Empresa agradável de trabalhar onde faz o bom de trabalho com seus profissionais
good,Good company to work for. There's plenty of flexibility with hrs/overtime. You work 10 hr shifts. They give you an opportunity to earn a degree with the Career Choice that they have to offer there..
good,"I have gained a lot of knowledge within the 5 years of working at amazon, the people are great to work with, the pay and benefits are great, but at this time there is no advancement positions open at my building and I would like to put my knowledge to use somewhere else if possible."
good,"It was always a good shift. I respected the work place very much. I had a very normal day shift, and very typical work. it was a lonely job to work cause I started talking to the books. that was the hardest part."
good,Hr claims that it is easy for advancement in this company but it is not and it makes it hard to trust them on other matters as well. Overall boring work but good pay
good,Standing for 10 hours. Coworkers are amazing. Managing to not mess up. Make rate. Meeting amazing cowrkers there. best part about the job is the people. worst part about the job is the rate.
good,"I worked a 10 hour shift.   I learned how to pick, scan and lable products.   I worked as a team alongside my collegues.  I was ready willing and able at all times to preform to the best of my ability"
good,"Good place to work, to make friends and to learn about customer's needs. Everyone's treat you well and kind, good environment and friendly people"
good,they work well with their staff and they put their employees first and they try their best to make everyone there comfortable and safe at work.
good,Its a good place to work but the hour are a bit to long for a mother of six kids like me. the work is not hard and they help you with school.
good,They give you an account that you manage your time off yourself. The employees are good people. Job security comes and goes depending on the time of the year.
good,Each day is different. Some days can be stressful and others aren't. Around the holidays are when things become most difficult but those times do not last long.
good,I used to walk in at around 11 A.M and then check my mails and talk to my colleagues figuring out whats the task ahead for the day! And then around 12 P.M we have our regular stand up meetings(scrum) where we discuss whats the task that lies ahead and whats the progress made so far and how to split the task among the colleagues!
good,Its good place to work with room to climb up the ladder. Just wasnt the right fit for me because I wanted to go back to school for an associates.
good,Decent job. Good pay for the work thats is to be done. Standing on for long periods of time is mandatory. Coworkers are good people everybody greets you
good,"Amazon is a very good place to work.The supervisor helps out when needed,he makes sure that you are working in a good situation, and  he makes sure that you are given time off just in case you have a family situation or something else. The pay is good as well as the people who work with you."
good,"Mein Name ist Ana, und ich fühle mich geehrt, die Gelegenheit zu haben, in kontakt mit Ihnen zu bekommen. Ich habe gehört, viele gute Dinge über Amazon und viele interessante Empfehlungen von Freunden, die derzeit für Amazon arbeiten. Eine riesige Produktion in ganz Europa erweitert."
good,"I would have a set schedule for the week but could choose hours flexibly as longs as all calls with customers happened within in my scheduled window. I would sit down at my desk and log-in, as soon as I was in I would engage with a customer. I would spend my work day helping with all manner of issues or transfer where they needed to be based on my titles clearance. I learned how to rely on myself more working at home, though I did have a support team it was great to further learn to solve issues independently as trained. Management was friendly and supportive. The most enjoyable part of the job was working from home."
good,"I work a PM shift Sunday - Wednesday. As a PM shift manager my ultimate goal is route completion and achieving the best statistics possible, First time delivery, concessions etc."
good,Good but I would rather not work for the pay given here.  Pay is not worth the workload we are put through here.  I would recommend this company for those who are really needing a starter job.  No long term future here
good,"reasonable hours and pay, offer overtime on a regular basis.  Good insurance packages as well as pad vacations.  Prizes and raffles for the hardest workers."
good,"A typical day would be going throughout the plant and making sure that items are in their correct location and finding ""lost"" items."
good,"loved the idea behind it all. was one of the easiest jobs i have ever worked. 10 hours a day, 4 days a week."
good,"its good for what it requires from you. you can dress casually if you'd like, everyone is always on the go, plenty of chances to stand out for  advancement."
good,"I've found from working here is that the culture is output oriented. If you are demonstrating success and getting your work done at a high level, they are actually extremely flexible about hours and I've found my quality of life here to be incredibly high. I work hard, certainly, but I also have a well balanced life and I love my job."
good,The typical day in the department I worked in consisted of a start meeting which included stretching and discussing certain calendar items for the day. Then you set off to work. Walking 10-12 miles a day there were plenty of water coolers to keep yourself hydrated and also great break rooms.
good,learned group skills and team work. co workers were sometimes stiff and boring. sometimes have fun there. hardest part was in stow it took to long.
good,"work as a seasonal employee, the work is not what I expected. I work in AFE (packing multiples) and the supervisors are super strict about time, talking to co-workers and you having any kind of say. You walk miles a day. Breaks are 15 minutes, one in the am and one in the pm. To get to the breakroom you walk about 1/4 mile each way. After walking you really only have about 7-8 minutes for break and do not be late by even a second or you will get written up. Lunches are 30 minutes. management doesn't care. They will not work with you with your schedule. The work is monotonous and the days are long.There is a lot of lifting (up to and sometimes more than 50 lbs), and tons of standing. There is no sitting allowed unless on break or lunch. You are expected to pack a minimum of 85 boxes per hour but the goal is 100 (you will be written up if you do not meet this goal). The warehouse is hot and very loud."
good,Worked with customers and helped with orders online and chat.Most managers are nice and they try to make work fun. I love what they stand for and they are a great company to work for.
good,"work  days were pretty straight forward . really fast paced but overall fun and exciting . Fun co-workers and managers who understood depending on the work load , the long work days could sometimes be hard and would consistently be their for support. the most enjoyable part of the job was definitely clocking out ."
good,"its very hard work u have fun at the same time it was a good place to work at. we did alot we work hard the people are friendly the days go by fast i enjoy working at amazon.This company is great, working your way up is why Amazon looses so many amazing people. I do feel it is a great work life balance, but even if I worked harder my efforts wouldn't be recognized or appreciated from a fiscal perspective."
good,"A typical day was a 10 hour shift, with 3 breaks(2 paid.), it was my first warehouse experience and I was very impressed in the efficiency and diligence they gave to the process and trying to improve it for safety and production. My co-workers were average joes that were easy to get along with and relatable. The hardest part of the job was the first 3 hours and the last 3 hours, they dragged on and sometimes you needed to push yourself through them but afterwards the day seemed to breeze by. The most enjoyable part of the job was Getting to see interesting items either conveyed, or brought into the warehouse, taking a few seconds to look it over and getting back to work, sometimes if the item was interesting enough you write it down and look for it on Amazon.com. A close second on interesting is the Robotics department, and that speaks for itself."
good,Amazon was no doubt a great environmen to work in. I learnt so much from working here and all my peers used to all feel as though we were all part of one big family. :)
good,"Empresa com ótima visão, qualidade nos produtos e atendimento ao cliente."
good,"PRÉPARATION DE COMMANDE AVANT EXPÉDITION"
good,I learned many things and the hard part of this job is to stand up all the time and the co-workers are very kind. The management is very good
good,Its a fast paced work environment. You have to be ready to walk a lot. Not a lot of time to sit down and rest but if you like fast paced productivity this is the job for you. It is also fun because you can work independently but there is a lot of other employees you can interact with as well.
good,Enjoyable to work with the community and the co workers.  Management could have been better.  It was a great enviorment until I was pregnant with my second child.  Could have been better leave covered.
good,"Good working environment, excellent colleagues and good benefits. The management is understanding and supportive."
good,"Outbound shipdock worker lord truck up all of them and keep line clean and help all over the warehouse "
good,"Warehouse job. My job consisted of inventory. Checking bins, boxes, pallets to make sure that everything was in its right place."
good,"I had the best manager. If anybody in my team needed help with anything manager would help. "
good,"The first day on the job, you learn so much, depending on what you're doing. I was a packer. You'll learn everything you need to know in about 2-3 hours and then after you learn they throw you right into it, packing real customers packages. A typical day was clocking in and getting straight to work. Making sure that your work space was stocked, and if it wasn't you would have to go to the back of the warehouse to grab your boxed and any other supplies needed. Then you get right to it. The hardest part of the job was actually standing there for 11 hours straight, well with 2-15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch. Also making rate. Another thing is that every embassitor or manager will give you a different answer for the same question.  The best thing about the job is that you meet a lot of people there. That's what keeps everyone going. For the most part it is very busy but we are allowed to walk around when we need to. A lot of times there isn't anyone watching over you like a hawk. So when you need a break, water, or to go to the bathroom, you can."
good,"Sitting in front of the computer for hours sorting out problems for customers on the phone, email and chat, the management was very encouraging and supportive. co-workers were most of the time too busy, but fun when they are free for a chat. The most difficult thing about this job was not being able to help the customer, while the most enjoyable part is the satisfaction you get from knowing the customer is very pleased with the service rendered."
good,"Worked at the depot between Bedford & MK in run-up to Christmas  2012, and I enjoyed the experience. Spent my shifts lifting boxes of goods, scanning each item, packing/labeling each item, then placing the items onto a conveyor belt. Work was constant and repetitive but the time seemed to fly by. Money was ok as I was on the late shift (More money if on Nights). Coworkers were a laugh, but the permanent staff didn't like if you worked harder/faster than them - it made them look bad (which I enjoyed doing!). Breaks are scandalously short especially since you had to pass through security on way out then back in, which took time. Other than that, I would gladly do another stint here if I needed."
good,"but  securty less job,other wise job was so good,enjoyin to working working with co workers and superiors.weekly 2 offs was soo go thing. thats it"
good,"This is a place where you get to show the ownership , Bias for action and Deliver results.We work in a dynamic environment where we have opportunity to learn and experiment.A dynamic changing environment which provides us a scope of inventing and simplifying things.We have an amicable atmosphere where you can express your views Discuss,Debate,Disagree and commit to a common goal as we get to work in teams."
good,The first time i worked for amazon i was in the receiving department it was ok but they stayed looking over your back they wanted you to be at 100% all the time even if there wasn't any work coming down the belt; The second time i was in the packaging department it was the same way rushing without any work and third and final time i worked there i was in the picking department where i pulled customer orders from a scan gun to be taken to the packers to be shipped out that was the best time i had being in that department. the management was great at times.
good,"gute Manager"
good,This place is huge. The staff is nice and courteous. Their HR department is great. Very busy during the holidays. Moving up in this company is easy.
good,"Company Standards is Out Standing , i feel very Proud that I have been worked part of Days in AMAZON.COM, Really wonderfull experience"
good,"Amazon isn't always for everyone, I really enjoyed Amazon. There was a lot of friendly and helpful people. its mostly working 10 hours per day, working 4 times a week."
good,A typical is fast pace and fun the people are a little hard to get along with but you learn to deal the break area is great the managers will play favorites so work hard and hopefully you'll make it
good,"lot of people are working, you can meet new people, just hurt legs after first days. but i learned to use scanner, i found some friends. and they pay good money"
good,"Here at Amazon all co-workers are friendly, get along and willing to help each other. Safety is #1 in the entire facility. The hardest part of the job is remaining in a certain paste since there were times where the floor shut down and slowed down the entire facility not allowing workers to receive products to pack. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to meet new workers and all of us working as a team. I believe it is awesome how the facility has vending machines of all working equipment such as gloves, box cutter, etc."
good,"Learned too improve my speed, typical day at work is packing boxes, binning sometimes and just having fun at work at times."
good,"Amazon was a very exciting place to work for my first job, it was diverse. There is a lot of people to communicate too, everybody is friendly, but the rate and peak is out of control, they expect you to make rate even when theres no work or if your scanner isnt working properly."
good,"At Amazon our day depends on the work of that particular day, We used to enjoy the work."
good,"Fun growing with people who are positive minded and willing to learn.The management is just awesome and helpful,they make sure that things are orderly and done on time."
good,fast paced workplace keeps you moving. Helps you get fit because you're moving and carrying little to heavy boxes. great place to work loved every minute of it. The people and leaders are very helpful and nice.
good,"It was fun working environment at Amazon and most of all I got chance of making more friends."
good,"Not recommended if one is look to grow in career, as it takes a long time to move up the ladder."
good,"It is a very hard job. However, management is very willing to help prepare you to be successful in any way that they can. The business is very customer oriented and aware that a happy cusomer starts with a happy employee."
good,"A parte mais agradável de trabalhar na amazonprint é sem duvida o modo amazonprint de ser valorizando o seu colaborador para refletir no melhor atendimento ao cliente, sempre investindo no colaborador com cursos de qualificaçao de produtos e atendimento ao cliente,tudo isso resulta em uma equipe motivada nos pontos de vendas."
good,"It was a good job. It was a hard job but it was worth it. They always made sure their employees are safe and cared for. It was hard getting use to but after a few days, the hours flew by."
good,"This job really helped me to grow my skills with talking to customers and working in a busy environment especially around christmas. The co-workers are fun and easy to get along with. This was such an enjoyable job, I loved every second of it."
good,"exciting, customer obsession driven position. Very challenging from day to day."
good,A good company overall. Very physically demanding job for lower levels with long hours. Management is friendly but never really around. Co-workers are great but you mostly work alone all day. The hardest part of the job is that it's very repetitive and physical. The most enjoyable part of the job is the great benefits that Amazon has to offer.
good,"I learned to work a faster pace in 30 minutes, I learned how to drive a forklift. The coworkers were ok to work with, they help time pass."
good,"Very good working environment and colleagues, really great canteen with free tea, coffee and drinks. Not easy to work but highly recommended."

good,"As a technical accounts management associate, my job was to answer phones and assist merchants in putting their product for sale on the Amazon.com website. I learned a great deal about on line sales and working with spreadsheets. This job was fun, but I did notice that the younger employees were the ones moving up regardless of their skill or hire date. Most all of the Team managers were helpful and fun to work with. I really enjoyed the casual atmosphere and fun competitions between departments. Management was very in tune with keeping morale high."
good,An average day at amazon is same thing everyday. You don't really get to talk to anyone to much. Everyone is very nice. I enjoy the security Amazon provides.
good,Good job but very repetitive. Its 4 days a week with ten hour shifts. The lunch breaks are extremely short. Benefits are good.
good,"Working for amazon was a great expierance, almost everyone that works there was amazing, Managment was great along with being a fun and enjoyable work place"
good,though the job is only a seasonal postion I enjoyed working there with the supervisors and co-workers very face pace learning enviroment
good,"Amazon is great place to work for, if your use to fast pace environments. you will have 4 10 hour days and 3 days off. due to the fast pace please know you will be loosing some lbs. The hr department  is growing to fit the needs of the employees but over all its hard to get a response from them unless you are right in front of them."
good,"I enjoy and benefited from working at this company. Most of my co-workers were great to work with, and this made my work time more enjoyable."
good,"The processes are not difficult and it is very easy to make your rate. However, management is not the most professional. There is a lot of favoritism and i do not feel like one gets recognized for their work."
good,"This position was great as a part time job on campus.  Although it did demand a lot of time and engagement, I learned a lot from the company and felt like it helped develop and refine my public speaking and networking skills."
good,"1.Good Salary and employee benefits but poor work like balance."
good,"i liked working here but not something i wanted to make a career"
good,L'ambiance durant les heures de travail avec le son dans tous les sens tout essayant de respecter le quotas demandé
good,Everyone is willing to help one another. It is fast paced but the work is very easy. The best part of working at the Davenport sort center is   the teamwork.
good,"The Amazon warehouses never close. You'll find some easy cash, some overtime, and some weight loss- if you don't mind the work."
good,"The hardest was pick time."
good,"An typical day is being assigned to an lane. At this lane, you have to scan two boxes at a time to its assigned pallet. You will continue to it is no boxes yet. Most of the time the boxes are constantly non stop so you have to keep up with it. You usually work with about 10-20  people on your lane.Your managers always aware you of what to do and let you known your scan rate which is important. They will also move you to another lane if they need help as well. You have to scan a certain amount of hour. It is an easy job with good pay. You just have to have patience, be able to stay on your feet and energy to lift and scan. The management staff is cool to work with as well as the co-workers."
good,"The good about Amazon is that it is a physical environment. You are standing lifting, pulling pushing, reaching, bending and mostly lifting."
good,I liked Amazon it was a nice easy environment. I learned a lot of things there and got a lot of experience on forklifts. It was a good place to work and the people their were nice. It wasn't in the city I wanted to work and live in.

good,"Here we will be volunteer on our work,"
good,"Ho lavorato solo nel teriodo natalizio e solo nel turno notturno, quindi non posso dire poi tanto. Resta comunque un esperienza positiva e ben retribuita."
good,"A great place to work. Fast pace on the shipping dock. I was responsible to get trucks loaded, sealed and ready for departure at the required time. Management was great. they knew I was expierenced to perform their positions from the position I had retired at VDOT. co-workers were hard working in order to get the trucks loaded on time which was also the hardest part of the job. We worked to meet the metrics of one thousand parcels per hour if I remember correctly. automated lines separated parcels but they had to be hand loaded into various shipping company trailers.There was opportunity to advance and I'm told the people I worked with have advanced to higher positions. rules and regs were as expected, safety inspections nightly. docking proceedures had to be followed."
good,In this fast moving work environment a good vision is one of the most important elements. At Amazon we are surrounded by highly qualified colleagues who bring the company to the top. Amazon is the earth most customer-centric company and this is what drives the teams to overcome any type of challenges.
good,its a fast pace job. they work hard to train thier employees and make safety a big deal. they do things to accomindate the people working there.
good,i was a picker i was picking things for customers an i was a packer to packing them for customers i liked thi job it was a great busy place to work an good targets to hit
good,"I had the opportunity to launch Amazon's kiva sortable fulfillment center in Ruskin, FL. I worked with carriers all over the state of Florida to ensure that shipments made their promised arrival date."
good,"Amazon is a great place to work. A typical day is clocking in, seeing where you will be on the start up board for the day, stretching, then getting to work. Co-workers are amazing. The hardest part of the job is trying to manage the night shift with life. I love the fact that it is a set time and day every week when I have to work."
good,"The job requires a lot the pay is okay but the Picker job in a big and second largest Amazon warehouse is difficult, with walking around and getting the job done"

good,"Everyday will be tiring but fun at the same time. I learned working for my first time is not very easy. Also, the managers were good always checking what they were they doing right & wrong. My co-workers were hardworking. The hardest part of the job was surviving each day. The great thing about the job was meeting different people."
good,"I enjoyed working for this company.  The pay was great, I lost weight from all the walking and the pay was good.  There were perks given for your hard work and the management was nice to the workers."
good,"I work there as a temp, the management was always available if you needed assistance,I learned how to stow and merchandise, the hardest part for me was driving long distance, and most enjoyable part was working with my fiancee (in different department of course)."
good,"typical day was an 10 hour shift packing goods to go out to customers. i learned health and safety and ways to pack goods. "
good,"Agreat vibe when entering the job, managers are very willing to help others, very caring as a company, and employers are very helpful as well."
good,"As returns come in,we would process the returns.In the process we catch all the fraud items that come in. Maybe the customers don't think we check the items they send? Fix any problems we find."
good,"10 TO 12 hour shifts"
good,"Not enough hours, but a great company. I get about 20 hours  week. But nobody knows what is really going on and it is frustrating ."
good,"amazon its a fun job you get to learn alot of different stuff "

Hardest part of my day...there was really no hard part of my day The most enjoyable part was having the chance to  be cross trained in many department because I learned quickly
good,Usually my days went quite well. The work was generally easy just included a lot of walking.  The hardest part of the job was the walking which really wasn't all that hard.
good,Excellent place to learn but you must be competitive and not with then skin.  Expect to have high expectations provided and you must either meet or exceed them.
good,"You have to be at work by 6, we first go to the start up area where we    warm up at. Working there I've learned how to drive a fork lift & walkie. Co workers where very fun to work with & be around.The hardest part of the job may been walking to the car at the end of the shrit, but the most part was a great work enviroment to be in."
good,It was great working their but stressful. The co-workers were really cool and so were the bosses and other associates. The hardest part of the job was loading the trucks and going outside during the winter to lock and unlock the trucks.
good,"Each day is new day & new learnin,Gives more oppurtunity to Grow,more support given by managers & co-workers nothing is hard."
good,"Even though have 10 hours days, there is a good balance in the pay.  The company attempts to judge there rates verses other places in the area, and it is in general not bad."
good,As soon as you walk in the door you are on the move. The work really makes the time fly by and the co-workers there are very friendly. It may take a few weeks to get used to all the soreness but it will really keep you in shape.
good,"Working at Amazon is a very straightforward experience. 10 hour days, with two breaks and one lunch in between. Morning meetings were held by an always enthusiastic manager to set daily goals, and highlight achievements. My coworkers were mainly very diligent, opting not to fraternize until breaks. The 10 hour days were challenging, but goals and incentives made the challenge welcome. The enjoyable part of the job for myself was knowing that I had achieved my personal goal of learning the job, and overcoming the learning curve that would have kept me from progressing."
good,tres bonne experience avec amazon surtour la culture de l'netreprise qui se reflete a chaque niveau. De bons avantages sociaux
good,"A typical day at work involved reviewing returned items that other employees would determine that items sell-ability status. If I saw something different than a co-worker would of seen, I would correct it based off my own experience."
good,"We unloaded pallets and tagged them ready to be delivered out. The hardest part was there was a lot of walking and lifting involved but it made the night go really quick as we were busy all the time."

Management was amazing if I had a question they were there to answer it. Co-workers I never really talked to. I was there to do my job not sit there and talk.

I liked changing positions every quarter of the day that kept us learning more and more about the company and how it works.

good,i am an account specialist. working for amazon is the greatest thing ever due to its culture and attitude for customer service
good,it was a working place i enjoy the two month i have worked there but they lay off to much nothing was hard about the jo i made it seem to easy
good,great place to work would love to work there again you can learn as much as you want to
good,"This is Amazon's motto. With 20% YOY growth, Amazon is in a constant state of flux. The hours are long. The saying goes- ""at Amazon, it is not a job, but a way of life"". Very safety oriented."
good,10 hours a day
good,"Fun place to work, great management. I've learned a lot in this fast paced environment"
good,"At amazon every day is different, some days are harder than others. I have learned many a things while at Amazon, customer returns & how the supplies supply Amazon with the products are one of many. The management team are good, they help you tell you everything you need to know and try and help you succeed. The hardest part of the job for me is on customer returns which is what I am on at the moment, you have to be careful as one mistake could lead to a customer getting a damaged item so you have to make sure you check it when it comes back and make sue its in sellable condition, The most enjoyable is being able to in a nice environment due to co-workers and how everybody is around eachother, nice place to work in."
good,Great place to grow management skills and many opportunities to continue to grow with the company.
good,+Kind of the same thing every night. Only difference is how much packing each different night offered.
good,"At Amazon i would typically go in and all of us employees would be assigned to a specific line, either by ourselves or in a team, to pack and ship various items. It was a very fast paced job but the days went fast and production was high. The management was very professional but still fun at the same time, as well as the majority of coworkers. Everyone got along very well which made the days nice. The hardest part of the job I think was getting up early, I have almost always worked second shifts and it was much different getting up at dawn. I loved the atmosphere there though and how fast the days went with good pay. They also played a good variety of music while we worked which made the day much more enjoyable."
good,"Amazon has a very healthy and happy culture. They live to their ""work hard, have fun, make history"" slogan. Working at amazon has taught me a great deal in perseverance, coping under a great deal of stress. It has taught me flexibility. It has also taught me to live life and to have fun while being productive."
good,"it was great experience working here.great culture ,freedom and openess but lack in professionalism and ethics"
good,good to work.
good,a good place to work ... atmosphere is awesome.
good,"When I would come into work, we would have stand up, telling us about our performance, and the expectations for the day, and what out group rates were at the end of the day of the day before. I have learned that it takes a team to make the criteria and expectation in a work environment. I loved how the managers, and staff kept us going, and just telling us how it is, not caring what the employees thought about it, its their job to inform us about the things we need to work on, and accomplish throughout the day/week, and whenever they seen I need help or more training they would be there immediately, I have to say management has a lot of responsibilities, and they make sure they do what they have to do to make there associates happy, and even when people dont like that, they still keep going, and keep the company steady. I always observe my surroundings, and the different attitudes of my co-workers, most of the time they had nasty attitudes, and think that nothing is far, or someone is looking down on them, I have also noticed that people are sometimes there to just play around, and think everything is just a game, until they get fired they realize that they should have payed more attention. Being around negative people is hard because it seems like I become that way, and I don't like that, I love just going to work, and being at work, around positive smiling people, I know things can be hard, and people get upset, but you just have to brush that off, and move on. I want to close with this, me being able to work, and not have a reason not to work, is the most enjoyable thing"
good,"I enjoyed my time there immensely. Management was always nice and helpful. Pay was decent, benefits were very good."
good,A typical day working amazon is working fast and standing for a long time. I learned how to work fast and useing the scanner. The mangement are nice and friendly if you dont know how to do something they will show you. Some of my co-workers were nice. The hardest part working at Amazon is standing for a long time. I enjoy meeting new people.
good,"amazon is a well organized complany, and i enjoyed working there. amazon always made me feel like i was an asset to there company"
good,it is a good place and has good people the hardest part is to get used to the pace of the work
good,• Using scanning guns to pick items.
good,was always was there to work because you got the treated the way you should and just great place
good,"Stand up meetings, how can we be productive and meet numbers. Proper way to step down and turn around or how to pick up a heavy item, management was awesome they would come and talk to you about numbers and where we should be at. My co-workers were just as motivated as I, leaving because peek season was over, hours were awesome 11 an a half hr days 3 days or sometimes four days a wk."
good,Very fast paced work environment with many great co workers and a pretty good pay.
good,"10 Hours on certain days weekly, learned a lot, management are well organized, people are friendly but quiet, standing on floor 10 hours daily is hardest part and I enjoyed being busy all the times."
good,Put away product onto shelves and move around a lot in the warehouse. Co-workers are on task. Hardest part of the job is to keep your numbers up. The enjoyable part is that the day goes by fast because I am constantly working hard and moving.
good,"It is a 10 hours 4 days a week, stable schedule, learned lot around the warehouse, managment are good, co workers play nice when you play nice, hardest part is standing 10 hours, enjoyable part is its indoor building."
good,"Work for me was great i focus on my job mainly because i want to get it done, I learned alot from scanning, packing, picking, and even unloading/loading trucks. Management was alrite some did not really help you learn things so i would have to learn from my co-workers in which i worked with very nice people that was helpful and easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job in making rate but once you get the hang of the job it becomes easy to some people and myself was easy to me."
good,Amazon was a fast-paced enjoyable workplace where I learned a lot about the industry and technology used in warehousing/distribution.
good,"After being hired by Integrity Staffing Solutions for the Christmas peak, I was hired permanently by Amazon in February. So far I enjoy working there as a Pick Associate. The only bad side is you have to work along side some folks that don't work as hard as they should so that can be frustrating. I try to just work as hard as I can at a consistent rate."
good,"Excellent Management, difficult to fit in, great pay, management has high expectation of MBA grads"
good,"I started with amazon.com in June 2011 under a 6 month contract and was let go on November 2011 from the contract, reason unknown. but the contract was ending so was released as employee instead of being kept as full employee. My only complaint is that they start you out as a temp and if you are meeting the company standards but the contract ends and they do not keep you then you are out as quick as you are in. As for benefits they might be great but as temp do not get them until full employee with the company. So just to sum up how I feel about Amazon.com as a employee, I would have to say awesome to work for a stress free work environment and great people to work with."
good,My typical day at work started at 6am in the morning. first all of the pickers so we can get ready to work. then when were all done we all split up and go pick whatever our scanners tell us to. Our first brake is at 10 ends at 10:15 then we go back to work. Then our lunch brake starts at 12 ends at 12:30. Our last brake is at 3:30 to 3:45 then we get off work at 7pm until the next day.
good,"Easy money, fast paced warehouse. Worked there during the holiday season."
good,Great learning experience and was the best temporary job ever had. I enhanced skills on speed of typing as well as becoming better with excel and other Microsoft platforms.
good,"I had some great/smart people around me and was able to learn a lot in my time here.  It was very different from my previous positions in a small IT shop.  Working in a Data Center has a very different mindset/skillset than I was used to, and the end result is that I learned a lot."
good,"I loved working at Amazon. I was one of the first hired in DET 1 , when it opened in Livonia & it was very nice. It was my first time working at a place where the supervisors and managers actually physically joined in on the work loads of other employees to help them out."
good,"They offer a varity of shifts you can work fulltime, parttime or flex (flex is you work when you want too).  And, they have morning, evening and overnight shifts.  The warehouse I currently work at they only offer parttime shifts (4.5 hrs per shift) and flex scheduling, meaning I choose the shift and how often I want work."
good,It is indeed a pleasure to work with a big multi national company. I learned most important skill - Team work. Also treating our customers as a friend is one of the best motivation for a customer support representative.
good,"Really great company to work for with lots of diverse backgrounds and opportunities for growth, as well as company benefits including medical and free transport."
good,"Very flexible hours, get to work on your own time. Also there is no dress code so you get to wear anything you like. Staff is great you'll get the help you need on your first day there"
good,At Amazon you will work 10hr shifts for 4 days and off 3 days....very fast pace. Great place to work. The managers are very supportive and involved. Management gives out snacks and prizes to show their appreciation.
good,"I had a good experience working with Amazon. I chose to work in a temporary position as I wanted to try to find up more about there culture and work condition. "
good,"Very good energizing team work, results driving, safety first, good incentives, hi-end technology equipment, excellent cafeteria."
good,The job was good and it pays very good. However the down side of working at amazon was the consistency of mandatory overtime. It is not necessarily a bad thing but for someone who wants to spend time with family and things like that it might be a struggle.
good,The pay is very good but you have to work hard maybe nights need to be very fit and can lift lots of work especially Oct thru January Christmas a good company as online shopping is only getting bigger you work hard you can go permanent
good,"Amazon is full of diverse people. And the community is fantastic. And most of the managers are great. However, the way they do things can at times seem like not enough. Or too much."
good,"I did absolutely love working for Amazon, and I do plan to most likely reapply on down the line, but just like anywhere else, it has it's negative aspects as well. I was hired as a Seasonal Customer Service Associate, therefore my assignment there only lasted 6 months. Apparently, Amazon has this never-ending cycle of hiring seasonal employees every 6 months. Depending on the demand, they might keep some people on and give a new job offer, and others  like myself can potentially be eligible to reapply after 90 days. A little advice to those beginning in my same position......they do not play with ""authenticating customers that call in!"" So don't play around with that. You'll know what I mean. Precision is everything with security and Amazon. Good luck!!"
good,There are times things could be run better but that's every company. Amazon really makes their employees feel welcome and ready to go. There is no shortness of kindness and motivation. Pay is good but full time is too hard to get into.
good,"Mi experiencia en Amazon fue bastante buena, aprendí mucho sobre el secor logístico y de todo el proceso que tiene un producto desde que se pide hasta que se entrega. Mi función era almacenar productos segun su peso y tamaño. Lo que más me gustó fue aprender tantas cosas nuevas y el ambiente de trabajo, y lo que me pareció más difícil fue el hecho de efectuar un mismo movimiento de manera repetitiva (ej. agacharse, coger peso) pero a medida que pasa el tiempo te acostumbras."
good,"Lavorare in amazon: esperienza positiva!"
good,"Can-do, go-the-extra-mile and win-win attitudes are evident signs of workplace wellness. Employees have a sense of camaraderie, cooperation, and empowerment. Healthy competition exists without vengeful, spiteful backstabbing."
good,".very fast paced , strongly put safety first and very good management good benefits from first start date 401k payed time off, unpaid time off, and Amazon stock"
good,Quota's were hard to meet at first and a lot of heavy lifting. There were some great managers. Good benefits and overtime available if desired. Biggest complaint was inability to get the job done because of warehouse conditions ie. lack of space.
good,"Really enjoy working for a company with tremendous upside. It is a very fast paced work environment, but having been in the military before applying made the transition so much easier. Not for the faint at heart."
good,I loved it...sometimes it’s a lot of work and poor management. Felt like they should pay more. I really loved the four day schedule and three days off.
good,As long as you follow the rules and do your job you will not have any problems working here. They are flexible and understanding so they work with you with any problems.
good,"Formation picking,packing,stow avec en tout une durée de 4 mois et demi"
good,"I've actually enjoyed working at amazon I've met people who became friends outside of work, and built bonds with a couple of managers. the job can be boring sometimes but its not too bad."
good,They’re a great company to work for overall would recommend to people who enjoy hard work but the benefits of your hard work will definitely pay off through out your working of the company!!
good,"Gute Einarbeitung, Freundliche Mitarbeiter, geregelte Arbeitszeiten"
good,"This is where I improved drastically on my time-management skills. Everything we did, time was involved. The time you clock-in, take your first call, average length of each call, number of calls and targets. It was a thrill and I loved it."
good,"I had a great time working at Amazon. It's just  I have to pick a career that suits me at the moment. I kinda miss the fun, the challenges, the trust of the manager I worked with."
good,Great pay able to work just weekends opportunities for advancement. The benefits are great as well. Wish the shift could start later but other than that no complaints.
good,Working in amazon  is real fun .Flexibilityin work is the key to the company . More fun and grete place to learn the work in amazon . Moreover its fun working.
good,"Flexibility with this company is good. The hours could be better and the pay is good. Can be stressful at times, but it's an okay company to work for."
good,"i would definately recommend this job to anyone. The rules are strict but its still a great company, nice environment. Management is great sometimes depending on who you have."
good,HVH hiring events day in and day out. The job is very repetitive. Pay and benefits are fantastic and you can negotiate both. Huge push for perfection and being the best. Be prepared to work hard and be innovative.
good,"Amazon offers a wide variety of opportunities for its employees. I have been an employee for 2 and a 1/2 years almost 3 years, and it's been an incredible learning experience.   I have set many career goals for myself and I am already climbing that ladder. I am very happy to be working for such a wonderful company."
good,"This was a work from home position. It was a flexible position where you choose your hours for the next couple of weeks out ahead of time and you must give a 24 hour notice if you are unable to work your shift. "
good,"its a production based job, workers have the task to pick, sort, Pack, and ship products for customers. Customer obsession is key everyday weather you work in the corporate level, warehouse, or the delivery station."
good,"lager arbeit sowas wie Pakete einscennen einpacken wegräumen,"
good,I loved the work culture. The pay was enough to live in Bangalore and there were more opportunities and growth. The building was amazing. The management style was very nice.
good,"lavoro dinamico, solitamente si iniziava con il briefing (riunione di gruppo per aggiornarsi su novità), ambiente pacifico e collaborativo, leggermente stressante perchè si è tenuti sempre sotto controllo ma nulla più."
good,Overall it was a chill company to work for. I applied to make extra cash for my europe trip. Didn’t think I would like it as much as I did. Met some amazing people. Work load is not easy so don’t think you can work there and not do anything. Must be active
good,Loved it I always gotten respect from staff members. The job was easy enough for me to have energy for family after work I loved it can't say anything bad about Phil 6
good,"Just got bored from being in the same spot for too long, and my heart just wasn't feeling up to my job...not to mention, my training during peak was not great at all...soo I feel like that effected my rate the whole time I was placed in Pack. I enjoyed it when I was moving around the facility and learning about all the different jobs. I do regret leaving, & would love to join the crew again,someday. I highly suggest working there, regardless the long 10 hours of work."
good,"DDE8 is a new facility with less than 6 months of operation time. As a start up, it is constantly assessing, reassessing, and working to optimize there logistic needs."
good,"job is very nice and i feel very good to work here. They prefer to safety of their employees that is the best part of the job . u can feel very comfortable at there."
good,Productive company who cares about it's employees.  Clear sense of what's expected on a daily basis and support to complete job.  Good management and work environment
good,"its cool, but it can be better. Amazon is a good stepping stone for those looking to advance into leadership roles since they hire from within. Positions other than management are are permanent part time. There are times (peak) when the company will offer a ridiculous amount of overtime for those looking"
good,I people are very friendly and the management is good as well. They have flexible hours and the environment was very friendly and safe. The people help you out a lot as well.
good,The company culture is more like start-up's and i enjoyed working there. Job wasn't hard but interesting. Management wasn't bad at all. I've learned a lot about the company.
good,This position allowed me to work and still be there with my family. Hours were flexible and the days worked were negotiable. This job gave me a sense of job security.
good,"I worked to facilitate logistics at an Amazon sorting center. I was surprised by how willing people were to help me find my way around the area. If I ever was unsure about what to do or how to do something, I knew I could ask and receive a helpful response. Overall, I thought it was a great place to do work."
good,The Amazon Canada is quiet professional and great work environment. They have a good payment structure and working there is quiet amazing. They have number of shifts which we can change according to our priority
good,Lots of good people and different job opportunities. Great for that first job or something you want to keep for a while. It is fast paced so be prepared for that.
good,Great company. Health benefits start the day you are hired.  Must be able to stand working in hot and cold weather.  Job is repetitive.  Management is great.
good,"friendly company, flexible schedule, strong job, good partners, good pay, opportunities for growth, benefits, offer overtime, pay holidays, clean buidling"
good,"Estuve muy a gusto, me promocionaron al poco de entrar (fui de la primera plantilla del BCN 1). Tuve que dejarlo por motivos estudiantiles, y todo el equipo me animó a que no dejara los estudios por seguir en la empresa. Trato humano de 10."
good,Amazon had a very friendly work environment but very strict time off task system Long hours which I happen to like . They pay very well would work here  again 8/10
good,Great marketplace to sell on. I recommend this site to anyone that’s looking for passive income and have that lifestyle of being free. I’m very thankful for this opportunity.
good,"Amazon offers flexible work environment suitable for any family, pay is okay, be customer focused. Amazon is respected by its peers and I have learned a great deal there."
good,"I loved working there. The care the managers had for their employees was great. We worked hard, and they pushed us to the limit but, also make it fun and you enjoy yourself."
good,The job paid good the people were very diverse and overall they had a couple of good managers. The job had multiple options where you can learn lots of new jobs that can benefit you when applying for another job.
good,Great company and a lot of room for growth. It is very hard to find employment and the interview process was very easy and quick with in a week I got my acceptance letter and was working
good,"I loved my job at Amazon and wanted to make it a career. And, today they said season over bye. We were told after peak season, we would have a job. Well, here I am unemployed. My family and I were depending on this job. I wish they would've been honest. But, I do thank them for the opportunity and the experience."
good,"Overall fun experience, I was a picker so at first it seemed a little difficult at first but after I got the hang of it everything seemed to fall right into place. I would work there again if I didn’t have to leave for school"
good,Amazon has Amazing culture and the tech space is exciting. The scale at which the challenges need to be solved keeps engineering teams motivated. You can move around different teams and countries based on your work challenges interest and the management is pretty open.
good,"I love working at Amazon. It's as if I'm getting paid to workout due to the MUCH walking we do. The pay is fare and you have opportunities to receive higher pay at times as well. My managers and staff are cool! The atmosphere is helpful due to the great attitude of most co workers and management."
good,good place to work and good place to start with cool managers good facilities and not that much work load. the work is good and we get to learn things.
good,Amazon does a great job of making sure that their employees have a great understanding of the task at hand as well as making the employees feel a sense of belonging.
good,Working at amazon is always fast paced and keeps you on your toes. Peak season and get a little crazy but management is always there to deal with any problems that arise
good,I am a stower and my day starts at 6:30AM to 5:00PM. I was trained to operate an order picker. My schedule is Wednesday through Saturday. The job is hard work that involves bending down and lifting boxes up to 45lbs.
good,This is a great place to work for and has great pay and benefits. I would say that the only downfall of working here are the long hours and very very fast pace but other than that it was great
good,"Amazon is a satisfying company to work for. They pay well, higher than I would expect for a warehouse position, and the management are understanding when issues arise or you need assistance. However, Amazon is, of course, a massive company and values results above everything else. You are expected to keep up with huge workloads even when it is more than should be expected, and to stay as late as needed to complete the workload."
good,"Work is physical and fast paced but includes benefits and has a guaranteed 40+ hes. Break duration times and regulations are difficult to abide by. Supportive team members,"
good,"At first, I had to get used to driving the P.I.T. TRUCK. However once I got the hang of it I was good. My only issue was time off task which caused an issue at my job. When I explained the reason for the time of task forbexampl they didn't feel that my reason was good enough."
good,"can't complain, just wish the hours were consistent. I would like to stay there but the hours refrain me from wanting to. The hourly pay is good but the checks can be slim."
good,"Must appear on stats that you’re striving to meet expectations of set targets."
good,"A typical day at work involves me driving incoming product around for 10 hours and stocking the shelves of amazons warehouse. "
good,Mangers are big on moving people up through the company if you are trying they will help you every step of the way. They treat everyone the same and give everyone a opportunity to grow.
good,"Great team work environment, you feel valued. When I hired full time your benefits are immediately active. They take accountability very seriously and expect you to stick to your schedule."
good,A typical day begins with stretches and a group cheer. Mostly on your toes working as efficiently and safely as you can to complete the task and make quota.
good,The pay was good work around some good down To Earth people  always willing to send somebody to help you if you are behind A couple of stop  You work 4 days on 4 days off but you can  Pick up extra days easy
good,Could Be A Place To Enjoy Work But Also Sometimes Over Work You. Its Loud Because Of The Machines But They Do Play Music For You. You Meet A Bunch Of Different  People Old Or Young.
good,I believe Amazon was a great fast paced environment to work within. I met and worked alongside good people and had good rates of pay. This is the kind of environment I enjoy!
good,Good structure friendly  management.  Flexible hours good pay rate. Lots of opportunity to move up in.this organization. They have a large variety of jobs to choose from. Overall it's a great place to work. Stress free environment.
good,Hier wird einiges abverlangt aber es ein super Klima im TEAM
good,Everyone was very friendly and understanding it was a good company to work for great benefits and wages the hours was a little much not much time with your family but they made it fun while u was there
good,Wonderful place to set up career and gain knowledge. Amazing Leadership principles to be followed by every employee. Very friendly leadership and management.
good,"Salaire: 11% au dessus du smic."
good,"Lavorare nell'Amazon è stata una bella esperienza, si lavorava in gruppo, lavoro collaborativo. Ti spiegano bene il lavoro. Buono anche il stipendio mensile."
good,I love working there good learning experience like my managers hey was there for me when needed didn't like my situation for me to get laid off for someone else but they stayed they went to the same class I went to but other than that overall haha thank you God bless Happy Thanksgiving
good,"Correct, ambiance assez cool, pas de pression "
good,"Forklift Operator,maintenance I bring motivation,safety skill and a open mind to get the job completed with respect and honesty work smart and look out for fellow associates"
good,"I loved working at amazon it’s just the travel and distance was taking a role as I was working nights and had trouble trying to get to and from as I don’t drive but other than that I would work there again, no problem grate source of income."
good,The people were nice all the resources you need are available to you. HR very helpful and useful. They also have the best benefits that I have had by any job I have ever work for.
good,"I've been at Amazon for about 4 months and I can honestly say, they got some kinks to work out.  During onboarding, things were so unorganized and crazy, I almost quit before my month was in.  I didn;t get all the training I needed, which was a problem. But after learning the ropes as I went along, I got the gist of some of the policies and rules of the facility.  Overall, the work is easy.  It's not very difficult work. In some departments though the managers may expect you to perform at a certain pace all the time.  Others don't. The management and leadership can be pushy at times but are ok for the most part. I'd say the hardest part is dealing with the mechanical issues that their facility brings.  Examples being running out of work for hours or a machine downstream breaking down because of excess amounts of work being received. The most enjoyable would be the atmosphere and the pay after working so hard on $15 an hour."
good,"A typical day working at Amazon would include assisting customers in various manners either through Phone, Chat or Email. "
good,"Everything is fast phase."
good,"Was working good first couple weeks, then they kept hiring more and more people that they got so over staffed, that they would offer VTO because there was no work for everybody."
good,"I would recommend Amazon to anyone who has the desire to become a team oriented employee, and to experience what it is like to work for Amazon . The job offers educational and investment opportunities. Overall it's an exciting place to work."
good,"Amazon provides ample opportunity and resources to grow within the company and to move abroad as well. Operations is a dynamic process and has regular updates or new processes so one has to be on their feet. The workplace culture is pretty ""chill"" in terms of on the floor activities, dressing etc. Facilities provided to the employees are also helpful in balancing work and personal life."
good,"Your daily job requirements are to, load your own van with 100-200 packages within 20 minutes. Each day your route will vary by location and van driven. You are expected to have delivered all packages within 9 hours. Your coworkers are immature, and lazy. High school like atmosphere filled with drama & unprofessional employees. Management is okay, and the pay is great!"
good,Really great place to work.. Can advance fast. Really good free eye and dental insurance. Easy money. Hazelwood location is mostly part time. Great people to work with.
good,It is a good place to work. I am fortunate to have gained experience working for Amazon as a customer service agent dealing with North American customers. During this period I gained valuable practical experience in fields outside my comfort zone. I also gained valuable insight into how to communicate with my colleagues of various age groups and experience.
good,"I found myself on a small, unique team at Amazon doing live corporate events. I had worked with most of my team members for at least 2 years before transitioning to this job. I found Amazon's compensation to be competitive and my manager was always sympathetic to my needs once I had my first child. All in all I found this to be a great place to work."
good,This job has pushed me out of my comfort zone and has allowed me to grow in ways I didn't think possible right after graduation. I get to lead a team everyday and help them have the best possible work experience. Every single day is different leading to different challenges and successes daily.
good,"good job , but not something to have all the time as a job delivery is sometimes far from one to another."
good,Nice work environment. highly productive and work orientated in a relaxed manner. Gained a lot of Experience as someone new into the job sector. Would recommend to anyone who has interest in customer care.
good,"Advancement opportunities are solid, benefits are great, pay is fair, time off is soliid for a warehouse position, management is spread thin but does their best"
good,Good environment to learn new things and i was also very excited when joined. I learned a lot from here. Bus facility and extra pay for overtime. Even a single minute is paid.
good,A typical day is of 8 hours but timing are quite flexible. There is no bossy cilture as such in Amazon. Individuals are given time and flexibilty to work and grow at their own pace. Management is very cooperative. Workplace culture is so nice that you wont find it in many other it companies. Salry at lower hierarchy is a bit less. And if you dont innovate within two years your growth will saturate and by end of 3rd year year you may be politely asked to perform or leave. But there is reward if you are consistent with good work
good,"You can have a good or bad experience working at Amazon depending on how you carry yourself, your relationship with your manager and your knowledge about your right. "
good,Amazon overall was a good company to work for. My only frustration with the job is your second break never feels like a break. Depending on where your station is you have a long walk to the break room & back it really cuts into your scan in scan out 20 minute break.
good,"It was a really good job and it had good opportunities, and pay rate was fair. It was  an easy application and the interview was was informative on what we was to expect."
good,I only recommend doing flex as a side job only. I don't see enough jobs available for everyone to make a full time income.  Please be cautious as to you may not get a job for days.
good,"Lots of Walking, lifting, bending, pushing "
good,"Good job to have. Lots of advancement opportunities, if you're a good employee. Their expectations are reasonable, as long as you're not a lazy person. If you don't like to work, this is not the job for you."
good,An excellent detailed description that provides opportunity to expand your skills in a fast paced environment as well as the diversity within the staff.It also provides an opportunity to climb the ladder to higher job opportunities.
good,"Amazon provides a place for you to work with some of the best people in the industry and therefore it has amazing learning and growth opportunities. "
good,"It’s hard work, but a positive work environment. $15 an hour is barely a living wage unless you work over 40 hours. I like the job, I just wish it paid a little more."
good,Great experience to begin with and possibly build a career from not the worst experience yet the time frame throws everything off given time and day they will become off track .
good,"great place to work at, excellent diverse staff. All staff enjoy working at the work place, and have many trainings doing their job."
good,First part of the day start at your department standup area and you get your daily tasks and goals. You can be trained with many Job tools and assignments. It can sometime lead into high tier jobs that amazon offers to just Amazon employees.
good,"Learned a lot, very fast.  The day goes by WAY faster.  Answered average 80 - 100 calls a day helping with anything from password resets, to kindle troubleshooting and locating shipments in India.  Each day was different.  Management (actually the lead team members) were the Crux of the organization if you ask me."
good,"Amazon was a fantastic place for a summer job in my experience. They pay was good, hours were flexible, and shifts were never longer than 5 hours long. Break room was very nice, well lit and colorful. As long as you work hard, the time goes by quickly, and you get paid on a weekly basis!"
good,"Your time off builds as you work there. The hours aren’t flexible at all. The job pays well, but the days are long. As the holidays come up expect to work 50 to 60 hours a week, with mandatory overtime days. There is no dress code, but you’re expected to meet your hourly rate of shipments. Managers are cool, and the job is enough to live off of, but it can be a stressful job."
good,"Not a bad company to work for , decent pay. Mangers are cool and very easy place to move up quickly in. Only downfall is having to deal with other associates ."
good,"Its a great job but the pay for the work is low. Management was great, super friendly. Co-workers were also super friendly. Work wasn't all to difficult  but very tiring."
good,"The overall work life at amazon can get overwhelming, but the pay is good. The life you live is completely based off time management. I would recommend it to anyone who’s looking for fast money"
good,"Un lugar para trabajar duro, pero para crecer tambien"
good,"The benefits are very good. Insurance is very affordable and it is very good insurance. The hours were long, but you only have to work a four day week. Overtime has become optional and you can work up to 20 hours overtime in a week which is paid time and a half."
good,Management de qualité et  règles de sécurité très mises en avant
good,Good atmosphere to work ...salary is good ....fast paced work environment ....mixed culture people environment.....happy go lucky .... benefits are very nice ....
good,"Working at Amazon is definitely a fast-pased warehouse environment that includes constant teamwork and daily variability in job function.  One day an associate could be sorting packages, another they could be loading pallets on the truck."
good,Great place to work. I Enjoy having a four day work week and three days off. Location is within 10 to 15 from my home. Health Care Benefits are excellent
good,"This was the best job I've ever had and would go back anytime. Best pay and benefits. Best training, HR and management. Best culture because the people strived for being great to one another."
good,At Amazon we believe that every day is still day one. A day to take a first step. A day to look forwards to new challenges.  It's your day to be part of something great. A day to make your ideas come to life. And your day to join a company that redefines itself every day. That's the energy and passion behind Amazon.
good,"amazing place to work to explore your true potential, Amazon builds you to be stronger mentally and think out of the box. The team your around are like a family and always support you."
good,"Fun and enjoyable place to work at, met a lot of cool people. Managers are very helpful and kind. Help me with any concerns. Kept me busy throughout the day and made day go by fast."
good,Mi sono trovata benissimo con i colleghi con la mia manager e il lid...il lavoro belo molto direczionato...posto bello...
good,"Ive been working at the warehouse in west sac since 2017, and it has been as good as a job can get. Amazon has a rep for treating workers bad, I have not had this expreince in my particular warehouse. The managers here go out their way to make every one feel comfortable. During the summer when its hot they walk around handing out water, caprisuns and other snacks. I like working here,its really easy. it can get REALLY boring but its simple."
good,"Enjoy working here, I have grown more than I ever thought that I could. I have learned that it is ok to try things outside your box. Management is pretty helpful for the most part when you need things done. Being out in the elements is hard on a everyday basis. I get to work with a great team and great customers everyday."
good,"The interview process alone gives you a good example of how data driven Amazon is when it comes to everything. It is a grueling process, but it prepares you for what to expect if you are hired. Culture is great and there is a lot of flexibility with being able to work from home occasionally which is great."
good,The Managers at the Amazon facility that I worked at very kind and respectful to the needs of their employees and will accommodate a change in your work schedule if you have religious needs.
good,The job itself wasn’t horrible but working 10hour shifts 4-6 days a week takes a toll on anyone’s body especially if you work in the heavy department like i did . I did the job for almost three years but when I had a child it was time to go . I wasn’t getting any sleep or time to see her .
good,"Nice place to work, fast pace considering the delivery requirements, highly recommended to those looking for a part or full time ob with the ability to work with others and ready to get the job done correctly,"
good,"I'm really glad I worked at Amazon for the period of time that I did. I received a stable source of income, got to be a part of delivering packages to customers, and learned some valuable customer service and work experience in the process. The only downsides to my experience there were the physical toll on my body from all of the physical work, and the lengthy commute to Charlotte from where I live in Cornelius (which required trips to the gas station every week during the time I worked there)."
good,Best place to  start career  and make carreer with. Great work environment and benefit for the exployee. Fast paced promotion and helpful management..
good,"Amazon India allows you to be yourself, It does not have rigid work culture. It allows the employee to be comfortable in who they are and bring in their your idiosyncrasies to the work."
good,"The company over all had positive morale and great people to work with. Management is worried about you as well as the job you do. Hours are fixed, but you can earn time for days off that rolls over. There are also many local and internal fun events to be a member of!"
good,"J’ai travaillé de nuit chez amazon entre Octobre et Décembre super ambiance, charge de travail correct et sécurité au top."
good,It's a overall great job and a good place to grow with. The biggest problem is management and not enough trained manager. The advancement to grow with this company is not limited but offered to everyone that want to advance
good,"Produced photo and video content for Amazon Fashion US. Duties included managing a three-million-dollar annual budget, allocating funds according to planned projects. Worked with tight deadlines, managed projects while working closely with marketing, social, and fashion teams."
good,"It’s constantly busy, there’s always something to do. Because there’s targets to be met. The breaks are not the greatest if your working long hours. But the salary covers up for that, great pay and even better that it’s weekly pay."
good,"Really smart people, a lot of opportunity for growth, always encouraged to be innovative, think big, and create something new. Developing a good management team is a critical component of running a successful organization. Managers not only supervise employees but must make important decisions that directly affect the company."
good,We have great health insurance benefits. The pay is good for those starting out but seems to lack for pay appreciation for those working there 5 or more years.
good,I actually liked working at Amazon. I never worked in a warehouse before. I worked for them for three years but I transferred to a new fulfillment and it was robotic and that was my downfall. They terminated me for not making rate for the week. Management would not work with me or help in any way.
good,Working at Amazon prime now is a fun place to work. You can find yourself working in either a big warehouse or in Whole foods. When working in the ware house you will be either picking items for orders or if its slow you will be stowing items in bins. When working at Whole foods you will find yourself running around the store grabbing requested items.  You pick up shifts on certain days of the week that are 4-4.5 hours long.
good,good place to work .  great pay . very strict  gives points for attendance . was not very good for my school schedule . Can make a lot of overtime during holiday
good,"I like working this company and I want again to star work, it’s nice jobs, not easy but like intelligent job, pay my check all the time I can make my hour.."
good,Worked at amazon but looking to relocate for personal reasons.Great benefits and pay.Work scheduling online.Able to view scheduling before shift and communicate with manager via email.Pay is great. Perfect location. Short travel time for employees commuting.
good,"I worked here as a seasonal employee so I cant say much regarding their policies & work ethic, but I can say that during the seasons its very full with all the new seasonal employees, & it can be pretty fun since they do a lot of raffles during that time."
good,"Followed verbal and written directions with accuracy."
good,"You will be worked. You will get sore. Give it at least 2 or 3 mos. before you get used to the demand on your body and sleep schedule. Other than that, be prepared to see folks get promoted all around you, no matter how long you slog it out. Nothing personal. But it's a foot in the door at one of the world's most far-reaching companies, right? Right."
good,"Amazon is definitely the place to go if you are a self motivated individual and have basic commons sense. You have to tell them when your ready to move up, they wont ever promote you because you're a hard worker. If you want it then take it (you own your own development)"
good,Get review of what to expect in amount of sorting for customers for the day. Work is steady and at pace that keeps busy all day long. Days go by very fast.
good,"When you first come in you're hired with a lot of people. The object of this is to see if you really want to work and if you want that job then you have to put in what this company needs from you to work. You're going to be willing to be open to change. That's the key thing other than being able to get along with your other team members. There is going to be times when your other members are going to need you. This is where the team player comes in to help with your order. You see, it's the willingness that helps drive a great company to work for. And believe this, the companies management does recognize y'all first hand! "
good,"Ho trovato un ambiente di lavoro molto stimolante ed organizzato sia nelle procedure molto chiare."
good,"I loved working at Amazon. The work was sometimes monotonous but the pay was very good and the benefits and extras were great! Great insurance, bonus every month, 401k, stocks, life insurance. They also give you gas cards if you dont have money for gas, you get free counseling, after a year they will pay for you to go to college, they have pet and legal insurance options, giveaways often, you can go to new facilities and train people for a month all exoenses paid and you get paid of course your hourly rate. Amazon in my opinion is a great place to work for"
good,fast paced and super busy at time. Learned to be fast on every task that is given to me. Management was great. Work culture is a mixture of every race. The hardest part of the job was getting timed for your job duties. The most enjoyable part of the job was the activities with the staff and management.
good,Nice place to work atmosphere was good.work schedule was good managers were nice to me people treat you with respect . Got to meet some nice people turn out to be good friends and they were like family
good,"Pros:"
good,"It’s a an ok place to work,depending on what position u have,it’s fast paced,some managers are ok n it’s hot in the summer time but any other then that..it’s ok"
good,The pay is competitive. It is a nice atmosphere and the people are great to work with. It is easy to move up and great to learn about operations. I really like working here.
good,"I worked at Amazon full-time for around 9 months"
good,"I really enjoyed the environment my fellow employees. The only issues that I had with the company were with a specific manager. Half way through my seasonal stay there, I was transferred from one manager to another because my previous manager got a promotion. My old manager was helping me out because the shift that I currently had {which i traded a pregnant lady for to help her out} was not working with my personal life. My old manager was going to help me to get my schedule switch so that there was no longer an issue because he saw huge potential in me. The new manager said tough luck and eventually i was forced to leave. However overall the environment was amazing and the people were very friendly. There were always doing special things or having special days to make things fun and add a pop of color to a slightly stressful work day."
good,"How is it that you worked for Safeway when you have all that experience in Accounts Payable "
good,Amazon is a company that is very fast-paced. Employees should be very strong in the walking category. It is a warehouse environment so you should always dress appropriately. Plan to lose weight for sure and stay hydrated.
good,"Quick and easy hiring process, great pay and benefits, fast paced work environment, great team morale and relaxed dress code. If you are a hard worker and willing to learn then this is the job for you."
good,I had a remarkable team and remarkable management it was very supportive. It was helpful to accomplish heavy tasks and In depth photo shoot. and video productions. The expectations were always realistic but at times could be quite stressful. However management was always helpful and open to additional assistance.
good,nothing to say thank you good job good place to work at and it a lay back jo no one bother youand there word with you it not a streefull job they listen
good,"good working culture. 2 days week off. you can give your suggestions. can maintain a good combination between personal & professional life."
good,"My experience been great...you have to remain focus, have a plan, and a goal. Once you have that you must execute! There will be distractions but stay focus and keep God First. There are tons and tons of career opportunity. I am so very grateful and blessed that Amazon came to Memphis."
good,Very fast paced real productive good team friendly environment.Quick on the job training understanding leaders. New equipment clean work areas to do the job most effectively.
good,It’s a great place to work I advice anyone to giv it a shot it definitely can take you places get all the certificates and training that you can that way you will definitely have a chance of advancement
good,"I was only here temporarily however it is a good company and has plenty of room for advancement, good pay, and good benefits. Temp employees are not treated as good as a regular full-time employee."
good,Very energized work environment that promotes team worker.  Ambassadors always motivate their teams.  Amazon always has all the equipment to be used by its employees on hand.
good,Good company but you will definitely work hard for your money! That was okay for me but for others it may not work. Training isn’t the best but once you know what you’re doing it’s smooth sailing. Overall not a bad company to work with!
good,"Each day the whole work crew would stretch and listen to safety tips after lunch and before starting shift. I learned about how Amazon gets products to customers. Hardest would be the long hours and the repetitive stowing, especially when it's all large items. Easiest would be the easy money you can make on the job."
good,It was a very awesome work experience. I got along with everyone. Also had the opportunity to work with some great people. I learned a lot there and would love to work there again.
good,"1. Lot to learn working with highly intellectual people around."
good,"good place to work ,good environment to work for. Work life balance."
good,"Its a fast paced environment and can be tasking but extremely interesting. New things learned daily, getting used to working under pressure when it is required."
good,"la mia mansione in amazon era fare l'addetta al picking e controllo qualità ,mi sono trovata molto bene in questa azienda. sono stato nel magazzino per 3 mesi, mi sono trovato bene tutto sommato, bravi colleghi sempre pronti ad aiutarti, staff affiatato, bravi manager. Purtroppo sono rimasta incinta e non ho potutto continuare ad lavorare."
good,Working for  Amazon was a great learning experience and the management was also good people who made sure that you got experience of the job and they trained you properly for the job. The dress code was very good and laid back. Always room for advancement in the company.
good,Amazon is a great place to work for anyone who is interested in entering a career working in a warehouse environment. If you have a knack to learn and enjoy a fast paced environment. This is a great job.
good,Amazon is a great place to work especially if it's a second job or student...great pay and weekly but its all part time..but theres definitely room for advancement in the company if u put the work in
good,Hiring process is quick and efficient no experience required. Excellent benefits effective day one of hire. Job is intensive and demanding but they teach you what you need to know.
good,"Working a 12 hour 3 day shift isn't easy work but its nice having 4 days off, the pay was the highest i've gotten so far so i loved that! Management is rather 'boys club' however. As a female worker I wasn't helped or given proper support while working there"
good,"Amazonians value leadership principles a lot and it shows in day to day work.  Meetings start with reading 6 page documents and then people dive deep into it.  A lot of thought and care is put into a project even before a single line of code is written.  Very little or no bureaucracy.  Great place to learn, grow and advance your career.  Although working in remote sites have its own disadvantages.  At times it appears that all the activity & lime light is on Seattle and remote teams have to fight it out for recognition.  Other than that I have nothing bad to say about working at Amazon.  People are wonderful & great to work with.  Work is challenging, engaging and enriching."
good,Amazon is an amazing company with a few issues. Advancement can be quick. Externally hired managers are paid more than internal promotions. Be prepared to work hard. If you like to be busy and have a sense of accomplishment everyday this is the place. The medical benefits are amazing and affordable. When’s the last time you heard that? Some associates are very difficult to work with but you’ll have that anywhere.
good,great place to work and motovistionl and it is very easy job and also good place to meet new friends especially if your new to the city
good,"Working at Amazon is always brilliant! Great company to work for and perfect workplace for growth and development. "
good,Very good support system. The training was very helpful and there was always someone there to help you. The schedule was at your own pace and always room to pick up shifts.
good,"I would love to work for Amazon again in the future. This was a fast paced environment with great people, great management and flexible schedule. I would work here again."
good,Bellissimo posto di lavoro ma con contratti di 3 mesi
good,"Working at Amazon is not for the light at hand. Furthermore, working for Amazon is  an achievement, more preferable to the fit & healthy. Anyone assuming they could be employed by Amazon while they simply go to work to converse with coworkers will not last long."
good,"Amazon is one of the best company who take care of their employees in terms of job satisfaction, amazing work culture and focus on their growth opportunities."
good,"Fast paced environment with opportunities for advancement.  Culture can be all consuming, must have the ability to effectively communicate your capabilities or may find yourself being crushed by the  demands."
good,I worked over night during peek season. it wasn't as bad as most people think it is. after the second break the rest of the shift flies by. as long as you are working safely at a reasonable speed then you will be just fine.
good,I worked there for a few months and I enjoyed it for the most part. I learned to pick and pack. People are willing to help and assist you in improving. Free drinks
good,You will do great if you find a mentor early at the company. Have them help and mold you to better employees for career advancement. There are few promotions available. If you can get all the available knowledge to be successful you should be fine and strive.
good,"Would definitely recommend, very consistent and great pay. My typical work day at amazon i scan in all packages, organized packages for them to be shipped out the next morning."
good,"if you're ok with not advancing up, amazon is right for you. need to make rate each day. took away monthly production bonuses and yearly stock bonuses."
good,"Good Place To Work. The Environment And The People Made The Job Worth Going To. I Learned A Lot About Different People And Also Exercised A Bunch At The Job. It Was Worth The Time, Effort And Money."
good,"I worked about 1 and 6 months on Amazon.  Working with TDR (Meeting deadlines, opening and closing of the roads. Pit drive (Removing pallets and replacing products inside the truck)"
good,This is a workplace where you can challenge yourself in different ways. There are many direct and indirect roles out there that can fit to your needs. Growth opportunities are everywhere if you are disciplined and ready to excel. Management can be a bit frustrating at times because of the constant department shuffles but other than that working at Amazon is pleasant.
good,Just show up ready to work and everything will be fine. That was one of my biggest problems. Also loved the management honestly great example of what managers should be.
good,"Quick paced fun environment "
good,"Best kob to work friendly , relax, good pay well supervised they show you they care easy job treat with respect flexibility on hours good people around"
good,"Our shift sorts over 100,000 packages daily and I take care of aiding by down stacking double stacked boxes. I also load machines that contain the packages so other workers can sort them out on a belt that leads them to the right destination."
good,"If you get to work with a desire to actually work and give it your best, then Amazon provides stability for anyone who needs a job. I worked there for a year and would've stayed. I left because of family matters and had to relocate."
good,"Working for Amazon is very simple. Your typical day is clocking in with your badge, attending the meeting, completing your stretches and learning how many packages you will be stowing or pulling that day. You use a scanner to stow packages in the bags, which separates the routes for the Amazon flex delivery drivers. Working in the warehouse is quite strenuous, you are lifting packages all day or night, it can be extremely hot inside the warehouse during the summer months, so please drink lots of water. Also if your pulling packages from the conveyor belt, keep in mind you have to move fast and your often working 3 to 4 lanes and it can be very exhausting. When I first started we were very short staffed, the turnover rate is extremely high and people complain and quit daily. About two months in, Amazon hired more people and it made the work load a little less exhausting for stower's and pullers. However it does take a lot of work and you have to be ready to lift packages that could weigh over 50 pounds consistently. The shifts are only 3 days in my location and you truly need the other four days to regroup. Its an incredibly simple job, however its quit strenuous and please make sure you accommodate for the temperature of the warehouse. Most people attempt to help each other out and its a pretty good rapport among everyone in the Fairfield, OH location. The managers are pretty great and they have a pretty good attitude when they come to work, which makes working hard a lot easier."
good,I have enjoyed to work in amazon logistics. i am vert fastly understand the work in amazon logistics.working in this company have great future for every employe.
good,Not interested in writing a review.  Supplied other information to assist others in obtaining information regarding working at Amazon.  I hope it helps.
good,"Working at Amazon was a wonderful experience for me. The job pays exceptionally well with plenty of benefits from 401k to lots of insurance options, etc. The managers and associates are all very nice and fun to work with. The workplace culture is pretty decent as well. Working at amazon is very fast paced and constantly making adjustments for those who are looking to be active. They also give lots of opportunities to advance in your career. Work there was overall safe as long as you don't take shortcuts. They have always make sure to warn you about possible incidents that can and have occurred to give proper awareness."
good,It's not hard. Just move the boxes. Management can get a bit power trippy and there are alot of people. But as long as u dont take it serious if you are just there to work you are good. And if you want to advance there are plenty of opportunities.
good,"Fun place to work at and can be stressfull and demanding at times. Quota's per day, must be met with little or no errors. Great place to make friends."
good,Very enjoyable place to work friendly atmosphere.  Training was top notch and training on different aspects within other Jobs.  Very flexible hours and schedules.
good,"Managing the operation has daily challenges. It is important to plan well and execute every hour.  "
good,"Un emploi assez physique mais très encourageant. "
good,"You would have to get to work before 6:30 a.m. At 6:30 a.m start working immediately. I did stow, so I had a big cart full of items and had to look for open bends to put them in. We had a couple of breaks and also a lunch period. The hardest part is just being able to be up walking the whole tie you are there. There was good management, they would check up on you and let you know if you were making the rate for the day. Meeting new people and having a conversation with them was the most enjoyable part of the job. I learned how to be more active with people and better my communication."
good,"Productive work place. Advancement, training, tuition reimbursement are fully available. Relocation far away or fairly nearby is fully available. Huge break room, a few couches. Free online computers  (10-12). Vending food is really good, changes completely every few days."
good,It is all good. The people are nice to work with and we were always treated well.  The work environment is very good (i.e. inside work). Did not have to put up with the weather (hot or cold).
good,A typical day at work was getting in seeing what was needed and attacking the problem head on.  Was also w cross-trained to be of assistance and help out wherever needed.
good,"There are really a lot of opportunities to explore and you get chance to work independently. A great work culture, there will be work pressure during the project submission"
good,">long but once you get used to it time flies by"
good,"I actually loved this job because of the pay rate, they give you a flexible schedule, no part of the job is hard, and I learned a lot of safety procedures while I was there."
good,"If you looking for a company to step up, then Amazon is the right example. Good chances for everybody independently of job experience. In addition, you get paid more than usual"
good,"If your looking for a full-time job with great pay and great benefits, Amazon is the choice for you.  Very diverse job so you will be around a lot of different people which is what I loved the most."
good,"I was a seasonal sortation associate @ amazon. Worked there for about 5 months before i relocated. Was an awesome experience. People were fun to be around, the ambassadors actually cared about us ""the team"" it didnt get too hot there, and the work was relatively easy. I'd definitely recommend Amazon to anyone."
good,"A typical day starts with a rally, then you are sent to whatever station you are scheduled to. You learn to operate a scanner, use conveyor belts,unload trucks, etc. Management was overall decent, but there have been days when they were hard to cope with. The hardest part of the job is finishing on time. The most enjoyable is an open environment and working with great people."
good,"I worked in Amazon for more than one year and I can safely this , if you are someone who is good at manging time and space properly, work focused you can work at wmzon peacefully."
good,Amazon is a good company to work for they have a lot to offer however bad management can really ruin a great company & the environment all together. I enjoyed most of my time there except for the end.
good,"Great job, and good benefits. They teach you what needs to be taught, and they also help you grow and learn. Packing and Picking are rather easy, especially after you learn what needs to be taught."
good,ns marchons beaucoup en pick se que j ai trouver dommage je n ai pas etait former sur d autre poste le pick apres plus de 3 mois c long
good,"Most positions are part-time. Therefore, you can pick the shift that works best with your schedule. A typical day is working in a warehouse setting. Pulling routes: basically, taking containers from shelves and placing them on a cart. Your route can be long or short which is called a training route. These routes are for those that are in training to learn to pull their routes. I've learned and can take away from Amazon, is time and safety. This is what Managers and Ambassadors express to workers so that employees get in the routine to be mindful of this daily.  Amazon, itself is multicultural. The hardest part of the job is management. To me the most enjoyable part of the job is being a team player."
good,Go to Amazon. Clock in. Get working scanner (not as easy as you think). Walk  for 10 hours getting items ordered by people or stand in one place packing them or stand in one place deciding if items returned by customers are fit for reselling.  Clock out. Go home.
good,"Overall, working at Amazon was an enjoyable experience; the work pace was quick but goals were attainable & the hours went by fast. The benefits provided to employees were great & the understanding and helpful supervisors were much appreciated."
good,This workplace is fast paced and employees are timed. Managers do a good job of monitoring staff to acheive maximum output from them. There is availability to various shift types. And the pay is good.
good,"We do mostly pulling, sorting, shelving, splitting, scanning of packages for delivery. A worker may do a variety of works depending on needs and workloads on a particular day or week. Hence work assignment may vary from day to day. The works usually are fast pace and timely. Mistakes and problems have to be resolved almost immediately. Also workers have to observe company's rules and safety rules at all times while on the premise. "
good,"This job is fast paced and some jobs can be very mundane and repetitive. Must make a certain rate at your particular job. Management was great and friendly. Most co workers were great but some can make it hard on you to make your rate due to cherry picking. Benefits are amazing and don't cost much. Long shifts of 10 hours but only a 4 day work week with 3 days off. Paid time off, unpaid time off and vacation time."
good,Amazon has amazing insurance. Very fast paced and must meet production rates. The lack of work at my building is my only complaint.  The managers have a hard time developing relationships because they must enforce rates.
good,i like working for this company. i constantly learned new skills that i can use when i apply for new positions. my co-worker are wonderful and management are very supportive.
good,"The project I worked on was interesting, I met many great professionals, and my work at Amazon set me up for success when I moved on to another company."
good,"Very physical job!! I did not mind the work, and enjoyed the environment, but my body has proven too weak for ten hours a day in a warehouse. Easy to get hired once they open slots."
good,"Great people to work with. Located at the new amazon warehouse in Omaha that opened in 2018, management is ok, couple of people are stuck up. Not too many cons. Also $15 per hour minimum for all of amazon employees!!"
good,Each position varies greatly as far as advancement opportunities and growth. Overall great company who values life outside of work just as much as day to day contributions. Great company with good benefits.
good,Good company. You can grow as employ and can manage your time
good,"So this place is a good place for a side job."
good,"Amazon fue un salvavidas en medio de la impresionante falta de oportunidades de trabajo que Colombia tiene actualmente, eso explica que haya mucho personal ""sobrecalificado"" atendiendo llamadas, fue una sorpresa encontrar tantos profesionales que nunca en su vida pensaron trabajar en un ""call center"" y que como yo,iniciamos con muchas expectativas dejándonos llevar por la medicina prepagada, la maquina de palomitas, el café gratis, el nap room y la mesa de ping pong. En nuestra curva de aprendizaje me sentía tranquila porque encontraba apoyo y comprensión pero sólo fue cuestión de semanas para que nos ahogaran las métricas y que unas personas no pudieran pasar el periodo de prueba por no ser el número que Amazon buscaba, por un lado debes regirte a las políticas de la empresa para solucionar los inconvenientes de los clientes, pero la encrucijada es que si haces lo correcto en una situación que pone en desventaja al cliente vas a recibir una calificación negativa de su parte y siempre va a ser TU CULPA, la absurda competencia entre managers porque su equipo tenga los mejores indicadores, estresa, indispone y presiona a que el equipo tenga que caer en malas prácticas y que se encasille a que los asesores sean buenos o malos por unos números nada íntegros. Es increíble que una empresa como esta caiga en estos errores tan vitales yendo contra la corriente de Bezos y haciendo infelices a sus empleados que tienen suficiente con lidiar con clientes malcriados que buscan concesiones todos el día, eso desangrará a la empresa."
good,"You will work hard, but is a fun place to work. You start with sick days and PTO available and accrue more as you work. Employee discount on Amazon items."
good,"Good place to earn money in short time. Why I need to fill this form I really do not understand, cuz I just wanted to skip this form's and go further, but looks like I can't without this text..."
good,The management team here is absolutely fantastic & very caring for their workforce! The actual site itself is the cleanest workplace I have ever worked in!
good,"Las condiciones laborales no son peores que en otras fábricas, en cualquier empresa te piden que trabajes duro, está claro que no te van a regalar nada. Si no te gusta el tipo de trabajo entonces es mejor que vayas a otro tipo de empresa (no vayas a otra fábrica porque será más de lo mismo). Pero yo, personalmente, prefiero trabajar aquí. En cualquier sitio me van a explotar, pues mejor que sea aquí que almenos pagan bien. Además está muy arraigaido el compañerismo y el llevarte bien con los demás. Esto evita que tengas discusiones con compañeros amargados, cómo pasa en otras empresas."
good,"The company has good ambiance and work culture apart from the work load. Work load can be easily managed with work life balance."
good,Travail avec de bons avantages mais qui requiert une adaptation vis à vis des horaires particuliers mais aussi vis à vis de la fatigue physique. Travail cependant bien encadré qui offre des possibilités d'évolution au sein de l'entreprise.
good,Its a fast pace work place I've literally have been all over when First stated here is either scanning each item and putting them in their location or pulling the items to the right rack for them to be scanned by a scanner but most fun for me is in the dock that's what I enjoy the most it is a fast pace and its like a workout and management is very involved specially at the dock area they are always there to help or answer to my experience very willing to train you in other aspects of the work
good,"Very supportive team, feels like family and i always enjoy working there. Would highly recommend anyone interested in working here. The facility is being upgraded to house more amenities for the employees which means more fun at work!!"
good,"it was really a moment to learn and grow at the same time, this job and a great job for those who like to work in a group and at the same time individually to achieve their goals"
good,"The pay is more then most places. Room for for advancement. 4 10 hr shifts 3 days off. Benefits. Closed on Christmas and new years.  40 hrs for vacation, 40 hrs paid time off, 80 hrs unpaid time off and year."
good,Great people and a lot of incentives. Great benefits along with it. Call in only if needed. They been there through my sickness an health meaning when i was sick i had also documentation to back up how sick i was so they will reverse the points.
good,"The management at Amazon are always communicating with associates, always making the work environment fun and enjoyable. Has a lot of great people who work there."
good,"Amazon not only made me think outside the box, however they established my career as an Analyst. Amazon is an amazing place to work. If you display dedication they will take care of you."
good,Amazon is a very fast paced environment and you must be able to deal with ambiguity to succeed. It can be rewarding and there are opportunities to try new things and learn new skills and industries
good,"basic shipping, packing procedures. rotation in different areas. a lot of work on peak season (Black Friday-after New Year)"
good,As long as you can keep up with the pace you be just fine. Breaks are not long enough. First one unpaid second one paid. During peek season be prepared to work six sometimes seven days a week.
good,On a typical day at Amazon we range on 35k to 50k of packages so there is no slow days beside maybe the first few weeks of the year. The management always make sure that we are well aware about safety but also make sure every package is sent out to every customer in ta timely manner. But there are sometimes that they rather have people that don't know what their doing than having people that actually get the job done. The workplace on the other hand is pretty much fun and stressful at the same time because of some days we will get hit with massive amount of items.
good,"Provided with hours of my choosing and the work was consistent with decent pay."
good,"I love my job at Amazon, but suddenly they said we have to move to another company and they will cut our pay. "
good,"Good shift patterns"
good,The work days where long and fast pace. I feel like if the employees where able to listen to music and had longer lunches then it would be a lot better.
good,"A chaque prise de poste on avait un réveil musculaire ainsi que les objectifs pour la journée avec un petit challenge entre les équipes du matin et de l’après midi un point SAFETY sécurité et un point qualité à retenir."
good,"hard work from September till December , crazy for Christmas , fun from mid January................................very proffessional managment........"
good,"Great place to work if you want to work hard and open to developing yourself based on the leadership principles. Day to day are tough days and very structured. Be prepared to commit to a decison and follow through by presenting your information via a document. The docs are what drive the business which will require you to look at your idea from 100 different angles with data to back you up. "
good,"I would work there again. Great environment, culture, and people. amazonians are a family. driving fork lifts and reach trucks are fun as well, makes time fly by."
good,"Before you start your shift you feel lil excited to go in and work. while, in the middle of the shift you feel tired already and wanting to go home so you end up cutting your shift short (vto) but if vto is not allowed that night, you wished you didnt go in that  night."
good,"Nice place to work, good benefits. Face paced lots of overtime. Good managers . the people are helpful and the training is easy. Anything you do t know just ask."
good,working at Amazon was cool the managers take care of the workers pretty good and operation managers played music for most of our shifts to keep us going thru the day.
good,"needs to improve being able to switch employees to do a job they can perform 100% at instead of injuring them in leaving"
good,Great work environment fast paced a lot to do stays busy  paid time off also provide unpaid time off and benefits are immaculate and also the 401k plan
good,"Amazon is a global organization with very strong work ethics."
good,"As far as employers go, they're pretty good. They expect a lot out of you as far as speed and productivity, but the management is also dedicated to making sure employees are able to get the job done safely and have ample opportunities for time off."
good,"fast paced environment,"
good,"Be business minded"
good,"if you don't like standing for long periods of time I suggest you not to work here. it is competitive, fun and all round quick work. Managers are kind and helpful."
good,"Bonne condition de travails, bonne entente avec les autres employés, sale de pause, boisson chaude gratuite..."
good,Quick paced but there is still much down time. Still in the beginning stages with this warehouse. Management is wonderful! Easy to talk to and willing to just sit there and listen to what you have to say. Very responsive!
good,my view on amazon is good work environment and managers whom talk to you and make sure you are doing the best job you can do. i like amazon personally because they seems to care about there workers
good,"I reall enjoy being a Flex driver. I'm considered an independent contractor,  and I'm able to work when I want  with the hours and monetary reimbursement made known before I take the shift. I have been in customer service for 25+ years , I'm burnt out but to free of spirit to be in an office. Being as flex driver allows me to not deal with rude customers . I drive to the location and if someone is there.. they are happy I'm bringing their item. Most times I drop the package take a pic then leave. My avg pay is $18 -$33 per hour. Anf I'm paid twice per week. Easy $"
good,"that was a good experience for me. They gave you a road and you have hundred address that you have to go to, you have an application, you have to scan all of your boxes and it goes on the application, you put all the boxes in your car and you good to go."
good,Amazon is a fast paced job focused on the customer experience. They promote a fun and safe work environment. The best part of the job is the challenges everyday are different and provide a chance to use complex problem solving skills.
good,"es un trabajo activo y dinámico indispensable mantenerse en movimiento, siempre hay trabajo por hacer"
good,"Made lots of acquaintances working in the warehouse. Amazon made working at the facility fun by providing incentives for working hard. They would offer snacks, food, have a mini basketball game, and we would even play smash brothers in the break room. The people really make this job worth while."
good,Amazon will tend to monitor employee productivity at almost every kind of job in about any department.  Several employees complained that they don't get enough time for breaks and lunch.
good,"Great benefits, learned  alot on with machines, management always on the same page, Safety Is a big thing which is fine. Working with great colleges. thank you"
good,Solve the hardest part of working as long hours standing in one spot all day it wasn't fine it didn't have too many days that you can get off work for peak season
good,"This job is honestly pretty good and not very challenging, it's just quite difficult to get the hours you need. There's an hour cap (usually between 20-27 hours a week), so even though the pay itself is nice, the available hours make it difficult to make a living wage."
good,Very fast paced company and physical. Great health benefits and plenty of sick time and paid time off.  they work very well with your school schedule.
good,Benefits are wonderful. Work/life balance was challenging. Tremendous potential for advancement if you're willing to challenege yourself. I loved working here.
good,While working at amazon I felt it was easy to get accustomed to. the only issues i had with the job was some of the managers at the site were not up to standards. The work was not to difficult but the pay rate should have been adjusted for those who were granted promotions.
good,Amazon allows you to become a leader and take independent decision. There are a lot of opportunity to learn new skills. Very easy to move between verticals
good,"Amazon treats people very fairly. They provide benefits equal to the amount of work they expect everyone to do and a daily basis. If you are a person that works hard and recognizing the benefits they provide, Amazon is an awesome place to work."
good,Amazon is a nice place to work so long as you don't mind the shifts. It offers a productive environment and the chance to move up when the positions are available.
good,I would go work night shifts and be very tired and when I try to work morning they would not allow it at all. I love working there but couldn't stay awake when I worked the night shift.
good,The days go by quickly. There is always something to do. Must be able to stand for a very long period of time. The pay and benefits are great. Overall a great place to work.
good,This job was a fun job to me only one complaint the dispatch associate's were very rude sometimes nice. My favorite thing was interacting with the customers.
good,they cared about their staffs mental well being so it was kept as a fun place during break times with a convenient store access for food purchase and such.
good,Just amazing atmosphere. It really felt as if I was away home planning my future with opportunities that could open doors I needed in order to survive for my family
good,"It was a good job, with nice people and it gave me the chance to learn a lot of new things."
good,"The hardest part of my job was standing eight to 12 hours per day!  I did however learn a great deal about corporate security.  The culture is very enjoyable.  The security managers determined your sites and assignment each day but there was a choice of up to 4 hours of OT, if you so desired. All in all it is a good 1st security job."
good,"Production meeting. Stretching exercises. Job Assignments."
good,"Working at Amazon was exhausting at times, but professionally personally rewarding."
good,"Fun place to work if you like physical labor, have strong attention to detail that's fast paced. You don't need the gym with this job since you will sweat a lot depending on the department. Seriously, sweating profusely is an understatement during peak. "
good,"For the person who wants to work but does not want to be committed to a specific schedule or set of hours, this job is perfect. If you are I the reserves you are only committed to 4 hours per week but if you would like you can work up to 40."
good,"Up on your feet all day."
good,I worked in Amazon 2 months. Its a international company. I also satisfied with their sallery but the 10 hrs standing job is not comfotable to me. I also have 2 month contract in amazon
good,"Was fun, never really played on it myself but was fun to watch others. made lunch and breaks very relaxing and kind of care free, its hilarious when people start getting competitive."
good,"Amazon is an Equal Opportunity  Employer .. I wish to transfer from NorthernCA to Southern CA , since my families are here. "
good,"Amazon was very fast paced. They had a 100% goal that you had to meet. They appreciated the hard workers, and tried everything they could to help them out. Including assigning a supervisor to help. I also enjoyed how clean they kept it, and how at the end of the day they made sure that everyone kept their station clean by cleaning it before they left. I also appreciated how they would have these little contests, and put music on to motivate the employees, and if they noticed an employee was having a bit of a hard time, they'd get buy the employee a soft drink to try to boost their energy. They day was long, but I appreciated the mandatory overtime since it made my paycheck pretty heavy. Another great thing about Amazon is they have very friendly coworkers in higher positions so they're easy to befriend, and love being helpful. I befriended 1, and he always kept my spirits high. We'd sometimes make fun of the packages that we'd sort through. Management is great. The hardest part of the job was when I learned I only reached 50% of the company's goal, and they had me get a work physical. The work physical determined I have a 50% lifting ability which means I could only lift upto 50 pounds. They needed me to lift 50 pounds or more."
good,"Great consumer-centric company, a good company from which to launch one's career; Fun workplace; Different shift patterns; diverse working population; Good building; Nice cafeteria and good food"
good,"Siempre hay algo que hacer, la gente tiene trabajo seguro."
good,"The work is based on meeting targets - everyone needs to make sure to put their best efforts to satisfy customers demand. I learnt the importance of everyone's input and the proper management of the resources. Although there are harder times, physically, closer to Christmas period, the job can give the satisfaction of working in team as well as an individual. There are also many perks connected to the job which makes the time spent more rewarding."
good,"My experience at an Amazon Call Center as a CSR was mostly positive. The work wasn't too hard, with each employee having access to an accessible and comprehensive database resource. The managers were good, and the pay + benefits was better than I expected initially. However, the calls are constant with little respite so even the most extroverted people can end up socially drained."
good,"Great place to work. Good people. Good pay. Very diverse"
good,"I was there 6 months and in 2 weeks of employment I was promoted to Ambassador training new associates in the picking process, "
good,"A typical day job is mostly on your feet 10-12 hours a day but its a great experience. You get alot of support with your co-workers and your managers. Even though you will have tough days with being on your feet, your pay at the end of the 2 weeks will be satisfied."
good,"I have been there all of 3 weeks and we are largely left to our own devices.  They give you video training on many aspects of the Sort Center, but you mostly learn from each other.  Put your head down and do the job they ask you to do and no more - this is the only place I have ever seen where over achievement is very much frowned upon.  If you have to put down your scanner to rebuild a pallet your numbers will go down, so try to avoid these pitfalls.  "
good,"I really enjoyed working there. Managers were great, very helpful. I enjoyed the fast pace of the work made time fly by. All the people I met working there where helpful and great to talk to."
good,Working at Amazon I've gain work skills to expand to other companies. It a fun workplace . Time and quality oriented setting. Safe and productive company. I enjoyed it .
good,The work it is relativ easy and the person from the warehouse are very nice and if you have a problem everyone will help you. The manangers are nice and when is the busy period the company offer free food and drink.
good,"Easy work, not stressful at all. Good pay for the work. Part time hours are controlled based on the ACA eligibility. Very relaxed work environment and managers are very nice for the most part. If you do the assigned work at a reasonable pace, managers really don't say much to you, but they are a very positive group"
good,Working here was a blast. The management was understanding and cared about you as a person. The various positions were easy to learn and had their own perks.
good,i would work about 12 hours a day just handing there picking items couldn't listen to music that job was really boring and they work you like salves the management was good
good,super expérience  bonne équipes ambiance agréable et bonne adaptation
good,"Le cadre de travail est agréable , amazone met beaucoup en oeuvre pour les employer."
good,"Its a really good job when you are working full-time. Part-time workers are able to become full-time but its a certain period you can transition in. Personally, I hated my hours. I wanted more because I felt that if I am going to work this hard in a job then I should at least get a larger paycheck."
good,"Have nothing to say they fired me because someone lied and said that they felt threatened by me sing snitches get stitches, I have nothing more to say"
good,"It's a good place to work if you need flexibility and pays above minimum wage, but it's not a job to rely on as your only source of income unless you can get a full time position."
good,The job was cool . Super tiring and super fast oaced . If you don’t keep up with the speed they want you to work at you’ll be fired after a while . So be careful .
good,"its really a face paced working, its tiring if you're working with people that are lazy and not willing to work as hard as us, because it makes the job more dificult and more stressfull"
good,"The job itself was stressful. You get calls from angry customers who are hard to make happy (especially around christmas time) "
good,"The job is fast paced and the coworker are nice the management team does their job really well, biweekly pays are always a plus . The benefits are solid ! Recommend"
good,Amazon is a good place to work lots of benefits and discounts but the place is a very busy environment so be prepared to work a lot. Sometimes it could be overwhelming but you meet a lot of great people and management is great.
good,I Enjoyed To Working At Amazon. It Was Fun And Exciting. It Was Different And Creative To Help With Employees With Any Type Of Situation. I’m Not To Sure How Flexiable They Are With Schedules.
good,Very Great anviorment with great people and great pay/benefits. they always tried to keep it a positive place to work. And were always doing things to keep you motivated
good,"I worked in a large sort center so it varies from locations and buildings so my experience can be different than others. You work long 10 hour shifts, sometimes 11-12 hours in a day if you get offered overtime that day. Some weeks you work 50 hours because of peak season (holiday season for Amazon). If you aren't in a lead/ management roll then you are in a rated function. You have to meet daily rates and if you fall under the daily goal you get productivity coaches and potential write ups and after a couple you can get terminated for not meeting productivity. You will be on your feet the entire shift which means you are constantly standing all day and sometimes walking 15 miles a day picking customer orders. You work in a really fast paced environment. Downside is the break and lunch times. You only get a 30 minute lunch and 2 “15” minute breaks which are actually more of a 10 minute break. There are multiple opportunities for promotion which allows you to go to different departments or even different building locations in other cities and states. They also have a program called Career Choice which allows you to go to school which Amazon pays for. They have great benefit options as well as 401K and Stocks (have you seen Amazon stocks lately!!!) I have met so many great people while working for this company."
good,"The opportunities to learn here are literally unlimited, and the opportunity to take on new responsibility is as well. I honestly believe you can be as awesome as you want here.Although Amazon is a large enough company that I'm sure there are good pockets and bad pockets. Everyone here is really smart, and wants to succeed both personally, and as a company."
good,Good job for extra income or people with no serious bills to pay. Can work up to 60 hrs a week during peak seasons and about 30 hrs during non peak time.
good,"A typical day began with an associate meeting, site updates, warm up and stretching, job assignments. The management was very engaging and participative. I had the opportunity to learn a variety of operations and skills. They encourage open communication and provided opportunity to offer input in all areas of the facility. The hardest part of the job is the rapid transition of the management team and constant change. The most enjoyable part of the job was the sense of teamwork and being a part of so much innovation."
good,"Enjoyed my time there, the staff and environment were quite nice. The management was also well handled and given. "
good,"Not up to date on the cost of living in the San Francisco Bay Area and the tech industry. (This was for AWS, not a fullfillment center). Low pay but great training options and benefits. If you are starting early in your career, this is a great place to start."
good,A great first job. The environment is fun and safe giving a lot of importance to growth and development personally and professionally. It also has a recreation room.
good,"Gotta be quick on your feet, Smart, and try not to overthink things due to wasting to much time which they do not want."
good,"If you are a direct hire to Amazon the benefits are endless. The worst parts of the job were that there was no air conditioning in a large hot warehouse, lots of walking, limited breaks, short lunch, and mandatory overtime. The best part of the job are the paid time off, overtime pay, and medical, dental, and vision benefits. I loved working here, I wish I had been able to say, but they do not have accommodations for disable people even though they claim to have."
good,"Overall Management can be a bit cumbersome. But as they say, this is only a stepping stone. The expected productivity might be difficult to make and keeping and eye on your Unpaid Time Off is a must."
good,"Working at Amazon has been the best decision I’ve ever made. The safety and work culture is fantastic. If you don’t get pumped up on the floor just by the safety culture to everyone has, this probably isn’t the job for you."
good,The only thing i can say bad about Amazon is that with out a degree there is no way to get into management.I have been there for a while and a lot of people come and go.The work place culture was fast and fun.The best part of the job was training new people and seeing them  progress in there positions.My boss made sure if you did something good he made sure you knew it as soon as possible.I started at 6 pm and worked until 5 to 6 am Sunday thru Wednesday and some times Thursday.If they gave more management positions with work experience instead of a degree i bet that a lot of people would stay.They would have days when they provided breakfast or dinner.I got a 2500.00 bonus when i was there for three months. Really is a good job but i want to be manager and at my age i dont want to be back in school.
good,Wonderful leadership that is with you every step of the way. Taking calls and making the lives of your customers a bit better for just being there to listen and help out in their distressed situation. It makes you feel like a hero at the end of each day
good,"Really nice place to work, they always look forward to work safe and team player. the timing is sharp and we always do a standup chat with all crew before start the shift."
good,"Working at Amazon was a great experience, with some faults. There was always work to be done and there was always a chance to move forward. The fault I found was in my department, new area managers always got switched out. This made it difficult to gain trust with the new managers in order to help with promotion opportunities."
good,The Amazon warehouses are a very fast paced working enviornment. Based off the different departments you work in you could work alone or with a group. Lots of different shift options and room for growth.
good,i loved my job. Im very tech savvy and helping people who never thought they would be able to fix their own issues is a reward in and of itself. All of my older customers love me due to my patience and sense of humor. I have spent 2 hours on the phone on a 20 minute problem just to make sure my customer was comfortable and satisfied.
good,Great work environment and culture. Plenty of opportunities to advance and gain experience. Management is very approachable and willing to work with you. Work can sometimes overrun personal life.
good,"Amazon has a wonderful culture of customer obsession and care for their employees. However, working in a call center is not something everyone would enjoy. It can be stressful, depending on how fast paced you're able to be. "
good,There is a lot of heavy lifting. Required to be able to lift and move boxes. Fast pace but everyone including managements are very focused. Great place to work
good,"Repetitive routine (part of the job, lol), quick-paced, and social-interaction friendly. Great management and amazing work schedule (get to pick our own schedule)."
good,"Amazon is a great place to work job culture wise. It's an employee friendly job offering great compensation and benefits in the job market. It's a place where can meet great people but at the same time you will meet less friendly people."
good,"Honestly one of, if not, my favorite job I've had to this day. Unfortunately, when there is a lot of new hires coming in, your job security starts to fall."
good,"Excellent management "
good,"The job wasn't very difficult, but it did get stressful at times. Management was very involved and tried to make changes when they were needed as well."
good,"60-80 contactos diarios, yo tenia libertad de accion con los clientes."
good,"its very fast paced, so if youre not meeting the rate of your department; you get callled out on it. other than that, it is fun & a great workout, dont have to speak to anyone, just do your job& leave. great benefits &  also, very big on safety."
good,Daily work consist of problem solving and sorting packages for delivery. Management is laid back and as long as you do your job it is a great environment to work in
good,"i would let people know about amazon jobs and that they have nice benefits and nice workers ."
good,"Great to work for, long hours, could use a better management system, managers were rotated or switched out too often to get to know someone on a first name one on one basis."
good,"Great benefits, very busy & repetitious. I have no complaints, except the 12 hour shifts overnight doesn’t work well with just having a baby. Otherwise great company."
good,"The travel distance was not the most ideal for where I actually lived. it was a fun work environment with great opportunities, But overall I enjoyed the job."
good,Amazon is a pretty nice place to work. Most of the people are friendly In the job is not that hard to do. The biggest thing for me is that it was very repetitive work and that there was a rate for almost everything you did. After awhile I just got bored.
good,"big screen tv in break room. vending machines in break room ,good health vision and stock benefits. 401k and on site am-care and human resources and several breaks during the work period"
good,"I enjoyed my experience at amazon, working alongside the mini robots and machinery. The morning stretches and staying productive was a plus. The training was easy as well."
good,"Amazon is not for everybody. It is a fast paced company that demands your absolutely all no matter what. No matter how over bearing the job can be, they still aspect your best efforts"
good,"My review on Amazon is that it was a great place because they cared about your needs, always checked up on you and the pay was pretty good. I would definitely recommend this job for a lot of teenagers."
good,Great Learning experience. Would recommend for people who are just starting out. Non Flexible hours. Environment is dull but safe. Ive learned how to be a great team player working at amazon
good,"Fast paced, non stop, long hours,enjoyed the people, I learned I am not a robot,supervisor was okay, when things broke down had to sit around or go home"
good,"My experience with Amazon was okay. Great place to work, the people I worked with were high spirit. Maintaining rate was a barrier for me on the order picker and I did not want to leave on bad terms."
good,"You get to work with some exceptionally talented people from all over the world that bring a fresh perspective to challenges and problem solving. Each brings a new challenge and and management is always willing to listen and consider a new idea or process change to solve a problem, meet a challenge, or even a new product or service."
good,Working overnight was rough for me because I have children. This is a great job for college students or children right out of high school. The job is very fast paced.
good,"work in a high spaced environment, willing to lift heavy boxes, shipping boxes down a conveyer belt or you could be packing the boxes that day scanning the merchandise to go in the box to be shipped out or you could work in rebinning which is putting merchandise in the bin to be shipped out. or you could be scanning all the merchandise to be put in the bin"
good,"Great offices although the locations have their disadvantages, people are awesome, friendly and always helpful.  The jobs have a purpose  fitting into a well defined overall plan."
good,"Amazon has a positive atmosphere. Management is great and the benefit package is amazing. There is constant opportunities for advancement and growth. The only down side is the work hours at my specific location, all locations differ in work hours."
good,"It’s easy work but you are on your feet the entire time so it’s bad on your legs and back. One you push through that it’s the EASIEST job in the world."
good,"Good place to work, great hours, good pay and more but i had to move so i couldnt work there that long so i had to quit and find another job. But i had great experience there."
good,I wish I could go back I love working in a fast paced environment.  I lied the people I was with especially the managers very nice and helpful. Even though we working 12 hour shifts they would give us two 10 minute breaks and our lunch
good,"Start off with a meeting and go into daily stretches with high energy, they like to have everyone involved and enjoy their time at work. Training should be reworked as some people were unable to properly build a pallet"
good,"Management is very good"
good,"Amazon is a great place to work, you get to learn a new thing every day.In Amazon you get a lots of time to learn and have fun"
good,"Worked for company for almost two years. Never had any real issues involving management, work performance or teaming with other employees. Overall good."
good,"10 hour shifts 4 days a week"
good,"Honestly amazon is a cool place to work at cause than you learn how things get to your house ,but the pay does suck I think they should pay us way more because Amazon makes billions and we only get 12.25 starting  but tap out at 14.35 that's it and our raise we get every six month only 0.25 cents. They should really care more cause California is expensive to live in .Plus side the benefits are great."
good,I enjoyed working for this company. They empowered me to perform at very high levels and I was compensated appropriately for my performance. I left for a possible advancement opportunity with another company and wish that I had not.
good,"Working at Amazon was physically challenging, but very positive environment.  Flexible with shceduling, and very good benefits.  Very  diverse group of employees. Was a good experience."
good,"The department that worked in was great. I had to find employment outside of the home in order to get childcare assistance, You were able to set your own schedule or jump on if you had extra time in your day."
good,"Working with amazon is like having fun along wih work. Its an awesome place. amazing job. Its been 20 months working for Amazon. Its a great feel, having said got so many good friends."
good,"I was with the company for almost 4 years and learned so much about myself, how to drive a business, and develop a great sense of what makes a great employee."
good,"The on site location I worked at had several vending machines, seasonal dinners. Play room for breaks."
good,"Fast paced environment, certain numbers to hit hourly, boring at times, fun management, paid half hour break, unpaid lunch.  Not a bad company to work for."
good,"Days fly by at Amazon but the work can really wear on you. I learned alot about leadership and exemplary work. The management can be completely one-toned at times, however. The hardest part of the job is again, repetitive. And the most enjoyable part is the workplace is generally very casual, and managers will actually listen to you to an extent."
good,"I liked working for Amazon, but the only thing was its just a bit far for me compared to where i live. The work was a little difficult at first because i wasn't used to walking 10 hours a shift but it took me about a week to get used to it but it panned out."
good,This is a great company to work for. I love coming to work everyday. The managers and the associates really care about there work. It's like a home away from home.
good,"Amazon is one of the best places I have ever worked for. Sure there are kinks to figure out as within any company of this size, but overall a great company to work for ."
good,Amazon sticks to their employee slogan. Great way to move up if you are hard working and put in the time and dedication. Great chance to travel the country if you are willing to relocate
good,If your a fast worker or likes to work in warehouse industry. I personally liked it cause it's the right pace for me. I'm a a person that takes challenges.
good,"its a good place to work for due to no over time recently, living is hard.. i wish they had atleast 2 days of the extra over time. i would be happy at amazon for rest of my life.. Overtime is needed the most but they don't have any to offer right now and that is the sad part"
good,"Competitive job, very fast paced. If you find a good friend to work next to the days/nights can go by fast and sometimes be fun. If not, the days/nights can be very long and tiring. The pay is really good and they are always doing free giveaways and advancements within the company."
good,"Days are fairly busy, but from top down there is a solid group work effort, that is stressed, and repeated daily. Most employees in due time learn this, and strive to meet this minimal amount of effort."
good,"Amazon is a good company to work for. Always room to advance. Also, After been employed for a year, You can sign up to go back school or continue to move up in the company.."
good,Amazon is a good company to work for. They provide associates with the opportunity for advancement along with the coaching for everyday work. My typical day includes receiving inbound freight and transporting freight into the warehouse. The Amazon culture is always about safety and priding themselves on staying safe.
good,good enviornment but sometimes they demand more than your capability.otherwise they are best to do warehouse job.need to give more salary to workers.all in all good .
good,"It was a good job with several work schedule options to choose from to fit your life.   Good pay and diverse culture.  Great for extra pay, especially around the holidays.  Love that if you wanted to train for a special position, you just talk to your supervisor and they would fit you in a train class."
good,"Working at amazon is great, the environment is very fast-paced which makes time fly by. Advancement opportunities are open for all employees. Provide health, dental and vision insurance."
good,A typical day consists on meeting up with your group when you arrive to work to perform mandatory stretches. After your stretches you are assigned to your station. I learned how to worked individually as well as with a team. We often have fun little competitions within our group and the building. Management on my the side that I worked on was more organized in my opinion. The hardest part of the job is managing your time considering it is a big building. The most enjoyable part of the job was working as a team and receiving an extra check bi-weekly just for being there everyday. Also they offer VTO- voluntary time off which does not count against you and multiple raffles and prize opportunities.
good,"Amazon is a fast pace warehouse, I have learn how to pick, pack and stow. Management overall was good, the hardest part was during peak seasons and it was the most enjoyable part too."
good,"Amazon is a great company that helps entry level software developer grow. There are a lot of broad cast and course resource you can use.  "
good,Productive Company and promoting of position advancements. Very enjoyable workplace with efficient management. Proceures and processes that were beneficial to excellent customer service
good,Amazon is one of the best place to work. Always insist on high standards and think through the problems from customer side. I was very fortunate to spend 10 years in Amazon. You will have complete freedom to share your views and express your thoughts. Your smart work gets rewarded for sure.
good,"You are expected to perform in a fast paced environment with high rate output performance and accuracy on every shift. If you perform on the low end scale, Amazon will coach and make sure you understand what is expected of you everyday. No time to socialize. Every part of where you are assigned is monitored by computer because you work with scanners for all the items you pack, pick or load for transport. "
good,Fast paced and clean environment. There are a lot of different kinds of people there and everyone seems to be excited to work. I guess I have to add more words to this in order to submit it so that's what this last sentence is.
good,Amazon is avery face-paced environment. Rates required to be met by the end of each hour and are recorded. Management is very helpful when it comes to daily information.
good,The pay needs to be increased. Over worked and under paid. Cost of living in going up. Only .25 raises. Caps out at 13 as a tier 1 associate. Besides that the job isn't bad. Love that we get paid personal time plus vacation time.
good,High Security and very fast paced. you walk A LOT and do heavy lifting. you stretch with your team in the morning and have scheduled breaks. You work 10 hours a day 4 days a week and OT is sometimes available.
good,"Amazon.com is an exciting fast paced work place with some of the best minds challenging the improvements in the process within the operations. A great place to learn and understand how retail operations grows and build skills to improve people leadership.The hardest part of the job is to catch up with the accelerating growth of the company and keeping up with the demanding objectives. That being said, the results are fruitful to experience and one can learn a lot if supply chain and operations is the field someone is interested in."
good,"Co workers are helpful.  Benefits are excellent.  Best insurance I have ever had.  Work is very physical!  You will be sore after working 10 hour shifts, but your body can adjust."
good,"Recommended as a place to start a career for management and logistic, however working hours may not be suitable for most people because this job requires 10+ hours per day. Additionally, the company's compensation and benefits are very good and they offer a wide selection to fit their employees needs."
good,"I was a work from home call agent. Working from home has its ups and downs. Being a college student, this position was perfect! The only things I would improve is transferring calls/asking other departments for help. Its hard to stay motivated to fix a problem when no one else is sometimes. Also, Amazon policies are ALWAYS changing meaning, one day you can be explaining something to a customer that might change tomorrow."
good,working at amazon you always have to watch your back everyday. and work hard everyday. good hours. some  bad HR people and some bad management. I learned to always watch my own back
good,The pay is great and so are the hours. Lots of paid time off and vacation time. The environment is cool. you meet different people daily and its just great
good,This is a great place to work if you're looking for something at night for a second job. The work is repetitive so it's very easy to learn and incorporate new techniques into your work that'll make you faster and better at your job.
good,Greta overall experience. After graduating I got stuck on the floor and good positions were reserved or off limits due to current position. Work/life balance is questionable but you do what you have to do to succeed.
good,I worked there for 6 months and I was making a good amount of money (Avg. $300/week) with only working 5 hours per day at the most and 2 days off. You can also meet a lot of great people up there
good,Working at Amazon is a busy fast paced environment. You learn how to use scanners and also see the things the sale there . The hardest part about working there is that it could be cluttered sometimes and also keeping up with production.
good,"We work 40 hours a week, 4 days a week ,10 hour shift and 3 off days. We have a diverse of ethnicity throughout Amazon. I have learned how to dive deeper into the work assignments that are presented to me on a daily basis and have a backbone when and presenting problems to upper management ."
good,It was a very fast paced job with decent pay. Management was usually kind and knowledgeable. Pretty easy and decent work. Opportunity for advancement.
good,Ended too quickly for me.  I really wanted it to work out but my disabilities got in the way and ultimately was the reason for my termination.  I will miss it.
good,I really don't want to do this. But it is a great place to work and I think I would work there again. The Casual environment made it very nice and the co-workers were very friendly. Management was definitely helpful. And I don't think there was enough time for lunch but let me stress involved it could have just been me.
good,I liked working in the quality department st Amazon because it gave me a sense of pride to ensuring  that I was providing the customer with their correct order and that it didn't leave the warehouse damaged
good,"If you need a summer job, or just to get more cash for groceries, amazon is a great company to do it with. They have pretty flexible hours and its not very hard work. It requires some effort but not much."
good,Amazon is a great place to work at the same time have fun in life. Tension free zone but with great management and hardwork anyone can reach higher levels very easily.
good,"amazon was a fun, energetic, and fast paced work environment. the managers always are nice and the ones i had always tried to make work more fun, especially with the long hours that really helped."
good,"I enjoyed working at Amazon. It provided a lot for the worker to feel less stressed and to maintain a good work ethic. Overall, working at Amazon was safe and financially it provided enough benefits and pay to live off of."
good,If you find yourself in a postion that plays to your skills or strengths then you can happily work away so consider the job role you take carefully. Any encouragement that management give you to bring you up and make you feel good about your performance the agency can be sure to bring you right back down again. Colleagues are down-to-earth and an accepting bunch sure to keep a smile on your face. Managers are a great bunch too. Others will say different but its all about outlook and making sure you work hard. A good company culture is my number one important thing and due to the mix of cultures here this is the best environment iv worked in everyone there is very kind and respectful of their colleagues.
good,"Amazon is a good place to start your career, however in India there was no opportunity for growth because managers were always hired from outside and there was grooming of subordinates."
good,"The wages are definitely the highlight of working for amazon, and they have work schedules that give you the option to spend more time at home with their 3 and 4 day work weeks. The work requires either a lot of walking or a lot of standing in one area, and the shifts are long. Its not the job for everyone, but it can help get you through times where better isn't available."
good,"The hardest part of the job were the long hours and days on your feet. However, the most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with associates and being able to create productivity plans."
good,steady work pace environment. Learned to keep track of inventory and went over and beyond meeting goals and productivity. Been recognized numerous times as being in the top percentile in counting
good,"Working for amazon you meet a lot of people . You clock in go to your department and you department manager starts you out with stretches and safety tips for the day. They let you know what department you will be working in that night or day. Meeting so many people and spending so many hours on a day to day basis with the people that work there they become more then just you co-workers, they become like family."
good,"Great benefits and stability with a strong and positive work environment"
good,"loved working at Amazon. very fast walk all day long . it makes you physically fit & trim in just a few days.  loved working over there. as an order picker, we had pick light to heavy items from shelves."
good,"Despite my personal feelings and release from the company, I'd still recommend it to others for the pay/benefits. They even have stocks you can invest in."
good,Great place to work. Coworkers and managers are great. Facilities are great. training is comprehensive if a little boring. Time management is up to you which allows a great freedom but at the same time you must be the one to discipline yourself.
good,"The culture at amazon was good. They provided several benefits such as personal time, vacation, and voluntary time off which greatly appreciated do the work load you would experience during certain season. These benefits showed how much they cared about their associates."
good,I love my job! I enjoy working from home my leadership is amazing. Pay could be better but I make it work! I have gained a lot of experience in many different departments in a short amount of time I earn bonuses every quater and get a raise every 6 months again I say I love my job!
good,"Very straight forward job, nothing is too complicated as long as you pay attention in training or ask for help. There is also breaks throughout the shift so thats always a good thing."
good,"Amazon is a great company to work for, but there needs to be a revamping of management. The compensation also needs to be reconsidered to fit the cost of living in the area. Amazon claims to research competitive pay, but only matches the lowest rate."
good,Basically what I did was run the assembly line loading and unloading boxes. I got two 30 minute breaks. My hours were 4p.m. to 4a.m. I would have to say my least favorite part about the job was rapping pallets.
good,"Amazon is a good job to work at, they give you great benefits and great hours. I like amazon but i need a job thats willing to pay a little  more money, but i do recommend this job to anybody applying."
good,It had all sorts of things to do during lunch and breaks. Everything was upbeat. Everybody tried to make sure that you were safe in everything you did.
good,"There are a billion microwaves and refrigeration space in break room.you can watch 4 tvs while you're in there."
good,Good place to work. Warm and clean. There you can make a lot of friends because you find people from different cultures. A labour day is long enough to earn some money.
good,It was and awesome place to work but hours can be rough. The environment was very friendly and we had plenty of rest to work ratio in the warehouse. Amazon is and awesome place to work.
good,Bon esprit d'équipe
good,Amazon is also a place of employment where u can get easily terminated.But if you are a determined worker you should with stand all of the obstacles .
good,"I enjoyed working with Amazon as a picker and thrived in the fast paced,target driven environment."
good,"It was good place to work, its fast paced job. You have to be quick to keep your quota up. You work four hour/ 10 hour days. Pay is good. Benefits are good. You get stock on day one."
good,"The days are long, but then you have a whole extra day off.  "
good,"I like it a lot, but with kids the hours are hard to work around to get home in time to take kids to school or pick them up kind of thing when you have to travel its hard to handle a family life as a single parent."
good,"Although it can be a hectic environment, there is job security. But when you're isolated in departments such as Pick it can be a bit monotonous, and hours can vary during holidays and Amazon's own events. Overall if you're looking for stability and don't mind the physical and sometimes mental strain of a crowded environment with a lot of personalities then I would definitely recommend."
good,"Initially I enjoyed the stigma surrounding the title of EA at Amazon.  However, that excitement wore off quickly.  I was responsible for 5 directors, their departments of about 50 people and the VP of the department.  Lots of work for one person for the pay they gave."
good,If your willing to dedicate a few years to get into management then it can be worth it. Long term job advancement in a growing Industrey/Company then apply to become an Amazonian!
good,"I am a seasonal associate at a logistics facility in California.  It is a new facility and as such, there have been many changes as they try to figure out what is best.  I really like working there.  We operate 7 days a week but for the most part, everyone works 4 days per week.  The night shift is 11:30pm to 6:30 the following morning.  Time goes by quickly because we are busy sorting packages as fast as possible (they rate your speed and accuracy).  They can put you in different areas each night if they feel like it but you can also tell them what you like or don't like and they listen.  Some associates don't care about speed so they move at one pace all night (slow).  Other people move fast and care about their jobs (they are great to work with).  This goes for all levels of employees.  I think it's cool that they hire all types of people.  We have really old people, disabled people, a guy who speaks sign language only, shy people, outgoing people, all types.  As for the work environment, it is fun and kinda peaceful.  Not hostile at all.  The work is easy to learn, too, but training is done by associates who don't seem to have experience training.  So, you're kinda just thrown out there to figure it out yourself."
good,It was a good place to work. But management couldn't make up their mind and what rules they wanted to set otherwise having robots bring you everything was really easy good benefits great pay
good,I recommend Amazon for someone who either knows that one day they would like to work for the Amazon Company in more of a management level there is a lot of opportunity for moving up. I also reccomend it for someone like me who knows she doesn’t want a career in this field but needs a good paying steady job until I can finish school and start the career I want.
good,is great  to work with Amazon is more every day what I do is helping the people problem solve finding out the problem and I work with the team together
good,"Helping and assisting processors do their job to their fullest potential."
good,"On line business in Amazon is organized and well programmed."
good,Work environment was very fast paced and did not really give you time to talk to many co workers other than breaks and lunches. Long hours going around picking items.
good,"Perfect for the senior high schooler or the studious college student looking to get by. Awesome during peak season for picking up extra hours to put away cash for a rainy day but horrendous during the normal year unless you work more than one job. Essentially its move up the ladder or stall out, but the management is pretty good and easy to talk to. Everyone is friendly for the most part, the pay is satisfactory for the effort it takes, and the management is always showing their appreciation to their employees with giveaways and performance recognition. All in all its the perfect part time job for the young student or a retired individual looking for some pocket change."
good,malgré un travail assez fatiguant car beaucoup de déplacements et piétinement une ambiance de travail agréable dans l'équipe ICQA
good,"My managers were very positive people, we all worked hard and they praised us for it. It was very demanding, but after a few weeks you get used to it. Since I was seasonal, I had full health coverage, paid weekly, and worked good hour Building always felt cool and water everywhere. They were very strict on lunch breaks and fifteen minute breaks."
good,"I loved working with the company, but at times it felt like your voice wasn't always heard. I was quickly hired on as a permanent employee from a seasonal agent. After this, about six months later I applied for a few newer positions and was promoted. My promotion involved starting up a new department with other agents who'd applied."
good,"Amazon.com is a fantastic company, filled with monumental opportunity, inspiring leaders, and driven missions. The Amazon culture is a very rigid copy-and-paste of its Leadership Principles. Although Amazon is destined for innovation and future goal-settings, their scrappiness and Bias for Action philosophy at times hinders their quality and attention-to-detail."
good,"easiest job I’ve ever had, at first it seemed overwhelming at first but once you get the hang of it you get used to the long hours of being on your feet."
good,"Company is okay. Management is great, but only speaking from my experience. Going to school full time and working here isn't easy. Good job for someone that's interested in warehouse jobs. Room for advancement but it takes being liked by the right people. Long hours, boring, i just can't do one thing for 10 hours, hardly even moving or talking to anyone."
good,"Amazon is a great place to work as far as benefits and schedule. It is hard work and they expect you to meet certain expectations that you can easily meet if you put hard work into it and don't stand around and socialize like many of the younger associates like to do. It is very hectic around Thanksgiving to Christmas as it is the busiest time of year. This is when you make really good money as long as you don't mind the OT. Gets kind of frustrating with the extra inexperienced people that are hired, but if you remember that you were a newbie once too, you will get through it. Advancement is difficult (especially if you are an older (age) employee. They seem to favor the younger crowd and will work with them more than they will you even though you have the years of experience. They also tend to hire area managers right out of school, so if you are ready to graduate, apply at Amazon and you stand a real good chance of getting hired into a good position and most of them stay on after their ""internship"". You can also transfer to different states if you are planning on moving out of state and they have an Amazon facility in the area. They also will pay (90% I think) for school for almost any class you want to take and it doesn't have to do with anything Amazon, like getting your CDL, becoming a Vet Tech or IT Tech."
good,"You have to move fast but it is a fun place to work, and the overtime pay is really nice the hardest part of the job was having the items in a short time and really have to positive attitude."
good,It was a nice place to work and they had good benefits it just took the energy out of me at times. They had a shift that was very convenient for me but they got rid of it and that’s what took a turn for me
good,"Amazon has a really good place for work. Sistem perfectly works for everyone, They have amazing benefits and stock options. Managers are ok. But it's really hard to move on. You get stuck on one position and they less likely to move you on."
good,"Great Job for people to grow just think starting pay can be a little more. Offer programs to employees to help their lives, and equipment on site to use."
good,"Amazon is a great place for team building with friendly competition. Management does a good job keeping morale high and are always fast to lend a helping hand,in all i would recommend working for Amazon for either a first job or for a seasoned worker."
good,Such a nice Work place ever seen. Work will be so relaxed an I have learned lot of new Technologies. The Leadership management provide nice benefits to the Employees.
good,"work'ing and producting"
good,"I really did enjoy my time at the warehouse fufillment site. It was pretty relaxed, as fast-paced as it could be. There is no slowing down when a quota needs to be met, but they have fun with it most of the time. From the people working there - to the small rewards that were pretty awesome. We’d stretch every morning (mandatory), we’d go over the work the previous night and set goals for everyone. They played music on the speakers and people were up-beat most of the time. But, wow, was management the worst I’ve seen. There was no communication between the managers and Ambassadors. Someone would tell you to do one thing, and another would come around and tell you something else. That was really my main concern working there, but that’s really all - in my honest opinion. Yes, holidays were hectic and it was HOT, but that’s life working in a warehouse. I’d still go back to work ther  in the future for sure."
good,Amazon is overall a good employer. The company provides health benefits at a reasonable rate and also gives stock to employees who stay there for a while. The work environment is fast paced and can be stressful at times. The pay is adequate for the work required and the benefits and time off are a nice incentive as well.
good,"I started out as a temporary associate with a staffing company at and Amazon Deliver Station in Dedham, MA. I was promoted within the staffing company to a Coach. Eventually, Amazon held a conversion period and converted the third party associates into amazon associates. I was converted over into an Ambassador position which is essentially a coach and an associate trainer and person of contact. A few months later, i switched to the day time and learned how the return to station method worked. I soon applied to be a level 3 learning coordinator and within a couple weeks i was promoted. I relocated to Milford, MA. It did not take me long to get comfortable . In a nutshell, if you strive really hard, managers will eventually try and grow you. I had much support in Dedham but not so much in Milford. My reporting manager and station manager did not understand my role and they were very unsupportive to my role. It was difficult to work with them because they did not listen. The associates were great. We all worked together to pull through and get the job done and all of the staff were friendly."
good,Amazon is constantly trying to improve the way they do things. The job is always changing.
good,"I didn't work at Amazon very long due to it being peak season and the work load eventually died down. But other than that I liked it their. They gave rewards to their employees, very particular about employee safety."
good,overall it was a good job it just took time to get used to because the hours can be a little crazy especially during the holiday hours but other than that once you get used to you its great
good,While working at Amazon you are constantly trying to achive a high rate of work while you are competing with people of your team and teams around the warehouse.
good,"All the managers and co-workers help each other to achieve everyday  goals. It’s a fast paced work that I love, it is a big company and you never have a day like the other."
good,Working at Amazon is very fast paced. You have to be Quick and pay attention to details at all times to get a good percentage rate. Also be able to handle the hours and mandatory overtime.
good,"I liked working in Amazon, hope to work there soon again. The people are awesome, nice and good-hearted :) Always helping me if I had any problem.  :)"
good,Good place to work very fast paced depending on job a typical day at work consisted of walking picking items to be shipped off to the customer and handling a high amount of items.
good,"You got to be the laziest person on in the world if you don't like working here."
good,Over all had good experience work with Amazon.Managers r good but not much helpful.good and safe environment.Work is little hard. break rooms r awesome. Paid vacations and also UPT.
good,"The employees are very cool and friendly especially since everyone does the same job. The weather is unpredictable and it is usually hot inside the warehouse. You must be able/willing to lift extremely heavy packages and stand on your feet for the entire shift. If you are able to make friends, the job is pretty fun because you get to stand and work with your friends for hours. The job is non-stop so the day go by extremely quickly."
good,"Great Oppertunties, friendly people as long as you do your job you'll never have problems with the company or staff. managers are usually friendly with staff"
good,"my typical day at work would consist of being someone who makes sure that all the workers have work, make sure that the packages are being sent out correctly and making sure no mistakes are made. I learned that amazon is a very fast paced company and really shows u the value of hard work. the management is good, but not great.. sometimes the managers ask you to do more than what u can handle... the hardest part of the job would be the long hours and the long amounts of time on your feet.. really takes a toll on your body. the most enjoyable part of the job is that they do games and raffles for prizes."
good,Only good thing about amazon is that I had a couple of my friends working with me. Supervisors and managers were not on my good list and always wanted to single me out.
good,I was a picker days feel so long breaks where short and took forever to get to the break room did a lot of walking just to get to your station going to the bathroom was a problem cause u get time off task and get in trouble
good,They have really good management and benefits! If you need a steady job with really good starting pay then this is the place to work! Staff is very helpful and friendly!
good,"Entreprise motivante."
good,"Amazon isn't for everyone, there are many different jobs there but if you're willing to put in some hard work and sometimes, long hours, especially during Amazon Prime Day and Peak, it could be a very rewarding place to work."
good,"I absolutely enjoy working for Amazon, great environment and management is pretty good. The hardest part of the job is picking up your coworkers slack in a labor intensive environment. Most enjoyable part of the job is actually doing the job itself. I happen to enjoy sorting boxes. "
good,"Amazon is truly committed to creating the best possible experience for their customers. As an Area Manager I worked a lot of hours and spent more than 80% of my time doing physical manual labor. On the upside, there was ton of room for growth and the compensation is unmatched."
good,"Working at amazon is good. I really liked the flexible hours that I was able to get to choose. I learned the ""behind-the-scenes"" of what goes on with packages after pressing ""buy"" on the website."
good,"I worked part-time, but am not sure I would enjoy it as much if I were to work full-time. I could see how a lot of people would like it for the full-time benefits, but I physically don't know that I could do it."
good,It was a great place to work at they have good opportunities.  It was a fast paced.. Everyday was a challenge to where we tried to succeed.  We always try to surpass expectations.
good,"The communication with HR is a complete train wreck. Everything else about the job is completely ideal. They also work with your hours. It is just unfortunate that, despite it being their job, HR prevents you from maintaining job security."
good,"at amazon each warehouse at shifts try to outdo the others, you could be on top one month, have the same performance the next, if another shift out does you then your upper manager is upset from the top down, if another warehouse out does you even by a few units then their chances of advancement is in danger and they will either let it slide or crack the wipe out so they can get ahead in their career, depending on how cut throat the upper management is for each building."
good,it was an overall good experience. associates made it hard by not doing their work and not respecting upper management. the only time it was good was when it was beneficial to them.
good,"On a typical day I would handle 15 - 40 cases.  Some of these came in as phone calls, others came in as emails, though even with the the emails you were expected to attempt an outbound call to the seller."
good,The oveall job is very fast paced or consistent at times. The breaks are only 15 minutes. There are two sides of working the more slow paced side is manual and the automatic side is ver up beat. The warehouse is very gloomy and there is no music or energy from anyone.
good,Overall a great place to work at. Wear comfy shoes since majority of any shift you're on will have you either standing in place for several hours or constantly running around assisting in places as needed. Friendly attitudes and personalities all around.
good,"The position is production based and especially during the peak season (holiday traffic), things can get a little hectic. There are great benefits and there is a  great potential for promotion."
good,"Busy and steady work, great work environment with a diverse group.  They provide a lot of training for multiple areas in the fulfillment center.  Communication is difficult at times during peak seasons with the volume of people."
good,"amazon.in is the company where you can learn alot and there are many chances to growth,"
good,"Not much communication amongst peers..seemed very competitive..like a race every day..need longer training..management seems to listen sometimes..it was all about the business..every job is timed and sometimes it gets to be a rat race..need to screen employees more.low pay, never saw improvement in 2 months with pay."
good,Hardest part of the job for me was working on the pit machine. Other then that I really enjoyed working there. Most of Management is nice and helped when needed it
good,great place to meet new people and you learn new things daily.  People come from all walks of life when you work at amazon and the pay is great at the time
good,"Good place to learn and growth is slow and mostly cant maintain Work life balance salary is low, good independence on workplace thoughts encouraged...."
good,"I love amazon for the benefits. Being a picker, I often worked alone. The main thing i disliked was keeping up with 100% rate EVERY WEEK. After a couple of weeks without making rate, you will get written up."
good,"The job would get very very physical at times, to the point where would have go a round the conveyor & pick up the that would fall of the belt, because amazon so many packages & not a enough workers to make sure this doesn't happen."
good,Good environment job is easy management is okay its pretty easy to move up if you want to they give you an option to change locations and train as well a travel
good,"Alot depends on the department you end up in. There are three different departments. If you end up in the end of line, good luck. This job is very physically demanding. You will be sore for months."
good,"DDA 3 Was a faced paced location, many people need to realize that it is logistics is always moving, so training and doing it right was always a good thing. The Management always pushed us forward and made sure our safety was priority."
good,amazon is a great place to work. the management is simply awesome. they care about their employees. they listens to you whenever you have any issue with anything. they give you work from home most of the time for female employees. transport is the best. have not seen any other place with such a great transport facilities.
good,I only worked at Amazon oner the summer yet I made multiple friends due to the friendly work environment. Working at Amazon was my first real job and to start at $12.50 was amazing. But working 10 hour shifts with an hour and half of cumulative breaks was honestly brutal and tiring.
good,"Amazon Flex is a great way to supplement income. It is hard to get enough work and hard on your vehicle, but I think the overall work environment is good."
good,"I worked here shortly as I failed a crb check after a few weeks, my time there was good, a bit hard some days because there wasn't enough staff weekly pay was really good also."
good,"Amazon in Peterborough was opened for Christmas time only when i was working there, there was a great atmosphere, friendly contact with management  and also work wasn't hard"
good,Great pay and loads of benefits! Work life balance is not so great but that's okay. Top technology is used at fulfilment centers. Change is frequent so everyday is not the same. Could use one more 15 or 20 minute break throughout the day.
good,This was a good place to work with plenty overtime. I will say it is very busy and they have production quotas to meet. It gets hard to keep up at times if your not used to that kind of work.
good,"Amazon sort center is a work in progress, they listen to their employees ideas and suggestions while trying to improve the work place every day.  Great part time job normally 4 hour shifts in evenings. Only down side is other associates do not take this job seriously or have bad work ethnics. Team work is the key to this kind of work harmony."
good,Working from home in convienant. Although a lot falls on you to maintain as far as internet complications etc. Not a bad place to work at all just some things are outnofnyour control
good,"I work at Pack Department. I enjoyed the fast pace work, packing packages ready to be shipped. I am amazed how start to finish where the package goes in Amazon. While learning, The managers/Supervisors are very helpful teaching new employees to get started. While i had prior experience in Warehouse setting. It was a second nature with me. I liked being able to work many different positions in one department during the day. Work is reasonable and expected to work fast pace. Work hours is 10 hours a day is standard. The hardest part of the job would be work place culture. Since Amazon has diverse culture, people from all walks of life. It would be great if a company put professionalism top priority addition to work ethic. Overall Amazon is great place to work full time and always work to do during the day."
good,"Tiring and fast paced good pay though but no benefits, you have to deal with a bunch of lazy people too. If your looking for a fast paced job w good pay this is the job for you."
good,A balanced work/life situation and a good variety of projects. The creative workers were treated with respect and the environment was good. Only drawback is lack of advancement opportunity for contractors.
good,"Work hard, have fun and make history. This is the motto. The warehouses are clean, noisy and management watches what you do. The jobs are not hard but you need to concentrate on each job, be safe."
good,"Je travaille en équipe de nuit et l'ambiance y est très bonne, le travail est physique mais ce n'est pas non plus ""l'horreur""! Les managers sont tops, très à l'écoute, donnent de bons conseils pour faire de meilleures ""prod"" ils sont également très performants sur les gestes et postures à adoptés pour ne pas se blesser."
good,"Demonstrated my ability to think out side the box, manage change and resolve ambiguous situations. Also demonstrate ability to prioritize and manage multiple projects simultaneously. Extensive knowledge of industry programs,and trends."
good,"Everyday we stock shelve, but are sometimes moved to other position to help other departments for few hours to the whole day.  The leaders of each side of the buildings communicates to worker the best place to stow.  They also tells us the best approach to do work or extra information happening for the day or the following month.  Every month we get a meeting for each department regarding the building and the company, and new information for employees to take advantage of.  The most difficult part of the job is that you sometimes work in a different department for a whole week or more."
good,Work 10 hrs a day goes by pretty good. Management is great and theres an open door policy for any concern you might have. Fast paced culture. Repetitive work is probably the hardest and most enjoyable would be interacting with different people.
good,"One of the best companies I have worked till date.Transparent work culture and good management.It truly stands by the tagline workhard, have fun, make history."
good,Good job to have nothing too much to worry about fairly easy good pay and good benefits too. Just in my opinion not very exciting work to do in my case.
good,"A typical day at work is fast paced stressful with people shouting left and right, machines constantly humming, positions constantly changing, few minutes of break. You learn to be quick on your feet and competitive. Management is always at their post and on your back for something. Workplace is very fast paced and constantly moving."
good,"there is not a dull moment and the job keeps you on the move so you don't get bored while just standing around,management team always there to help and will hear your opinions and are willing to work with you"
good,"Very busy on a daily basis as there is many orders being placed constantly. "
good,"Great people, safe working environment, lots of activities and promotions to get involved in. Nice break room, benefits from healthcare to paid time off are very good"
good,"Highly organised atmosphere, professional management. My tip would be to choose the workers more wisely. The best aspect in this company is that you can grow in the field very quickly."
good,"Great place to work, yet i would like to see better management. Advancement is important in a career and if management doesn't want to promote they won't."
good,"Most of the people there are amazing and there are tons of different positions. But it can get really stressful really quick. That aside, I know lots of people who have been incredibly successful there."
good,"After having enjoyed nearly three years as a picker for Amazon, LEX1 is becoming much more of a customer returns center than a place to pick merchandise. In the process, not only are the areas where merchandise is stocked becoming overfilled and harder to negotiate, they will also adversely affect your expected rate in terms of both quantity and quality. Furthermore, LEX1 is expected to become a full-blown customer returns center by 2019. By then, there will no longer be opportunities for pickers and stowers at LEX1."
good,"Clock in by 7: 35 ,and from then till break, its constant work and no play. Every, and all of the work an employee does is monitored closely, as if, he or she is under a magnifying glass. The time that employees are not doing work, for example, interaction with a  coworker, going to the bathroom, or getting water, etc., is also monitored like a hawk monitoring its prey. The whole day is like a bad dejavu that you know actually happened because its the same thing you did the day before. The most enjoyable thing about the job are the people including managers because they were very helpful. j"
good,"One of the best places to work , if there is chance to go back will definitely take it."
good,I liked the job when I was working there as it was easy work as I was a packer and it was a friendly place to work at as I meet a few friendly staff that helped me through the weeks.
good,"A typical day at work for me would be payroll, admin work (HR) holiday, working with Management, metrics Then lots of adoch, where I have to prioritize."
good,I had fun at the job but at the same time I was a hard worker and made good progress and decisions I will recommend anybody to work there I was really loved it there it was the best job I ever had
good,"A typical day at work - just work til the end of the shift , what i learned i learned to invest in your brain , managment is good and kind , workpalce culture is high"
good,It is a nice place with beautiful people who work hard and have a good time . It is a good job where all people is happy and work with pleasure and we  learn a lot of thinks like work as a team .
good,you get good bay. the bad thing is you don't get paid time off. everyone will work with you if you don't know how to do the job. you can get a lot of hrs. make good money
good,"Hard to get in, get on the right team, and you be successful. Live and Die leadership principles. I have enjoyed my time and learned alot from alot of great people."
good,Really great co-workers and management is always helpful. The need to make rate is hard though unless there is actually work in your area. The hours are long and your on your feet the whole shift. Can be exhausting at times.
good,I worked part time as a fresh associate. It was easy if you stuck to yourself. Work was basically shopping. You shopped for people as if you were shopping at the grocery store.
good,I was OK with the job but i don't like that they rush you if you like word of advice  dont work there if u cant be fast because  they want u to rush they like competitive people
good,"Fast pace work environment, fun you get to meet new friends and a lot of fun activities, good benefits.the company pays for your schooling and they also offer classes on site or you get to choose what college you want."
good,"I like working at Amazon. It is good for international people. You have many options to visit your country, or family back home without loosing your job. That the most in working at Amazon."
good,"it is not only customer obsessed but employee obsessed as well."
good,It was fantastic job where I did I always miss them my team member and my leader. call centre is my best experience in my life. when I was talk lots of person every day from everywhere in India. when I leave job I had some issue with my family only that why I leave my great job.
good,"I learned about the importance to keep a fast pace for my work as KPI and performance are essential for the running of any business.  In addition my work can be a significant input towards the success or failure of the company I work for, there is therefore no time for mistakes or poor practice."
good,"The day starts with start up. A gathering of all associates and management in my department. The area manager tells us our goal for the department and what we need to do in order to achieve our goals. I was a stocker but worked in different departments, such as receive(unpacking merchandise), Packing, picking, ISS( rerouting misplaced merchandise).Most of the job duties require you to maintain a certain rate. Management was always busy and friendly. The work environment was very fast and quiet. I learned how to work with a team and about the career choice program: the program pays 95% of tuition and fees. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with rate. I like Amazon benefits and working as a team. This was enjoyable to me."
good,There is room for advancement in many fields of expertise. The best way to move up at Amazon is to always take the opportunities provided to you at learning new tasks.
good,Good place to work some one is always willing to help out its always someone there for any Question you may have. And if you do no how to do the job that was giving to you they give you to get done.
good,a typical day at amazon was okay and could be boring sometimes. I learned different departments while I was there. There wasn't anything hard about the job. The most enjoyable part is learning different things.
good,"Job security, always guaranteed to work 40+ hours, medical, 401k, stocks, paid time off, met lots of cool people with lots of experience from all fields, had lots of opportunities to learn different jobs."
good,"I was part time at the Holabird Plant (Fulfillment Center) for a short while, it was a great place to work.  "
good,"Going in early to work is key because parking can be hectic. Clocking in is quick and easy, we get three breaks total. One short break at the start and end of the shift, and a thirty minute lunch break 4 hours into the shift. I worked in Universal Receive, so I scanned items of varying weights and sizes into totes. Being able to lift boxes 50lbs is a crucial part of working at amazon. These totes were then pushed down the line to a different department of the warehouse. While working at Universal Receive I learned to work fast, and be organized about how I work. The hardest part of the job had to be when you would get pallets of work with a low item count on it making my rate low for most of the day. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you receive a pallet with boxes with high item count on them. A pallet with high item count means that its possible to have high rate for a long period of time. (Depending on how quick one works of course)"
good,"Some coworkers were getting along with you, some weren't Management are very understanding. Job is physically demanding but somewhat worth it. Most enjoyable part of the job is working with others as a team."
good,"Working for Amazon I had the best experience, they treated their employees  like family. Here I was trained to operate a forklift, something I had never done before. Endless opportunities."
good,"Lots of work, minimum training and onboarding. Should spend more time with temporary help to ensure longevity of employment and possible extension into full time employment"
good,Not enough pay for the work and it was kind of stressful.......working for 12 an hour they should pay 17 at least that would be reasonable for the kind of work
good,"Only reason I would leave is for better hours and pay. Everything else is great. management is great,  Good working team open communication. Its a nice place"
good,"Depending on what department your assisgned too your more then likely have a quota to fill, be sure to try and meet that because they can dock you write you up or fire you for failure to meet it."
good,I have learned a new thing everyday about Amazon and its work culture. I learned about new tools and technology to analyze the data and create reports.
good,I am still learning as the days go by I'm sure Amazon as a company will not let me down on any of the promises they have made to my as an employee. Within my first week I've seen a dollar increase $13.15 to $14.15 it made me feel valued.
good,"Excellent Workplace"
good,"If you apply for a Reserves CSA position, you have a flexible schedule which is very convenient for individuals who have families and must make constant adjustments. Learning the work is simple, there is paid training. I have no complaints about this position."
good,"As my position as a Picker, There is constant walking. You have to keep a quick pace without running, so you fast walking for 10 hours straight. Other than the constant walking, bending, knelling, climbing and lifting, the job is easy and the benefits make up for the physical demand."
good,Amazon is everything you desire when it comes to wanting a work environment that gurantees hours and is not too much stress on the body. The only downsides are lack in variety and occasional bad leadership. In my experience I grew in a department that eventually couldn't provide anything new to learn or develope on and when i request to learn more in other areas I have to go as far as changing departments entirely or even shifts. When it came to management or leadership most of my seniors were great to work with  but you come across that guy that abuses his power every now and then but never got too far out of hand due to checks and balances.
good,It was fun at first but as time passed it was a little more difficult due to everyone not pulling together to get the job done but over all it was a great place to work.
good,"Amazon is really cool place to work with. They treat their employee with dignity and with respect. Here, you ll get a good growth opportunities only when you work hard for it and be passionate about it."
good,Good work environment and work quality just tough schedule. standing for 10 hours on concrete. management is good and they seem to care about everyone
good,Amazon work culture stands alone from other companies. It always gives you complete feel like home thought. One awesome place to work is Amazon development center.
good,"Depending on your department a typical day consists of a lot of walking and standing."
good,"The benefits are great, but the long shifts at night are not the best. It is a good company to work for. The management changes constantly, but they are friendly and helpful."
good,Great job but no time for kid(s) and being involved in activities with them. Also no time to really get things done during the day because you sleep once your iff in the mornings and by the time you get up it's time to go back.
good,Amazon is a good place to work in with friendly people all around.The working environment is exquisite and formal at the same time.I got a good platform to understand people handling skills through customer service executive position
good,Very fast paced and sometimes  overwhelming. The plus side is that you learn new skills very quickly and are surrounded by outstanding professionals. I  really enjoyed my time at Amazon and would recommend to others as long has they could handle the pace.
good,"The best job I ever had was at Amazon. I worked 3 different warehouses, and they were all great... The only thing I don't like is that Amazon tends to hire managers who are fresh out of college or fresh out of the military even though Amazon says it prefers to ""promote from within"".  Management at some warehouses needs work, but overall, Amazon is a great place to work... don't believe all the negative reviews you may find online about working at amazon... You have to be okay with this kind of laborous work! If you are lazy, this is not the place for you."
good,"Work for an associate is very dry, same thing daily. Management is helpful as can be. Great culture but the work is so repetitive it makes for terrible long days. Very lenient work place in which you can come and leave as you would like."
good,Amazon was filled with fun people to work with but you always had rules that you had to follow that sometimes didn't make sense. The rates were always to high and they seemed tone always trying some new process.
good,"Amazon is a place where you can acquire great skills. It puts you on test with lot ambiguous situation, the expectation is have high bias for action. Wear what you ant at work which actually brings in a lot of comfort as well as confidence."
good,Nice structured work environment easy to stay busy. Always work to do very organized environment easy to get around and quick to get comfortable friendly
good,"I enjoy the job greatly, is fast paced and mildly challenging. My coworkers are fantastic, and my leadership is pretty solid. Overall I would recommend the job to anyone willing to work hard."
good,"Always on your feet and must work fast, but can be fun. You get to see the how items are prep for shipment. Always meeting new people and employees always shown appreciation."
good,Nice company brings best out of you.The work experience will be great and the work and life balances well.If you are right team then everything will go well or elz it will be messed
good,It may be difficult for some but it is simple. It may be repetitive which is the simple part but the difficult part is keeping up with the desired pace.
good,"Uma empresa de grande porte nascional , muito boa de trablhar"
good,"I learned more in 1 year working at Amazon than any other place I've worked. You are constantly engaged with people that are smarter than you and if you take the time to listen and learn from them it will be well worth your time. I call my short stint there my e-commerce MBA and in actuality I probably learned more working at Amazon than if I had gone to get an MBA. "
good,"Great benefits,  willing to work with you on hours you are able to work. Pay for schooling if you want to go to school.  Every now and than they will bring in ice cream or slushies."
good,"Amazon is a good company to work for. Working at Amazon is vey up pace in environment. The company has very good benefits for their employers, employee recognition is one of Amazons top benefits"
good,Super respectueux et tres agreables.personnel sympa chef courtoi poli et comprehensif.
good,Fun place to work but the managers are not on the same accord. Very bad communication issues. The hardest part of the job is trying to meet the extremely high rate
good,It was a pleasure working with Amazon. A company well equipped with all the amenities. Have a very good culture and also have a vast development possibilities.
good,"Amazon's day at work is fun. You get to learn a lot on how to work with a team while completing team goals and improving relationships with peers. The management is also very organised and systematic."
good,"Fun place to work at, the people make the place fun and one learns a lot about leadership and the importance of always pushing yourself. Amazon has been a great company to work for."
good,"amazon is a very good place to work.  Employee friendly and understands employee career progression and groom them to achieve that. "
good,"Normally the packages come off the truck and we have to unload fast and safely. Then we split the packages by letter then from there we separate them by number and letter, then scan them to the pallet that they match and then wrap them up and put them on to a truck to be sent to the post offices."
good,amazon is a good place to work at. Great benfits and wonderful people. You get a lot of time off when just starting off. Only downfall is standing on your feet for 10 hours
good,it was challenging but a very good place to have experience. Managers are fun to work with and very helpful. Hours of working ai very convenient. It is a nice place to work
good,Working at amazon is very relaxed and you feel accomplished at the same time. The only down fall is the pay. It tops out at 13 for a normal employee..
good,"Great place to work if you live near by. can be taxing on your knees and half the day goes by, so little time for anything but good hours and great pay. "
good,Working at the fulfillment center is fun when the people are nice and friendly. The work is not always easy especially in the holiday months. The managers are mostly teens straight out of college. Which means they don't really care when you ask them how to move up and/or get promoted to a higher position. They just don't really understand.
good,A typical day at work is going in at 6 pm and staying till 5:00 am. Lunch is only 30 mins and I feel I don't have enough time to eat. The great thing about this job is the pay and benefits!
good,The average day you are scanning hundreds of packages as the conveyer belt is moving. I learned to adapt to the speed and do pretty good as an associate. The hardest part about working at amazon is keeping up with the packages. The best part is that they encourage you to stay hydrated and they give you breaks and the supervision is limited due to the amount of people and there's always a job to do.
good,"I enjoy working for amazon, it is very laid back and productive. They're a little to strict about the point system that they have going but it is an ok job and worth the pay."
good,Working at Amazon was productive and there was never a down time. I enjoyed assisting the customers with any problems they were having with orders or their accounts.
good,"1.chasing our target"
good,I enjoyed working at the company and learnt a lot. There is a lot of support for career development and the culture at Amazon is actually the best that I have had.
good,"Amazon warehouses are relatively clean and aren't too loud. There is plenty of room to learn new tasks that will help break up the monotony, and the safety of the associates is stressed. The work is only hard if you like to work hard."
good,"go in start daily meeting,get my stuff find out were i working for the day,get sign in and get ready to go to work.start unloading trucks,and doing paper work,then getting ready to put out to fill orders."
good,"Your typical day at work looks the same everyday since it's a repetitive experience. You get a steady schedule. You learn how things work around the warehouse, opportunity to work in different areas of the work place. Managers are easy to find in the warehouse and ask questions or whatsoever."
good,Amazon really is a customer focused company and wants them to be taken care of with the utmost respect. When taking calls the reps on the phone and management do everything possible to make sure we are trained and equipped with tools necessary to support our customers.
good,"The conditions we worked in were too hot, especially for the summer, but I believe the pay made up for that. Also having the required breaks were really nice because the room was cool enough where you could get your energy back for the last half of your shift."
good,"The dress code at Amazon is very comfortable. I love the fact that you don't need a union to support AAs. There's a open door policy which allows you to get with any manager in the building whenever needed. The opportunity to advance is probable, and the BENEFITS are wonderful."
good,"Working at Amazon customer support was overall pretty amazing. I met a lot of fantastic people which I made friends with. The pay wasn't the best, but for me it was more than enough. Managers were for the most part great. We got free fruit on Wednesdays which was neat. Now most of you reading may be thinking, ""why give it such a good review and not 5 star it?"" well folks I'll tell you. Sometimes the people you're assisting can get on your nerves."
good,While i worked there rates were stressed everyday but they did give you time to adjust to it if you were new and i quickly got used to making rate. its a very fast paced environment so your work days will go by fast and you do get 3 days off a week if you dont decide to work overtime the 5th day
good,i enjoy working for amazon in till the thing start change for the wrost and i was put in the blacklist for amazon because a manger is upset and dont want to help there worker
good,There are a lot of people who are great to work with at Amazon and often the day goes flying by because the work doesn't usually feel overwhelming nor overly lacking.
good,It's a great place to work. I love the Human Resource department. They are understanding and very helpful. I also love the 3 day weekend that we receive. I love the people that I work with.
good,"Amazon is somewhat enjoyable. Management, when working together, are a blast to be around. The illusion that honesty gets you places on the other hand, is not."
good,"Make it a habit to evaluate morale in your workplace; if it’s suffering, a break for fun can lift spirits and boost success. Give your team a chance to enjoy themselves; it’ll undoubtedly create a friendlier, happier, and all-around healthier environment for everyone."
good,program-ul si volumul de materiale ce trebuiesc pregatite pentru distribuire
good,"Working at the Amazon Fulfillment Center was a pleasant venture. Professional, fast-paced, well organized, and an inviting atmosphere. As someone who is motivated by music, it was nice to have music being played over the loud-speakers and kept with variety. The work was not very difficult because the trainers were very thorough."
good,"I love Amazon, part time work is perfect due to the fact I wasnt burning entire days and its alot to learn as far as advancements and things the company gives back and offers... you learn alot, have fun, meet alot of great people, work hard yet wont notice the time go by and mostly you get paid and leave happy."
good,"- Working in amazon is a challenge, as well as fun"
good,"I liked it but it wasnt what i expected. The fact i had more than 2 kids kind of made it difficult to work there when emergencies arose. They would give you points regardless if you had a dr note or not. Wasnt completely fair. Not family oriented, I understand that there are provisions and things that need to be done, but I expected them to understand family life considering most of the managers had families. Other than that, hours are great if you can work it. Tiring, but that comes with any job."
good,"It is a very good place to work it is very secure and your time there will be very productive,and professional with hard working employees dedicated to get things done"
good,"I found my time with Amazon to be both challenging, and rewarding. The balance with work and personal life was good and the company perks were fair. The pay is less than I would normally accept, but it worked in a pinch. For remote at home work it's ideal."
good,"It's a very hard job when you start. There are long hours and you have to be on your feet for most of them. "
good,"High energy, liked the people I worked w/.  Just the hours were long.  I have a child at home that was smaller at the the time.  ^0 hours a week were a little much for me."
good,"A typical day at Amazon would start with the the warm up center. This where everyone would stretch and the managers would give out any important news. Management was great, it seemed that they cared for every ones well being. Hardest part of the job was the long 12 hour shifts. The most enjoyable part was the fact if you really worked hard you would get recognized."
good,This job was over all a great experience the most enjoyable apart about this job was you always get recognized. It could for the smallest things. They believe in fair opportunity with EVERYONE.
good,"great benefits great learning experience,great work environment  high management turnover rate. very safe environment. HR Staff is very friendly and helpful."
good,"Its a great job, especially for college students or people who need an at home job. The only down side was that it does get tiring and they sometimes require overtime. Other than that the pay was amazing."
good,It's a great place to work if you want garunteed hours and decent pay. ovefall most fellow associates are rude and disrespectful toward the work environment. Not all the managers are friendly and you do get lied to sometimes. The work is pretty easy as long as you don't mind being physical.
good,"Great energy, very enjoyable and fun workplace. Loving people with amazing attitudes. Everyone including the staff was very personal and caring. They treat you like a real human being."
good,Overall a nice experience if you can get around alright. I'm not too sure how a worker would feel about this if they around 40+ in age so I'm not sure if it would change past that. The job I had was a picker and it was pretty much the same thing day in and day out.
good,"I enjoyed the general relaxed atmosphere at Amazon.com. You have a task and you are responsible for it. It must be delivered by the set deadline (which are not always painfully close), but you can do it in your personal pace, as long as it is done in time. There are tough things to handle, but you will always have the support of your team and management."
good,"The time I worked at Amazon, I have to say it was a great experience. The manager I had was very supportive and extremely motivating person. The team I had also complemented the amount of motivation the manager offered."
good,"It can be fast paced at times,but it is a nice job.I am being cross trained in another department. The management is very supportive and works with us most of the time.There is no hard part of my job. I enjoy meeting the deadlines and making my contribution to customer satisfaction."
good,"working with a scanner, bar code, and item detail. Keeping up with the pace working fast and moving fast picking the right order. The hardest job is moving fast between three floors to get the item for the client or vendor."
good,"Nice place to work and start your days in Uk. Salary is good and on time, persons who work in amazon are international and positive. "
good,"great job i would absoultey refer a friend or business partner to this company. They were very compensating with time off, hours and work life balances."
good,"At Amazon, this facility is huge. I worked at Ont-6 in Moreno Valley and you would see a lot of new faces every day. This job is mainly good that are only working. 10 hour shifts for four days is not suggested for those going to school because it will catch up to you. It was hard to balance work, family, and part-time in school. "
good,it was a very good job I learned a lot about the process of online sale I didn't get try any new positions because I had to leave due to the fact they wouldn't work with me on my shift
good,You work hard long hours. Business needs come first family matters 2nd. Great benefits comes along with it. Please take advantage of it especially the health care because even if you don't need it at the moment  you will need it in the near future.
good,Clean climate controlled warehouse. Great starting point for warehouse employee. Work is fast paced. Teamwork is encouraged. Management is open and accessible..
good,"Working over there was okay, and I learned how and why these bug companies had to grow bigger. But the H.R was slow at giving information, and giving out approval or disapproval."
good,"It's a place where you can come to work knowing that you have to work, but at the same time you know you are going to enjoy yourself while you are there."
good,"Overall its a good job with a number of benefits. After working with the company for a year, Amazon will pay for up to $3000 for schooling. After 2 years, you will receive stocks. Definitely a place that I would recommend."
good,"Amazon has a great management, CEO to line leader, a typical day is keeping a quota and completing tasks accurately, However during holiday seasons it is a mandatory overtime policy which does not allow a person to work two jobs and forces one to find last minute sitters if children are involved. There is great advancement opportunities  for all positions."
good,As the trucks were being unloaded I scanned in the merchandise as it came off the lines from the trucks .We had rates that we had to maintain.Also part of my job was to train new hires on how to receive.
good,"very dirty place, sometimes things can be unfair very hard work but benefits are great.. great for people who have to fit school in they schedule amazon works around that."
good,I enjoyed working for Integrity staffing. I got the privilege of working through Integrity for Amazon. This was a fun relaxed setting where I worked with and met some wonderful people I call friends.
good,Amazon is a great company. Very understandable they also help you when you have problems. They work with your schedule to balance your home and school life the shifts are short and easy and they give a lot of over time.
good,Packing or going to sort side same thing daily. I learned how to work in a very fast pace job. Management was good they need some room for improvement i get like there was a lot of favoritism.

good,Amazing place with alot of growth opportunity ahead. Fun involved with an excellent Work Culture. Less Salary but with more Perks. Good management and with great infrastructure for sure
good,"A typical work day at Amazon consisted of lifting, and getting merchandise out to customers in a timely manner. I learned to be flexible while performing various task in a very busy environment. As far as the management team goes I would have to say overall that the managers showed concern about the employees at Amazon. The culture at Amazon was very diversified and everyone was always helpful to one another. As far as the hardest part of the job I would have to say that the constant lifting was the hardest. The most enjoyable part of the job was the different variety of people. In addition to that Amazon always had fun activities for employees to participate in."
good,"The job provides good benefits and pay, but management expects far too much from its associates, even though they are exceeding their quotas. There needs to be a balance."
good,"Working at amazon is a great experience and defintaley something you'll remember for a long time, during my time at amazon I improved my confidence and communication skills massively, meeting new people, building friendships and having fun makes the job more enjoyable, the only con to the job would be the long hours however they fly by if you make the most of your time there and work hard."
good,Get to work and clock in. Have a short meeting regarding packages for the shift and safety. We also do short exercises to prepare for the shift such as stretching. Scan products and package them.
good,"AWS is a big name in the industry.  They hire the best of the best, it's very tough and competitive. A great learning experience if you can get your foot through the door."
good,"A typical work day for me is starting off with, clocking in. I would come in 5 minutes before my shift and clock in. Then i would check the board to see what my function was and/or lane i'm on. We would walk half way across the facility to ""Stand Up"". This was a pre-shift meeting. After that we would go to where we were assigned. Then we scan packages in until we hit the number we are supposed to hit. Example, if they say we have to scan in 50,000 packages, we have a total of 5 hours to do so. If not finished after 5 hours, we go home and the next shift has to finish it. I learned team buildings three different roles, and to always be safe. The hardest part of job would be keeping a constant work flow on a slow day. Some days, the work is so slow and you have to find work to do. Most of the things you could think like: fixing pallets, base wrapping, cap wrapping, and staging pallets. The most enjoyable to part of the job was working with my team mates. I met some really cool and very nice people while working there."
good,"Overall it's a good company to work with. However, it's suitable for a very specific kind of folks due to some peculiar processes. So I will recommend folks to surely take an attempt to get inside Amazon."
good,"Work culture is awesome,  no work pressure,  really good opportunities. Great services provided to employees. Working environment is really good. Really good package is provided."
good,"Its more than having fun rather than working. You get more learning, your peers always there to help you out. The work is completely dynamic in nature."

good,I enjoyed everything about working at amazon. It was fun and fast paste. Clean and understanding and everyone was friendly and helpful.

good,"the salary they provide as a fresher and other benefits like cab facility, cab reimbursement and sodexo are really good comparatively with other companies."
good,"A Company where you can learn develop and do things differently. You can speak your thoughts stand for your believes and let the world know what you think."
good,Fast-paced and dynamic work environment. Competitive pay and you will earn every penny!  Use core leadership principle to guide the business which work very well. Management is very smart from top to bottom but would benefit slightly from hiring more senior managers.
good,"Being able to help the customers needs and wants is a great team work experience, meet new people, great benefits, helps you with job experience, great place to work"
good,"Love the work environment but for me personally I just hate the lack of hours. Other than the lack of hours, I love it. Very laid back environment and fast paced."

good,"Enjoyed the challenge of ensuring payments were good prior to releasing orders.  My day was always busy, handling from a minimum of 60 to 100's (during Christmas season) a day."
good,I had just sold my Businesses of 10 years and needed to get back into the workforce and Amazon gave me that chance.  If you can handle standing on your feet for 12 hrs at a time it's a great place to work.
good,"Quality assurance (QA), which audits how well we’re sticking to agreed processes and highlights any discrepancies. This team also helps analyse customer-facing metrics."
good,"4 days of work at 10 hour shifts, unless there is overtime which would be another full 10 hour day during the week. fast paced keeps job going"

good,Easy work culture with open window system no restrictions with dress good co employes and managers and individual will be awarded for his ability not just for tenure.
good,Booming company with guaranteed full time hours and decent pay with great benefits for amazon employees but they work you like slaves with short breaks and 10 hour shifts.
good,"great learning experience  "
good,A typical day involved either packaging items for customer delivery or collecting items to be packaged for customer delivery.  I learned to work in a very timely manner.  Punctuality was very important because it was a deadline oriented environment.  I got along with management quite well.  Never encountered any issues with how the people were being managed.  The hardest part of the job was being on your feet for as much as 10 hours.  I viewed it as good exercise.  The most enjoyable part was the people.  Most were conscientious and hard-working. Many were quite funny and colorful.
good,"I enjoy working for Amazon I work 4/10s and 3 days off. They have great benefits, have fun, make history, and work hard is our moto. The hardest part working here during October-December we are working 60s a week and having 1 day off is hard especially during the holidays you don't get to spend time with your family who comes into town. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you work with."
good,"i start working in december in amazon, only for a month, in picking. "
good,is a nice and fun place to work.... amazon is big company has good people works with.... at warehouse lot works to do or has so many departements like some do pecking or stowing or packing  item return..... with with coworker we become like family
good,"Work place just like any other factory, typical eight to ten hour shifts, overtime always available. Great thing about it were the benefits, and job security. Feel like management could be better, more organized"
good,Amazon is a great place to work. I am always learning new management skills everyday. The hardest part of working at Amazon is certain parts of the year the over time work and life balance. Over all I enjoy working here everyday.
good,"It was a tough job. There were very high expectations, but as long as you meet the quota they will keep you. Very focused on safety. Always giving feedback, both positive and negative. Constantly offering rewards for hard work. Pays well. Lots of great benefits. Management was very encouraging and understanding. They were always helping to improve the process and make things easier on the associates. There is a lot of pressure, they are constantly giving feedback, but in the end, it is always to help you become better and was never given in an accusatory way. I really loved this job. Amazon was the best employer I have ever had. I was very sad to be laid off."
good,"Great place to work , very easy work and great pay and great benefits. Very nice managers and fast pace environment. Also give Birthday parties and holiday pay"

good,"They make sure we don't go hungry, offer free snacks sometimes, but spending 11 hours a day for 4 days a week can mentally drain you...."
good,High turnover rate and hard work. If you don't like to walk at least 5+ miles a day then this job isn't for you. Managers I had in the stowing department were awesome and great to work with
good,Amazon is a good place to work help you out with anything you need  at any time of the day and they show you how to do things when you do not know how and yheybwioiod show you all night and then have you try it when they are sitting there watching you
good,"Ambiente lavorativo piacevole,se fai il tuo dovere nessuno ti dice niente,anche se per i pochi mesi che ho lavorato li,mi hanno trattato come uno di loro"
good,my day of work their was always something new such as learning something new or moving on up. The hardest thing about my job was running back and forth from place to place.
good,you would walk in then scan in and put away your lunch and things then clock in and get to for work then go and do your morning exercise before work. now I ever since I worked at amazon I learned how to scan and split the boxes then I learned that you can always count on the management or the co-workers to help you out if you don't understand something or if you are stuck or something or if something doesn't work like it suppose to. the hardest part of the job is when you get a lot of boxes coming just because you never know how many are coming .it could just be one or two but then easy enough five or six could be coming back to back and that is when you and your co-worker teamwork come to play and when the boxes are all gone and put where they belong and your co-workers are all tired from scanning and placing all the boxes the feeling of victory is the most enjoyable part of the job everyone love.
good,"I loved working at Amazon, they're productive, fast paced, always have something that needs to be done. The managers are extremely nice, so are other associate's. I made multiple friends. It was an overall great learning experience."
good,"Amazon has it set up where you accumulate time such as personal time, vacation time and unpaid time. The time is there for your own personal use and the more time you save you get an extra bonus on your check."
good,it was great working there but to many people working at one time plus need to pay more money plus its too hot in the wear house the boss yell a lot an u need more break time there
good,"It is really not that bad the rate they expect you to make can be done and they offer plenty of benefits that many other companies do not. It is fairly easy to move up and they offer school accommodation. The work is mundane and repetitive but its easy work. The management at my FC is very friendly and understanding. The hardest part of the job are the people, they constantly complain and do not do their jobs, then they wonder why they get fired."
good,"It is a fast paced job that keep you busy, but the pay and benefits are all worth it. The employees are usually kind and helpful. It takes a little while to get used to all of the different procedures and rules but once you do you can do really well there."
good,"Work is simple and easy, great co workers and great environment with great managers! There really isn't much to say besides if you work here just don't be a lazy to your co workers!"
good,"- reger Umgang mit Kunden"
good,"I liked working here, the benefits were awesome. Management strived to make working conditions better and rewarding. Work was challenging but not hard. If you show up to work then you are ok. Not for the lazy thinking at all."
good,Amazon is a nice places to work if your single they have to many hours per day not enough time to expend with your family. But is a fun job they keep you really busy and every day they try to improve the way you work so the merchandise get in and out on time.
good,"Walking into a company life Amazon can be very difficult at times but easy at the same time. Depending on your mood and how you would like to complete your task, Amazon does have fanastic managers and leads that keep others on task to complete what needs to be done."
good,"hard worker"
good,"The job was very cut and dry. You would show up, be assigned your task for the day and then do your task until you were off or until they relocated you to do another task. On a daily basis I would scan packages the their perspective pallets, build pallets, wrap completed pallets and scan completed pallets to their outgoing lanes. My co-workers were easy to get along with as long as they were keeping up with their work. The hardest part of the job was trying to get some of my co-workers to stay on task instead of chatting with one another. The most enjoyable part of the job was recieving recognition for the work I was doing, management was alway roaming around looking to make sure we were working efficiently and effectively."
good,we work 10 hour days with a 30 minute lunch break and two 15 minute breaks. We work in a friendly environment with the expectation of making rate on a daily basis.
good,"It is a friendly and safe environment and different ethnic groups. It's a nice place. You can say, There may be a chance you may have promotions. It depends on yourself."
good,"Very fast paced, the managers made it a fun place to work.  The hardest part of the job was the long hours during the holidays.  There was so much traffic we had to have police to direct us in and out of the parking lot, so you had to leave an hour earlier than usual during the holidays."
good,"A typical day at work is like any other, go in work then go home, pack the box send it down the line, Its always fun talking with other people, management is always nice to talk to and always help me with my problems"
good,Lots of work in very little time. We had many busy days with flexible schedules. People from different backgrounds made for interesting teamwork
good,the job was very clean and straight cut.  i had no problems with it.  the most fluid job i ever worked at.  but not ideal for me to be standing and packing boxes all day 5 times a week.  although they allowed me a lot of over time so i was happy about that.
good,"typical day: begining shift meeting, go to you assigned location,work, break,work,lunch,mid shift meeting,work, last break,work end of shift meeting, go home."
good,"The job was physically demanding but I became more physically fit than if I had attended a gym. I really enjoyed meeting and working with so may different types of people while I was with Amazon. My work/personal life was very well balanced as I had 3 days off every week (except during peak season). I learned how much I was capable of doing and how versatile I could be in such a physically demanding role. Management was very hands on, supportive and provided good examples of how to do the job successfully. The insurance & benefits were the best I have ever had."
good,The whole Amazon facility works smoothly. The only problem I had with this job was that it was overnight. The management has a good way of keeping people inspired to keep working and to have ideas on how to make the process work smoother and faster.
good,"A place where I have learnt and have grown into what I am today. Organization, management and the culture is the best part of Amazon."
good,"Fun and tiring at the same time. You are on your feet 12 hours a day. You are not only working in one area of the building, you're constantly moving around and grabbing customer's orders that is listed on the scanner. It is a fast paced environment because you are timed. The hardest part of the job is trying to grab the items before the time runs out because you have to dig through different bins and find that specified item. Sometimes the item isn't there so you would have to miss it out and scan every single item in the bin. My coworkers and management were very helpful. They both provide support along with tips and feedback to help you out. The most enjoyable part was being able to work alone."
good,Management won't bother if your'e staying productive and making rate. Full time= four 10hr shifts. Free gatorade and Mountain dew. Good incentives.
good,Working for Amazon was truly a great opportunity to learn more about very fast pace environment in the fulfillment position
good,"It was a good learning experience while working with Amazon.The management was pretty cool and it was fun while working.The motto is Work hard, Have fun and make history and that's what we do at amazon."
good,My typical day in UK is monotonouse because I au-pair and I still do the same things with the same children now. Working in UK I learned many interesting things and I can meet customs and habits at international enviroment( AMAZON) . In my opinion doesn't exist hard and light job because every person likes different things and derive pleasure from something different part od life. I love people.... it is the best job !
good,"It was an amazing experience working with Amazon as a customer associate for North America as the people interaction is beyond comparison. "
good,The hours are long and the work load heavy. The compensation and benefits are great if you can handle the heavy lifting and the fast pace. Job security is based on rates.

good,"Awesome managers who listen and work hard to resolve any issues you have. "
good,"best work culture"
good,"A normal day at work is quite long 10h per day plus 2 extra for transport so is eating your time. I learned how to comunicate, how to make myself pleasent to the other people because there are people comming from around 50 countrys. The hardest part of the job is that involves heavy lifting objects and is generaly a fisical job. The most enjoyable thing about this job is that you can make a lot of friends and everyday you get to know a lot of new people."
good,"Taking chats. There are some issues with how the system we use works, that doesn't allow us to help the customer sometimes. But most of the time it is just about knowing what you are doing and being responsible. And the most important thing is to really care for your customers and help them as much as you can with a lot of passion. They are the reason you are here for."
good,"they paid well, and had decent working hours. it was a very productive environment and the also had really good benefits."
good,"Aprendi a trabajr en equipo, manejar proyecto y equipo a cargo."

good,"Amazon taught me everything I know about the workplace today and paved the way for me to be the great leader I am today. From launching a building to prime day then onto peak season amazon never ceases to excite you. Its a constant sprint throughout the year to prepare for the Superbowl, which is Christmas season. Amazon never strays away from its leadership principals and overall mission to please the customer"
good,Amazon.com is an amazing place to work for. Climate controlled buildings. Amazon has an amazing benefits package
