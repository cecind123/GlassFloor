bad,"Worst company to ever work for So don't waste your time at this place."
bad,"Collega's zijn gezellig,  maar worden onder druk gezet en alles wordt beloofd en komt Valspar niet na. Je wordt op een vieze manier behandeld als ze van je afscheid willen nemen"
bad,This place fired me for days they excused....not to mention they are closing the entire building in December.old equipment...workers who have been there 20 years plus being pretty much started over because they have changed the company
bad,The job was enjoyable but your co-workers was a challenge. Without leadership and direction. Manager doesn't know too much about the job he is just in Manager position. Overall the job was good.
bad,"the co-worker are fun to be around some of the management are nice people. not enough time home with my family. I've learned how to deal with people with not so good attitudes, but the company really believes in quality for their customers."
bad,During the time I worked at Valspar there were a lot of changes going on and everything was very chaotic. It seemed as if no one knew the direction the company was taking and every department was during their own thing.
bad,"The worst company I have ever worked for from management to products. Valspar (Paintdrop) has no idea about the contractor paint business. Forced to see paint to professionals that know paint and never came back after they tried it. The people at Valspar know it and you were told to sell through it. Delivery trucks never available so you have to deliver everything youself. I cant believe a paint company this big would allow this to happen. No respect for the painters, employees and no pride in their products. What a misstake!!!!!!!"
bad,At one time working at Valspar was stressful but rewarding. A Plant Mgr change impacted things in a negative manner in early 2011. Communication to direct reports and to the plant floor dropped off drastically. New PM often never left his office. It was months before he made an appearance on the plant floor to see first hand what was taking place. Basically set behind his computer firing off flaming e-mails treating everyone's job. The trust that many of the leadership group had built was gone.
bad,They work you hard and you have to get 90% every month if you are not making 90% you get fired. you can't get promoted and you get 50 cent rise for the year.
bad,"don't work hear beware stay away poor management . short staffed "
bad,Management is absolutely horrible and cares for no one other than themselves. I gets up to 140 degrees and at one point we didn't even have fans because they said it was a fire hazard. Even though we used production equipment with the same plug in and voltage. We had a decent maintenance crew but when they would come up with a good idea the production manager would steal it as his own to make him look better. One of those companies when half the production workers would be a better fit for supervisors and management other than the current ones who only worry about how to keep there job.
bad,"Worst work environment I have ever experienced, Mangers are paid by the degree they have earned not what they have accomplished. Leadership is non existent and what is really scary is they don't know the difference between leadership and management. Turn over is weekly.........Stay away!"
bad,Wouldn’t recommend this job to anyone else... was fired due to favoritisms and because management don’t care about there temp employees just hired on this place showed that hired on employees can fight with a temp and they get off with a warning and temps get fired on the spot.... my old manger found a new job in New Jersey was happy to leave if he wouldn’t have left I would still be working there
bad,"Too many people were involved in every decision. Slow to proceed. Lots of busy work. Goals unclear. However, that was all before Valspar was sold to Sherwin Williams. I'm sure things are different now because 90% of the staff in Chicago was turned over."
bad,"Valspar worker us 60-65 hours a week when the housing boom was going on, and fired us when everything slowed down. Valspar got into an aggressive cost cutting mode and nobody was safe. They fire hourly and salaried workers."
bad,"don't work here don't let you take breaks in a 12 hr day .suppose"
bad,"Horrible place."
bad,"It's like getting into Fort Knox (very difficult), but the turnover is crazy.  It is like a phone factory.  You never really feel like you are a valued employee, more like a seat filler.  It's heartbreaking when you give a job your all and feel little recognition for your hard work.  There are some amazing supervisors and employees.  Their benefit package is good and their vacation and PTO package is even better.  Try not to get too attached, they don't really care about you as a person or employee."
bad,Stress full place to work at especially if they don't provide you with the right tools to work for. I learned that you really need the right tools for the the job your working on. The hardest part of the job is having you lead man breading down you neck and making you make mistakes for stressing out.
bad,Filler machine operator of oil/latex quart and gallon paint. Production and assembly of oil and latex paint.
bad,"Management is quite terrible, And the other representatives rarely are helpful. The company was good when initially starting but the management changed and so did everything else with it."
bad,"Long hours and hard work, not good management, don't care about the employees. Always looking for the bad in workers. Pay is not good. ..temporary employees makes the same as a full time employee. ..that's crazy. Every 6 months you get a raise. So in about 2 years you will be at $15.00...Wow"
bad,"Valspar was a fast paced company that had me working many nights, weekends and holidays. They are now owned by Sherwin Williams, so it's likely that many of the bad experiences that I had wouldn't have existed with the new culture and management."
bad,"Whilst I was working for Valspar (5 months) over 5 people were sacked "
bad,"Poor work culture and hard to move up in the company. Very political. Meager raises, Hard to get noticed even when you work late. Lots of Gossip including in management."
bad,"I enjoy being able set my hours, but if I wanted to be realistic I am on call 24/7 even on vacation time away. My job is a Outside Sales Representative however I do sales, deliveries, orders and processing. I will be contacted my consumers first thing in the morning to as late as midnight, weekends off and even out of town. The position is definitely demanding and does not consist of any true clarity as to who is in charge of what, it is more a shared job responsibility between location manager, sales representative and driver. I wish we had the resources and the products to really make this job a success as to which I came into this from the beginning stages to help build this company to something great with my knowledge and experience. Unfortunately much has been ignored and workers have been hired outside of the industry who are not familiar with this industry and not have been properly trained to understand what or how they should go about learning how to better the company with the skills they bring to the company. Anyway, if things don't turn around this company is looking at a lot more loss than they already experiencing."
bad,"I worked at Valspar as a contract designer w/in the Chicago/O'hare office and was excited when I got the opportunity as the marketing division seemed to have a lot of promise. Though they appear to be an innovative, creative company... they are not! Unfortunately they did not use their creative designers in-house to create the innovative designs, they went outside to get the fun, creative job done... no need for that. Poorly managed in many ways. They cut my contract short with no notice b/c the so-called ""manager"" (one of the worst I ever had) was leaving on vacation and ""had no one to manage me"" even though I had 7 more yrs of experience in design and management than her. It was a BS excuse b/c they knew I was not happy, creatively and they were ultimately looking for a permanent Art Dir. It was a contract job and I needed the money! It was my way to make a living and they didn't see that. In the 6 weeks I was there...3 people got fired and 2 quit in my division! That tells you something! Employees aren't really treated as human beings, more like cattle. It was a blessing in disguise to leave!"
bad,Used to enjoy working there but all management changed and switched to 12 hour days that are very long for such physical labor. Switched to Aetna insurance that’s totally awful
bad,"prior to acquisition by Sherwin-Willsams, we spent a year spinning our wheels.  No process changes were permitted, nor was i able to implement change, which was why I was hired e.g process improvement, develop relationship with sales.  No support nor back up.   "
bad,My experience was great as a worker until it came time to hire. I went through a temp service and unfortunately the temp service's contract ended leaving me in a awkward predicament. I thought I had a good enough relationship with my supervisor and manager that the transaction would be smooth to permanent placement. Instead I lost the job completely even though I worked well and was well liked. Just unfair overall.
bad,"Barely had coworkers to replace daily "
bad,"Good people.  If you really want to work, this is the right place to get overtime."
bad,"The management could have been a lot better, as well as safety in the work environment. They had little care for OSHA regulations in the warehouse and general safety. Very little care for their employees."
bad,"The consumer group is full of challenges from the top to the bottom, clear understanding of ""Your place"" in the relationship between Valspar and the customer was straining. An easy job for those with no experience in the paint business. Job work/life balance is verbal and difficult to achieve, typical work week is 50 hours. Comp and bennies are good. Very little advancement available, management is good on the regional level and the culture is good on the level you are working. Good luck"
bad,"Tem gestores fracos, que desmotivam os colaboradores. Tem muito potencial, afinal é uma multinacional com 200 anos, porem aqui no Brasil falta investir um pouco mais para poder ser uma empresa de sucesso no nosso mercado. Tem muito potencial, porém é mal administrado."
bad,"I was worried that the fumes were hazardous to my health.  The work was good, but you couldn't work without subjecting yourself to chemicals and fumes."
bad,Worked in different areas of  the facility. Long long time ao
bad,"A typical day would consist of providing customer service to businesses, order processing, resolving queries and complaints, invoicing and basic accountancy."
bad,Not much to talk about with Valspar. Company was being brought out and has not been sold so I knew as a contract worker there would be no place for me at Valspar and there was no concern for my job in which I did a great job but got really frustrated with management and their childish ways. Especially higher mgmt.
bad,There was not enough communication between the workers and the foreman. The Workers were good to work with.There was real good medical insurance and bonceses
bad,My co-workers are far more reachable and helpful than my supervisor. I feel like i can come them for anything but i don't because they're dealing with their own issues. The management states they can help with anything but they seem to be bothered when we reach out for help. Almost like an inconvenience.
bad,"Valspar's systems (financial reporting, analytic's, operations, etc.),  were difficult to manage through. The artwork and art label system drove one to managing minutia and not what really counts - product strategy. The consumer div. is driven by Lowe's and the sales team. This puts them at a me-too product innovation disadvantage and vision is extremely short-sighted. This also puts an undue sense of urgency that could be avoided with stronger leadership. Something is broken there."
bad,"Steady work.  Too much for a typical day.  Rarely ever have a summer.  Always on OT.  Very poor management. Learned how to handle hazardous chemicals.  Some coworkers are great, and some are bad.  The hardest part of the job is managing time.  The only real feeling of job satisfaction is getting everything done on time."
bad,A very stressful and unappreciated workplace that has alot of favortism going towards minorities. It is a place where those who work the hardest get stepped on and eventually fired. what is the logic in that? Perhaps that is why the facility is shutting down!
bad,"Valspar no longer exists and has recently merged with Sherwin Williams. It was a demanding environment to work in. The pay was typically lower than market but employee benefits (401k, paid leave, insurance) were good."
bad,It's a job but it need more room for advancement. The pay could be better. Safety is something that could be work on for the workers from the public .
bad,"While the pay is what is attractive, especially with overtime, management is what will drive you out the door. There is constant pressure to point out the flaws of your coworkers, and rarely any recognition for those who go above and beyond what is required of them. Threats are regularly made by management that ""if you don't like it, you know where the door is"". Not only are these threats made, but they are done so in public. Over the years, the company has cut back more and more perks for working there such as lunches and raffles, and most of the time does not even provide cutlery for use by employees."
bad,"The pay is worth the hard work. Opportunities for advancement if you  befriend plant manager and collaborate outside of work.  Not a bad company, but the worst job I've ever worked."
bad,Fast paced work place with short breaks. Roaches throughout facility. Poor quality control. Bad filters after processing. 100-200 filter bags every other batch. Gritty product. Bad engineering controls. No experienced operators. Lazy management. Short staffed. I have almost 20 years experience and left this place after 2 weeks for better job offer. Not enough compensation for the back aches. Look elsewhere if experienced.
bad,The job was so exciting at the beginning but there was no direction in terms of career growth. This was a good place when you just started working to gain experience in the coatings industry.
bad,"Due to Valspar being bought out by Sherman Williams and the merger hitting a big obstical pushing it back to the summer of 2019 all of the top management is trying to keep from implementing anything, even safety programs needed very badly"
bad,"The idea of a ""mobile paint store"" sounds nice on paper but the overall execution of this business model, in my opinion, was not the best. The frustration I face is trying to generate the sales of a brick-and-mortar paint store through a ""food truck"" sized store. Most of the business I was getting was simply touch up paint jobs, which take the most time and generate the least sales."
bad,just a stepping stone to get farther in life.have good people working there but there is a buddy buddy system there.work hard no one notice but do something wrong and you get thrown to the wolfs
bad,Worked here for a short time as a temp and pay was ok but hours were insane. If you have a family I wouldn't recommend working here you have no life but work. management was also bad they didn't want to hear about any problems you were having.
bad,"No trabalho, todo dia eu estou e o que eu sei procuro passar para um colega do setor."
bad,I getting was getting paid 12 dollars and hour and making around five to six hundred  dollars every week I was working for them as a temp for 3 months before they hired me permanent.
good,"Trabalho em equipe e solidariedade, o difícil era morar em Guaratingueta e trabalhar em São Bernardo do Campo, o bom era estar com os amigos"
good,Its a good company to work for of you are single and like working overtime .Really not good of you have little kids that you are trying to see grow.This is just a lilttle something .
good,"Entreprise très peu épanouissante, très mauvaise ambiance, management plus que mauvais, odeur de solvant,.... En bref a éviter !"
good,"Lowes is a very nice a friendly environment to work in.  Management is nice and eager to please."
good,"A day at Valspar is met with copious task oriented activities that always seem to outnumber the number of employees or sophisticated systems available to complete said tasks.  It is a regular challenge to guide the business into areas of growth and improvement as most groups struggle to work together.  Most of the employees there are nice, but are left to defend themselves and their positions with little support from management.  The most enjoyable part of my job is influencing and mentoring young minds, as there seems to be an endless supply of new employees that need guidance due to the high level of turnover."
good,"Started out as a great place to work, but after the Sherwin-Williams acquisition, the work load spiked tremendously, and we were nowhere near prepared for the increase in volume.  Not enough workers, not enough equipment, not enough trainers, etc.  Worked almost no overtime in 2017.  First three months of 2018, averaging nearly 80 hours a week.  No days off because we couldn't catch up on shipments.  Management oblivious to what working those kinds of hours will do to employees.  Pay was okay, but had to wait 5 years to make top pay.  Not much upward mobility--guys who started out as warehouse associates 20+ years ago still doing the same job."
good,"Expectations were unreasonable for a supervisor: expected supervisor to be supervisor, manager, technician, hourly worker, laborer.  Many weeks required working up to 100 hours."
good,The job was good but the Management wasn't there because their were going close that branch so when the time came I got a better offer from a other job.
good,"Valspar has been one of the few companies that use both sales and service cloud, as well as communities.  They are also very open to exploring new Salesforce functionality.  "
good,Wonderful way to meet new people everyday. Love managing/coaching sales associates. Hardest part of the job is keeping up with part timers because of their schedules which I have no control over.  Most enjoyable is the relationships built with sales associates/management.
good,"Valspar has a great history and a proven track record of succeeding in markets. Although the Valspar brand name is only a few years old, the company has been around since the 1800's. Co-workers were always easy to get along with and help each other out. I was a self taught employee. Training happens quickly and doesn't get repeated. Management is/was not great at the Garland, Texas facility. I had better experiences with management at other facilities but not at this one."
good,You have to remember this company just went public in 2007 so they do not have all the kinks worked out. They work hard to streamline processes and make things better. This is great! THey are very focused on LSS.
good,Great products and group of people to work with.  Management did not follow their Core Value Statement.  Integrity lacks in this company and was not a good place to work over the last few years.
good,"The management style is very demanding. There are too many people trying to be in charge, especially those who don't have any authority. There also, needs to be a better transition between both 1st and 2nd shift."
good,"Ruthlesss people when it comes to meeting the bottom line.  Will close a facility and out people out of work in the blink of an eye."
good,"Fast paced ever changing day. Management wants schedules, sales plans etc. but they don't mean anything because company is reactive rather than pro active. Good co workers, upper management is not with it."
good,"Its all smoke and mirrors and pretty much a ""good ole boy"" enviornment"
good,"Always busy. "
good,llllllllllllllllllllllllllll lllllllllllllllllll lllllllll lllllllllllll llllllllllll llllllllllllll lllllllllll lllllllllllll lllllllllllll lllllllllLiked it for the most part. Learned alot while I was there.
good,The benefits are great especially compare to what I have been offered in the area. The incentives to come to work on time and work safely were wonderful as well. The company has decided to close the automotive plant in the city I work in so job security was not a great rating. The management team at the site where the main reason for the move.
good,"Hard en zwaar werk in het magazijn. Vooral door de zware dozen, en de minimale hoeveelheid regels die je moet pikken. Je mag slechts 2 fouten per week maken. Als je snel bent en je maakt veel fouten, dan ben je klaar. Maak je geen fouten en ben je langzaam redt je het ook niet. Als je brede interesse hebt kan je hier meer doen. Ik heb er mijn heftruckcertificaten gehaald."
good,"Buena compañia para trabajar con sueldos muy competitivos y un gran ambiente de compañerismo,pero desafortunadamente fue vendida  a Sherwin-Williams company"
good,I enjoyed my employment with Valspar. They provided decent pay for the work needed. Could have been more efficient with providing the proper PPE required for the temp agency’s they provided for the company.
good,The environment at Valspar was very stressful the management did not know what they where doing they would send us to every upper management and nothing really got solved. My co workers where the best people i have ever worked with loved them.
good,"Het is er in algemeen wel een goed werksfeer, alleen je werkt met gevaarlijkestoffen die de algemeene regels eisen masker,handschoenen,specialekleding enz."
good,This company Micromanage everything you do..report after report  and is very management heavy I hate this job... Stay away...
good,"Friendly, relaxed work envirnonment, every one works well together.  Good attitudes, good work ethics"
good,It was a good place to work now it went downhill after sherwin took it over loved the overtime and the friends I made there but could of stayed there for along time
good,"Valspar offered competitive wages and great benefits. The biggest issue was that there wasn't much advancement opportunities.  I really enjoyed working there, though."
good,"This plant was great to work at a few years ago, but management has changed and we have a ton of inexperience here now.  The most stressful part of this transition is the fact that management will not listen to the operators or supervisors that have been there."
good,"This company has great people and it is a balanced well paid job, however, the management is not professional and responses from HR come back to you very slow."
good,"Was typically an 8 hour day that was mostly manufacturing based, I was involved in both purchasing and inventory control. Working with east coast suppliers most work was done very early in the am. "
good,Overall Valspar group was a good company without good management. I did enjoy the employees that I had the pleasure working with great people.
good,"A typical day at Valspar is extremely busy, result oriented and very fast paced environment.  On a day to day basis I make and handle thousands of dollars worth of paint and paint materials. Starting the day we as employees come into what is known as a team huddle that nails down the objectives and goals for the shift and what needs to be done for the day.  I would then go and find my batch cards which identify what I would be working on. Normally I would deal with 3-4 batch cards a day. I then have to plan out how I will approach each batch so I can get an idea of how long it will take me per batch.  I then would order my raw materials which normally takes 30-45 minutes to receive. After order my materialsI would then go to our computer which has a PPS (Prospective Payment System) and would then start my batch in the system letting the company know what batch is being handled, when it was started, when its finished and its yield percentages per batch. As I continue after the PPS I then have to determine what size mixing tank I need for the batch and once this figured out I am able to start dumping my raw materials.  Following directions is a must because one little mistake could throw off the batch and more work would have to be put into a batch resulting in lost time. After I am done with a batch I then have to take measurements to figure out the GPI (gallons per inch) which then goes into a calculation to determine the yield percentage of the batch that shows the accuracy of your measurements after you have added all of your materials.  Then after this step is complete I"
good,"A very good company to invest in.  Demanding workload long work hours.  Currently, transistioning to change culture."
good,"Good flexibility for working hours."
good,"Call Center with requirements to maintain matrix to average speed of answer, call talk time, and after call work monitored to the second."
good,"They were only interested in the work going out the door. If you worked for the wrong supervisor they would work you as hard as you would let them, while others would do as little as they could. You were always handled in a every personal way, It was always personal and not in a good way between you, and your supervisor."
good,"At first Valspar was a horrible place to work, no real management, lots of turnover, and poor training. But, the corporate enity as a whole strived hard to improve on all of these things, and ultimately done an awesome job in doing so. However after only three years of employment the Elkhart facility was closed due to the defuct economy."
good,"I enjoyed working at Valspar. My job was very loosely defined, so I learned a lot of different tasks so I could help where needed. Everyone was very willing to help."
good,Competitive salary and positive work culture.  Plant shut down caused departure.  Union work force that collaborated well with management.  Quality product that is well embraced by customer base.
good,"For the first number of years with the company it was great. Hands on training, stocking and demos with Lowes employees. Once the company got new management and added commercial sales to the position they started burning out most of us salary employees."
good,Valspar has been acquired by Sherwin Williams so I would expect the culture to change in the Pittsburgh site but that could take a while. A lot of good people but the business is struggling a little.
good,"The job itself is great, I actually really like the job.  Factory work is different if you have never worked in that type of environment.  You sometimes feel like just a number and not an actual human.  Wish we were praised more for a job well done. All in all its a good job, pays well, and the people are decent to work with."
good,Valspar has had tremendous success in paint manufacturing and is recognized as a leader in the industry.  It has a decentralized organizational structure which can be good and bad.  On the good side there's a lot of flexibility to implement new ideas at a local level.  On the bad side - if the idea is big enough there are many road blocks which can hurt morale.  Most management teams operate in silos because there is no clear direction with priority given to the proper issues at hand.  The company is full of great people and most people want to develop but without the tools and leaders to develop its workforce most people never develop to full potential.  That goes for both salaried and hourly.  Pay is above average and the benefits are solid.  Work-life balance is above average as well.
good,Not enough compensation for the type of work being done and the amount of work being done. Management is not very approachable. Do not feel like I was provided enough training to do my job efficiently.
good,"I like working there, just need more money and closer commute. Learned how to mix chemicals without proper protection management. Coworkers are very good people especially the veterans.  Hardest part of the job is not being able to breathe fresh air. Meeting new people from all the turnover that happens on a daily basis."
good,"I worked for Valspar and was in charged the Ace Hardware Account for East Texas, Houston, San Antonio, and South Texas.  I provided training to store employees and attended to all customer needs."
good,"very stressful job,  good management, good pay and working hours"
good,There can be some nice profit sharing and bonus opportunities
good,"Maintained paint production lines. Mechanical, electrical, pneumatic, hydraulic repairs throughout the shift. Answered calls for production line breakdowns, machine changeovers and facility repairs."
good,Valspar decided to get out of the business in the division that I worked.  Had a very close knit family feeling in the building that I worked.  Had a lot of potential.
good,The group I was in did not offer much for advancements within the company.  Work done was not appreciated.  Performed testing and support for chemists.
good,"It's been a great experience and opportunity.  I feel as though I'm not being compensated for all the duties I currently do here. "
good,fast paced environment but very safety oriented facility. learned a lot of safety requirements that I did not know before. best part of the job was the people I worked with.
good,"Assisted the VP of Purchasing, typical day was much interaction with department team  requesting report information for Executives of other departments."
good,"paint manufacturing plant. i was trained on every job in the plant and could do them all. Union shop, good pay, sometimes hard labor to perform. worked nights 12 hr shifts."
good,"During a typical day at Valspar, I drive a stand up fork lift and pick orders for shipping.  Also, load and unload tractor trailers.  The work experience overall is a good but not much room for advancement."
good,a typical day starts with a short meeting and stretch in the morning. Then everyone goes to their positions. break at 8 am and second break at 11:30. The shift ends at 3:30.
good,je begint de dag met het bekijken van de inkomende orders van die dag en dan die van de rest van de week en verdeelt de taken zo dat alles optijd af is en als het druk is maak je alvast stappen om overwerk in te lasten daarnaast moet alles zo veilig mogelijk gedaan worden en dat hou je in de gaten
good,"It is an okay place to work, mainly because of the gentlemen you work with. For the work you do the pay is not well. Advancement opportunities is minimal also."
good,"Very Hazardous, requires lots of Safety Regulations for your safety. Chemical hazardous products work-related that requires lots of Safety-precautions."
good,"This job was ok, did many jobs masking, demasking, chalking, fork lift, pre paint inspection, blowoff, blast and blast blowoff Met a lot of good people and Management was good."
good,"A typical day at work, was the same everyday.  Put hazardous chemicals in a tank, mix them together, add hazardous pigments for color, mix, check other properties of the paint and work on the next batch.  I learned more about becoming a supervisor.  Management were not good listeners.  HR department was only one employee stretched between 3 other properties.  Co-workers were your typical male dominant factory employees.  Hardest part of my job was dealing with management, who were not qualified to have their positions.  Enjoyable part about my job was the paycheck."
good,"Scope for learning."
good,"The job its self is not bad, but during the busy season you can easily spent 70 hours a week there. Management is easy to talk to if you have an issue and they are willing to let you change your hours around if you have appointments or something to do. Overall I like the job."
good,"A typical day at work involves testing new batches of paint and making sure they are within the designated specification range. It can get busy and hectic so time management is important."
good,"The Lowe's Sales office was filled with very talented people who truly wanted to be a team contributor.  The hiring process 5 years ago required personality, intelligence, and cognitive testing which helped in selecting the right people to work in the group."
good,"I learned that maintaining very efficient and cost effective programs in a manufacturing facility is a major part of producing a product. Also, learning programs is a very important quality to have."
good,Mobile pro paint shop designed to assist the professional.
good,"I was hired through a temp agency with the promise of a full time position in 6-12 months. After about 4 months it was announced that they would be moving the facility to Minneapolis and an immediate hold was put on promotions and advancement. "
good,"Interesting work in a busy manufacturing environment but unfortunately erosion of the customer base (Australian manufacturing relocating off-shore) led to reduced volumes and redundancies in recent years."
good,"This is a growing company acquiring and dispersing smaller companies.  Seems to help in their growth and their bottom line.  However, it is at the expense of the customers and their U.S. based employees."
good,Pretty good company.  The headaches can come from many layers of management and you are at the mercy of Lowes.
good,"There was a time when it was very enjoyable. "
good,"It help me save alot of money the summer before I left for college, and I met alot of great people."
good,Safety Was The #1 Priority.
good,good hours good pay good management overall a good experience in shipping receiving field
good,A typical day at work is challanging and never seems to end. There is plenty of work available.
good,Valspar is a good starter job but not for the long term. Odors and hazardous chemicals on everything you touch. People not grounding a constant fear of being blown up on an daily basis.
good,Valspar was a good place to work but bad because of layoff at any time. Every one there is family and friends. Learned how to mix batches and test my product.
good,Hay gran respeto entre los compañeros y departamentos.
good,"Fast paced but casual environment "
good,"challenging production , great company with entry level positions with room to grow career wise. learned a lot about operating machines. love the work and process"
good,I have enjoyed my time at Valspar and learned more about the consume business vs the pro painters.  A typical day allowed me to visit location to inspect location maintenance & ride with the rep team to promote sales growth & process.
good,"Good place to work, very friendly and helpful co-workers and management, hardest part of the job is getting wet and having to dry under the air conditioning."
good,Working at a plant is much more high-paced than an office setting. Never bored and always something new to learn every day. Downside is corporate does not take the time to understand each plant's capabilities.
good,"goed management"
good,"It is a very nice place to work. The work-life balance is great, however the subject matter is a bit dull. It is studying how paint dries."
good,"I had just moved to California from Ohio and was able to find a place at Valspar. It's a small group, but it seemed to function very well. The toolbox meetings were very informative, as well as uplifting. There was also stretching that was mandatory before you started your work day that I thought was awkward thing to do at first but proved to be extremely beneficial. There were complaints about management but it wasn't anything different you'd find in a manufacturing setting. I really liked how close everyone was. It was like a tight little family."
good,La empresa tiende a que los errores humanos es para despedir a la persona y perjudicarla sabiendo que nadie es perfecto
good,"A empresa possui uma excelente estrutura, principalmente na área de laboratórios, no dia a dia o aprendizado é constante com contato com os produtos fabricados e análises diversas realizadas no laboratório de controle de qualidade. Possui um ambiente muito agradável para se trabalhar e a direção/gerência é bastante presente nas atividades e prestativa com os funcionários. Algumas dificuldades existem na comunicação entre as diferentes áreas, mas nada que fuja ao cotidiano de qualquer empresa."
good,the work day was fun and interesting with the customers that came in the doors of Panera Bread.I learned that curtain foods cant be placed by or near each other because of contamination and that the peoples thought on how the business looks will determine if they want to eat there or not. the management made sure that all requirements are up held and that made sure we did our job to the fullest and made sure the customers where satisfied.
good,"Hardest part: Long work weeks, working 12 hour shift 5 days out the week. Enjoyable part about the job was being paid weekly. The culture of the job was diverse and comfortable. Supervisors was great, no problems at all."
good,"The plant was a good environment to work."
good,The company was great to work for just got downsized. My manager was top notch and I never expected to be let go. I know that everyone I worked with became family even though I did not spend much time with others because of the area that I managed.
good,"Management is somewhat disorganized. The picture they paint to you at the beginning is not the reality.  This place has high turn-over because of poor management, and lots of politics.  The work is hard.  If you get a line operator position, plan on being wet almost every day you go to work.  Not fun during the cold months especially.  Breaks are ok, but can be short.  Pay is decent.  This facility produces dust, so plan on being dusty from head to toe almost every day."
good,Valspar is a decent and productive workplace.  It is a nice 9 to 5pm job.  The product you support is interesting and uses new age technology that keeps you interested.
good,"Doe maar gewoon ...."
good,"I enjoyed learning about the company and how different it was from my previous job before this, it was a Paint company so I was dealing with Paint unlike my previous job, I was wearing different hats dealing with Electricity & gas along with media calls and other different faults and emergency calls. It was nice but still challenging getting orders processed via fax, phone and emails at a certain time etc. Co-workers were good busy most of the time but I managed to get help if needed from one of them we were a small tight team just 4 of us in customer services so we were always busy and worked well under pressure. Enjoyable part of the job was my team keeping positive and helping each other. Truly got through the day by helping each other and that is what I appreciate the most."
good,", was very good company. fun place to work. union, good benefits, good training on the job. sometimes very long hours.  good go workers, and always safety first"
good,Valspar was a good place to work at the time I was there. Working 3rd shift with no opportunity to move to 1st shift was a boomer. I had to look for something better ans closer.
good,"Providing solutions to customer's problems in a fast paced call center. I learned that in order to solve the really difficult problems, being flexible works better than using a singular approach. "
good,"Company operates lean but sometimes too lean, particularly in areas where it really counts. Less red tape and things get done pretty fast but everyone plays multiple roles in the company. Pay tends to be decent though."
good,"Life was fun sometimes, but the turnover rate climb after change in upper management. Lost customers due to rate increases and poor quality, after making changes to products without customer knowledge."
good,A typical day a Valspar would be sitting at a computer looking at batch tickets and sending them into production. It was very easy but it was very repetitive.
good,Three shift operation that you pick up  where the other shift has left off. The process involves making a batch in the reactor while finishing another in a swing tank. Also preparing one or possibly two batches to be made after the current batch being made. I learned how to multitask  many tasks at one time. Learned to run a reactor and work as a team. Management was minimal. Co-workers on my shift worked together well and helped each other whenever needed. The hardest part of the job was timing out your time to complete all of the task needed to be done at certain times. Most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with.
good,I learned that I was people friendly because I was the first point of contact to the customers. I also learned about invoicing and paying bills. The individual I reported too gave me opportunities to work on big projects and trust my ability to do my job and go beyond. This was a temp position as well that I enjoyed being a part of.
good,"This company no longer exists. Plant closed down after many years. Alot of great employees lost there jobs, and some more than that. I'm sorry valspar couldn't run a business better."
good,Great company to work for. Pay is at or above median wages. Fun and enjoyable place to work. Coworker and team lead are always open to help. Work hours is flexible as long as you put 8 hours in a day.
good,I was able to progress from an assistant  store manager to manager in ten months and there was great support to see the final result from management point of view.
good,"Good place to work, very team environment that pushed everyone to improve.  Workplace felt more like a family than work.  A smallish group, so everyone knew everyone."
good,Overall it was a great place to work. There was a lot of opportunity for overtime. I was able to move into a new department fairly quickly. The atmosphere was laid back and everyone was friendly.
good,Valspar was recently acquired by Sherwin Williams which should provide additional career opportunities.   Everyone is hard working and got a long well together.
good,"i do not like not knowing when overtime was going to take place, i did not like not being able to plan my weekends in fear of overtime more overtime worked than described in interview process.  to much micromanaging"

good,Spent two years training as a diver. Great teachers and mentors. Work life balance is getting better and better. Opportunities to travel and do great things in your career!
good,Fun and encouraging coworkers. You learn that all the research and development are part of something big. And the coworkers are just as friendly and enthusiastic about chemistry as you. The most enjoyable part of the job is that you get a sense of ownership with the project you work on and you learn about the variables of polymer science.
good,Good place to start your career but the company is facing dramatic changes in the management recently.
good,"Managed a team of 4 staff covering all aspects of Finance department. My role was to ensure smooth running of the dept & ensuring accurate ledger transactions before closing off ledgers & producing month end management accounts for FD review."
good,"Go to a different store in each day to rapport with store management staff and maintain inventory control on products within store control. Train employees within department to sell your products, maintain a brand store appearance with replenishing color chip racks and informational brochures that are displayed for the customers. Work outside of store to bring in potential business. Observe and maintain business analytics to see where strengths and opportunities lie."
good,"Depending on who you work with, this experience could be good or bad. Most are willing to work with new people and show them the ropes. Others are not. On the whole, this is a good place to work. Paint is a interesting part of every day life and Valspar is a great place to learn about coatings."
good,mostlyt now they work 12 hour shifts and most saturdays. there is not good communication between management and employees. the hardness part of the job is getting there and boredom. its a very easy job.
good,Best part was being able to take the bus to work in downtown MPLS.  The cafeteria on-site was pretty good with a decent salad bar.  My direct manager was not a people person and never made me feel at all welcome.
good,Fast paced work environment with high demand.  Everyday I learn how to be a better supervisor being more efficient.  The management team collaborates with me to help accomplish department goals.  The work place culture is get it done right the first time.  Minimize mistakes so the team can produce more.
good,I enjoy my job now. I don’t like the harsh chemicals I have to breath in. And I’m looking for diff hours so I can see my kids more. Other than that it’s can be a great job.

good,Typical work day was relaxed and low pressure as long as you get done what you need to.  There is a little bit of micro-management going on.  As long as you hit your numbers and prove that you are doing your job and making sales you will be left alone by management except for the occasional work with you do with your boss.
good,I like the people and the supervisors. They pay well and have great benefits. they work a 3/2 shift.  The hardest part is when the elevator is down and you have to haul raw materials up to the 2nd floor.
good,"I loved the responsibility of the job...making sure we supplied the best product possible to our customer.  I took pride in my job and took it seriously.  The job required interacting with R&D, management and hourly employees.  There was some travel - at least a few times a year.  There were a lot of decisions that had to be made quickly, so you had to think quick on your feet.  The majority of people were great to work with.  But, I did notice if you weren't apart of the ""good ole boy"" group, you were treated as fairly.  Some people made major mistakes and cost the company money as well as had several complaints.  But somehow they were able to keep their jobs over someone who was going through some personal issues and they didn't seem to want to compassionate and understanding.  But other than that, I really enjoyed working there."

I got fillings in 4 teeth, all my wisdom teeth pulled including oral surgery for 2 and my cost was around $200.
