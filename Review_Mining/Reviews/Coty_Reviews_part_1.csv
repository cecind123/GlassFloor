rating,review
bad,Worked here for  a year or less.  Coty acquired from Procter & Gamble.  It wasn't anything I enjoyed about this company other then the people I worked with that also came from P&G
bad,The people who work here are rude from management to temp employees. The environment is toxic and stressful to work in. The pay is low and the managers play favorites. Having education means nothing without experience but they won’t allow you to gain experience.  Terrible work/life balance as well.
bad,"They fired you without notice , big sales goals no tools , the tools are at the managers garages.  Lots of pressure and stress no any help , work overtime but not paid ;-( unrealistic sales goals for 1 person. They had budget for 2 people but only 1 worked and they make you lie the VP of the company when he visits ."
bad,"worked there for 1 week left with no job to go to as it was that bad . they made it seem really good at the 2 interviews i had but was nothing like i was told when got there . it should have rung alarm bells when the forgot i was there for there second interview waited over 2 hrs then was told sorry they forgot i was there and could i come back next week !!."
bad,"Lots of old heads, 20% turnover rate yearly, stock is going down, pay is lower than average, lots of processes, not enough talented staff are working here in Toronto."
bad,I got  a message off a woman from flair recruitment for an interview she cancelled like an hour before and then hasn’t got back to me since. Very unprofessional won’t be applying for any more of their vacancies.
bad,"Business units within an organization must work together to accomplish goals. The general manager is responsible for communicating the team mission and fostering an environment that builds consensus and gains cooperation from others in order to accomplish the mission. Effective managers know how to develop, encourage, maintain and reward cooperative work relationships. They understand how to facilitate teamwork and foster trust and commitment. Without a standard of behavior when interacting with others, effective teamwork will not happen."
bad,"They do not care for people. No respect for diversity, people management and integrity. No long-term planning. What I learned is that there is no job security, and they can completely deny the previous agreements that they had given. No verbal communication about the announcements, etc., which is another proof of the lack of professionalism, and the fact that they can change their mind the next day"
bad,Loved my job! It didn't matter who had what title we all chipped in made it happen.  I have never seen such team work.The best company I have ever worked for.
bad,"Management : aucun suivi du stagiaire, grosse pression avec le contexte de restructuration, des gens qui veulent partir, tous les gens dénigrent la boite et les managers dans leurs dos. Super ambiance ! Les salariés regrettent amèrement l'ancien temps avant la fusion avec Procter. "
bad,The pay was terrible and there was no room for pay raises. What I learned was never let anyone break your spirit. The management was poor the best part of that job was my co-workers.
bad,Every excuse in the book for not paying independent contractors who travel and represent this company.  They are taking 45 or more days and still no money to pay personal credit cards for company business.  This place is the absolute worst.  And no one cares.
bad,You don't want a job at Coty. They take thriving company and rip them apart until they want to sell. They care nothing for their employees.  Management cares only about thier jobs and brow beat you to ensure they get bonuses.
bad,Jefes de linea sin formación ni para realizar su trabajo ni para tratar al equipo por lo que el operario trabaja con miedo y sin motivación.
bad,"no comment, because some days are better than others and that might be anywhere a person works. But I believe a company should always look out for it's employees because without them there would be no company."
bad,"you don't need hard work here as your performance will not be monitored on it."
bad,"Too many managers, too many meetings, too much micro managing and not enough focus on working as a team to get the work done."
bad,This company is a cancer and does not care about the people. This place will drain your personality and energy and will stab you in the back before you know it.
bad,"Since the merger with P&G, the company has had very high turnover. Very little promotion within, no clear vision or business strategy for improvement."
bad,"Micro managed by leadership- my boss and his boss and her boss, poorly ran company. This company has generations and generations of families working there so there are tons of clicks there. Lots of relations going on from management down to the floor! Management protects bad employees from being fired for performance and attendance. Shift leads are not hired based on qualifications but how well they know people or how many men they slept with and the list goes on and on. Stay away. Hardest part of the job was working with SOME of the worst  overpaid line operators, they should have been making 10 per hour on 2nd shift that were lazy and just wanted a pay check. The GPWs worked better than some of the line operators on 2nd shift. Pay checks were good vacation was bad. Christmas party was good."
bad,"The job is very stressful and they work you way to hard and to much with so little pay. The management is very poor, they patronize you and treat you very unfairly."
bad,"Poorly managed company, upper management doesn't care about how people feel and no opportunity to advance. Encourage work flexibility but not available for all department."
bad,"This is a terrible work environment - little to no guidance.  No supervision, no help.  Management is not present for help. This has been an awful experience."
bad,"Horrible locations, management talks a lot does not accomplish anything. Lack of communication. No training program set in place. Managers must act fast and they are practically alone to figure things out."
bad,"Cannot recommend Coty to job seekers. Weak culture, poor leadership, lack of organizational direction, and an overall arrogance that validates the momentous business divestiture that is currently happening."
bad,"En la zona nueva en concreto pésimo condiciones malas poca ergonomia y demasiada gente mandando ."
bad,"After the 2016 merge with P&G beauty business, Coty is still in chaos and has totally changed.  The problem is they no longer know what they want to be and are trying to force a new culture that isn't working."
bad,"uninspiring leadership with no vision for the future of the company. toxic culture that starts at the very top and flows all the way down through the organization. very unfortunate as there are a lot of dedicated, passionate employees who are demotivated by this culture and lack of disrespect from senior leadership. most employees are overworked and underpaid."
bad,"Stressful workplace, poor management, alot of friendship based decisions. The pay was good, benefits were good but definitely understaffed which left the employees overworked."
bad,"Low pay, no benefits, Everyone looks down on you if you are young/entry-level. Pretty nad company. Laid people on left and right because they have money issues."
bad,"Working here, either you win or you die. The company is huge and moving extremely fast, so there are a lot of opportunities, but only if you accept to give up your life and to kill (not literally) everyone on your path. Your actual work output doesn't really matter, provided you're good at selling yourself. Everything's a blank sheet, there are no procedures, everyone's tasks are in contrast with other's ones. Management is fueling this competitiveness and the environment is constantly tense, not to say threatening, everyone can be fired at any time. Overall, it looks like there is no strategy that spans further than a few days."
bad,"Gave it a shot, but didn't stay long. Had very little support from managers whatsaoever. It was a very disorganised place to work at, with unsensible plans, nice words were just nice words - the ideas said on meetings were not implemented in the day-to-day run. (Not talking about big ideas here, just the basic stuff like support, training etc.) People with questionable moral in charge. Colleagues were very supportive helpful though. I don't recommend overall."
bad,"Coty expects 200 % out of every employee. They promise you promotions, pay increases, special training to get you in there, then don't come across. They use you for there purpose's then get rid of you."
bad,"I worked for this company for 3 months and I could not stay there any longer after I saw how badly management handled their daily operations. I left a fortune 500 company to work here because the benefits and pay seemed promising but I was very disappointed. There was a director and three supervisors in our department that would oversee the staff but the director would come in late everyday and when she showed up she would chat up with one of the supervisors for hours about what her life was about after work and due to her speaking loudly we could often hear the entire conversation while trying to work. "
bad,llegar a horario y reponer las gondolas que me dice el encargado
bad,"The culture at Coty is all about the shareholders/executive managements pockets getting fatter and fatter at the expense of those that do the work. They have no idea what they are doing, every 12-18 months they restructure and change their business format. Management is very sneaky and thinks they can fool employees - Example posting your job online while you are still employed. They set up people for failure, they do not train anyone - they just throw them into the lion's den and expect the employee to figure it out instantly. They will change your boss without any notice, not even the courtesy of meeting with a new boss before they begin their role at Coty. They do not value long term employees and get rid of them like discarded garbage and do not offer them fair packages. I have seen this happen to dozens of employees ever since they went public. This company was a dream when they were private. Management was loyal to their employees. Not any more."
bad,The management there is horrible. This company has a revolving door. The full time employees have nasty attitudes and do not know how to speak to people. They treat the workers like dogs.
bad,"poor pay, very repetitive jobs, rude management, no life outside of work, no job security, purposeless break, if they are short on a line you will do your position and the other persons, youll fall asleep on the line its soo boring, uncomfortable work environment"
bad,"Extremely toxic environment with absolutely NO work/life balance.  Frequent layoffs mean the person sitting next to you may ""disappear"" at any time and you will be mandated to assume his/her role as well as your own with no additional compensation, reward or recognition for doing so.  (""Since you are declining to do so, I assume this means you are handing in your resignation?!"" - SVP, Human Resources)"
bad,"The company tends to hire and fire permanent employees knowing they are not technically going to remain permanent. "
bad,"When I first started Coty about 5 years ago it was a great place to work. Great work/life balance, plenty of room for advancement and overall a great working environment Fast forward to know and I can tell you that it's as if I'm working for a totally different company. Ever since ""acquiring"" P&G's Beauty business they have been laying off massive Coty employees and replacing them with P&G personnel. Also a majority of the business is all being moved to Europe with whole departments being wiped out entirely. "
bad,"LOTS of promises......Lots of lies. Mangers are kept completely in the dark, with zero or false communication from leadership. Work/life balance: if you want to get your work done, you can expect to work way more than 40 hours. Coming from corporate environments, this is the worst place I have ever been."
bad,"Terrible place to work as a Process Engineer.  The Director of Fragrance and most managerial positions, have been vacated since and I am thankful for future employees."
bad,"Worked there for almost a year as a temp, after new management took over in my department, things got worse. Supervisors chose their favorites and treated them well, the others not so well. Had constant issues with supervisors calling the temp agency rep to handle situations that could have been handled better. Overall employee happiness and mood was low, and the permanent staff only cared about how they looked and stepping on as many disposable temps they could to make themselves look good, never cared about their temp staff, promised advancements, but never delivered, always had excuses and lies to push and prod their temps to work harder for lousy pay if or when you'd get all your hours."
bad,"The company stated has continually provided poor management to ensure that their workers are truly working. Hard working individuals are often harassed, while others who complete minimal work are praised."
bad,"aprendi a ser cajera"
bad,"My opinions are based on my experience working at the Rocky Point, NC facility that recently closed. My experience is in no way indicative of what conditions may be like at other Coty facilities."
bad,"Great pay and benefits do not compensate for the poor management and work environment. Large turnover of long time employees is the recent trend. "
bad,"Strong team spirit at Coty, but top management is simply a disaster. It seems there is no vision and no understanding of how people are overwhelmed by the quantity of work since the take over of P&G perfume brands. Expectations remain the same eventhough the workload has tripled and we lack resssources."
bad,I was there for two months and then they had massive layoff. My group was laid off but they brought new people in. It’s like a revolving door there. Poor management
bad,"Pros"
bad,"I only worked for a few months at Coty, but I did notice they had a huge turn around for employees. They always hired temps, and never kept anyone permanent or longer than 6 months. Everyone was replaceable and they constantly reminded you that you where a temp. "
bad,"Pros:"
bad,"When Coty was smaller, it was fun, inspiring place to work.  Now it tried to grow by leaps and bounds without maturing the processes first.  Failed miserably at it, which is why the stock is where it is at.  Executive Management is blinded to reality of the inner workings of the processes or the people because they stay in New York/Paris/London.  The culture has become toxic in that people advance by tearing down others with no merit.  Unfortunate lack of true vision by VPs and up..."
bad,Major Supply Chain issues based on the last CEO's strong push to do multiple projects at the same time without stability. No clear progress in sight this year.
bad,"Not much to say, it is toxic. It is who you know now what you know. The more skin you show the more you are liked. It has great potential once they change out the leadership"
bad,Not a horrible place to work and efforts for improvements were being made. Management needs work.  Highlight of the job is the free gift bags full of products.
bad,This company only thinks about filling it pockets and drives away the good talent and productive employees. Instead of producing quality products its all about getting the products out and selling substandard products. Management is bias and only promotes the significant others and close friends. The Hr team is very corrupt and does nothing to help or protect permanent employees. Anyone with 15+ years is getting fired or jobs are dissolving. Not a secure business anymore and takes on new projects without securing and being subject matter experts before moving on.
bad,"I started working for Coty, Inc due to a buy out.  The management there wanted you to do what you were supposed to do and not go above and beyond.  They called it job security."
bad,"There was a merger from Procter and Gamble Cosmetics to Coty on Oct.1,  2016 and thru the re-organization, my role was eliminated and my last day was 12/31/16.    "
bad,I learned of to use a pallet jack and palatalize and wrap the boxes up and it help boost my stamina cause i was working 12 hours for certain days.
bad,"The People Are unorganized and unprofessional, I just started and 3 days i had to sit at the wall until they found a place for me and 12 others to work and last Friday everyone the was waiting had to go home. They are a waste of time and wasting peoples gas to drive back and forth for nothing and hard work for little pay. So Im looking for work else were."
bad,"Was there 7 1/2 years. Been on long term disability for year. See at least 10 dr visits monthly. Was terminated due to not returning messages from hr in a two day block. If phone screen is broken how do I see a message is there. Sorry was on disability and living on 60 percent wages with wife and kid, oh yea and we are homeless due to Florence. Still fired me.  So I will let whoever reads this answer about working at Coty."
bad,"Mandos intermedios, en general, poco preparados. Eso tiene graves consecuencias para los operarios. Poca coherencia laboral."
bad,"Muy buena empresa, ambiente de trabajo saludable.."
bad,"Firm sales goal each year employed with Coty & P&G,exceeded $17 MM.  I have a strong ability to build trusted relationships with customers regardless of size or GTM model. Meeting deadlines and operating within budgets continuing to be fiscally responsible and accountable for customers/ activities/ materials in my domain is very important to me. Love a challenge and ability to sell in and sell through. Managing people is a joy to me,watching them grow and succeed in their roles. I controlled trade fund matters for the entire team. Met and exceeded education goals, delivered a variety of events (shows, classes, sales meeting,etc.) to a very diverse audience, (store employees, salons, consumers, Korean, Hispanic, and African American).  The most enjoyable part of my job was working with my team and customers."
bad,"While only working here for a short period of time as a temporary worker i found the working conditions what you would expect working as a line operative. A mediocre job satisfaction but with friendly Co-workers."
bad,Advancement takes years and you have to be a forklift driver or a scanner. Other than that your stuck. I knew hard working people that had been there 3-5 years no advancement at all.
bad,"Good work place but some of the line leaders are very pressing, and did not experience good managing."
bad,I was there for a couple of months and they felt the need to thin the heard so people were being let go left and right. only a few months later it all happened again and now for a third time and people who have been there for years are not getting their contracts renewed including myself. the company does not care for its staff.
bad,Coty has turned into a political play ground where managers would much rather higher people who can personally benefit them or go with an external candidate. The HR is an even bigger joke.
bad,"The only thing I once enjoyed about this job were the few people I'd made friends with. Once that was gone, the working conditions, and the management above me, weren't worth the type I was doing for such little pay."
bad,"Inspect products on assembly line for damages or any errors"
bad,"Equipe reduite, PSE successifs, management defaillant."
bad,Por la mala organización de las encargadas y al no tener el control sobre el personal estos mismos faltaban sin previo aviso y por ello generaba una recarga de trabajo con lo cual la empresa no podía cumplir con el tiempo y forma con sus clientes
bad,"nothing to report on Coty Beauty.  "
bad,"its a big company, but in argentina it's not that big. They have good products but they are not as well developed as they could. they have quite serious problems in keeping there good human resorces in the company"
bad,"Una empresa en la que reina el llegar a los picos de producción marcados por el director general más que cualquier otra cosa. La gente era despedida por el simple hecho de no llegar a dicha cantidad de producción."
bad,I love cotys but it just was'nt enough money and they wasn't doing any hiring it was going to be 8.50 all my life until I work there cotys good for people for a part- time job only
good,Poor Manangement...Work 50+ hours per week. only 2 weeks of vacation. very stressful...no work life balance...the company is uncertain...the company has changed greatly over the course of two or three years...more work with less people.
good,"no room for advancement however, OK beginning job for experience for a high school student. But not a great pay for permanent, long time employment."
good,Working for this company was a satisfactory experience.. Great job for anyone who wants to expand their working resume.There is a lot to learn in this working environment.
good,There are no opportunities here unless you are content with working in the same position for 20+ years with no incientment.
good,"Extrema desorganização, alguns gestores fazendo experiência pessoal  para ver se sai alguma coisa correto... Diretor que manda em chão de fábrica. Para isso existe gerente, coordenação e supervisão."
good,"The AE speaks poor english and likes to put all her responsibility on the freelancers . Also lacks communication skills, the job would have been great if my boss was someone else. Communicating with her on a daily basis was beyond stressful. I would dread talking to her .  The managers are all very cliquey and catty. If you aren't a major suck up prepare for your life to be miserable ."
good,"It was a temporary job. As a temp, you got the back end of everything . Low pay, no benefits, novacation & poor management. Coty's itself was a smooth job. Id work for the actual company, but the temp service is a no way. 8$/hr is college kid money."
good,I got with everyone fine. A lot of times no one could tell you what to do so you would figure it out on your own. management was not helpful
good,I am able to connect with people and make them feel good. Advise products to suit their needs and accommodate their daily lives. The hours are flexible and you have the ability to go in and work when you know that the store is busy...hence making it easier to meet sales quota. Hardest part of this position is the people are not respectful of one another; as there is so much competition and most of the women are rude to others.
good,"Péssimo ambiente de trabalho, principalmente no marketing"
good,"No structure yet after doubling the company size. "
good,unloaded 10-12 trucks a day with no time to get your thoughts together due to rushing work instead of getting with the worker to make it easier for the worker and the company to get the best quality of work the best part of the job was the other workers that tried to help make the the job simplier
good,"OK place to work"
good,"No raises even when we surpassed or sales goals, bonuses were taken away without the company even telling us. Hours are cut at random even after being promised a certain amount of hours"
good,"Need new fresh management, due to a very long transistion period, the company is struggling with their management style. They do have some of the most respected and well known Legacy brands in their portfolio."
good,"In most departments there are no standard operating procedures.  You are literally ""winging it"" and please cross your fingers that the person training you is knowledgeable in the position or knows how to train or else you will surely fail.  Coty's business module is changing every two years, with new system integrations, departmental changes and often time the employee is the last to know!   Coty was once a great place to work, especially in 2010-2015, but that instantly changed once the company went public and new management came aboard.  And forget going to HR, they will only protect management and foster the hostile environment for the employee.  Most of the employees are over- worked, under-appreciated and can often be found in the break room, on their cell phones interviewing for the next job.  My advice for anyone seeking employment at Coty is to get the experience and Get Out!!!  There are other companies that value and listen to their employees, unfortunately Coty is not one of those companies!"
good,"Coty Inc, Hunt Valley is in transition.  During this time it is extremely stressful.  Plant leadership is not stable.  Managers are not trained.  Employees are not happy"
good,"Coty has the potential to be a great place to work, if upper management would listen to their employees instead of chasing away top talent. They have great healthcare benefits, some good practices when it comes to Summer Fridays and Maternity Leave, and some truly wonderful and inspiring employees, but communication from upper management leaves a lot to be desired. The general feeling is one of unrest; morale is low, and has been for quite some time."
good,short time line for Merger with P&G. Stressful working conditions.  training was rewarding being able to help personnel world wide.  long commute a lot of traffic
good,"Very fast paced environment where operators are not paid enough for the duties they perform. You are often asked to go above and beyond by working late, working weekends, and even doing others jobs with no recognition for the hard work you put in."
good,"loaded and unloaded work on and off the conveyor line, then took finished product to shipping area with a pallet jack.. management wan nice at times.."
good,"Job cuts happen a lot and they let many talented people go.  There is zero feeling of job security.  I loved my job, my team and my customers.  My team always produced top results yet when I returned from an extended medical leave (very serious condition) I was told my position was eliminated after 12 years. They don’t care how old you are or what you bring to the role. "
good,"An ok company to work for, offered training but only in house so allowed all my external certificates to run out which I thought was wrong. Management was poor for my area, a pass it on mentality in alot of departments. "
good,"Buen sueldo y el ambiente es agradable ,a veces mucha falta de educación por parte de jefes y jefas de línea. Contratos EXCLUSIVAMENTE para verano, no hay posibilidad de indefinido"
good,Okay job if it’s just temporary. Not a lot of room or opportunities within the company for growth. Sometimes unorganized and workers are extremely unprofessional
good,It has been only few month since Coty has acquired Color Brand from Procter & Gamble and it has been learning stage right now where am understanding the structure and culture.
good,"I've had a good experience with Coty. The company is going through growing pains, but has some good people working through it. The business is down, and are losing good people through attrition."
good,A job to know all of the up coming perfume. Is considered a good full-time job. Will start off at $8 an hr. It is usually considered a temporary job. It has 3 shifts.
good,"not a bad place to work "
good,It is an ok place to work if you you are content with doing the same thing for 30 years of your life.  If you do not want to advance then you won't.
good,A very fast paced company that cares about it's employees work/life balance. Lots of meetings and many projects to keep everybody on their toes.
good,Designed men and women special holiday fragrance gift sets including of over seeing production such as photo retouch of products.
good,"Working with employees and customers on a daily basis"
good,"Typical day: order processing & accounts receivable."
good,"Coty has been a great place to learn and develop my skills, but there has been no focus on career development for many of my coworkers and myself. Promotions come after many long conversations about feeling stagnant and micromanagement is a big issue. Work Life Balance is better than most companies though."
good,Falta de cultura organizacional. Cabide de empregos.
good,"Only worked for Coty during the transition from Cincinnati after divestiture of BC brands from P&G.  The Company nearly doubled, and was trying to merge the ex-P&G brands."
good,"Products are over prized designed to trick young superficial clients. If this is the business strategy that management thinks is best for Coty, that is okay but there are other things they could also do to promote the corporate name. Perhaps Coty could show good citizenship by giving out scholarships or Coty could show their respect for their customers by helping them see that inner beauty is even more important than outer beauty."
good,"its a good place to work but I have been working their for five plus years. Don't get me wrong its great if you don't mind groveling for a permanent position, unless your a hot young single."
good,"Coty est une bonne entreprise, mais la culture d'entreprise ne permet pas un bon équilibre vie professionnelle vs personnelle."
good,"A day at the shop means 10 to 12 hours 5 to 6 days a week. Lead a great team of multinational talented individuals. "
good,"The plant is a very nice place to work. Great co-workers. The management ,however, is less than optimal. They tend to think that all problems can be solved with a spreadsheet. If you go to work there,get what you want up front, because there is very little chance for advancement afterwards."
good,You dont get paid enough to do all the work you do. They should hire more permanet people. It's people that's been temporary for years and still never get permanet. Other than that great people.
good,"Typical day is extremely busy, but fun and exciting environment. Employees take pride in manufacturing such great products. The employees are the best and extremely loyal to the company."
good,Desarrollo de un nuevo sistema de gestión para ahorro en planta.
good,Executive leadership turnover & change has been significant over the past 2-3 years.  The organization has grown too quickly in the past 10 years to be able to do things well and the poor results have shown from that.  The Sanford factory is a good place to work for the most part.  Fairly good benefits and pay overall. Many people have left in the past few years that haven't been replaced.
good,"The team members work together to represent the whole group before clients and executives well. Company benefits package and perks are great; after 5 years of service, 5 weeks vacation time including summer Fridays."
good,"The people are awsome. Cafe lunch is gross, some supervisors are rude but its ok. They place you where your needed so you learn so many things. You also have to be percise"
good,"Jeune diplômé cette entreprise apporte une expérience à vivre, celle d'un groupe américain construit avec des nombreuses fusions acquisitions donc une vraie diversité des collaborateurs."
good,Pleasant place to work. Work speed was the same everyday you knew  exactly what job you would be doing From day to day. Work was very easy to learn people was very helpful.
good,"Long days"
good,"Coty does pay fairly good, but the pay could be better. They don't offer any bonuses to the regular employees and the managers who sit in meetings all day take the big bonuses home."
good,"high stress job that did not compensate accordingly management played favorites"
good,"Solid place to work. No room for growth at the company. Great benefits like discounted fragrances, and Fridays off during the summer. Careers stay at a standstill there."
good,"Boa empresa para se trabalhar."
good,"Having worked as Area Manager for my company for four years and  the takeover by Coty, the last two years have proved challenging with the changes made to in my opinion a company that was solid in every way."
good,"My work week runs from Tuesday - Saturday. Tuesday and Wednesday are office days. Responsibilities in the office include payroll, sales tracking, training, event annalysis and planning, setting goals for season with team of 50+ employees, motivation of team members, hiring of new associates, and etc."
good,Coty was very fun and good loving place to work. I made sure everyday i put a smile on everyone face while i was there because the work can be hard but i try my hardest to make it suitable for everyone.
good,OK place to work. Worked there straight out of high school. Helped me lean about working together as a team. The most enjoyable part about my job was the fact that i got to meet a wide range of people.
good,My job would be pack things out. Drop bottles on the line everyday. I also help out around if need to do so. From this job i learn how to work in group and how to the things the right way in the line. My co-workers would help out sometimes when needed to. Some of they where nice people to work with. My hardest part of my job are be pick up the bottles of the packing place. To but them of the line. Also help run the line with a high speed without nonstop. The most enjoyable would be helping clean around and get everything ready to tomorrow. SO we can head home.
good,"Faster, Further, Freer is the motto, and they live by it.  Can be challenging and frustrating at times."
good,"Job Security, steady work weeks, and overtime. I feel management could improve. The most enjoyable part of my job is supervising the line."
good,"Benefits are good, job security is low, there is a high rate of turnover. There are people that are stuck or set in their ways and don't want to except change. Management or direction from management seems to change constantly. Work flow is constantly changing, old equipment is constantly breaking down causing massive mandatory and weekend overtime. There are very few good people there that want to succeed. Succeeding at producing the amount of product OEE and helping to promote those that do want to succeed."
good,Coty was the easiest job I have ever had.  I feel that the culture there has changed with the new people in human resources.  They tend to not want to deal with issues
good,Working at Coty's was pretty good. I liked how it was basically the same job every day making it easier every time i returned to work. The other employees were friendly and as were the managers.
good,"It was a very basic simple tasks, but the repetition left me with a lack of motivation. I felt like my skills could excellent more in a different place or job title."
good,"slow pace company. Management lack leadership and a clear direction. Not security of work and hard career advancements. "
good,"enjoyed co workers "
good,"You must be a self - starter. You will wear many hats working for Coty (fast and furious). For me I enjoy the active, busy work days."
good,I like it's a fun job an it's laid back I love the hours an the pay I like it but it could be more an the people that work ther they or nice as long u or
good,"sold mens fragrances, merchandised gifts/fragrances, very competitive, had to sell a certain range in sales each shift/day, sometimes gets real boring standing around"
good,"Work is consistent at Coty inc. They keep you busy, but provide you with competitive wages. I emjoy the work that I do. It is a steady 40 hours a week with minimal overtime at the moment. I enjoy the hours of 6:00 a.m. to 2:30 p.m."
good,Good company to work for but they moved my division to New York which I was not interested in relocating. Benefits are good but I have confused feelings for management
good,The leadership is not united and has short term focus only. The good part is that there are pockets of people who are willing to collaborate and look out for each other.

good,Coty embraces a forward thinking mentality.  They utilize their sales team to drive growth.  They are becoming the #2 Beauty company globally.
good,"I set up of the machines before the temp employees would arrived, flush, prep and prime the system. Management was a constant turnover, the permanent employees worked well together for the most part.I think the hardest part was getting the temp employee to come to work, when they did the numbers reflected. In the year and half of running the line we only missed our numbers 3 times, that was because the machines broke and we didn't have the parts to repair them on site."
good,"Interesting product categories and brands."
good,"Never a dull moment, with each day presenting challanges and solutions. Team work and support from all levels, machine operators to management. Hardest part of the job is to not succeed in getting a piece of equipment running to it's full capacity.  Most rewarding part of the job is to mentor/coach an employee to their full potential, especially when there is a language difference."
good,"My job mostly consisted of preparing costing sheets and manpower sheets for new products. Also, I entered the routings and production versions in SAP. I also worked on a few productivity improvement projects. "
good,Expérience très enrichissante malgré des horaires intenses et beaucoup de travail
good,"The new CFO said it best, Coty had a heavy org structure outfitted for a $40bn company. Too bad Coty is actually $4bn. Overall, great company with very smart people. The organization is in flux and expected rounds of layoffs. But I consider this temporary. Consider Coty in 6-12 month horizon."
good,I had a very short term consultant role so did not get a good gauge on the culture or work environment. But for the short period I was there I enjoyed my team very much.
good,Nice place to work. Management could have been friendlier. I would probably work for this company again!
good,"Briefly good people just do it attitude"
good,Clean safety first kind of work environment but the job can be stressful because it's fast paced and you're working along side people who've probably been there for years and don't like picking up slack off New comers. To deal with that they deserve more pay . And Just in general more pay for the cost of living or at least room to advance
good,"too much leadership change. narrow career path. Benefits are great, pay scale is good for certain roles. I am moving on due to lack of opportunities in my area."
good,I put caps on perfume bottles. Its a sit down job all day on a assembly line then I get switch around to other lines.Sometimes they don't explain the the job to you just put u one line

good,"steady learn how to use a scanner gun."
good,Company is in a major transition after having bought the beauty brands from P&G. There is potential but management needs to make sure to retain the talents.

If not on forklift pay is terrible. 10 Hour. No promotion potential anywhere. And its all contracted thru randstad, which is a good company, but coty does not hire on so your stuck as a temp and will can let you go for any reason even if its just lack of work to do which does happen after december."

Talk to maintenance techinicians,again both shifts to if there any problems or any new changes to the job functions to the line operations. As soon the line starts I would test the product and do quality checks of my own and at the same I would go to the quality control give them samples of the product that im running to assure good quality production. If everything runs well and quality of production is good I would order more parts of the product if not in inventory aslo order the next job order and get in contact with the material handler to make sure the parts get to the line and send parts that the line does not need back into inventory warehouse. Review 5s process check list guidlines as follows and good houskeeping on production line.

good,The company's culture was very aggressive. Sales results was never good enough regardless of how much of an increase you had. Good behavior and positive results were never acknowledged.
good,"Working at Coty, Inc. was challenging just due to the reformation of the company itself. Additionally, if you are not ready for a high-stress, high-intensity (but extremely rewarding) experience, working at Coty would not be for you. Also, they are very quick to let go of under-performers."

good,Coty is a company that helped me with growth as far a becoming a manager. What Coty lacks is coaching for upper management and the way they treat other. Coty was a good career move for me.

good,A typical day working at Coty starts with interacting with fellow colleagues. They are very professional and my manager is very professional and knows the jobs. She's very supportive and very knowledgeable. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the NY counterpart.

good,Working there was fun and challenging! I learned so many new lab skills and methods that I would not have other places. The lab work was consistent and interesting.
good,I learned a lot about the world of mass production and distribution working a temporary contract here. The workplace environment is laid back and as long as you get all of your work done you can come and go as you please.

I was responsible for finding and correcting errors in data entry, and following up on time-sensitive tasks done by other departments.  That activity took up a third of my day.

If we did then we would move to another line and start maybe filling make-up.  So I had to learn to adapt to the different jobs that I was place at to do.

good,"Coty are a driven company wanting to succeed.  Job security is not too great as they are results focused and not people focused.  However if you have the desire to win and perform, I believe you can be rewarded.  I am waiting to see if this is the case but that is my gut feel a year on from the P&G merger."
good,"I do not have a degree in industrial maintenance, but i came from a personal background in auto mechanics which drew me into the industrial side of mechanical work. I was given the opportunity to showcase my work ethics, and was also given the opportunity to become a permanent mechanic over time. I have proven i can be taught easily, and can be given my own production lines to maintain on a daily basis. Dedicated to my work, and take pride in success."

good,"A typical day of work consisted of greeting all the new hires for the day and taking them to their new department, afterwards I would approach the managers of my department and assist them with whatever was needed for the day, coordinating the employees throughout the day to the department they were needed. If some of the kelly employees needed training then i would train and explain what was needed and expected from them, if someone needed to be given a warning for a certain behavior or because of a fault found in the product then i would talk to them and verbally coach them (another word for warning). Despite the highs and lows of my job I enjoyed every part of it, doing so it allowed me to interact and help the kelly temps workers at Coty. I learned that not everyone reacts the same way and each person learns at different pace, and the challenging part was going at their pace."
good,fun to work however stability is not great if you want something super regular outside of holiday or events. The people are kind but it is competitive and sometimes they send too many reps from Coty to the same place and it hurts your sales.

good,"Typical workday"
good,"A typical day for me would be to set up the work area by replenishing and merchandising the stock. Never at any time will i ignore any customer or bypass an opportunity to make a sale while i am merchandising. After this i stay on the selling floor pitching the product or making it known what is for sale. Basically soliciting in a non menacing manner. Sales, sales, sales,...restock, repeat. I spend a lot of time talking to customers and potential customers...even getting familiar w/some locals who frequent the store. My co workers are usually fine...we are competing to a degree but usually represent different brands so it is a tame competition. Management is confident in their well trained employees therefore allowing themselves to do whatever else they need to focus on. They're aware of what's happening...they watch and they correct if they need to. But mainly stay 'out the way'. I try to have at least one piece of clothing on everyday that represents the brand i am selling...also in this case i will wear the fragrance as well. My job is pretty easy going when you put in genuine effort...bottom line. The hardest part of my day is leaving. i like to set personal sales goals that go beyond what the company expects...sometimes i make it; other times i don't...it's hard to leave before i do. But in most cases i am not allowed to work past 'x' amount of hours.so..."

I've learned about the company and was very passionate about my position and what I could provide for my clients.  The Job culture was great, when I first got on board with this company I made rewarding compensation and created friendships that will last forever.  The easiest part of the job was to engage with my clients and get to know them.  The hardest part was not knowing if we would make our day or not and I was extremely hard on myself for that but I learned how to stop worrying and just do the best I can by providing the customer care and leadership.  My most enjoyable part was for us to be the team that we were pushing through our day by competitively trying to make our goals and from that we would have bonuses, making our clients satisfied because they matter."

While I was there I had the opportunity to casually study beauty/luxury goods during my shifts at the front desk. Many staff members were friendly and helpful, however they expected me to have a basic beauty product knowledge and slightly advanced computer skills to facilitate some customer calls and questions in addition to daily tasks/ group and solo projects that I was happy to participate in. I was expected to know how to do my job well from day 2, training and coaching was minimal but definitely adequate for my role which was easy, fun and mostly slow paced but not boring.
