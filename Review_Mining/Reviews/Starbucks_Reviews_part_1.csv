bad,Une entreprise se doit d’être à l’écoute de ses employé et de récompense des actions ainsi que augmenter les salaires et prendre conscience qu’il n’y a pas que leur petite personne et leur porte feuille qui joue pour que les employé soit heureux de travailler un poste de responsable pour 1200 € et une honte honte à cette franchise !
bad,"If you plan to build depth in your career or advance into corporate from a store position, don't waste your time. If your plan is to go for a corporate position, do so straight to corporate. Stores are unsafe to work at, management bases evaluations on hear-say and most tenured employees. Depending on where you come from, you will either be accepted or not. All of my skills I worked hard to master and maintain were thrown away and I was ostracized for wanting to follow policy and doing the right thing. Maybe not talking bad about one another and making cliques to get someone fired? "
bad,"je venais a force la boule au ventre une des responsable ma menacer, ont est payer 1200 a faire de travail d'un manager les manager ne sont jamais la mais toujours en pause enfin bon moi qui adore l'enseigne je suis tres decu et je ne recommande pas"
bad,"I genuinely love coffee and everything about it so of course working at Starbucks was inevitable because it never felt like a job to me, it was fun and exciting for me. I interviewed and was offered the job on the spot and was so excited to finally have a job I truly enjoyed. However, shortly after working there I began to see that the store manager was rude, extremely unprofessional and wouldn’t mind stabbing an employee in the back if it benefited her somehow, she had zero regard for her employees feelings and made them fear going to her for help and guidance, she always talked down on employees, she always had a bad attitude every time she worked. She made the work environment hostile and unenjoyable when she was around. She talked badly about her employees to other employees, she called them degrading names as well as yelled at them for simple mistakes instead of guiding and coaching she would yell and make the employees cry in front of customers. She always made people feel like they are worthless and stupid. This horrible  behavior from someone I wanted to look up to made me hate everything I once loved and was passionate about and that makes me so sad."
bad,The Yukon location sucks. Management is terrible including the district manager. Constant gossiping by the store manager and she has no respect for peoples life outside the store.
bad,"Worst experience of my life. What I learned? Never to work for Starsucks. They should add flames, fangs and a pitchfork to the logo to depict a more realistic image."
bad,"The company isnt family orientated it makes you work with no staff due to stopping store hours, the management dont care, and there is no thanks for hard work"
bad,"My first GM was temperamental, hard to talk to and was unwilling to work with my schedule after I was hired. My trainer was impatient and not willing to train in any helpful manner and seemed to resent having to train me. This was a few years ago.  It was a miserable experience. The new GM was erratic and hardly ever there, but at least willing to work with my schedule. I was so excited to work for Starbucks. But now I would not recommend it, unless you have a very employee oriented manager. Also Starbucks as a company considers the free drinks and 1 food item during your shift as a part of your pay (this was on a posted flyer). I'd rather have money instead. This high traffic location is also chronically understaffed by design. They purposely undestaff at this Starbucks location. So expect to run like mad for the entire shift almost every single shift and be sweating and sore by the end of your shift. (There will be a number of heavy items to pick up and clean and store. Lots of lifting.)  And for customers to literally scream at you for not being fast enough or for some minor issue. Also the management always promised me gas / travel money to pick up store stock, but I never received any money no matter how many times I asked. Overall my experience was a lot of stress, hard physical labor and aggression for very low pay. I miss most of the staff (it was a nice group overall), but the job was simply degrading and exhausting due to the high stress environment and all the physical labor which made the benefits and low pay just not worth all the trouble."
bad,"•Not only will you be disappointed with working in this establishment, you’ll also be treated unfairly and punished for having a voice or opinion on any work related matter. "
bad,"Starbucks uses a very thin labor budget. You have to work at triathelete levels during your whole shift and you still won't feel like you've accomplished thier unrealistic standards. Also, while you do get benefits, they are expensive and take a lot out of your paycheck so your take home pay is not worth the stress."
bad,"Did not like working for starbucks do not recommend"
bad,You phone becomes your life you can't take off sick or personal time as you want. They do not have competitive pay. Managers always work overtime but don't get paid for it.
bad,While I worked at Starbucks I’d often cry in the bathroom due to coworker harassment and medical/disability discrimination. Customers were mostly rude and demanding. Starbucks sets themselves sup for this kind of behavior from both customers due to its “the customer is right no matter what” attitude and due to its lack of discipline for its employees. I do not recommend ever working at Starbucks
bad,"They want to be a fast food joint and they want a fast speed of service and minimal workers. it's impossible to do. You cant ""connect as they want you too and keep things moving fast. they need to decide if they want to be an exceptional coffee company or a fast food joint."
bad,Pago miserable neta 4000 al mes por una jornada injusta de a veces 12 hrs Te tardan en pagar el primer sueldo y te explotan muy feo
bad,"Place was a nightmare to work for, lack of communication from management and treat all contractors like no one. Would never want to work here again ever!!!!"
bad,While working there other employees threw things at me left notes on my desk insulting my intelligence and telling me to quit my job. I only could take so much that forced me to quit..
bad,"Imagine being hired on, and immediately thrown into a supervisor role, from then on you receive minimal training and its very stressful because if you do any little thing wrong you get written up no matter what it was."
bad,"It’s disheartening to see the amount of outside hires for management positions, that have little to no experience in this industry, rather than promoting from within and investing in its employees that are committed to growth and learning."
bad,Worked for the company for almost three years. Never got a pay raise or promotion during my time there. Remodeled the training modules for the district as demanded by my manager. Trained most of the new employees and helped set up two new locations. No recognition or bonus as promised. Starbucks uses people for their benefit.
bad,The pay was very bad. I had no hours. Been there 1 whole year and only have 8hrs of vacation. Hours are cut.. I never worked a full 40hrs a week. They claim only the leads& supervisor are the only ones who works full time\40hrs a week but nobody told me that when i applied. The leads were very young 18&19yrs old and always asking where and how&what to do. Very unorganized. Supervisor never check check when people put in request employees put in for PTO and i always end up not getting paid for days i requested pto
bad,Worst experience of my life.  They brought me up just to push me down.  I was stressed all the time as the store was almost always short-staffed (on purpose; incredible that they scheduled that way.. to have the bare minumum number of people so that we were all beyond stressed and customers were waiting for longer for their orders.  Just a terrible experience overall.  Don't work here they make it seem like they care about baristas but really they just view you as worker bees.
bad,"El encargado de tienda pone que está en turno y no aparece en días, el trabajo es super elevado y hay poco personal porque nadie quiere trabajar media jornada por 300 euros evidentemente. Las horas extra tras el cierre no las pagan, incluso si ha sido un día súper movido."
bad,"They don't take care of employees and if there is a problem, they throw the employee under the bus. They don't protect and the manager that I worked with lied about some declarations I never said."
bad,Management is the absolute WORST. I go home crying from work at least once a week. The management is fake and makes you feel so bad all the time. Some of the staff is nice but the management makes you feel stupid.
bad,"Schedules did not come out until day of."
bad,Worst job I ever held! Coworkers were catty. Never learned anything other than how to operate the drive thru window. Other employees hired after me learned how to be a barista and never stood drive thru.
bad,"Manager sucked , used my depression against me . You don’t get paid enough . Sure they have good hours and transfer locations . Very stressful , their is favoritism though"
bad,"Getting free coffee and a good discount is cool but is it worth getting screamed at, hours cut, and doing the work of three people because of labor cuts? Not really."
bad,"I have never worked in a more chaotic environment like this place. My manager didn’t care if people showed up a half hour late and on drugs. In fact, he made most of those people supervisors. There was constant drama that all started from my manager. The scheduling wasn’t flexible at all. It didn’t matter if you worked 3 jobs, you would be scheduled for 20-30 hours a week even if you couldn’t make it due to your other job. "
bad,"Killer environment with unreasonable demands.  Incompetent people who are abusive with no support from management.  Promises made are never kept.  In two years I only make 67 cents more an hour!"
bad,A lot of hard work a lot of customer service store manager maybe Works 3 days a week 4 hours a day never there the plantation location . Not a lot of room for advancement terrible working hours the company is just for managers the Baristas are very taken advantage of
bad,"Horrible place to work. Starbucks should be your last place to work management is awful. Strongly advise to find a better place to work. "
bad,Starbucks is a great company on the outside but once on the inside the truth comes out. managers expect too much from you and ask you to keep doing more and more while compensating you barely above the minimum wage line so they can preach about how well paid workers are while continuously expecting way more than what you're worth because of these reasons.
bad,Horrible Company but some of the local managers are OK. Starbucks is a company that will give you some work experience but don't hang around to long. Use it as a stepping stone to bigger and better things.
bad,"I witnessed bullying of a visually impaired employee at the 21st and Amidon store in Wichita, KS and the company simply swept it under the rug like it did not happen. Even the district manager was aware of this foul behavior, and didn't find it to be a problem. The company does not uphold their very own standards in any way shape or form."
bad,Starting off things we’re good. Lack of management at the facility I was located. Better management could’ve lead to better days and better suited establishment
bad,I think that this company needs managers who are trained better for this company. Starbucks should be a fun place to work but all we do us get yelled at and told that we don't know how to do our jobs.
bad,"Management in this company is terrible, and the DM are very racist. They don't care about you, they only care about making money. They don't understand that we are all humans and all the same even if you're a supervisors or store manager."
bad,Vraiment à éviter management de masse on se fou de nous
bad,I have nothing good to say about this company. The amount of work you do and the high stress levels that you deal with are absolutely not worth the money you make at Starbucks
bad,"Hires managers from outside. Prioritizes the customer over you, so you feeel disposable. High turn over rates. Wage not equal to the amount of work. Does not care about your family or well being. Benefits are expensive. Toxic work environment."
bad,Terrible training left me with no drink making experience. I liked the job overall but this location needs a specific person for training. Not someone who is working their own shift along with training... too busy
bad,"Did not treat employees fairly"
bad,"This is not a great place to work."
bad,The people who worked here were just as disgusting as the customers. The managers were lazy and selfish. And the fellow employees had a competition on who could be the second laziest disgusting employee.
bad,"The company isnt the issue, its the people that work for them. The people that work for the company are bad. Even our district manager is horrible at her job! she needs to find another profession, bc this just isnt cutting it for them."
bad,"I worked for Starbucks, they completely disregarded my schedule and made me work with puking in the kiosk. I was insulted everyday by my manager no matter how good I did. My schedule was completely disregarded I was expected to work 12 hours if someone didn't show up and expected seven days a week with no breaks while 7 months pregnant with extremely bad morning sickness and swollen ankles and feet."
bad,"worst work place culture. they pretend to be good even though they are not, they are kind in front of you, praises you but they talk behind your back. they wanted you to be transparent and tell them your work or personal problems but eventually it will be pass on the other stores and everyone will judge you. there's no such thing like partner voice, since they will listen to those senior partners or they will just listen to store managers. i though starbucks is a good platform to work with since it is a very well known company but it is not. before they focus more on their people but today they are just similar with other fast food chains who focuses more on sales and getting the work done. there is no passion at all, even in doing coffee tasting."
bad,"Bully, corrupted management culture that promotes for discrimination and undermining people specially educated , experienced candidates who are perceived as threat."
bad,"Management: wasn't the best"
bad,"Terrible company with terrible leadership, can’t pay a living wage to their employees, all they do is threaten their managers, handicap them from doing their jobs, and make as much money as possible over the safety and well-being of their employees and customers. They don’t actually care about the experience, they just want money."
bad,"when i worked at starbucks there where so many lazy people there no joke expected me to make there check no thank you so i quite."
bad,Wouldn’t go back to working at Starbucks for all the money in the world. They do not care about their baristas or anything else except sales. I could barely sustain myself on the salary
bad,Management does not do their job and is only there to get a paycheck. Say one thing then do another. You constantly answer to coworkers about what to do all day-no independence. Worst of all everyone is not genuine and say all things with a fake smile. Preppy degrading mean people on the inside. I felt made out to be stupid for asking questions as I was still learning. free drink and Spotify were the pros
bad,"Working at Starbucks is one of the saddest things in my life. You are constantly berated by management. Always expected to give more and never receive anything in return. After almost 5 years, I've found it incredibly hard to progress as advancement is only given to those to suck up under management. Filled with long days..early mornings and late nights."
bad,At my starbucks location my store manager would pick favorites on who would get certain hours and shifts. She would also tell you that work life is more important than your family life.
bad,"To many rats just waiting for you to mess up, cut throat back stabbing when someone wants your prime schedual,and no one and I mean no one wil want to hear your version and no one will take the time to help you, it is a shark tank at best"
bad,"Ive worked at 5 stores in four years and had 9 managers. they tell us to clean up puke and pick up biohazzard, they also cancel facilities calls and cause chaos. Its a horrible environment."
bad,"I have always worked a fast paced job and can appreciate starbucks is one of them but they do t care if customers sit in line forever as long as the window times are low because that’s all they time. Managers are unsupportive, and lack basic skill requirements for there job. The store manger is new but hires and promotes based off of having bubbly personality not accounting for skill so we’re fully staffed with sub par workers and mangers"
bad,"It was a fun and productive workplace. Ample learning opportunities. However, the stores that you are posted to can destroy you physically and mentally."
bad,If they didn’t have favoritisms it would be a better work place other then the employees are tryna hook up with each other I feel they would be good and they need to get rid of the roaches too
bad,Starbucks expects a store to run with minimal staff but extreme high volumes.  And then they score you on your customer connection that is impossible to make because you are running trying to get your job done.   Unrealistic expectations. Pay is low and benefits are expensive. I don’t recommend unless you work in a low volume store.
bad,"managers are constantly pushing for more and more from employees all for the sake of a bonus they receive, while we stay unfairly paid. would not recommend this job to anyone."
bad,"Starbucks on its surface should be a very good company to work for. They have a great benefits package, tuition reimbursement for school up to a four year degree, and preach about how they treat partners (employees) as their soul of the company. They offer cool financial incentives. Their corporate culture talks about an efficient and technologically advanced company who is committed to zero negative impact on the environment, amazing work/life balance for their people, and an exceptional customer experience. It should be a great company to work for. However the truth is quite literally the opposite, and no where does this hold true than their store managers. I applied to work for Starbucks in the Store Manager role to expand my leadership capabilities, and while I was successful in doing so, it was only in the face of extreme adversity, borderline harassment and neglect, and with a high degree of mental and physical stress that ultimately led to a disappointing departure from Starbucks. I cannot speak for every market, but the Greater Houston Region suffered from an extreme lack of leadership capability at the district, and regional level. The region was led by an individual who was hired without coming up through Starbucks management, and therefore was out of touch with his direct reports and his store locations. His failure at effective leadership showed in every meeting that I and my fellow peers had with him every time consistently. He didn’t understand our metrics for success, and he didn’t understand the challenges that were standing in our way. This led to a high level"
bad,"工作環境差 壓力大"
bad,They don't like that you have experience and know how to make drinks and run cashier at the same time make sure you continuously check if your request for the day off is approve evem though you put it a month ahead
bad,The manager was brutal. There was a lot of harassment in the workplace and caused numerous of the staff to leave. He caused a lot of stress to all of the workers and made it an unhealthy workplace.
bad,"I’ve been working for a Starbucks for two years now, and because I don’t have children I’m always stuck working late shifts and weekends. The pay is terrible and the management doesn’t support you at all. Avoid"
bad,No proper training leave you to it the place and staff are to clicky the mangers ignore any issues and you just clean on your shift they don’t hire cleaners u are the cleaner even though your employed as a coffee shop assistant ! Don’t waste your time no support
bad,The pay rate was low. Company don`t offer full-time employment. Overall rating is 0. typical day to work is that there is a dress code and an apron that have to be put on before being on the floor.
bad,The manager of the kiosk doesn’t do her job and leaves early only for it to fall on anyone else. never completes her shift. i don’t know how she hasn’t been fired yet for it because customers complain all the time of how she leaves 2 hours early EVERY DAY and will leave brand new trainees to fend for themselves. whatever you do; don’t take the morning shift at this location...EVERYTHING will fall on you
bad,They over work you and the pay doesn’t compensate. I hated how much they cared about getting drinks made wether it’s corrector not and some people COULDNT take direction.
bad,Worked in Miami and then moved to Roanoke and found a very bad environment in the district as well as overall bad ethics. Working in the South Florida market was a lot better than this market.
bad,"My worst job experience I ever had was at Starbucks working as a barista. The training was terrible, I was there for over 6 months and hardly got any time on the bar. I mainly worked the cashier and was store support. I got bedridden sick since other employees were sick. It was the worst sickness I ever had. I was forced to work even though I was coughing up phlegm and had a 103 fever. During my illness I was touching food and beverages. I remember coughing into a napkin while taking orders. The manager had me call every Starbucks store in our district in order to find coverage but there was no coverage so I had to work. The customers for the most part were very kind and I made friends with our daily customers. The morning staff was terrible and would do what they wanted to do on the job. The evening staff was amazing and helpful. The store manager did not do her job and would just sit at her desk on her cell phone. When things did go wrong she would berate/yell at her staff instead of taking responsibility for the problems. The store was always missing something vital such as cups, straws, milk, everyday something was not stocked and it hurt us during rush hours. Clearly the store would run efficiently if they just changed the management since the supervisors were great. That is not going to happen of course but it would be a blessing if the district manager could do a performance audit. I would recommend finding another location to work at, ask the employees about how their store runs and how management operates."
bad,"I would work for any Starbucks other than the one at NRG Park. The staff is friendly however, the store manager is extremely rude, impatient and out right unprofessional."
bad,"Probably the worst licensed store that ever existed. I was sexually harassed and management did nothing. I was also paid the least amount out of every employee, and I was one of the supervisors. I did all of the training. The school that ran the store made me do less training than required, then we would get in trouble from Starbucks Corporate for not doing enough training. We were continuously understaffed and harassed by customers and former employees."
bad,"Your probably wondering why I put no benefits. Starbucks is known for great benefits. But let's be honest, the pay is not enough. 9.00 hour and a payraise of 2% for everyone every January 1st. So if you start January 15th. And someone else starts December 15th. You both make the same pay. Can you survive on $9.18? Will "
bad,"terrible managers were unprofessional, extremely biased, rude, and childish. they gossiped about the employees, and favored some over the others. incredibly unprofessional. bad coffee, and in my opinion and waste of money."
bad,Very very poor and toxic work environment. Working there will turn you into that kind of person as well. Eventually you will be aware that you are there to serve the ego of the partners.
bad,You will be over worked if you are in a busy location . Understaffing is common at Starbucks. Plus management is mostly outsourced so they have zero knowledge on how to run the place .
bad,"Overall, working at THIS specific location was the most stressful job I have ever had in all my life. The managers were abusive and the coworkers back biting."
bad,"Working at Starbucks is fun for the first month and then it just goes downhill. Management would not fix problems that needed to be fixed, most coworkers were disrespectful and unhelpful. They usually just stood there when you asked for help with something. Tips were very unfair, On Christmas I worked by myself for 11 hours and made $99 in tips, but I only got $16 out of it because tips were split by how many days you worked that week, so people who did not show up for their shift on Christmas but had more hours that week got more tips than me. Management and Cooperate did not do anything about it and I think that is just disrespectful to the workers. I would not recommend working for a Starbucks."
bad,"To nurture the human spirit, couldn't be further from the truth!"
bad,"I took the job after being promised a team lead position, found out after onboarding that I was only hired as a barista at a pay rate $5/hr below what I was told I would receive. Instead of full time, I got MAYBE 15-20hrs/week. Tips were abysmal, most I ever saw during a tipping period was $8. Didn't receive any barista training before being thrusted onto the floor. Absolute worst job I've ever had. People rave on about the insurance, but the likelihood you'll actually get enough hours to qualify for it is slim to none, even with extensive previous experience. This job is only suited for people who enjoy having coffee stained skin and going home smelling like rotten milk everyday."
bad,Starbucks mexico le falta mucho para poder ser mejor que ña de estados unidos
bad,"I've had a very bad experience where I was. I was there only 3 months with very little bar time, and my co workers and manager expected me to be at their level with making drinks. If I forgot to ask a customer something, such as wether they wanted their drink hot or iced I'd be lectured. Being downtown, I didn't feel safe, especially after somebody walked in and sprayed the store with pepper spray. especially after somebody"
bad,I advanced into a career path job so that is why I left  they over work you and under pay  crazy hours and not consistent schedule  not a job to stay at long term in my opinion
bad,"Overworked and underpaid. The hours at least were consistent, but even when I requested time and time again for morning hours (because I was working five days a week, all of them closing shifts) I would not get any yet new morning team hires were being brought in. The management has favorites and is very passive aggressive, treats those they favor less as being disposable."
bad,"like I said my views and beliefs didn't mesh with Starbucks, so it was a touch hostile at some points. I wouldn't recommend unless you are part of or don't mind being part of the machine. It is most definitely their way or the highway"
bad,"I would highly recommend working anywhere else. Starbucks is stressful, fast paced, management does not value you, managers will humiliate you in front of customers and coworkers, you are just a cog in the machine and not a valued human. You go home feeling worse every day. It is a very draining job."
bad,If you love working in an overstaffed tiny room and being treated like a child this is the place for you. Literally dread going in to every single shift you work guaranteed!
bad,"Daily stand up with over 20 people. The product manager was curt and unfriendly; he was quick to find fault with the new hires. I made the mistake of pointing out an improvement my software lead could make in a code review during the second week I was there; after that, he turned rather unfriendly. Obvious distinction between contractors and full-time employees. From what I saw SBUX is a huge marketing company with continuous campaigns to drive customers into their stores. I saw that they have a huge logistics operation to move the supplies from their producers to their stores."
bad,"I was never adequately trained, and then penalized for my lack of training. There are probably plenty of Starbucks stores that are good places to work. This was not one of them."
bad,"I would have love to stay at starbucks however there was no room to grow in a company that I love.The mangers where untrained and the baristas had to train the supervisors, with  no pay increase when we did"
bad,"I had mono and was fired due to time off, you are underpaid and over worked, no benefits. No sick days, only unpaid time off. 10/10 would not recommend"
bad,"Im not going to say much cos its not worth my time, but all i can say in my experience some been in my place has a new starter and they didn't try to help much. Manager was ok, but i think it was good for me to leave i couldn't do one more min there that's all. The only thing good and cos im trying to at least be nice was the tips even they was little for the hard work you do at there."
bad,They expect to much for the little pay! It’s sounds nice they pay a little above min wage but it’s not worth the work they want you to put in! They expect you to be a different person !
bad,It's bad. The management culture is one of constant understaffing so you are called into work even on your off days. There is no understanding on the corporate level of what its employees or customers want or need.
bad,"They did not consider my availability even if they were accepted, scheduled me once or twice a week that would either be during my school hours or secondary job hours, never answered my text messages regarding my availability and my several confrontations about my frustration."
bad,"Ignoring contract rule as at document what I signed was 38.5h but real contract what they send at email 18.5h what made more pay taxes less earn , also they do not care to provide proper training as barista. If person do well casher job they keeping weeks to do it as run sales well but at busy time or short staff must do every think even no training so, I left disappointed by very bad manager job as staff was treat no good ."
bad,Starbucks underpays and overworks their employees. They dont care about them or if they can afford to live but the charge at least $6/customer on average they didnt transfer me to the store I needed to be transferred to so I still spent 45min in traffic to and from school causing me to not get home til midnight and lose sleep since I had to class at 730a eventually causing me to drop out all because they didnt want a high transfer percentage they dont value their employees at all
bad,Absoulutely terrible company. Terrible management. they hire 90% women for management and all of them sexually harass their partners. Good luck on staying mentally stable working there.
bad,Worked there for 2 and a half years as a shift supervisor. This place makes you jaded and caused me to have a negative outlook on life. When I left this place my life became way more positive and I learned to love people again.
bad,I really enjoyed working for this company when I first started then my store manager kept telling me that she wanted me to be  promoted .  She started showing me extra things I could do to help the other managers out at the location and then I had to go down to have a sit down interview with other store managers and I was questioned on how to do certain things things that I did not know at the time. Because of that I didn’t get promoted which was fine but she kept telling me every week that I would be after that. Afterwords I went to another location I was told by the same manager that I was going to be promoted but then they hired brand new people so a lot of the management lies about What you actually will have
bad,District Managers are not empathetic or rational about their decision making. They only care about their bonuses & incessantly “drink the koolaid” before they take time to consider the impact of decisions that effect their store manager and baristas. You’re better off working at any other fast food honestly.
bad,No room for advancement. Management tells you one thing and does another.  If you have a family or want a life outside of work this may not be the place to work. In some stores especiallly high volume ones it's a sink or swim atmosphere.
bad,Don't get hurt on the job...from a sink pipe they will not fix...they will not do nothing for you or put you in the company were you can work. They don't care about their employees.
bad,Management was very rude. didnt care to pay people more when they were struggling to cover bills. Wouldn't recommend anyone to work for this company. not to mention they are extreme;y racist
bad,"Horrible and irresponsible management, unprofessional employees and toxic environment which impacted the quality of customer service and onsite work. I dont recommend working here."
bad,The job started out great but then it became increasingly difficult and the pay wasn’t worth the stress of the job. Management wasn’t very friendly or helpful.
bad,"I've worked for Starbucks twice over the years, and my more recent experience was a vast departure from my original one. Where it used to be a detail oriented, creative, artistic place to work, it is now obsessed with only speed of service and unquestioning obedience to your superiors."
bad,This is no place to work if you are trying to grow. You receive the bare minimum. You have to be on the managers good side to get anywhere in the company. Every one does not get treated the same.
bad,They’ll throw you under the bus. Management has downgraded since I started there 6 years ago. This place is just trash now. They don’t care about partners just about making sure you upsell to everyone.
bad,"Management is terrible, was told to provide medical evidence to support obtaining shifts that require a lunch break, thanks for the 5hr and 45min shifts, lied to multiple times, tips went magically missing, the place is ran by kids, if your looking for a job I wouldn't suggest it, one of the worst experinces I've ever had"
bad,"I went on to work for a similar company that provided better income opportunities"
bad,"worked here for awhile and never treated with respect not worth it to apply just for the discount, they try and keep employees there based on their perks but in the grand scheme of things its completely not worth the stress"
bad,"The company's bottom line is unfortunately to make money and any cost. Even though it is the world's largest provider of coffee, the employee experience is lacking. No compensation for extra work or effort, and base salary for full-time partners isn't enough to live off of. The ""Tuition Reimbursement"" is a hassle and often doesn't cover 100% of actual cost, despite the advertisement."
bad,"Non-stop customers, short staffed with minimal support from direct upper management. Not allowed to make decisons on behalf of my staff and  location and feel supported.. "
bad,"This job was nonstop stress. From the moment I arrived at work, often past the time I was supposed to clock out, my coworkers and supervisors would yell and berate me, often for things out of my control. I was not allowed to stand still for a single moment before a supervisor yelled at me to do something, and occasionally there was nothing to be done. I'm not a slacker, at every other job I've been praised for my work ethic. But here I was expected to constantly perform as if corporate was watching me and hoping to see that I'm a perfect, maximum efficient robot."
bad,Working for Starbucks is meant to be ‘fun and creative’ nope. You management don’t care about you or your life. There is little to none progression and they almost always employ from outside instead of promoting those with the skills in the company. Hours are changed with little to no communication and notice. No communication with baristas whatsoever. Rude and dehumanising management and higher.
bad,"Nothing to say. Point blank never again. They DONT care about the employees. Self centered management. When they have problems it’s the number one priority and everything is okay. When an employee has one, all h** breaks loose and we are on the verge of losing our job. I don’t recommend this job to anyone unless you want to be super stressed out all the time."
bad,Starbucks is a place with high standards that will crush you if you aren't careful. They constantly care for the customer with no real back up for their employees.
bad,Young people who talk to much and are over caffeinated. Paid very little. My boss only cared about becoming the district manager and was preoccupied with so many things at once.
bad,i left starbucks after 3 years . it is defintely high school employment if you dont intend  to move up . good job for college students as well as it is only part time work
bad,"Worked hard for over a year with the dangle of promotion in front of my face Went through management change and it was the worst experience of my life "
bad,"I worked at Starbucks for a little over a year and from the beginning I saw how poorly managed, stressful, and unprofessional the place was."
bad,"Within five years of working for Starbucks, it started off great and went down hill from there. No good management at all. They can’t keep store managers."
bad,It is too fast paced to not work as a team. Training is TERRIBLE. You are just thrown out there and nobody likes to help. Worst job I’ve had. Not worth it at all.
bad,"The manager at the Council Bluffs location is terrible. Insensitive, doesn’t care about her employees, will talk about you behind your back. The District manager isn’t any better, you’re better off working at scooters or somewhere else. The benefits aren’t worth the stress, the job runs you into the ground. Don’t do it."
bad,This stores manager does NOT know what she is doing. She spreads lies and rumors about her own supervisors or baristas to her favorites within the store. She will not want to promote from within unless absolutely necessary. The team is not trained properly since upper management doesn't want to ever work at the actual store. The hardest working people get put down while the favorites are the ones thats mistreat customers and have no idea what theyre doung. Just don’t do it.
bad,"I don’t think this is a bad company, however, the location I was at was super unprofessional. I always felt belittled by some of my partners and especially by one of the managers at this location. "
bad,Its just caving into people who complain about company policies that they tell you to enforce on a daily basis. Worked in 3 different stores and management never had your back. Hard to get necessary hours.
bad,"Ich wurde nach langer Zeit als Mitarbeiter entlassen, da man, als ich mir den Fuß gebrochen habe & einen Monat ausgefallen bin, die Kosten für den Ausfall nicht bezahlen wollte. Dies lag Vorallem aber auch an der inkompetenten Storemanagerin. Nun warte ich nach meiner Kündigung schon seit mehreren Wochen auf meinen letzten Lohnzettel."
bad,Se olvidan del Barista cómo ser humano y nunca te dan oportunidad de crecimiento.
bad,"It was like joining a cult. Don't work here unless you want to bow down to the Starbucks gods. Management is terrible and judgemental, I got yelled at because I didn't complete training that they didn't tell me about. How would I have known to do that? Coworkers are alright I guess. Don't expect anybody to get off their breaks on time or help you if you need help. Don't expect anybody to like you for your first few weeks of working. "
bad,"under paid and overworked. most people treated as slaves, even underage employees. good disguise from company that it cares about its ""partners"" but in reality, NOT TRUE AT ALL."
bad,"Trop de pression, salaire pas attractif, environnement du boulot trop de querelle,"
bad,"The managers I worked with at Starbucks made it a negative experience. The hardest part of the job was working with negative employees, as well as negative managers."
bad,If you don't want a job with gossip And drama don't work here .Starbucks is bad news .Work should be professional not feel like middle school. Hours also never stay the same.
bad,"Starbucks works you to the bone for very little pay. Regardless of how many years you have been working there, your pay remains low. I have been working there for almost 4 years and have only got a pay raise of 1.15 since starting. They recently increased the starting pay salary and it is now only 15 cents less than what I make. The only way to get an actual pay raise would be to get promoted which only happens if you lose a manager. In sum, I after devoting some much of my time and effort I still only make 15 cents less than a new hire. If you still want to work here that's fine but don't be too good at your job or you'll be expected to carry the whole store at the same insignificant pay everybody else is getting. This is to say for all locations. Management may not be as bad as mine in most locations however and the people coming through are most times the highlight of the day but is it worth it? NO."
bad,"The management was not all that great, I left after a few months because I dreaded going into each shift.............................................."
bad,"Worst company to work for, would never allow someone I care about to be subjected to the stuff I was, no chance for advancement and older partners were pushed out"
bad,not a bad place to work but it is not for people over 26. if you are not going to school or something it is not very fun. the coffee is burnt anyway. blah
bad,"I was so excited to work with Starbucks. Don't waste your time if you want to work at a place where you are underpaid, disrespected and mistreated by fellow coworkers. Management does not caee about you so dont expect to be encouraged or have your voice be heard."
bad,Customers are rude. Management is uneducated (high school grads) and insecure. District managers are insane and also only high school educated. Girl bye
bad,"Do not work here! Even as a first job. Seriously. They are all talk no action.  "
bad,"The most immature, unprofessional management in the world. They gossip about you, no confidentiality. They mess with your schedule when you get on their wrong side. Egotistic people. Favoritism makes you sick cause it’s like you only get what you want if you kiss their butt. They have people who are not certified training you. They do not care about Starbucks unless theirs visits other than that they can care less. Screw with peoples schedule if they don’t like you. They want yes people, but don’t want real people. If you confide in one person the whole store knows. This store has had many hidden complaints but they fail to follow through. If you wanna get through to this job fake the funk. Don’t trust no one just come to work to do your job."
bad,"Working for Aramark at CSUEB was the worst experience. The management was terrible, the pay was abysmal, and the workers did not do their job correctly. Working here is stressful and very time consuming. The management does not care to take into consderation school schedules."
bad,I did not enjoy my time there. I enjoyed coworkers not managers or customers. I would suggest that anyone interested in the company stay away from tourists areas crazy work schedules and crazy agressive customers
bad,"managers are disorganized, district manager could careless about employees, they expect you to base everything off of Starbucks and nothing else. no training what so ever. A extremely judgemental and very cliquey environment"
bad,"poor management. poor service. poor quality, and not natural. A typical day would require that I maintain a stand on my own with out assistance from my coworkers."
bad,"Poor management team, not a very supportive team! They will push you down so they can look better then you! They say they are there to help you learn then turn to the boss and say theyvare not succeeding just so they can get high in the company!"
bad,"Not a great job. Didn't like it. Coworkers were nice, but you're overworked, underpaid, and the management is incompetent.  Customers don't respect you."
bad,"a good job for a young starting out person, whose still receives income from other places , best as a second job. poor management, lack of respect, forced diversity. Ignorant costumers."
bad,"Starbucks was too stressful and the management did not care about anyone but themselves. Management fires people for mental illnesses, falsely accuses employees of stealing, and treats all people terribly."
bad,I got in a bad accident that severely injured me and totaled my car right after I was hired and my manager still wanted me to work and she told me to just uber. Complete lack of empathy with management. NEVER WORK FOR CORPORATIONS.
bad,Was not respected by management. Had to clean up needles from restrooms. Understaffed on most shifts. General manager favored employees.Working there felt like a Mean Girls movie.
bad,DO NOT WORK HERE! The stressful unorganized low pay is not worth working here. I come in and I know what to do no matter my position but other people don’t. All the managers point fingers of who’s in charge and they all blame stuff on each other’s. I actually know what I’m doing but yet I’m always overlooked. If my old manager was still here I would have been a manager  a LONG time ago instead I’m surrounded by idiots that aren’t organized know how to communicate or be responsible or delegate or see the big picture and details. It’s all a big mess. Customers are unhappy all the time bc no one has there stuff together
bad,"Starbucks is a joke. They ignore loyal workers and hire outside for management positions and they get paid 40k plus and don’t know anything about the job. They try to  guarantee  hours or advancement. Then they change there mind and basically say screw you even though they don’t know what the heck there doing.  They hire a bunch of people and give everyone part tome or super part tome therefore forcing you to quit so you can actually provide for yourself or family.  The managers don’t care. Then while Starbucks passes up all the loyal workers the managements outside hours get the most lax the most everything just no nevermind be completely unoroginzed. They don’t know plays or how to do first in first out. NOTHING!!! Everyone in my area is out of network hires. I know TONS of great candidates that would have  been over and beyond outstanding managers but ALWAYS overlooked. Like I said it’s a joke. Worst job ever. "
bad,The management at the Anacortes location was awful. No choice of availability. Threats of termination if not interacting with every singe customer. Never working there again.
bad,"I was initially hired under the pretense I would be promoted to a supervisor position. When I accepted my offer letter it stated I my pay rate was $11.25, when in fact I was paid $9.50. Instead I was bounce from store to store within my district with the verbal agreement of being a supervisor. When I'd ask question I was told I had ""misunderstood"" previous conversations."
bad,honestly starbucks is a toxic work environment i absolutely do not recommend it to anyone. the management is always weird and power trip-y and they make it so hard to get benefits.
bad,"Management was horrible, understaffed, high turnover rate, manager was new and gave employees two rush hour shifts which caused many employees to be burnt out."
bad,"Terrible management with expectations designed to shoot themselves in the foot and then they blame the staff for the upper management issues, terrible product"
bad,"Maybe it was just my location, but every shift made me want to jump off a building because of how stressful and understaffed we were. 10/10 do NOT recommend working for this company if you can help it."
bad,"a typical day at work consisted of setting up the pastry display as well as making sure that all milks, condiments and untensils were stocked. I worked alone which meant i took and served all orders in a timely manner.The most enjoyable part of it all was seeing the satisfaction on customers face once they recieved their orders."
bad,"Starbucks managers are not nice and they belittle you and break your soul. I worked there for a very long time and in my last days there I was 8 weeks pregnant and had the flu only for my boss to put me on bar while I was coughing and sneezing and on my break he told me everyone hated me. I never went back,"
bad,"Because disrespect and harassment are allowed in this work environment by partners and customers I do not recommend working here. You have to have pretty thick skin for all the politics, rudeness and elitism of partners and customers. District, and above, managers are not coached to be encouraging or compensating. Dishonesty and lack of integrity are in upper management are status quo."
bad,"Aramark is a bad work place  , there is no team work in this company, basically if you do not know people you will not move up in the company, I’ve been here for 4 years and they have talked about moving me up but there’s no action to go with it"
bad,"El trabajo no es equitativo, no hay una cultura laboral continua y es constante el mal ambiente laboral. La marca solía ser buena, pero en estos últimos años ya no hay interés por hacer sentir bien a los colaboradores. No hay empatía en caso de los miembros gerenciales con los demás integrantes."
bad,Management is terrible. They don't care about you and will insist you work overtime unpaid. Don't get trapped here. People were treated very poorly at my store and management did nothing about it and corporate didn't care. Don't believe people here.
bad,Was hired for full time at first did get good hours. When I was able to receive benefits my manager told me she had to cut hours per corp. Lost my benefits a few months later. Don't recommend this job.
bad,management is horrible. she doesn't know what she is doing. I would come in to work on the order days and have to put it away myself. there is no communication between manager and barista
bad,"it was awful, i hated every second of it. the management was terrible, everyone was always unhappy and our store failed to meet literally every requirement."
bad,"Starbucks was extremely stressful and did nothing for their employees. Required a lot from part-timers and did not listen to request for days off, would work you as much as possible. Tried to avoid giving their employees break,"
bad,The busyness helped with time but the people were bad. Everyone started stuff and made up rumors and tried to get people fired and when told to management they listened
bad,Working at Starbucks was like being in high school again. The popular baristas with the manager were favored and always got whatever time they needed off. Managers and supervisors always had favorites and if you were not one it was known and shown.
bad,"It's a food retail job, what do you want me to say? frenetic, terrible hours, minimum wage, treated like a slave, no benefit to speak of, and the workplace is horrible."
bad,Worst job I’ve ever had. Unprofessional. The environment was not where I felt comeftable. Felt like there was a lot of discrimination going on within the store.
bad,"My location was very racist to their employees, very poor management you rarely get days off they over work the employees and worry about the wrong things"
bad,"Manager is inconsistent and buckles under pressure, takes frustration out on employees. This establishment has the highest turnover rate I've ever seen and is an unsafe work environment due to the drug use of employees and homeless people in the area."
bad,"Starbucks is the most unappreciative company I have ever worked for. I never recieved any thanks or congradulations on my success or accomplishments. They focus so heavily on ""team building"" that there is no recognition for those that work harder than others. Everyone gets the same recognition regardless of how hard you work. Employees that carry the weight of other employees are not compensated or rewarded. As a manager I comped on all quarters since being promoted. I received manager of the year. Never was I thanked for any of this. I also feel that many of their policies are driven by liberal politics. I feel as though because my beliefs were more conservative and I had religious beliefs this caused me to be the odd man out, and I was treated poorly for this. Overall it is a bias company, who treats employees, especially management unfairly and is quick at the trigger to file unfounded claims."
bad,"Working at Starbucks was a total waste of time. Managers were awful, there was little to no schedule flexibility, the pay is hilariously terrible, and most co-workers and shift supervisors were angry and unprofessional. If you have an enemy or someone you really dislike, try to get them a job here. Otherwise, don’t waste your time."
bad,I hated this job and the management that came with it.This was the worst job I ever had and my manager worked us to the bone. He did not appreciate us for the work we did and only cared about his career and the money that he made.
bad,"Two summers ago, I was hired on as a shift supervisor. I was promised they’d work with my school schedule, as I am a full time student at LSU and was taking two summer classes, and that it would be very flexible. It was not. My grades were even affected. Then I got seriously ill. So I’ll that I was rushed to the emergency room and had to have emergency surgery. As I was updating the store manager, she only told me that I needed to get my shift covered for that day. I called every single starbucks in Baton Rouge and explained the situation, but apparently every single shift supervisor was working. I believe there were only 2 that were off on that Sunday, and they did not answer their phone. Then she complained that it was her 7th day in the store and how it wasn’t fair as I was in a hospital bed with not one, but two IV drips in my arms. I soon learned that I had a cyst on my ovary and it had burst 3 or 4 days prior, and I had tried to call into work the day or so before, but I was told I would be fired if I didn’t come in. So for 3 days I worked 8-10 hour shifts while internally bleeding because I couldn’t go to the ER. Finally, when I passed out in my kitchen from blood loss I knew I had to go. I had to have an exploratory laporotomy to remove the cyst and had to have two blood transfusions. I had lost so much blood I passed out every time I stood up. I couldn’t even hold myself up long enough for a chest X Ray. I explained all of this to the manager and her only response was “what about your schedule these next weeks?” I knew then and there that was the last straw. Starbucks"
bad,"They are a good company if you do whatever they want"
bad,"Starbucks is like a glorified middle school. There is so much backbiting, arguing, gossiping, and ridiculousness, it's amazing anyone ever gets a coffee. The company environment is garbage, and it is virtually impossible to get promoted unless someone high up just likes you as a person."
bad,the absolute worst. 2nd worst company i have ever worked for. i plan to never work here again. i suggest you don't either. don't even think about it. it's the worst.
bad,"They used to care about their partners, but not anymore. Its all about being faster rather then connecting with customers or even getting the chance for a breath. No labor to compensate for business, terrible management that gets away with whatever they want, and district managers who do nothing to help like they claim. Starbucks will continue to struggle with turnover until they start treating their partners properly instead of lining their pockets with our sweat, blood, and tears."
bad,Bad pay and terrible manager that came in everyday drink ir hung over. There was a lot of drama at work and not everyone being to work together. Never worked anywhere where co workers cried everyday before
bad,"i don't care to write this review. it was a mediocre, poorly run establishment. Luckily, I was only using this as a part-time gig getting through college, and full-time shortly after graduating. No benefits, no communications, poor teamwork, threw out food at the end of every night, god awful place to work."
bad,"Starbucks is the worst company I've worked for. Awful pay and they work you like animals. People are incompetent and not trained correctly to begin with so work shifts are constantly telling people how to do their job. Management drags you around for promotions and advancements, they throw meaningless titles at you to keep you where you are at. Labor is always too low to have people work, so no hours and shifts are beyond stressful. Paid horrible for such a big company."
bad,"I believe that upper management at Starbucks consists of sociopaths who gravitate toward each other and subsequently poison the work for a lot of us. I've watched district and regional management take advantage of their freedoms and personal power within the organization with no repercussions.lThis is what happens when the culture of a company gets watered down by people who care about their own self interests and not of the employees on the ground in the cafes, who are the true backbone of their business."
bad,come open the store make sure everything was ready for the customers making sure that the food was ready.didn't learn much due to the fact the management was too busy catering to the young kids.the hardest part of working there was trying to get everyone to be more aware of the customers and making sure that they were happy while they waited.the best part of my job was the customers that is always the best for me because I love knowing about them and their lives
bad,"It definitely has a team mentality work flow, which is great, until someone slows down or messes up on something (which happens, no big deal) but it does get tiresome since, from my experience, only a few people carry the responsibilities of the whole crew. People come and go, and the people who were there for long periods i.e. 2 years or more, are very bitter and passive to customers or crew. I did enjoy most of my time there, but it is over shadowed by a toxic environment. It is like any other fast-food joint."
bad,"I worked here whilst I was a student, it paid the bills and and gave me a steady income for buying textbooks and the such. Pay was low for the work, as cleaning toilets was involved not just making coffee. Could improved toilet cleaning hygiene as the blue roll used to wipe surfaces was usually put on the bathroom floor whilst we cleaned them."
bad,"You'll never make enough to live comfortably in California, obviously. And you always have to do 3 things at once so get better at multi-tasking. All of my co-workers were lazy so I had to work harder, plus there are way too many customers at once to keep up with."
bad,This place is awful to work for people are mean managers are not understanding there is no grown opportunity and the work conditions are horrendous not to mention to fact that the pay is abysmal and the hours are not flexible.
bad,"Every employee i worked with was almost always gossiping and talking about why they wanted to leave and never wanted to have a career with the company and most did not even value having a job and so most underperformed while still getting a paycheck, there were favorites of the managers and they never really wanted to develop anyone with means or needs of going into management."
bad,Was fired due to my type one Diabetes. I got extremely sick and my manager said type one diabetes isn't an onset illness and it's not grounds for calling out. if you don't show up for work we will consider letting you go. My doctor told me not to work and gave me a note because i was extremely sick. Management treats employees like slaves.
bad,"Didnt enjoy it at all. I worked at an ingles starbucks. They pay more than a stand alone, but you gotta do more and put up with more bull. Dont do it to yourself.... trust me you're worth WAY more than they're willing to offer."
bad,"Clarksville Starbucks are ran by horrible management, GM's, and regional management. Girls are mean that work here and your hours will be cut if you don't suck up to your manager. Customers are demanding and rude. Stock options are only realistic if you stay for years because your stock has to vest before you can pull it out and if you leave before it vests, you surrender it to the company. Also the college program is only at some online school in Arizona, they only reimburse you for tuition if you work certain amounts of hours and if you don't then you're screwed so it all relies on your manager to schedule you and not send you home, same for health insurance."
bad,"Extreme lack of knowledge for food safety in the Southeast region. Harassing managers and extremely disrespectful managerial methods. West coast locations are where you want to be, hands down. They uphold company standards."
bad,It was not a good working environment at all. I hated having to clock in and I am more than glad that I no longer work for this company any more. I wont ever come back.
bad,Management was the worst I have worked with at another job and no team work among employees. Horrible work place don't recommend this location to work.
bad,The manager is a joke. She played favorites and didn't know her job at all. She made me clock out for lunch but keep working because she didn't know how to schedule it right.
bad,"conclusión: nada agradable la experiencia, mucha desigualdad"
bad,"I worked at starbucks for a couple of years. Made minimum wage. then they took half my pay to cover the ""amazing"" benefits for my healthcare. I was LITERALLY paid in free coffee. The environment was hostile. The manager had a mission to make all our lives miserable. Customers also treated us like garbage."
bad,"If you don't mind getting treated like you are a coffee machine then work here, if u want to be a real person don't. The managers don't really care about you they just put on a mask and pretend like ""we are partners"" at first I thought it was just my first manager but now I realize its just the type of person they hire into the role."
bad,"Starbucks is a great flexible company that gives you great benefits but the management sucks. Store Manager goes on vacation every other week, which leaves the store in a rut. The people he choose to hire are all fresh out of high school which means that it's more than likely their first job, which is nothing wrong with that, but they either call in late or don't even bother showing up at all, which leaves us under staff. Management does nothing about it but give them more hours that they don't show for, and now you're stuck trying to do your job and theirs."
bad,"very cutthroat and competitive. Other co workers or partners who have been there longer than I, are so upset with the lack of promotion and support from management and higher up superiors, they create a very uncomfortable and stressful work environment and community. We put customers before anything, including ourselves in the most exhausting and ill- prioritized way."
bad,"Rude, petty co-workers"
bad,"The DM lied about transferring me. The first general manager I had would lie to us constantly, schedule us lut of pur set availability, and never reprimand people who needed it. DO NOT WORK FOR STARBUCKS!! This is not a store or location specific issue, there are many horror stories out there for other locations."
bad,I hated it. You are a slave. They don’t care about you because you are just a number. It is definitely a hive mind mentality that few ever comprehend. Save yourself the hassle.
bad,"i usually work the morning shifts and it tends to get quite busy, the customers are really nice and funny once you get to know them and their drinks.."
bad,I joined Starbucks in hopes to connect with people and realized that the company was not about genuine connections at all. The company tries to push the belief that the number one priority is the customers experience but the real priority is sales.
bad,This job was the worst job ever didn't have enough people left me alone when I was a newbie didn't know how to do drinks yet when I got there my manager was quitting
bad,From my experience management is not the best at all.  Coworkers were really nice but because the management were consistently under high stress & didn’t know how to manage their stress in a work environment- it really made it an unfavorable unhealthy work environment.
bad,"One of my least favorite jobs. Monotonous, bad bosses with poor communication. The management expectations are outrageous but they don’t give you the hours you need to cover set ups. Unreasonable amount of travel, no time for breaks"
bad,"At Starbucks, you are an ""At-Will"" employee (like most jobs), and you can be fired for any reason they see fit. They will overwork you and then throw you away before your benefits begin."
bad,I wouldn't work there unless you want to cry every day of your life. I hope management has gotten better or else be prepared to be walked over by customer service.
bad,"Along with little to no advancement opportunities, their pay is not competitive & raises are not based on your work ethic. It’s the same for every partner across the board. Partners with 10+ years of experience make  $11/hr in the area I’m located in. Although they offer benefits, our pay is so low it’s hard to afford them."
bad,"I worked at a Drive-Thru location in Hayward, CA which was very understaffed and managed by someone who was not cut out for the job at all, she would literally cry in the back room when things got out of control at the store. Many times I got stuck at the drive thru area by myself which meant I had to take orders, prepare drinks and charge customers/hand-out drinks, it was a complete disaster! When I asked to transfer to a café only store the district manager said that transfers from the store I was working at were not being approved at the moment, so I ended up quitting after working there for six months. The pay was really low and I felt like the company did not appreciate their employees. They were not worth my time an energy."
bad,Will promise hours and then cut them and managers are never any good benefits are never actually given just promised I have never been so disappointed with a job
bad,Expected to work long hours with maximum output. Pay grade is very unsatisfactory. Should treat all staff on ground level with more respect and expect more if treated properly.
bad,"Fun workplace but the manger sucks! Customers are great just like family & it’s always an upbeat environment , there just really isn’t understanding or communication within the company"
bad,"coworkers get you through it. Customer service skills develop at a rate which does not compensate for making you hate the customer service industry. would recommend to a high school student, other than that, it can be demanding of your time and energy to do anything else."
bad,There are a thousand better coffee shops out there where employees aren't treated as being replaceable. I've never worked at a job where I felt as unimportant as Starbucks made me feel. They constantly made fun of a mentally challenged regular and one one memorable occasion spat in another customer's drink.
bad,The job can be flexible for hours but can be difficult for dealing with the general public. You must be fast in a highly stressful environment and be able to have excellent customer service.
bad,Starbucks is the worst place to work ever they don’t promote in house they rather hire in managers instead of promoting partners that deserve to be promoted
bad,"I quit due to the disgusting amount of racism within the company.  This was PRIOR to the events in Philidelphia, and continued after it.  Management cut hours and benefits for people of color.  Transgender employees who suggested trans-specific trainings were co-opted by cisgender employees who wanted promotions, we were not allowed to donate unused food to local homeless folks, management changed our paychecks so we couldn't get overtime pay, and then when this was discovered, we were told to audit ourselves, and a lot more."
bad,I worked with Starbucks for over five years and was always a diligent and respectful worker. I was quickly promoted to the shift position due to my work ethic. Little did I know the Shifts at Starbucks are minimally paid and expected to do many of the managerial tasks while managers make a descent salary and receive bonuses for goals achieved primarily by the Shift Supervisors. I did not feel appreciated or valued.
bad,"It wasn't my favorite job. It wasn't challenging and there was no room for growth. Management at Starbucks was fine. I'd work for them again, just not the place they were located in. Management in the main location didn't know what they were doing and constantly harassed the employees."
bad,Wasnt a good job. the pay was to low. overall stabucks was an okay job. the manager was very mean to us. she never wanted us to input our thoughts or questions
bad,"They don't treat partners equally, they treat people based on favorites and treat everyone else like dirt. I do not recommend working there. The only reason that you should work there is if it is not on a college campus"
bad,"It was completely horrible, with a horrible manager who only cares about himself and only gave himself 40 hours a week on a full time pay period. The people only care about themselves. Especially James."
bad,Starbucks was one of the worst places I have ever worked. It is like a high school as there is too much drama and the customers are rarely treated with respect.
bad,"I worked at a starbucks located in the Airport in Northern Ireland and they terminated my employment at Christmas without notice , says it all really. They would also phone me at 5 in the morning to ask if I could do overtime on my days off."
bad,"Once you get past the Shift Supervisor role, the job becomes unrealistic (time allowed to perform managerial tasks vs expectations of the results). Starbucks is a great college gig, but don't buy the lie beyond that."
bad,"Everyday never starts the same, I can come in and do my assessment, or I can run right onto the floor and help with customers."
bad,Manager never cared about partners. Offered me 12-8am when i said i was tired of 8pm-4am. Took advantage of me and pay was garbage Store went through 3 managers in 3 years and all were only there to make themselves look better to the upper management and not to actually helping the dumpster pile of a store. .
bad,"You only get part time hours and NEVER overtime. Your regular hours can and are cut in the middle of a shift with no notice. If you are a hardworker you will constantly be picking up the slack for your lazy coworkers. Management had no discretion and would tell a coworker everything you said about them even if you made a complaint in ""confidence"""
bad,"Wouldnt Recommend Unless You NEED a job & NEED Money. Horrible Place To Work. Customers Are Probably The Best Part But Everything Else Sucks. Coworkers Play the blame game when its a problem. Instead Of lifting one another up and working as a team, they make it their objective to bring One another down. And the pay isn’t anywhere near worth the things you will deal with working there. Stay Away. Horrible."
bad,"it was way to hard to get hours, you'll probably need a second job, hard to get promoted, rude employees, unfair company policies, favoritism, rude managers"
bad,Mala administración sobre todo la administración de Hiromi del ano mala coordinación super mal trato exigen mucho por tan poco sueldo hay personas que trabajan para poder pagar sus universidades o mantener una familia y con el sueldo y trato que trae starbucks a sus trabajadores es una burla.
bad,I didn't like working at starbucks because the manager was rude and I couldn't get my nails done . I hated the people there and they were not friendly or nce
bad,people will push you dont (literally) so get on top and its disgusting. Cleaning tasks are never completed correctly if even at all. The management in very very infair as well.
bad,The manager was not well suited to be a manager he lacked how to guide and teach new baristas. Everything I learned was from taking the initiative to read recipe cards on my own or asking other fellow employees for assistance.
bad,management was awfully rude and egotistic. Manager did not want employees to succeed outside of his control. I would never work there again because of this.
bad,When i started 12 years ago the job was about serving others about being the 3rd place and a welcoming atmosphere. The company has changed to only caring about the money.
bad,"I never felt welcome or listened to, and there was no life work balance. Not a good place of employment for those with severe mental health issues, the stress and anxiety and depression caused by going to work was enough to impact my personal life negatively."
bad,the hours of work were unfair up early then the next day work late workload was out of control district managers are unreasonable never enough training
bad,the manager of the store was always on a power trip and would choose to ignore your messages and picked favorites highly would not recomend working at a starbucks.
bad,"I used to own a coffee shop. I made all the drinks, did the ordering, retail,accounting, payroll but for some reason that does not qualify a person to run a Starbucks. Go figure. I guess 6 years is not enough experience."
bad,"This is the most thankless job I have ever had. In addition, it inspires a culture of segregation and bullying due to the cliquey nature of employees."
bad,Starbucks puts their guest at the highest level but forgets about their employees. I was one of the lucky baristas that actually got moved to shift manager within two months of working for this company. My view on this company has changed drastically since working there. I am glad that I am no longer employed. They do not treat their employees the way they should be treated. The baristas do not make enough and the list continues from there.
bad,"It wasn’t a good job. The people there were really harsh on new people. And they didn’t like training. They used the new people to do all the dirty work, dishes, trash, etc. it took months before I learned how to actually be a barista."
bad,"Manager was discreet in her prejudice and unprofessionalism. Never felt cared for or genuinely supported, despite the 10 months being there I was never given a performance review even though other co-workers had."
bad,"Supervisors here tend to bully one particular member of staff every shift, if you were the unlucky one you would do most of the cleaning and serving jobs, most of the time getting stressed as the others stand around and talk when not making the odd coffee order, but I would always get the blame when the customers got angry as they saw one girl struggle to get the majority of their order meaning it took time. How the supervisors got to that position with the bullying personalities I have no idea."
bad,"Do not look for work with this company. They will chew you up and spit you out without a moments thought. "
bad,"I would never work for this company again, they treat there staff as if they’re nothing, and the compensation for the job is little to nothing, the management is backwards, and they supervisors are always sitting on their phones, it’s a terrible place to be as both a customer and a partner."
bad,"The company asks too much of the shift supervisors. Realistically most do not preform the job well simply because they are not given enough time or people on the floor to fully complete tasks and reach number goals. Uses ""family"" like workplace to guilt partners into doing more than they should be without reasonable pay. If in a med-high volume store it is fast paced work and time will go by quickly; if a cafe only location the environment is more laid back but staffing still suffers to meet labor goals."
bad,Horrible. Ex Military manager ran our crew more like we were in combat rather than serving coffee. Would  constantly belittle and demean new employees who may not have picked up on all the aspects required job detail.
bad,I do not recommend working for Starbucks. More often than not I did not have good management. Customers also create a lot of stress. Although I did love making beverages.
bad,"After almost a year of full-time work, NEVER calling in, NEVER being late...I barely received any kind of raise and somehow my 2 weeks of paid vacation magically disappeared."
bad,"As someone who worked for Starbucks in multiple states and for almost 10 years, I have to say it's one of the worst job experiences I'd ever had. To go into every detail would be exhausting. Starbucks is all about Starbucks, not its employees. There were multiple occasions where employees were kept at work while vomiting, miniscule raises every 6 months, injury due to unstaffing and having to work too quickly with hot temperatures, and told to treat customers more kindly when they openly said they'd come shoot up the store. This isn't even from just one location. I could go on, but I'll leave it at one of the most unhealthy job experiences I've ever had. The culture tries to speak about caring for its employees and the community, and while they will participate in donating to local events and shelters, their employees well being is put on the back burner. They're constantly forcing you to upsale as well, even if it annoys customers and further hinders your ticket sales, which, if you don't meet the cut, you can get written up for or fired."
bad,"this is the worst company ever, if you love liberal idiots this is the PLACE  for you. I would never recomend this place. although they do allow all the homeless drug addicts to hangout and stink the place up while shooting drugs in the restrooms. But yeah, they are socially just. #STARBUCKSSUCKS"
bad,Took me from another job with hopes of better benefits and let go of me shortly after. They do not take care of older workers. They do not respect workers that fall below their maintained level of education.
bad,the manager i had while working there is now fired but he was the main issue with the store. the benefits are stock options and you cant make your own schedule but customers can be very mean so you need a strong manager to have the teams back in order for it to be a place you want to work at
bad,I spent a lot of time and energy away from my kids for the love of coffee but this company did not see my hard work. very sad to know you work for a company like its your own but they don't care about you the same way.
bad,Se portaron muy mal conmigo no me gustaría dar más datos
bad,"The company doesn't care about its employees, and the managers don't work enough to understand what is goin on in the store. They cut hours constantly making it almost impossible to obtain benefits, unless you've already worked there for multiple years."
bad,I was treated poorly by management. The higher ups don't do any work. They walk all over everyone. It's a game of choosing favorites for them. They don't commemorate people doing a good job. They don't care if you work really hard. They also won't promote you because they already have the favorites game played out and promote their best friends first. It's a clique.
bad,I did not enjoy working here. It was a very weird place to work. I felt bad working here. I didnt feel the desire to work here. I thought that i could do so much more in life then sell this drug called coffee
bad,"Horrible work environment.poorly managed, favoritism, no leeway if have an emergency. no structure, too many penalties. you seem locked into something that pays crummy and barely any room for advancement."
bad,"Very bad. very short breaks. Made  me change body piercings. Not enough pay, not living wage. Little protection against thieves. Did multiple jobs at once."
bad,You are worked like a dog and most managers do not care. Tried to call out due to being sick but you MUST have your own shift covered. No one in management is respectful unless you get lucky with the exceptional few. They promote idiots and keep hard workers in low positions.
bad,"This was a terrible work experience, there were not enough employee benefits, harassment, bullying by supervisors. HR does not involve themselves when harassment has been reported."
bad,"Worked for the company for over two years. The only thing that made me stay was the connections I had with customers. Then my store got a new manager, and screwed everything up."
bad,"High turnover rate where employees don't show up to work. On top of not accepting tips and horrible pay, I was always closing. No free drinks or free meals."
bad,the Management is just awful at Starbucks in Princeton WV. It is a cutthroat childish environment. More people quit then what came in I would never work there again under the current management.
bad,I would not advise anyone to work or shop here. Only promotional raises make it hard to stay unless someone plans on working there for the rest of their life. Multiple times a week for my entire time working there I will work more than 6 hours and not get a break. I never know my schedule until the the very last day of the week which makes it hard to plan when you are open availability. You can count on seeing multiple new hires every week.
bad,not open to creativity very structured unrealistic expectations low pay not flexible schedule management not easy to work with happy when I left the company
bad,"It wasn't the best place ever to work at, the hours were long. "
bad,The environment was stressful with unrealistic expectations. Lack of compensation for labor as well as lack of protections for workers. Customers would sometimes be rude and aggressive.
bad,"I enjoy working at Starbucks, it is a great place to grow and improve and improve in your customer service skills. Very great environment and a great workplace culture"
bad,try to find a job somewhere else as the management is not very organised nor are managers all that approachable and the level of support is only consistent provided your store is in the top 5/10 stores in terms of profit for the district
bad,"This is not somewhere to make a full time job. They do not pay enough for any of the duties or irate customers that make the job unbearable. The management is worthless and everyone is out for themselves and only themselves. This is a perfect job for someone who is looking to move on in a year.  There is no teamwork and there is no ""partnership"". They pay as little as possible for nothing but getting yelled at by management and to fight with customers who are insanely rude. This job deals with ugly people who are mean. AND NEVER TRUST THE MANAGEMENT."
bad,You had to deal with entitled people who would yell at you over the most minuscule things. Sometimes they would through stuff at you and then your manager would reprimand you for poor customer service when you were in the middle of making a line of drinks. They pay you the lest amount they are legally able to so you are not able to pay the basics like rent or utilities. you have to either live at home or have at least a second job just to pay the utmost basic bills.
bad,making drinks to customers satisfaction working with people meeting new people difficult situations low pay for hard work dealing with difficult people
bad,"I worked for this company for 9 years and have many friends who have worked there for longer. The company has changed since the beginning, as most things do. The structure of the environment switched from being customer focused to money focused. The almighty ""they"" cut labor and increased job duties extremely frequently while expecting better customer service, all of these cannot be accomplished at the same time. While yes, Starbucks offers many benefits, the workplace environment is now no longer worth the grief."
bad,Its stressful customers are always making you feel low like you are nothing there was a point were one of my coworker was treated badly insulted he was sent home cause it was just to much for him ..and management not organized to many things going on .....worst experience ever to work at starbucks...
bad,la empresa no cumple con lo que ofrece.. mala administracion y el personal de RRHH no toma en cuenta al trabajador.
bad,Management needs to improve on time management because the reason i lose this job is because of receiving notice from the company on a date that i am already terminated.
bad,"The people I worked with and the attitudes they had were awful. They would mock customers and other employees. It paid low, and it also was not worth the work you had to endure."
bad,I will never work for the company again. They would rather take better care of a fake student than a single mother that needed the hours and money. I will never go back
bad,"No one knows how to run or manage the business, just thrown in and most of the staff are more interested in their mobile phones rather than to do their job or assist customers. Barely get paid enough to make it worth your while, and the coffee is vile and food standards are not a thing."
bad,"My last manager was sexist and the kind of person who put being everyones feelings and being a friend before buissness. Also customers are cut throat, rude, and forget your human too."
bad,One of the worse job experiences I ever had. Starbucks is nothing like it claims to be. It is a corporate monster. Nothing more. Nothing less. Do not work here!
bad,"No training. No compassion. I was faced with racism, was told to go back to my country even though I'm a duel citizen of the usa and canada!"
bad,To be completely honest it was not the customers at all. The thing that made this company overall a 1 star is the fact that they do not care about their staff at all. They do not hear the voice of their employees at all unless you are friends with management.
bad,that work environment is terrible and i would recommend nobody works there. the management team is terrible. they make you miserable. they over work you. they mess up the pay there.its terrible.
bad,"I would give it -10 stars if I could"
bad,Management sucks and are unethical. They currently have lawsuits pending due to workplace violations. They do have favorites and the rest they get rid of.
bad,"Poor management, frequently turned up for work only to find that the manager has locked up and gone home or not turned up at all.  Wages repeatedly incorrect and rarely amended.  Low wage with little to no change of progressing within the company.  Staff not given christmas bonuses (despite it being allocated by head office).  Rules on uniform unclear - disputes among stuff, frequently ignored."
bad,"would not work for them again"
bad,"never again will I work for a company who has no values, morals and lack of respect for anyone other than themselves"
bad,"Malos tratos por parte de los gerenciales, sueldo miserable y no pagan las vacaciones como corresponde segun la lct"
bad,I worked the night shift. I would work by myself even though there was suppose to be another person with me for half the shift. If there was someone there they would not do their job.
bad,"Pensacola, fl - has the worst district manager and leadership structure."
bad,"Wages Low "
bad,"Very poor management, high turnover rate, poor scheduling, low pay, no breaks, managers and employees would no call/no show without repercussion,  training managers were great though"
bad,Was treated poorly. Would nor recommend working with company at all. Have to be flexible. Be able to work on off days. Dressed code is in order. Be able to work in fast paced environment.
bad,It’s a terrible company to work ford had a horrrible expierence I’ll never go back to working for that horrible company rediculous can never hold a manager and district manager is a complete jerk
bad,"Starbucks as a company is great. They have many benefits and opportunities. Unfortunately the manager at this store is extremely unprofessional and rude. I was hired full time and at first it was great. Unfortunately I developed some pretty serious health issues and would have to call out every now and then. Instead of being supportive and asking how I was, I was asked ""well can you come in at all?"" or ""Well I guess I have to figure it out, this is really inconvenient"". After a while my hours began to dwindle away going from 40 to 32 down to 24. Recently there has been a large snow storm and I was snowed in and couldn't get to work safely. I was told by my manager that I should have been fine since I had an all wheel drive car and that I didn't need to call out. Then proceeds to tell me that they want to come look at my driveway because they didn't believe that its dangerous and I was calling out because I didn't want to come to work. After that I was told to either move to a better place or buy a better car. Not only does this cross soooo many lines , but all of this happened in front of customers. This is beyond unprofessional and there is no consideration for your well being. I would not recommend working at the Grass Valley Starbucks until it is under new management."
bad,"It seemed great at first. But man, did that change. Its all hype. Dont get me wrong, I have good memories, but i went through to have them wasnt worth it. In heinsight, it was a bad place to be lol."
bad,"It need more and better management hits not a company i would want to work for again, they need to understand its a learning process. They are flexible with schedules"
bad,"“Even Manhattan clam chowder, the accompaniment to grilled salmon (ordered medium rare, delivered medium well), turns out not to be actual soup, but a thin, saccharine, barely spoonable sauce of tomato and chile oil; it’s precisely the type of liquid one might expect to find scrapped off the side of a hot steel buffet.”"
bad,"Working at Starbucks was alright when I was on the clock and chatting with customers and makin drinks. However, the management of my store was horrendous"
bad,"Impossible to work for a company that has such corrupt management and doesn't enforce its own ""standards"". Definitely a hypocritical and cutthroat environment."
bad,It sucked  too much work not enough pay people are mean and demanding and the people who hang out in the lobby are all weirdos who have nothing better to do than bother the employees.
bad,Starbucks can be a hectic place to work but overall i enjoyed working there. I enjoyed being able to be creative with drinks and i adored my coworkers.
bad,The management at starbucks do not care about you. All they care about is how you close the shop. Make sure you perform all your duties correctly if not face other consequences.
bad,"Extremely poor management, literally I asked for my schedule; kicked me out of work group chat and never responded to my schedule request. Plus they owe me a check and had no reason to stop scheduling me. I had great availbility too. Rude people and rude enviroment."
bad,"My SM and DM were both awful. My SM overworked us, blamed her attitude on her stress but would roll her eyes at me when I had a problem with controlling my anxiety. The job is unrewarding. The company and the customers don’t care about you. The North Star program is a joke. I was told we were going to get one on one training and instead we got an incompetent SM and DM claiming there’s no training, it’s just a book we read. Customers are rude, ungrateful, and impatient. The job does not pay well for what they out you through."
bad,"Management sucks, they care only for the times. Everything is so fast pace you cant really connect with customers. Only good as a side job. Stressful environment."
bad,Management is disrespectful and poor. Creates a very poisonous work space and an overall hostile environment. Scared of my store manager. Feel threatened. I learned to record all conversations.
bad,el trabajo es estresante y mucha presion sobre los trabajadores aprendi mas que nada a valorar los derechos del trabajador ya que en la empresa no los valoran la gerencia no esta para sus trabajadores solo para los intereses de ellos mismos no tienen cultura laboral como a diferencia del extranjero no poder optar a ascensos despues de mucho tiempo de trabajo y mucho favoritismo lo que mas me gusto del trabajo fue el echo de conocer nueva gente nada mas.
bad,great stock good coffee and great coworkers and clean the store was large with good food and great vibes help me when I needed it still making good money
bad,"I left my previous job due to mismanagement of scholarship money, as well as a profound ineptitude in the administration. I went to Starbucks with promises of a decent salary, flexible schedules, and a caring corporate culture, and instead was met with a disappointing lack of opportunity for advancement and a schedule that swung from 5am-6pm."
bad,the management likes to save themselves. harassment of all kinds goes on and only the good workers take the blame never ever work for this company. scheduling is poor they over work the staff
bad,"23.5 degrees ltd...been working for them 4 week"
bad,"Now it is solely customer based, to the point where partners are suffering, and hating their jobs each and every single shift. They are underpaid for the amount they accomplish daily, and are constantly forced to try to reach unattainable goals for the company, while Starbucks continues to cut labor."
bad,"Working at Starbucks taught me a lot of things in customer service that I found very useful. Although i was not getting full time when I asked for it, the management is hard to talk to and most of the time you don't see them so it's a hassle to ask for what you want. You work under pressure every day and if you are good at a certain position you will be on that position all the time, which is not like me I like to learn many things and switch it up. The staff is friendly at any Starbucks most of the time, but of course, there are people who are difficult to work with at any workplace."
bad,The environment is't bad it's just the people who works make it difficult. Other then that it's not bad place to work. It really could be a positive place to work.
bad,This place sucked it got on my nerves. I always had a headache here. The management was awful. Always rude or in a bad mood of sort. Always brought the personal life into the work area.
bad,i will never work there again ever i have never enjoy it at all and to much rember and i didnt learn any thing and the management as not nice people and no good and all off it and i hated it
bad,I was sent on a wild goose chase for my interview. The company itself was very unorganised. I booked a day off for a hospital appointment but then was made to work two weekends in a row and broke the working time directive. I was made to feel very welcome to start with but then very quickly it made a U turn and it became all about the money and not the well being of their employees.
bad,"the schedule was terrible, the workers did not care, management was very unorganized and did not communicate at all. i would never ever go back........"
bad,"I was hired as a full time employee, which was suppose to be 32 plus hours a week.  When I was moved to a different store, my hours were cut to less that 30."
bad,"Standards and benefits are very low, Poor Insurance packages. Low career growth. The work environment is completely different from outside view. Degraded Salary packages."
bad,Starbucks was not the job for me. It did not pay well and it was impossible to get enough over time. I worked with a bunch of kids who had no work ethic.
bad,i hated my job. my bosses were unappreciative of the long hours of overtime that i put in. I have put in over forty hours a week and nothing. they wont even give me christmas off. i asked in a month in advance who does that.
bad,"It was a bit of time ago.It can be very stressful/ I worked inside an A & P store it was very stressful, and I was very underpaid. Who can live on $8 an hour"
bad,"The CEO is delusional and the company as a whole just keeps eating smaller companies.  The job made all kinds of promises of advancement and never followed through.  The same 10 district managers where in place for 10 years, all of the general managers just circled them, waiting for one to die so they could have their job."
bad,"This was the worst job I ever had, good principles, but at the end of the day it's a business and all that's valued is the bottom line. If you're in a bind and need a job that pays minimum wage, this is for you. If you require more from your professional life, then pass on this."
bad,"This company use to be really great to work for.  Now partners are not paid fairly even though they have seniority, management was garbage, and nothing was confidential when confronting higher management.  I highly do not recommend working for Starbucks in the Memphis and greater Memphis area.  I would go somewhere else if you wanted to work at Starbucks. The management and district management is terrible."
bad,I did not enjoy working at Starbucks. It was a high stress environment with little support from management. Many of the other employees were judgmental and negative.
bad,"great company to work for. good hours. good pay. free food.The Executive team is out of touch and does not believe in their people. They reside in an area of the building that is closed off to all other employees and rarely ever interact with staff. Over the last several years 8+ jobs have opened at the officer and executive levels and many good, qualified internal candidates have applied. Only one opening was filled internally."
bad,The worst company I have ever worked for. No accountability for the management team and will literally hire any breathing body when they are not good fits for the job. Worst job ever.
bad,"A typical day at work would include coming in setting up everything for the day, making the coffee, and teas. Once we opened we were busy because of all the work places around us. We had to work fast."
bad,"Worst place I have ever worked, poor management affects performance. I love working but absolutely hated working there!!! They pay the bare minimum, staff are so rude and management couldn’t manage a fly!"
bad,"they lack organization a ton, everyone has different ways of training and can get confusing. Very cut throat every one wants to move to the top so people will start rumors and made sure they get in to your skin to make sure you quit."
bad,typical work day is being yelled at by customers. managers sleeping or hanging out while lines wrap the building. It is impossible to keep the place clean but you get in trouble if it's messy. The company in general doesn't care about their partners.
bad,"I really can not explain the whole story, it would take me all night. I have many documents and witnesses and medical history that can back up my story. If your really that interested, feel free to call me."
bad,"The management at my location was horrible! Worked excessive hours without paovertime pay! Tried to change the environment, but to no avail! Only worried about the bottom line, not the employees"
bad,"Muy buena empresa para comenzar a laborar, sin embargo los planes de crecimiento no están muy bien establecidos"
bad,"I hated working here, the manager sucks and the company sucks. I worked here for 4 years and the first 2 years was fun but then the company became very pushy and work became very unmotivating and not a happy place to be"
bad,"management sucks"
bad,This store required us to turn down homeless people in a regular basis. And had policies that changed like you breath. I would go in not knowing what was the right way of doing things. I also felt really bad having to charge the customers a dollar to pay for water. I would have customers who found it ridiculous and were ready to fight about it. I felt as though this job was less for the customers and more for the hire ups who I worked for and I was just there stuck in the middle taking the rough end of the situation. I also didn't like how the manager had kept changing the work schedule daily or never sent it to you because she wasn't sure herself if it would change or not. I really found that unprofessional. And I would have really prefered knowing at least 2 weeks if not 1 week ahead what my working schedule was. I didn't appreciate having only a days warning. I did however enjoy seeing the regulars and being able to gain lots of working experience but I felt that it was not worth the amount of abuse you'd get from the manager and the supervisors combined. Nobody would be by your side and you basically fended for yourself.
bad,"This company is full of greed. It cares more about transactions and customer count than well being of employees. They want us to make every moment right even when customers treat us so mean. One time this lady snatched her food item from me because she was running late to work and i got in trouble for not apologizing and making the moment right? She snatched her food from me really quick, what is there for me to say sorry about? Thats just one example of the greed."
bad,"Fast-paced and stressful for a job that does not provide enough money for employees to pay their bills. Customers are often a nightmare and it is rare to find a manager that will actually stand up for their ""partners."" Good fit if you enjoy being yelled at by caffeine addicted customers and are not actually looking to make money."
bad,the beginning was sweet but by the end of five years it was sour. thanks for nothing...the only good thing about working there for so long was the stock cash out at the end. Then my last pay check was garnished to pay for the remainder of my insurance policy...
bad,"In my store, it is extremely stressful. You get no support from upper management, poor training, and very inconsistent in all things. I have been told it is a great company to work for but my experience at my store has not shown me that. You are supposed to be able to transfer locations relatively easily, but since my store was so bad they blocked all transfers for all of us no matter how hard we work."
bad,There is not help when there is a rush. expect you to hab=ndle everything on your own during rush hour times. if  there is help aviable they still wont help
bad,"Managers dont care, customers hate you, and you do the job of 3 people every day. Honestly that's it... it's terrible and not worth the frustration that youll have."
bad,I was told the job was entry level but was treated as if i was expected to perform to the same level as someone who worked as a barista for multiple years.
bad,"Management wasnt the best"
bad,Worked at a busy franchised place of Starbucks and they didn't want to pay their workers what they deserved. There was literally one person working there for at least 7 hours before the next person took on their shift. It was just horrible.
bad,"Target has poor policies regarding how it manages its Starbucks locations, leaving employees extremely overworked and understaffed. Our location, being one of the only Starbucks in the area and located in a large shopping center, was constantly busy, but despite repeated appeals to both Target and corporate Starbucks management to assign more payroll hours, we almost never had enough people present to get the job done. "
bad,No comment they do not care about their staff and just want to make coffee. Never give raises always have new items but never show gratitude towards staff.
bad,"Bad place to work for, company does care so much for the hard working people like the housekeepers, the cleaning crew nor the gift shop/ food service people."
bad,they are not worth it. poor management down here and horrible working conditions. its like the corporation forgot about the stores they have in Mississippi. always running out of product never getting the right amount of labor for the stores and they hire managers who aren't qualified its ridiculous nothing is done fairly here its done by favoritism and honestly its everywhere but i mainly have seen it in Mississippi stores down here its like you're in a different world they don't do anything to standard and corporate does nothing to help with any of the issues. so no i would never recommend someone to work at Starbucks in the state of Mississippi.
bad,It's a good company to work for. It showed me a lot and open up a lot of doors. I got to know so many people and you get to see celebrities and talk to someone that needs to have a good talk
bad,Don't work here unless you like having people drink your coffee. It's hard to watch your hard work disappear. Coffee is art. Don't let it be consumed by people that deserve it.
bad,"Terrible pay"
bad,"It's a college job at best, an overworked underpaid nightmare at worse. Do it when you have to but get out ASAP. The tips do not make up for the low pay."
bad,"Not of fan of Starbucks. They don't appreciate the best ""PARTNERS"" that they have within their company. Never will I be part of this corporation EVER AGAIN."
bad,worst place to work in your life. definitely didn't like working there got offered a new job that's why I decided to quit there. felt like you were taking advantage of.
bad,"Everyday is a struggle to continue on. I'm depressed, overworked, and disrespected in daily. This company does not care about you at all. They trick you and lie to you but in the end it's about numbers."
bad,"dit bedrijf belooft je veel dingen maar voert geen 1 van de beloften uit "
bad,"I was working at Starbucks inside of target so I would alot of the time be forced to work alone because the management of ""starbucks"" not target felt she was to high up to help me so it was a stressful job dealing with things on my own. It only made me more dependent."
bad,"needs better pay, better management, more people to work, employees are stressed out with the short hand we have. the weekly pay is fine. management could do a better job"
bad,"Poor management, I was told I would learn to make a variety of coffee for customers instead I wind up just doing dishes, cleaning, throwing lots of trash. This was a very bad environment."
bad,starbucks is good but as a company they are very wasteful. tooo much waste and not allowing employees to donate waste to a good cause. rather throw unused food away.
bad,The management was seriously horrible. Never seen such bad teamwork. The management did not help when it was needed. The environment was fast paced and not organized.
bad,"free coffee is not worth being crushed under this corporate giants foot. management is only worried about their bottom line, employees can only get part time hours because they refuse to give you the benefits of a full time position. you will not move up unless someone dies because they do not promote from within unless absolutely necessary"
bad,"I worked at a Starbucks in Oklahoma and since I left, I have NEVER returned to another one even for a coffee.  I will never work for that company ever again."
bad,"Poor management affects the workplace and partners are always working under pressure. Whilst here, I always felt pressured to solely sell the food and drinks but I was never appreciated for that. As a Supervisor, I understand that we have to make money for the company but we must also always think about our partners. Every time I am working with my manager, I am afraid to do or to say something wrong"
bad,Bad culture attracts bad types of enthusiastic people. And the management commit their life into a clearly stressful reproduction of a hospital setting. Unsettling uncomfortable barbies.
bad,They only care about their money at the end of the day. They preach partners and love for their employees but in actuality its the exact opposite. Pay doesn't match the emotional stress they put you through especially when it comes to management being held accountable or showing favoritism to other employees.
bad,they give no breaks expect too much unrealistic expectations bad morals bad environment was happy when I left felt a whole lot od stress relief would never
bad,"This job was incredibly stressful. There were too many easily solvable problems, like scheduling, management, running out of supplies etc. There is also a well known fact about Starbucks that they have bad managers, the customers are unappreciative, and rude."
bad,The management takes advantage of the people below them and there is never any organization and were always running out of things which makes it super stressful.
bad,"anyone who has any sort of ambition should not work in a retail store. The management is political, inconsistent and shouldn't really be allowed to operate the way it does in the scope of ethics and compliance."
bad,The pay sucks the hours are horrible too much work for the little pay. Perfect for a student living at home with no bills and or life. Stock options are good but you have to be there forever to benefit.
bad,"management is the worst I've seen , hours went by how much the manager liked you, begged to pay money into the till if you made a mistake. i will never work for this company again"
bad,"A typical day would be me coming in changing into my work clothes. clockinng in and jumping right on the floor whether that means brewing coffee, making drinks, on the oven or scrubbing the drains."
bad,I did not like this job from the start. I took the chance to try it out but everyone was just to rude all the time and made you feel uncomfortable and made you feel like you didn't belong.
bad,Environnement de travail trop américanisé. Pas de management participatif.
bad,"I was told I was to old to work at this company and got fired . I was discriminated because race , age , and disability.. the supervisor harass  me every time I come to work . and even after I complain I got no help . made me think its normal practices at this company .. I was force to work off the clock and got no paid . after I complaint to the partner resource I got no help nothing . until this day they owe me my hrs"
bad,This is a job that you can work and make money. You make coffee and work with other people in a customer service environment. You get free coffee during your shift.
bad,"I worked for Starbucks in my 20s and the hours were awful and stressful, they paid me minimum wage with a master's degree, they never gave me the benefits they agreed to give, and there was no work life balance because all I was doing was working for Starbucks. Not to mention customers have high expectations of Starbucks products so they are rude, yell, scream on occasion and have such high expectations you'll injure yourself trying to please their clientele. If you make mistakes, your manager will fire you. Not to mention the bosses were stressful to handle because they also yell."
bad,"Starbucks presents itself as a very progressive and compassionate company. In reality, it is just a huge PR machine. "
bad,"this job was by far one of the worst places to work. the management is horrible and i was a solo worker and basically my own manager, i stocked the supplies, created the drinks, cleaned opened and closed all by my self. had no breaks and no lunches. and they were taken from my pay."
bad,Starbucks is the epitome of an evil corporation.  They treat their employees like garbage from the highest levels and this trickles down into every aspect of their business.
bad,"Não temos tempo pra ficar parado é correiria."
bad,"Made drinks and food, cleaned work space. Hardest part of the job was getting there early and leaving late. My co-workers were always a blast to work with."
bad,"customer service and exceed expectations, it was fun and great and the people were a little nice. a lot of homeless people peed on the windows."
bad,didnt like working at starbucks at all. I worked in multiple locations and they all were terrible. The management doesnt know how to run a business and its all high school drama.
bad,"they treated seasonal workers bad they was unfair. Overall, some people were nice. Management was horrible, co-workers were sweet and fun."
bad,"Starbucks...I worked there for 4 years. Bad pay. Bad benefits. Toxic stress. Do what you want, but don't expect to be happy for a while if you choose to work here."
bad,Too much work for little pay. The rude customers were not worth the amount of money you got paid . There really wasn't a management.
bad,"The environment is very stressful, the managers are not very kind or understanding and the overall pay is not well. Starbucks as a company is great but being inside safeway made it hard."
bad,"A typical place at starbucks are busy,  what ive learned working at starbucks you learn alot of patience with working in  customer serivce. my co-workers are a joy to be around. The most enjoyable part of my job are the people."
bad,"They care very little about their ""partners"" There is a company wide ""everyone is replaceable"" mentality that makes for an extremely uncomfortable environment."
bad,very fast paced and very stressful to work when your manager doesn't want to help or put in any effort then yell at everyone when things get crazy.
bad,"Best place to start a career and for student. ,Love the different customers and culure experince  every partner always had I can help you attitiudde"
bad,Starbucks is a good company to work for if you're in high school or looking for a part time job while you're in college. Do not expect to make a career out of this. This job does not pay well at all. Please do better.
bad,"There's this culture surrounding working in Starbucks that it's a 'great' and 'fun' place when actually it feels more like a prison sentence. I don't know whether it was the particular store I worked at or the fact that Starbucks is bit by bit selling off it's stores to franchises which are damaging the Starbucks brand from the inside out."
bad,"The Beckenham and Orpington branches are both franchises however the management at Beckenham doesn't seem to know what their doing. they always seem to be running out of stock, the café is always a mess and a lot of the customers walk at on a daily basis, the basic standards aren't followed and the rules change as time goes on."
bad,"Overworked, underpaid in an always short staffed work environment. Too much pressure for the pay. Cuts to labor budgets in the last few years have made this work environment too chaotic and the job  goals impossible to complete."
bad,"This was the worst job I ever had. The employees were snippy and backstabbing and did nothing but complain. The manager was not interested in anything but her girlfriend. I was shoved, swore at, and in all manner suffered abuse from the other employees.  The work was tedious, repetitive, boring, and dirty."
bad,It would be a great place if the Barista's didn't fear being retaliated against.   New Barista's were trained poorly and made to feel incompetent.  They need new management.
bad,"Constant stress when on the floor, favoritism is evident. In the beginning it was the ideal job but it is time for a new change in work venue."
bad,"Starbucks uses a large amount of benefits to cover up their insufficient pay wages and treatment to employees."
bad,Very bad management communication. The store manager was a very good team leader .Very annoying costumers. Trying to be nice and like reward you get nothing.
bad,"Leaving was the best thing that I did for my sanity! They hardly ever worked around my school schedule, it was almost impossible to get time off on weekends, management was un-organized, customers were very rude, I could list all day."
bad,worked here for wayyyyyy to  long for a $10.65. worked here since 2007 and left in 2013... its not worth it people...apply at another employer
bad,"PROCESSING orders"
bad,"i learned about teamwork ,good customer service,and the most enjoyable part of the job when we got good results in a visiters and make to much fun"
bad,I'm glad to have had the almost nine years with the company. I have nothing but praise for Starbucks. I learned a lot and I am going to miss the many connections with the customers that I had daily.
bad,I  would never consider working there again. Starbucks as a company is full of it. They try to make it seem like they care about their partners but in reality they only care about the money .
bad,good for student: I did it when I first mover to the city. it was a start for me. learn a lot about people and how to handle different personality.
bad,Starbucks is a bad company to work for. They don't take care of their staff and management never places their staff first. I would stingily not work for this company.
bad,"good learning experience"
bad,Das Unternehmen hat zu wenig rücksicht an MitarbeiterInnen mit Familie. Die Sprache im Laden ist rau und die Arbeitskultur ist ganz stark nach Sympathie und Antipathie geprägt.
bad,A typical day at Starbucks in Target is extremely always busy. It is important to work as a team when working at Starbucks. Talking with guests and serving exceptionally great coffee is what Starbucks is known for. The hardest part of the job is working alone. It is difficult to make drinks and ring up guests in a timely manner.
bad,"This was a horrible company to work for due to the management. It was a great learning experience, but I am glad I do not work there anymore."
bad,"Great after school job, fast pace lovely work environment."
bad,"This was my very first coffee job, very fast past and the management is very particular on how they  make their coffee. They kind of expect you to know right away how to do everything so that was slightly frustrating."
bad,I enjoyed working at Starbucks. The schedules were always very flexible. My managers and co-workers were easy to work with.
bad,learned a lot but could of been a better experience. learned how to be a good manager and learned how to hire employees. enjoyed making drinks but didn't like dealing with snooty customers
bad,"Steam Pressurizer"
bad,"I went into Starbuck's thinking it would be a very cool place to work for. It kind of had that reputation. I was wrong. My store went through at least 3 managers in the two years I was there. The last one I worked for was horrible, and so was the District Manager. I was sent home one day because my shirt wasn't tucked in. So, I lost a whole day because she didn't want to tell me my shirt was untucked. I didn't even realize it was. I thought that was completely ridiculous. The actual job itself wasn't that bad. I liked the fast paced environment. I just wish I had a better manager."
bad,"I hated it, short hours, no healthcare before 6 months, it sucks."
bad,"This is a very corporate company that does selectively choose who can and cannot break rules and bend policies. The middle and upper level management is often very well compensated financially. Corruption plagues this level of management and does not take into consideration the benefit of the lower level employment. Upper level management is often involved in personal scandals that boil over into the work environment such as personal relationships, marriages and sex affairs. This directly impacts’ Baristas, Shift supervisors, and how district managers handle affairs from store to store. When things become so unmanageable that an employee would need to seek assistance from corporate, this individual must remain anonymous for fear of losing their employment and is often ostracized if not terminated for truthfully speaking up. This did happen. There is also a common trend in Starbucks stores relating to substance abuse. Many times these employees are catered to above and beyond and little consideration and reward is given to those that show up for work on time, complete tasks, and follow policies. From the outside looking in many people are deceitfully leading that this company is a people company, who offers great treatment for their employees but upon closer inspection this is not the case at all. That 5$ plus$ cup of coffee translates to a very low hourly paid employee. Get to your your Baristas and they almost always will inevitably expose the real world of Starbucks coffee. ""Scoops for troops"" is often misleading as well with the coffee 1lbs donated for overseas soldiers never"
bad,Starbucks does not care about their employees terrible wages and managers that lie and get away with it i do not buy their coffee any more after working their myself and seeing first hand what a piece of work. They are another Pizza Hut company only care about their CEOS pockets thieves is what they are
bad,"McDonalds is just....terrible. They will screw you over so quick its unreal. You could do the greatest job, and they'll look over you for a druggie. I wouldn't wish this job on my worst enemy"
bad,No longer work at starbucks because it wasnt what I wanted for a career
bad,There isn't a lot more to say about this place other than that they managed themselves poorly and now they are gone.
bad,"Horrible leaders , not it the same page every store runs differently !"
bad,"A collective of Racist and inexperienced and illiterate Regional and Market managers to slave others based on their values not on the company guide, policies nor vision."
bad,It is very hard work for £6-19 per hour.We dont get any praise for our hard work as there is only 2 of us and is very busy from 7am til 3pm .Only from our customers.
bad,"i learned special diets of the resident, other than that i dish washed and cleaned and closed the kitchen."
bad,"This job was not the best job, the customer were rude, the management was VERY unfair and rude."
bad,"Enjoyed the time here at Mc donalds, wasnt really a job for me just did it because i needed the money. the managers were really mean and unprofessional."
bad,"Oversee other Baristas with preparation of preparing beverages."
bad,"Misguided workers, on site staffing often never there, late or simply forgets."
bad,"As you may know Starbucks is very popular all over the world, so the environment was very busy on a typical day and even slow day. I learned how to operate a barista machine, the rules and regulations of a food service environment. The hardest thing about working there was taking in every single last drink in a certain amount of time and memorizing them. The management was very poorly she wasn't a team player or being there for her co-workers."
bad,It was a hard work place due to lack of communication between managers from safeway to starbucks.
bad,"I would never recommend working there to anyone. The entire company is a mess. Employees are constantly undervalued and unappreciated, the pay is laughable, the benefits are terrible and the hours are terrible. You will bust your butt for them and in return they will take advantage of you until you break and then toss you aside."
bad,A good company to advance in promotion great people. A fast pace enviroment.
bad,Die Arbeit im Team und mit den Kunden macht enorm viel Spass. Mulitasking.Prioritäten setzen. Kühlen Kopf in stressigen Situationen behalten. Mitarbeiter ausbilden.
bad,I like the fast pace and meeting new people and all making drinks and making people smile but i wasnt going anywhere they wouldnt let me grow with the company i was stuck being a barista.
bad,"You can not grow with this company, management do not communicate good."
bad,"I enjoyed the pace, however management was very disorganized and hours were cut frequently"
bad,"Starbucks had horrible management, wasn't helpful with my schedule, and I overall felt uncomfortable. The co-workers are not willing to help you learn, and get frustrated easily. The one year raises are also pitiful, not even $0.25. I could go on and on about how horrible this experience was."
bad,Manager doesn't care about work ethics and will fire you for the simplest things and unfortunately this company works best in who you know not what you actually know
bad,"when i was in california, i had a great time. in the new mexico market, we are over worked and underpaid and it’s ridiculous. upper management has no clue what’s going on and hardly talks to baristas in stores."
bad,"If you want to work ridiculous hours, spoken to like rubbish and never have a break, then go to eurogarages. 12hr shifts with no time to eat or drink. Rude managers with no help given."
bad,"If you like being overworked for extremely low pay that doesn't match the amount of stress, labor, and pricing of the products you sell, then this is the place for you. Your advancement is based entirely on favoritism. The entire district I worked for has issues with almost every store manager when it came to retaliation, ethics, not following corporate rules, not caring about employees. You're going to be paid a little over $9.50 an hour to work for a company who made over $30 billion in profits in 2018. Shift managers are often threatened with being fired over drive thru times, even if the issue has nothing to do with staff. Personally, I was written up for all of my medically excused absences, denied my CUP Fund Assistance from when my mother passed away, I was forced on medical leave in order to keep my job, Starbucks refused to pay me my company-guaranteed missing wages from while I was on leave (even after I submitted 6 sets of paperwork and medical records), and my return from medical leave was delayed for 7 months. On top of this, once I returned from medical leave, my trainer quit while in the middle of my first shift back - then my entire schedule was cancelled when the store manager and district manager couldn't find someone to train me, even though I was already trained. Corporate hasn't been able to help me on any of these issues whatsoever."
bad,"Working for a licensed store there was no partner food mark out nor beverage, there was a percentage discount which did not equal much because the owners increase there price on the highest side of the scale they could for there frozen food that never was delivered fresh. The owners did a lot of contradicting actions to accommodate the hotel it was in, the Starbucks reps that would come by to check in. Best today glad to have left there."
bad,"Exhausting, terrible, always scheduled outside of my availability even when I have spoken to my manager about it dozens of times, horrible working conditions, meanwhile we are all forced to appear Happy and nobody does anything to fix the situation when we have voiced our opinions even to the district manager."
bad,This company does not value their employees. Their decisions over the years have all been to keep the compensation rate low and to benefit the bottom line.
bad,"Extremely busy, depressing atmosphere. Your own colleagues work against you."
bad,"Conditions were horrible to work under. Trust me when I say the grossest and most uncomfortable place to work at. There were flies everywhere, nothing got cleaned right, and the worst of all was the working conditions for the employees. They never scheduled enough people during night shifts, making them work really hard to deal with customers and try to clean up, and it was boiling hot during the summer in the stand. Management was also much too demanding and bias as well. Do not recommend working here."
bad,"Starbuck ne jamais y aller , malheureusement tout les starbuck confondent vie privée et vie professionnelle, car la structure starbuck est une secte, je vous déconseille"
bad,"Managers are never off the clock. Expect to work 60+ hours a week... forever. And don't expect any raises, appreciation, or promotions. Profits are all that matters. Don't fall for their lies that they care about their employees. They don't."
bad,"Worked for this company for almost 6 years! Through the whole time of being a manager I was never fully trained never assisted in help with training, area manager and other stores in area so far away impossible for any help, they raised my hours worked but didn’t bother raising salary with that, working in a store that was struggling and in bare minimum wage was awful! And there method of disciplinaries was not correct at all, no investigation keeping staff in the loop, always short staffed! But conviently over staffed while sussuspension was taking place! Don’t recommend"
bad,"Başlarda bir heves ile başlayıp sonradan şirketin asla dışarıdan göründüğü gibi olmadığını anlayacaksınız..Kurumsallık iyidir ama bu adamlar fazlasıyla uçmuş durumda işe yeni başlayan baristaların pantalon ceplerinin dikili olma zorunluluğundan tutunda(resmen hırsız muamelesi çekiyorlar) Müşteri sizi öldürse abartmıyorum öldürse dahi müşteriyi haklı çıkartacak bir sistemi mevcut..Verdiği maaş ise ayrı bir dert..Şirketin sizden istediği performans Ferrari verdiği maaş Murat 131 resmen. 3 yıl çalıştığım süre zarfında gerek iş arkadaşlarım olsun gerekse müşterileri olsun her türlü insan ile karşılaşmışımdır çeşit çeşit insana katlanmak zorunda kalıyorsunuz.Askerlikte bile böyle sabırlı olma zorunluluğu hissetmemişimdir eminim.Emin olun sinir,stres tavan yapması için başlıca iş yerlerinden bir tanesi.Güzel taraflarıda var tabiki bolca çevre yapıyorsunuz ve çalışma saaatleri iyi ama shift bazen değişiyor sabah git akşam gel çalıştırabiliyor sistem.Eğer baristaysanız sürekli ayakta durmak zorundasınız mesai saatleri içinde boş durmak yasak diyor sistem iş üretmek lazımmış hatta hiç unutmuyorum mağaza müdürüme işim bitti şuan dedim daha mesai sona ermedi yere kahve dök temizle demişti şaka değil.Sürekli temizlik yapmaktan mağaza aşındırıyorsunuz aynı yere defalarca temizlediğiniz oluyor özellikle Cafe bölümünde oluşan müşteri boşları ayrı bir kaos masaları berbat bir hale getirip bıraksalar bile uyarmak yasakmış(Burger King`'ten aldığı ketçap mayonez ile masaya aşkını yazanları bile gördüm) Ne kadar azimli çalışsanız bile şirket gözünde hep bir eksiniz vardır. 3 yıldır beni vardiya"
bad,"Worked with the company for 4 years starting as barista and worked my way up to supervisor  the supervisor rate started at .15c more than minimum wage lots expected of you and a lot of pressure for no reward. Free lunches was a perk as supervisor but baristas paid half price. Management were terrible, staff turnover was constant, left the company after 4 years without a thank you or goodbye."
bad,Reasonable work for student and part timers. Although working for a franchise so will be paid less. Hard work and repetitive but depending on team you’re with can be easier it alot harder work.
bad,Baristas are seen as disposable and upper management are often gossipy. Pay is ridiculously low considering what is expected of you. Would not recommend to anyone.
bad,"The job and company environment was nothing like they projected , it was not great for getting hours , affording benefit or in the treatment of employees ."
bad,"Starbucks suckers to work at. Totally  not worth my two years I spent there. Pay sucked, hours sucked, management sucked. The turnover rate was at like 95%."
bad,I would not recommend. There is no growth. When asked how can we keep employees suggesting ideas are never followed. General Manager listens but has people above whom do nothing.
bad,"Very busy all the time and can be stressful"
bad,Starbucks makes billions. They don’t pay their baristas enough and the management system is based on friendship. It’s all who you know. Awful company.
bad,"You will not get paid what you are worth. You will be run absolutely ragged and then expected to give more. Your manager will infringe upon your life outside of the store -- constant texts, passive-aggressive phone calls -- and you will suffer nightmares from the anxiety of never being Good Enough.  You will sell a drink to someone for $7 that takes 47 seconds to make and realise that, after taxes, you don't make that much in an hour. You will enjoy your coworkers and then watch the demands of the job create so much turnover that six month after you start, you don't know half the people you work with anymore."
bad,"Training is non existent when you first start out and learn as you go which makes things 100X stressful. You are required to lift and take out 100lb trash bags almost every hour, the employees are young and chances of you getting bullied by staff are high. Manager has no management skills and loses patience with employees often enough to yell on their faces. Which makes a very hostile work environment. Benefits are a joke and no room for advancement"
bad,"Being a Starbucks barista is great, as long as you're still living with your parents or looking for a first job. Anything after that point and it's a waste of time."
bad,"Starbucks is a company culture based on cattiness. Employees often talk about each other behind their backs. Starbucks does not care about families and work life balance, they only care about customers who are usually awful rude and disrespectful. The worst 5 years of my life were wasted working for this horrible company"
bad,"do NOT work for a starbucks inside of a kroger. kroger management will screw you over again and again. they don’t care about you, your schedule, they won’t honor your availability, or seniority. i’ve been here FOUR YEARS and people who’ve been here less than six months are getting better shifts than me and weekends off."
bad,"I loved the idea of working at Starbucks but after I applied, I realized immediately the mistake I’d made. I wouldn’t wish that place upon my worst enemy."
bad,"Working here was one of the most sincerely awful experiences of my life.  Management is absolutely incompetent and as long as you schmooze your DM, you get away with everything.  Scheduling is garbage.  People are great.  -5/10 wouldn't be surprised if employees burned a store to the ground."
bad,"After 3 years, I received a 6 cent raise with an excellent review as a barista and I just couldn't do the hustle anymore. The only time I got enough hours to make rent without covering shifts at other stores (called corporate and they said there is no guarantee of any number of hours) was when I worked the overnight shifts at a 24 hour location. "
bad,"If you have good management and a quality district manager, you will probably have an okay experience with the company, but those managers are few and far between. Typically the DM’s are uneducated about their brand, the company and how to run a successful store. To make matters worse the store level managers are typically under qualified and inconsiderate of their subordinates and their needs and voices. So it’s a mixed bag. You get what you get"
bad,"Vile place to work for , management / shift leaders well don’t even go there not nice to work with "
bad,Managers are very rude and only care about certain  baristas also Hours suck only 4 hr a day the most lucky get 5 or 6hr and schedule all mess up . The training Is the worst they expect you know everything within a week or two remind you only work one or two days um ok and you would notice when employees would look at you and won’t even help you struggling . Also the  juan manager so unprofessional. I would thought Starbucks would treat there employees better that not the case they have you doing the most and energy for the medium wage so I recommend not working here.
bad,"I swear starbucks finds the worst possible people to hire with the worst work ethic, and then hires them on the spot. Pay was terrible and you are constantly rushed to do everything at once. They never staff properly, and I can say that it’s an issue company wide because I’ve worked at 4 different locations across the country. Management is always terrible. The place is so dirty it’s disgusting and you can never clean because they don’t have enough people on the floor. The job is extremely stressful and fast-paced and the customers are nightmares. The pay is even worse (no one tips) I’ve had many people ask me about working here and if it’s worth it, and I always tell them to RUN."
bad,"I had been excited to work at Starbucks even though I was taking a pay-cut. I had actually left a job thinking Starbucks would value me as an employee. Once I got in, I was very surprised. "
bad,"While I believe the overarching culture and vision of what its like to work at Starbucks was initially well-thought out in the beginning, the corporate greed of optimizing on money made and less on employee satisfaction definitely shines through."
bad,"Management sucked. Day to day most everyone felt their job was on the line unless you were a favorite, oh and white. Its a game and u gotta play to stay. Leave your morals and pride especially at home."
bad,"At first the job seems okay but it doesn't take long for managers to take advantage of its partners and create a stressful environment. They rarely consider whats in the best interest of their partners and are very slow to act, if they act at all, when a complaint is made."
bad,Workload doesn’t match pay. Manager gave hours to partners that they liked personally and not based off work. No discipline for partners not showing up for shifts.
bad,"Soul sucking job with impossible demands and abusive management and environment.  Everything they say about caring about employees, or ""partners"" is completely false and just for appearance.  They will bleed you dry every chance they get and then still demand more."
bad,Partners were put under extreme pressure to deliver results but not provided with enough support. Senior management is disconnected from the store level jobs. Micro management is a regular occurring issue from the District managers.
bad,"Very disorganized... do not care about your health. "
bad,Horribly over worked and many rules broken managment .rude customers always getting angry at the server because euro garages charges 10% more than s normal Starbucks. Not worth the endless stress you will not enjoy this work space
bad,I was promised the manager position and after months of studying and training they refused to give it to me. The management promoted on who you know not on what you know.
bad,"didn't get much training , poor staff management. , they didnt care about your needs or problems. made you didn't want to work their, low work esteem."
bad,"This company plays favorites. If you arent in the ""in"" crowd you get talked bad about and made fun of daily. I had to be the only one doing customer support and never was on bar, but i had it good enough to take out the trash one in a while so i wasnt always scrubbing the bathroom."
bad,"Starbucks is moving towards more micro managing versus letting the store manager run the business. They treat each store the same, even though business at every store differs slightly."
bad,my management was awful worked there for almost a year and wasn't even taught how to make drinks. I was basically bullied by my shift leads. I can't speak for other stores but mine was terrible
bad,"Management always acted as tho they were the best thing that's ever happened to the company. Even the shift managers looked down on me. The amount of work you have to do, cleaning, serving customers, mopping the floor, washing up is not worth it for minimum wage. The only way you advance in the company is if your face fits. Not to mention It took me 2 months to get my reference for my new job."
bad,"Management could care less about the employees. They only care about kissing their superior’s a** to move up in the company."
bad,The day was half good half bad. I learned that everyone recites the rules but barely anyone follows them truthfully. Management always reminded me of being back in high school. The hardest part was realizing that great work wasn't always rewarded . But at least I got to enjoy the personal connection I got to make with complete strangers over coffee.
bad,"Racist and discriminatory verbal actions from managers and staff."
bad,"The worst management I have ever experienced! "
bad,"At first Starbucks was an awesome place to work. Then I found out that my manager was hiring more people which means cut hours. Eventually I was not able to live off on my paycheck and had to find a second job. Soon after my hours were cut even more so I was working abut 12 hours a week. After complaining, asking for more hours (several times), a car accident, and not having enough hours for benefits my manager finally gave me 20 hours a week. Another issue I had with my manager that goes along with my lack of hours is that she would ask me to take her shifts instead of just scheduling me more hours. Also when she would be on the clock she would be in the back “making the schedule” for hours at a time for several days. On a side note, my coworkers sucked and I did most of the cleaning for the whole store and not just the customer support roles either. Overall, working at Starbucks was a poor experience for me. Not worth the stress. Not worth he poor pay."
bad,"A typical day was being short on staff due to them calling out or not having enough people scheduled for the day. Lack of communication with others, only worked maybe 4-5 hours max a day (sometimes resulting in less than 30 hours a week), the manager just watches the workers struggle instead of helping them, etc."
bad,"Treated like help, manager would not promote me or allow me to go.into other departments."
bad,"I work in downtown Cleveland, and its has become a very stressful atmosphere. The job itself is not managed the best and the coworkers are very negative. The customers are also very harsh and rude, and it makes the workday seem unrewarding."
bad,"Shifts were 3am - 9am or they had no hours for me. "
bad,"You never really felt secure in the westgate drive location in Brockton. The district manager lacked management skills. The most recent store manager lacked empathy. I have been separated from the company for about a month now and I’m still getting contacted by the store manager about issues with the stores social media page. Even making requests for me to handle things with it. Since I have left the company a solid portion of the core team has either been pushed out of their job due to stress, or fired even over a phone call. Steer clear of Starbucks at least in the state of Massachusetts."
bad,This company is good is you stay a shift or below. They don’t care about their managers at all. I miscarried and was shamed for needing to take a leave of absence. Worked over 50 hrs a week and was always harassed by the district manager at all hours of the day and night.
bad,"Slecht management, communiceren niet met je,veel jaloezie onder elkaar en proberen je onzekerheid en fouten aan te praten die ze zelf maken. Hoge werkdruk en veel onderbezetting zodat ze nog meer werkdruk van je eisen. Even een praatje met de klanten maken was bijna onmogelijk omdat de supervisor in je oor stond te schreeuwen dat je door moest werken! Supervisors die de werkdruk niet aan kunnen en af reageren op de barista’s. Nooit meer daar werken! Salaris via payroll, gevaarlijk systeem omdat ze je te pas en onpas in kunnen zetten, lijkt op een 0 uren contract.. Geen uitzicht op een vast contract. Daarnaast zou het meer geschikt voor studenten zijn om wat bij te verdienen maar heb gemerkt dat die zelfs weglopen of tijdens de training al of kort daarna!"
bad,"Working for Starbucks can be fun when you have a team that you get along with. However if you have a team that has one person that doesn't like to show up for shifts, or someone that comes in late, best believe you're going to have to pick up the slack. I learned that in order to make things happen the way you want them to that you need to constantly badger management, and reach out to different stores."
bad,"Corporate's goals conflict with their core values. Corporate message is that the customer is first, but does not support the staffing and product offerings."
bad,"it was my first job , I barely got any hours some weeks, some days it was stressful depending on the customers day if it was good or bad they would take out on workers"
bad,"worked there for about 7 months before I had to quit. The management constantly talked poorly about coworkers and other managers in front of employees and customers. My assistant manager was fired after I had worked there for about 3 months and instead of finding a new assistant manager they asked me to do it because I was the only full time employee. I said yes and I did not receive any training other than a binder full of booklets about customer experience and there was no pay raise despite my responsibilities doubling. I was there everyday of the week, my work day usually starting at 6 am, which would have been fine except for the fact that I was working alone until around 9 am and wouldn't get a break until around noon. I frequently didn't receive breaks and worked overtime every shift. My manager and coworkers were incredibly unreliable, they called in sick all the time and refused to stay and constantly slacked of during work. I often worked 10 hour days and occasionally had to open and close the store. Whenever I did have the courage to ask for a break, often I worked alone so I would have to shut down the kiosk for 15 mins, I would be interrogated about my coworkers and why they weren't there. I never felt accepted and was always worried about being fired because they would let people go for seemingly no reason. there were no perks at all and we were left without the resources we needed throughout the day. I never knew what was expected of me and it seemed like nobody knew the answers to any of my questions, everyone is just there to gossip and make a pay cheque. I thought"
bad,"I began with the company several years ago, unfortunately its willingness to bend to the will of social issues has had a negative impact on the employees. We are taught standards and then are continuously instructed to disregard these standards when someone complains whether it be legitimate or not. I have watched almost all the managers I have worked under be hired from outside of the company. I have seen no change in the training to prevent this from happening and they continue to devalue the ""partners"" that work for them by offering them very little opportunity to move up within the company."
bad,Would not recommend being a customer and/or a partner. Asked to work while not on the clock. Dealing with customers off the clock. Customers are not treated like the first priority to management unfortunately.  Never reimbursed for working off the clock. Asked to drive to other Starbucks  before and during a shift and use my own resources without reimbursement.  They're standards are not realistic for the staff that is provided. Superiors and baristas alike are constantly stressed to go above and beyond expectation daily. Belittled and berated by both customers and  superiors alike over very minor things. daily. You can get fired for not smiling enough. Never had a consistent schedule.
bad,"I loved what I did like making drinks and customer service. The work itself was great. But it's not a professional atmosphere as coworkers and managers bring their opinions, feelings, and life outside of work into the workplace. Communication is poor and most people just talk behind other's backs. Felt like I was in high school again. Not for genuine people who don't have time for drama. Terrible culture. Not appropriate for nursing moms as there's no private spots to pump."
bad,Would not recommend at all. I worked there and hated it more than any job I have had. Staff make you not wanted and management is a joke. I had no training what so ever either. The head manager that opened the branch is nothing but a pervert too. I left because of this and they actually deducted £250 out of my pay that I worked hard for because of 'the training' I had . It does state this in the contract if you leave within a year they deduct it off your pay for training but how can they justify it when you do not even have training? joke of a company.
bad,"Starbucks understaffs and pays way less than should be paid for a stressful job. They pressure you to come in when you're sick."
bad,"It’s just not a good place to work.  They say they value baristas, they don’t.  They aren’t who they say they are.  There’s no protection for SM’s.  They say “do whatever you can to surprise and delight customers” then take away your ability to surprise andvdelight customers.  They write hundreds of pages of “rules” and do not enforce them."
bad,"Good only for high school students, I don’t recommend long term with this company a lot of work no union or great benefits. Plus if you’re supporting a family will not make it with 1200 a month and advancing your career here is to much politics and favoritism. Please look else where now these day get a city job with union. This company works people to the ground at the end of the day your left with NOTHING!!!!!"
bad,I highly do not recommend working here. It was stressful and the management was poor. The pay is not worth what you deal with on a daily basis. It was one of the worst times of my life
bad,"I worked for Startbucks in the past about three years ago and it has changed or I have the worst manager and district manager out there. A typical day at the slowest store in district would include walking into a dirty store doesn't matter if it was an open or close. No employee is held accountable for their actions, shifts and managers are allowed to come in late but baristas get yelled at for doing that. The manager is always a new manager so they have no clue what they are doing or are always in back on the computer. The most difficult part is always working down employees, we have to send out ""partners"" to other stores every time someone calls out or doesn't show up. It becomes the shifts fault because we couldn't get out on time or had to send people home early since there isn't enough labor. There are very few enjoyable parts of the job, occasionally you find a awesome coworker but my manager has decided to keep all the employees have I am friends with either off or working the opposite shift than mine"
bad,"I believe the work experience could vary depending on the location, but overall, I find Starbucks work policies quite inhumane and harsh--in spite of what they represent as a company. "
bad,This Starbucks is very disorganized. It is poorly managed for being a high volume establishment with drive thru. There is no motivation and low morale
bad,Starbucks is a fun place to work when your first start only  because its a new job and you can get free coffee and discounts but once you and everyone else starts getting comfortable it goes downhill. The enviroment is not as happy as you would want it to be behind the counter.
bad,"Compensation is decent, product is less than average, upper management turns over quickly, difficult to create a healthy culture with rapid management change"
bad,"Es básicamente un McDonald´s del café, nada más que acotar."
bad,"I have worked at a store located downstate and LOVED my job. It was flexible, I felt supported and the work environment was welcoming. Moving up to MQT I got a job there thinking it would be similar in a lot of ways. I was SO wrong. This is the worst job I have ever heard. The boss is a tarrible boss. She rips you down and makes you feel inferior. She is manipulative and lies a lot. Its embarrassing for the company, because starbucks is such an amazing company to work for. People have quit left and right. She runs the store like none I have ever seen. It's a very unhealthy work environment. Please don't apply and look for a job where people will treat you like a human."
bad,"understaffed, inexperienced staffers, underdeveloped safety and security requirements, low quality employee mentality, not concerned with ethics in the workplace"
bad,"was treated very unfairly, was supposed to receive health benefits but after 6 months of constant calling and inquiring why i wasn't receiving the promised benefits i was still ignored. Management was very poor, for every mistake they would make they would blame a supervisor or a lower level employee so they wouldn't take the fall or receive any blame."
bad,Le manager et tous les cadres sont tellement nerveux qu'ils vous traitent comme des chiens.
bad,"My experience, as well as many others, was not a positive one working for Target Canada. There was a big lack of respect and communication between management and staff, which was the result of many issues. When requesting time off, even well in advance, it was almost always denied without any reason. There was almost always a shortage of staff because people were always quitting due to poor work conditions. "
bad,"23.5 degrees are possibly the worst company I have had the misfortune to work for!"
bad,Unfortunately i had to move back to my home town so the manager was not happy with me. She repeatedly made me feel rubbish for my Endometriosis problems i had at the time and brought me into the office for removing her off Facebook and gave me a really hard time for moving and leaving her store. She even kept me rotad on for shifts knowing i was leaving. Would NEVER recommend working for the company.
bad,The company has left behind the employees they hire .They have build a system to have the working class take care of the working class by taking away full time position and adding more and more work without raising pay pushing their employees into welfare and no be eligible for benefits
bad,Employees constantly bicker over positions. Never want to put ccustomer first and has a hard time cleaning up after selves or oone another.
bad,"Wish I hadn't left my job to progress into Starbucks as a supervisor, worst job I've worked for. Worst training! They messed me about . Badly organised to the point nothing important gets done such as paperwork tax codes proper Rotas and contracts. Wouldn't recommend to anyone even someone who's would have as first time job. They didn't even transfer my old tax code from my previous job which I've had to ring up and sort out with the tax office! alot of people, not all! act there working hard but are taking it easy and being lazY."
bad,Being a partner of starbucks has taught me how to work not only in a team but within a company. starting off as a barista and working my way up to a supervisor role has brought some positivity to my work ethic and the job I do. Unfortunately now I see no future in that company. Manager had no peoples skills.
bad,"I think Howard Schultz is an amazing CEO, but i think when you get to the store level Managers and District managers can be horrible."
bad,Contributes to Starbucks success by assisting the store manager in executing store operations during scheduled shifts. Deploying partners and delegating tasks so that partners can create and maintain the Starbucks Experience for customers. Models and acts in accordance with Starbucks guiding principles.
bad,the only good thing about working for this company is the feeling of how every drink you make is an art piece and the conversations with customers everything else is terrible.
bad,"I did not last very long at this Starbucks location.  During my  job interview, I was told about the company dress code, and I voiced a concern about my long hair.  I was assured that it would be fine so long as I kept it tied back and out of my face, which I was more than willing to do.  I worked for nearly a month and became fairly proficient at the job during that time.  However, there came a day when people from upper management came by, and indicated to the store manager that my hair was not acceptable, even tied back as it was.  The store manager relayed this message to me, at which time I looked around and noticed that several of my female coworkers had been working their shifts for several hours with their hair down.  I felt discriminated against, and said as much to the store manager.  At this point I was no longer willing to work my shift, and I quit on the spot."
bad,"Typical day."
bad,"you have to put starbucks ahead of ur family. they wanted me to change the day of my wedding 2 months before my wedding, because they transfered me. because i would not i was told i was not commit."
bad,"Ten years ago Starbucks was a notch above others in corporate values, now they are just like the rest, more concern about profitability,than the community,or the environment, while at the same time reducing beneifts for employees,and disgarding valuable expierenced employees."
bad,"I did not like working at Starbucks. We were always understaffed, it was extremely stressful and negative. This job caused me so much unnecessary anxiety and I was very underpaid for all of the work I had to do."
bad,"This company abuses its workers and celebrates hateful/disrespectful  customers and business practices. It encourages the toxic behavior from its employees all the way up to the corporate scale. Being a Starbucks ""partner"" is including yourself in a world of horrid management, terrible benefits, low pay and sexist coworkers(if you're a man). This company treats you atrociously, it pays new people almost the same wage as people that have been there 10+ yrs and is incredibly ""clicky""."
bad,"favoritism is prioritized. the coffee worship culture is like a cult where if you are ""passionate"" enough about coffee you'll never advance. the terms used a deliberately vague in order to keep decisions arbitrary."
bad,"At the location i worked for had no sense of team work, the management went out of their way to make you feel out casted and made you look stupid for asking questions. I was never asked about my future with the company, and when asked never received a reason why. I wouldn't recommend anyone apply at this location you will not advance unless you gossip or know management personally."
bad,I did not enjoy working there I don’t like the culture of the company. I don’t approve the CEO I don’t approve of her management style. I’m glad I left it was a good experience
bad,This job was horrible. The costumers where mean . Management was mean. And the time the would call you in to cover someone’s shift was horrible. I don’t recommend anyone working at the Starbucks in the kroger off Nathan dean.
bad,"The longer one remains with Starbucks, the more dehumanizing the experience becomes. The benefits do not outweigh the sacrifices to your self-esteem, your schedule, and your work-life balance. Not a good career pathway, ok for an immediate option."
bad,Very fast paced environment and stressful situations. Not a lot of support from corporate and not a live-able wage. Recent labor cuts have us working harder with less people during our busiest time of the year and makes it hard to have a good work life balance.
bad,This company is all about rippi g the public off.  You pay $6-7 for a drink that they have less than .75 cents in. It is horrible how they take advantage of the public and employees.
bad,horrible experience.It is impossible to be treated like a real human being when most of management is racist.But this is only at target starbucks  by lenox.(Atlanta Ga)
bad,"They had 2 coffee machines and I was left alone to operate both every single day from start to finish. Had 3 people firing orders at me and no help. When I was on a break or if I wasn't on shift 2 people were on my station. Place was very cliquey, the only males who get forward in this company are of a certain persuasion otherwise you're not progressing unless you're gay or female. Fought for months to get my final pay"
bad,"Starbucks is less than honest about opportunities available.  The average manager in my area was with the company around 8 years before being promoted to manager, which is the lowest level at Starbucks that actually pays a living wage in my market, and still not much money.  Their overall management style is largely passive aggressive, and it takes FOREVER for problems to be addressed.  Mostly, they just hope problems will get better or go away."
bad,this job claims they are here for their employees but all in all this is something you need another job or two to get by. My manager is currently only scheduling me around 13 hours a week so i don't even qualify for the benefits
bad,"Working for Starbucks was an okay experience and it worked with my schedule availability but the pay really sucks. If you want to work for Starbucks make sure you work at a regular store and not a drive thru, this is one tip that I will give to someone seeking to work at Starbucks."
bad,"Was excited to work for a company I enjoy. They treat their employees very badly. They were always understaffed, calling you in even during class times. The people were awful and would write paragraphs on how the wanted their drinks. I overall hated the experience"
bad,Would not recommend. Poor management overall and limited to change. Good benefits pays for school and paid weekly. Various hours of work. Management does not give employees a voice
bad,"I have worked last summer in a Starbucks store in Belsize Park (London) and I have lived the worst job experience of my life because of the manager. The first one was used to scream out in my ear: ""Let's go!!! Let's go!!!"" when I was making different drinks for the customers, because he said that I was slow to do that and one time he voluntarily hit my hand when I was setting the coffee machine! And when I finished my shift, he was used say to me: ""Go home!"" in a rude way...and these ones are only some of his bad and obsessing acts...Every excuse was good to bother and vex me without any reason because I have always worked with diligence, doing all that the supervisors told me to do and being always on time at work! "
bad,"I was a partner for many years, and the company has no respect for those that are loyal. Equal pay is not a thing, you are overworked and they promote managers that don’t know what they are doing. You think it’s a great place to work, but it’s a cult."
bad,Management at the Lankershim/Erwin store is terrible. Tried to fire me for having high functioning autism even though everyone else was almost as stressed as me. Too busy for the number of employees at any given time. No customer support. Expected to be smiling at every second of every work hour because if I didn’t it was seen as attitude the shift leads would bully me just about every time I went into work. Don’t work there.
bad,Starbucks ended up being one of the worst jobs I have held next to working at the 18 hundred they refused to work with my schedule because I had another job I never got my split of the tips most of the time and I worked hard to get a promotion and never was even offered one
bad,"Starbucks is fun , but you are standing for 8 hours with no breaks , the locations are severely understaffed , and there is too much for one person to do as expected . when something falls through the cracks , you are punished and ridiculed for it . they'll also schedule you for about 5.75 hours (the longest they cAn have you work without having to give you a break ) but I can guarantee you will have stay 30 minutes after nearly every shift , and you'll be scheduled EVERYDAY."
bad,"Starbucks will take you away from your life. Your life becomes Starbucks. Management will not support you,  and will give you more responsibilities than tools to handle them. Do not work there."
bad,not great for anyone who works for a living.  Not bad if you are a student.  on more than one occasion management received a cash tip for baristas I had to train.
bad,Literally so awful. I’ve never had more mental breakdowns and seen more mental breakdowns than my time at Starbs. The employee turnover is disgusting. I was a shift manager and it was a personal nightmare every day and my district manager did nothing. Went through 6 managers in my 11 month time there. So yeah.
bad,"Management only care about customers and customers satisfaction. Very little time and effort go into making the partners happy and hearing their problems. Hours vary some weeks hours are cut some weeks you have maybe 25 hours. They only care about giving you hours when it benefits them i.e. having to get you to cover a shift and not when you actually need hours. Over work you, constantly on your feet. If your looking or interested in working for this company I highly discourage it."
bad,"I was at first hired to become the asst manager but shortly after being hired the manager quit. A new manager was hired from another location but was given a raise of 6$ (been with company for 30 years) and then she'd come into work a 4 am clock in and then sit around and pretend to do work until about 1 pm in the afternoon. Now given this lady did nothing except sit and soak up her 20$ job. After complaining several times to management and hearing nothing for months, I eventually gave up and quit."
bad,Company cares more about making a quick buck and making their partners break themselves to make people happy than making sure their employees are okay
bad,"The management above SM's are disconnected and out to make themselves look good. It used to be about customers and partner connection. That idea ended approx, 6 years ago. The pay for managers is incredible and benefits as well, but the culture is sorely lacking."
bad,"I worked as a temp and then became a partner (directly hired by the company) after 2 months because of my work performance. I worked there for over 2 years and watched management become worse and worse each day. They do not allow internal candidates to move up within the company, instead they hire managers from Amazon. They went from caring about their employees to treating them terribly, and then they began firing the people who had been there the longest because they were not open to the ideas they had. This place literally crushed my soul. They made me feel terrible on a daily basis. My supervisor made me cry at least once a week. Do yourself a favor and stay away from Starbucks Roasting Plant in York, PA."
bad,"Ive worked down at the Starbucks in the city for about a yr before being let go for something little. I've even came in on my days off to clean the store a d always went above and beyond for my store. But management would rather favor people who doesn't follow policies and just all around not a great partner or what a partner should represent. Management doesnt value the good workers, over works them and don't want them to succeed"
bad,Shove politics down your throat. Corporate makes rules but doesn't enforce them. The second a customer complains the management pretends the rule never existed and blames the employees for trying to do what is correct.
bad,"destrict managers had no idea whats going on, if you want to join this company be ready to give up your  family.. Because you will be spending a long hours at work, no matter how hard you work there is no appreciation, management always asking for a higher results without looking at your understaffed store."
bad,"If you enjoy working in a chaotic stressful disorganized environment for very little pay and having everything you do timed down to the seconds, then this is the job for you. As a customer for decades, I always believed working at Starbucks would be fun, because the Baristas are always cheerful, smiling and friendly. In reality, you are instructed to ""connect"" with the customers, making eye contact and small talk that includes open ended questions to make them feel acknowledged and welcome. There is no time or place for genuine interaction. Every activity you do is timed, and there are timers with constant bells and beeps going off at all times, keeping you in a state of hypervigilance with excessive amounts of cortisol and adrenaline flowing through your body which can lead to developing adrenal fatigue and even depression. The additional constant noise of the coffee grinders, espresso machines, loud Spotify music in the cafe and customer chatter, combined with wearing (dirty) headsets, causes tinnitus and cumulative hearing loss over time. Positions are supposed to be rotated so no Barista is at any one station for more than 30 minutes at a time, yet in reality, you will likely be standing in one spot or doing one role with repetitive tasks throughout your entire shift, which is injurious to the body over time, and offers no job satisfaction whatsoever. Schedules are supposed to be posted 3 weeks in advance to allow for planning your life outside of work, yet the manager of the store I was in would change schedules even after they were printed and posted, often only a week"
bad,People are rude you’re schedule is terrible bosses are rude it’s not worth the pay and there places that aren’t team friendly and you’re a grunt worker
bad,"This hired for FT never got full time hours. Shifts changed every single day no two shifts ever the same hours. When my availability changed as I got another better paying job and advised manager of this she was mad and had issues with it. Also wanted my availability to changed as the bus only runs certain hours for me to get to and from work. And never work on Sundays as for this reason. I don’t want to spend more then half what I’d make in my shift to get to and from work. Almost lost job over this and took an hour and half explaining this to the manager via text as she was never in store to talk to. "
bad,Too much workplace drama. Could not ask questions to anyone without someone getting worked up. Hostile work environment that made me feel anxious at all times of my shifts.
bad,"The company is good if you are a SJW nutjob. That is not to say I am a Trump supporter, but, you gotta be on the opposite end of that sphere in order to survive at Sbux. "
bad,"No work/life balance. Will have to work even when you are sick. Managers don’t care about baristas or shifts as long as you are covering on the floor. Customers will argue with you, swear at you and head office will send them complimentary gift cards for that. “Lovely” place to be"
bad,"I wish for everyone time work like I have:)"
bad,"Starbucks sucks the life out of you. Customers treat you like you're the dirt they walk on and you have to eat it with a smile for dirt pay. Corporate will punish you severely for standing up for yourself when a customer is verbally abusing or sexually harassing you (and then send that customer 10$ in gift cards). Management at some stores in particular is awful; they don't listen to anyone's concerns about getting not enough or too many hours, and have no sympathy for medical or family emergencies (including sudden deaths in the family). "
bad,"Terrible management and company , drive Thru Southend ruined my life sacked me just before Christmas as I had been of ill, with a dr note , In a Better job now thank god"
bad,"The constantly revolving employee and manager door has only gotten worse over the last decade. District Managers are so out of touch with their districts that they don't notice Store Managers not showing up to work at all for the better part of eight months. You never see them working on holidays, but they actually expect you to work every single holiday and weekend, ad infinitum. They can change your schedule at will, and fire you for absolutely no reason, other than their Store Manager decrees it should be done. They asked me to routinely reschedule my grandmother's doctor's appointments, including her chemotherapy, and then they retaliated when I refused to fall in line. As a Supervisor, I had no recourse in the likely event, as in, every single day, when someone would frivolously call in sick or walk off in the middle of a shift. Partners were allowed to be insubordinate to the Supervisors with no consequences. Your opinion does not matter. The benefits are nowhere NEAR as good as they used to be, and the menu changes weekly. They are incredibly stingy with labor but have blistering expectations of performance. They couldn't care less about how long you've been with the company. Your opinion will never matter. They will side with the customer and the manager 100% of the time. An irate and abusive customer can come in and scream insults at you for the better part of ten minutes, and you are expected to then kiss their butts and give them freebies."
bad,The new Starbucks is all about corporate minded individuals who get paid the same salary as a 16-year-old learning how to work how unfortunate.Henceforth everyone just applies here just to get the free coffee and then it makes it the free coffee land for the free coffee seekers for the free coffee lovers effing coffee
bad,"honestly, just poor everything. management, petty coworker drama and endless pretentious customers nagging you for things you have no control over. corporate always making changes that make customers angry, or adding more ""2 second"" tasks on top of the billion things you have to do. Might also be just you carrying the weight as a lot of coworkers do nothing."
bad,You never knew exactly what the manager wanted  You  to do.  The manager wasn't very clear on things. And also wasn't sure on the policies. Unlike anyplace there was favorites and those Promoted quicker even without the experience.
bad,"When I first started at Starbucks, the mission was clear; One Customer, One Cup At A Time."
bad,I did not have a very good experience with this company. I was in constant fear of loosing my job and unable to take a day off ever.  Even when on vacation I would have to be reachable by my District manager
bad,A typical day would consist of coming in counting my register ; preparing the coffe machines and making sure everything behind the bar is set to standard
bad,Was going through a rough time in my personal life and when I needed time to see a counselor about it. I was embarrassed and made fun of by my manager
bad,"Don't go in with high expectations. Minimal training for minimal benefits, poor management and no back up for when you get treated poorly by customers."
bad,"Working at Starbucks was very frustrating for me. I felt that partners were not paid well for the amount of work that needed to be done. I also felt that some partners did not work hard at all and had poor work ethic and proper precautions were not taken. I constantly felt like I was the only person who cared about the store that I was working for - at times even more so than the store manager. I put in very long hours and did sometimes three times the amount of work than necessary. The biggest problem with Starbucks overall was the lack of staffing. My manager was unable to schedule an adequate amount of partners at any given time because corporate would not allow her to because to them we are basically robots and should be able to handle anything and do the jobs of 3+ people. During morning peak hours we would have one person on hot bar (me), one person on register and one person brewing coffee and gathering food/coffee, etc. We would have lines out the door constantly and always had a mass of people standing by the handoff plane. It was absolute chaos and very embarrassing and degrading to all of us working.  Every day when I left work I felt very upset and overwhelmed by how much of a disaster the store I worked at was. I  voiced my concerns to my store manager on some occasions and nothing was done about it. If anything it got worse as time went on. The day that I turned in my notice I found that I was finally able to breathe again. I will never return to this company and I would not recommend it to anyone who wants to remain sane."
bad,"Starbucks was not an enjoyable place to work.  While my coworkers were great, the salary was lot, and many of the customers were rude.  Overall, the poor pay and lack of respect that employees were given by customers made it a negative experience."
bad,"This was the worst job I had ever had. I stated I needed a 40 hours a week, full-time job and after the first couple of months or so. My hours were drastically cut and I had to address this with management, almost every week. They expect you to be available pretty much 24/7 for them even if they cut your hours to the minimum 12 hours a week, as well as for the majority of the other Baristas. If you are a student this is pretty good job so long as you're at a store where the management abides by the availability you've provided. However, I highly do not recommend this company for anyone looking for full-time employment. I know that shift supervisors, managers, and up can have full time hours but the majority of Baristas don't. If you're able to apply for a position higher up, it'd be worth your while but starting off from being a Barista is a struggle."
bad,"When i first started at this company you were rewarded for working hard, having actual product knowledge of their core product and were properly trained. Now it has turned into a popularity contest with no work ethic or standards and employees with no training to very little because training plans that have been revamped many times over are not followed at all."
bad,"I worked at the Evergreen village starbucks and i have literally be treated so poorly there! the manager is extremely rude, and very unhelpful. She would make snide remarks when you’d get something wrong, she’d treat you like you’re the dumbest person in the world if you couldn’t find the proper tea or something. "
bad,"Work environment was terrible, the district managers and the overall company don't care about you. The job wasn't hard; however, the district managers' unrealistic expectations and having a terrible manager made it a pretty difficult job. Extremely high turnover, baristas were not being trained properly (some of them were not trained at all), manager didn't know how to do the schedule. There was a mix of really nice regular customers and the worst customers you could imagine. The company tries to shove down the employees' throat their ""values"" and crazy standards about the ""customer experience"". The worst part of it was definetly having incompetent managers and no support from the district managers."
bad,"If you have an opinion this company is not for you.  Management  humiliated in workplace group chats.  Orders given out by a HQ team who have never worked in hospitality and didn't understand peak periods.  Achievable targets for bonus however now bonus payments made,  fees for non existent training?  Poorly run, poorly maintained stores!  Such a shame considering how great Starbucks is!"
bad,It was fun and it was a bless ing to work thwre but I believe they could do more better with team and mangers. .. I was working at the airport so that's what made the job cool
bad,This company has changed CEO's and in my own opinion DOES NOT live up it it's morals and values as a whole. It is NO LONGER about the people who work their or the customers- bottom line is it all about the speed and cash flow into the store. The best part of this job is the friendships you make. The hardest was trying to please those above you and meeting their expectations although many times unrealistic. My opinion is towards company operated stores- NOT towards it's affliliates or licensed operating stores.
bad,The company is not who they used to be years ago. Management is horrible and the company does not care about the safety of their employees. Pay is good but not worth the stress.
bad,The culture at Starbucks seems to revel in insulting the customer and making up their own rules and guidelines as they go. It seems like the rudest employees are the most rewarded.
bad,Worst job ever. Managers and some of the long time working employees that are in power are rude and racist. So suffocating job that you have to ask them even before breathing.
bad,"Horrible bosses and backstabbing partners and coworkers is the norm. HR will laugh off valid concerns of harassment and discrimination. Combined with lack of work life balance, it’s nit worth it and I would advise anyone to look elsewhere"
bad,"Because of the defamation act we have countering the first amendment, just don’t work there. It felt like being in high school and it’s exactly how it looks from outside of the line."
bad,"Didn't actually work here, but i love Starbucks. Im sure if i did i would give it a great review, however i did not . I did a financial analysis on it though."
bad,"I absolutely hated working at starbucks, the management was terrible and I dreaded going to work everyday. I originally worked at an amazing starbucks kiosk where everyone was super kind and it was a positive work atmosphere."
bad,manager are constantly cutting hours   don't get comfortable     the district manager changes so often that you are constantly being threathened with job security      its all who you know
bad,"Depending on the location you work Starbucks can be fun or miserable. My location was miserable, managers didn't care about you as a person but as long as you were working your shift. You could be sick, crying or dying on the inside and no one care but yell at you to get back to work. Its intense, everyone is out to get you so you feel as you cant speak to anyone. During a mandatory meeting we spent the first hour cleaning up after people who didn't do their jobs. Spent the next hour getting criticized on issues that have nothing to do with most of us. than at the end they give you little gifts to make it better. Over all I'm sad I accepted a job at this location and would not do it again if given the chance."
bad,"The management had no idea what they were doing, left scheduling to a computer, if you were sick? They forced you to come or else they threatened you."
bad,çalışma saatlerinin inanılmaz düzensiz olması özel yaşama dair en ufak birseyin olmaması. kazanılan hasılatlara oranla maaşların müthiş düşük olması.
bad,Was treated awful. I had a shift lead yell at me so intensely I was scared for my safety and no one stuck up for me. Plus I was the one who got written up. Terrible. Don't work there.
bad,"Management sucks, awful pay, culture is okay, most enjoyable part is going home, worst part is going to work there, very sexist, learned how to multitask very efficiently, but also learned to never trust the management because they say they will help you and they never do. Always cleaning up after own employees messes and work. They training is awful, they hire mostly imbeciles. Never give a heads about promotion, staffing is never what it should be. We are always running short staffed. Its just an awful place to work. DO NOT WORK HERE! Trust me, ive been here for over 2 years and it was the worst decision I have made."
bad,"Very bad work/life balance. Been working there for over a year and a lot change since than. Very unstable and give you no security at all, you can be let go at any time with no reason."
bad,"Starbucks was a terrible place to work. During the time I worked there we were underpaid, chronically over worked, and under staffed."
bad,"Poor organizational management with a transactional relationship between employee and employer."
bad,Very inexperienced managers; poor direction provided to partners. Standards at this store are not what you would expect from Starbucks. Schedules constantly change and they will not give enough hours to live on.
bad,"It would take 3 to 4 months to get our safety bonus checks.They would always tell you, next week, next week, just a bunch of liars. If you have a question. They would just ignore you, not even look up at you."
bad,"I immensely enjoyed Starbucks when I first began there, however, the culture has become increasingly about numbers and sales instead of customer experience. Management micromanages employees to the point of frustration and customers are the ones who suffer. The benefits are decent, but the pay is not commiserate with job requirements and not enough to keep up with the rising costs of living."
bad,The mangers were very disrespectful and the pace was super stressful compared to other jobs.The hardest part of the job was dealing with the disrespectful people.
bad,This was a company that had everything and then lost its soul chasing profit. I worked for company for 11 agonizing years. Everyone knows amazing people work at Starbucks but the toll they endure these days is too much for me anymore. Starbucks customers have devolved into the worst clientele in retail or food.
bad,"had a really bad experience working at this place, staff live in their own world , which is ok, but not when your job is team work based.  would recommend it for a person who is into that , a really mean shift manager who would never spend time correcting mistakes but criticizing with others."
bad,"this company is a decent part time job if you really need to make some extra cash or you are going to school."
bad,"i like to work Starbuck, Because they are good peoples and managers are very nice, you got benefits, when i work at Starbucks i got mark out every weeks and they have flexible hours. Starbucks has a good customer service."
bad,"Starbucks was a fun place to work for about a week or two but after that passes it defiantly becomes a negative environment due to low staff, pressure, and bad scheduling. My old manager would make fun of me constantly, she was extremely immature and bad at keeping the store going and stocked. They also don't take care of their employees and schedule them during school time or times they could not work. Overall would not recommend Starbucks."
bad,"Easy job, management is terrible."
bad,"Starbucks culture is bad, what they say about their culture is not truly, They are not open to externals, coming from outside you are not welcome, very close culture. "
bad,"Management ranges from excellent managers who eventually realize they are too good for the company and leave to terrible managers fired from unrelated companies. Customers are generally the scum of the earth, advancement is impossible."
bad,Worst job I’ve ever had. Poor management system poor communication managers are biased and extremely critical. Have no idea what real life problems are
bad,"A typical day at work was very stressful, demanding and fast paced. I learned how to be a robot and do it their way. They don't want somebody who thinks for themselves. Management there wasn't very good. Didn't know a lot. The workplace culture was like working with a bunch of kids. The hardest part of the job was keeping pace with everything. The most enjoyable part was the customers I met and friends I made."
bad,"You're underpaid, underappreciated, have to deal with customers with insane specifications, usually the shift leaders are okay people but the store managers are universally terrible. I think of the 12 store managers I met, one was an okay person, and the rest were so concerned with holding up the ""starbucks standard"" that they were willing to throw their employees under the bus just to get ahead. I would strongly advise against ANYONE working here, unless you're about to become homeless."
bad,"The manager had no clue what he was doing. He wasn't a leader, and let the staff go without reprimand which led to no call/show multiple shifts per day, because he didn't want employees to be upset with him."
bad,"Lack of communication between manager and employees, no benefits, poor salary, overtime is not always paid. Personally would not recommend to work here."
bad,working at starbucks is trash unless you're white. The customers are so entitled and rude. Open during holidays which I think is horrible as heck. Horrible job overall
bad,Worst job I ever had management is sub standard no idea how to actually run a plant and the caring culture they try to put out to the public is a joke all they care about is themselves and don't go to Human Resources because you will have a target on your back then
bad,"I found this job to be underpaid for the amount of stress a standard barista undergoes. The job itself is not only wrought with very aggressive customers, but management favoritism that I found preventative from advancement."
bad,When I working here it was a dream come true a company I had loved for so long. Yet when I became very ill I was given grief for my illness not to mention my coworkers being rude and mean to me for it. Not to mention when I was let go I have yet to be notified of it.
bad,The company as a whole is great. To be on the floor as a Barista means extremely hard conditions. It does not challenge you mentally or allow for special skills or show passion through your work.
bad,"New management made the plaza go downhill and quick, they have a lack of empathy, and don't really care how many hours you put in that you are not thanked for, underappreciated is why they have such a high turnover rate. Customers are constantly rude to you and the management doesn't help you deal with it, and as more people leave it gets worse and worse for wait times."
bad,"I worked here from 2015 until 2017 and I used to LOVE my job. However, as I moved from one store to another I found that the management/ Starbucks did not really care about their employees. Starbucks will constantly set up polices and procedures, but will always tell you to disregard these to ""make it right for the customer."" However, either way staff seemed to get in trouble. Even when the customers were completely in the wrong, Starbucks does nothing to protect their staff against countless complaints. I would get complaints because people did not like the fact that I did not smile or laugh at their jokes all day and I consistently got in trouble for ""not making it right"" for the customer, even if that meant I was adhering to policy. I met some great people but I hated working for this company."
bad,"When I think of Starbucks, I often think of a great work environment with a diverse staff and a sense of community. This is not the case at all at Starbucks at Macy's.  The staff was rude.There was a dress code only enforced on certain employees and while they promised a certain amount of hours, I was never really put on the schedule . I was not given time to learn and was repeatedly told that I was ""too slow"". I didn't feel very welcomed at all. Not to mention I was randomly thrown  on bar with literally no knowledge of the drinks. I love learning new things, but staff and management made my time there awful!"
bad,"Each starbucks experience will be different. personally i would never work there again. the work life balance is non existent, it is not a professional work environment, you leave everyday stinking, the pay is trash... your feet hurt every single day. it is extremely fast pace and  the customers are rude. the days are long. the only thing about it that isn't terrible are the tips you get each week that hold you over until the next paycheck."
bad,"if you enjoy working 20 hours off the clock just to make ends meet then this is the job for you. "
bad,management wasn't great. He promised me full time hours and only gave me 10 hours a week. He was rude and didn't treat me well.
bad,"I went into my interview September 11 and hired that same day. A week went by, I had not heard one word from my new manager. I finally heard from her October 7. I was finally an employee as fun October 20. "
bad,"Keeping the customer happy and getting them out in timely manner"
bad,"Typical day will start preparing the store to welcoming customers, ensuring cleanliness, food and beverages are stocked up and served to brand standards. Every Friday dress up allows creativity to grow and foster quickly. Training new partners to join the fun and engage customer to achieve sales and profit targets."
bad,"Co-workers could be great... management out of touch with the stores and reality... Low pay, cannot afford the benefits.. Worked close to 40 hours a week, open close, either get home at midnight from closing, or getting up at 2am to open switches 2x a week... Try to have any sort of life, much less sleep, or real food..   lost 25lbs in 6 months and cannot sleep more than 5 hours a night."
bad,"This company has too many loop holes...poor leadership that don't know how to control the business...You got to sleep your way to the top, if you know what I mean!!!"
bad,"Starbucks is interested only in making money.  They don't give a darn about their partners.  Management is a popularity contest.  If you're not your SM's best friend, don't expect to move up."
bad,This company really needs to reevaluate the way it treats its baristas.  They ask waaaaay too much and give waaaay too little.  I would have committed suicide if i was still working for this company five years later.
bad,"COFFEE People, embrace there culture or be harassed without end.  "
bad,"They pay you 9.00 and they squeeze out every penny."
bad,"A typical day can be stressful, I did however learn a lot of skills to take with me. Management is a revolving door, which I found created a very unstable work place. Co workers are like any other co workers some you love and some are more difficult however, this made for a lot of opportunities to develop people skills. The hardest part of the job was repetition, opportunity for growth within the company was most never heard of for those within the company. I meet a lot of really great people on my job and some I could really respect."
bad,"Loved the customer contact level. Overall fun place to work. although management was horrible. The management doesn't listen to the baristas concerns such as; being scheduled outside of ones availability, lack of communication of standards, lack of training, separate expectation of what is expected and probably the most frustrating is that my manager would promise promotions to all the baristas. Because everyone was told they were going to be promoted  this caused people to resent the people who were promoted before them or causing baristas to leave all together due to their frustrations. Which caused a whole different issue of having a high turn over rate and leaving customers and staff to deal with constant new people, who received minimal bar training. It is hard to get higher staff other than baristas to listen and take action towards concerns that come up. No matter how hard you try you will never be good enough. Starbucks Definition: Underpaid, under appreciated, under staffed, overpriced, and overworked."
bad,"Yes, they provide health insurance for even part-time employees, but it is costly. Many part-timers do not participate because they cannot afford it."
bad,"I always worked from 2-10 every day. I didn't mind but getting a day off was the worse thing ever, just because my boss picked favourites. Almost every single worker there was lazy to the point where I did ALL the work (even my supervisor didn't really help). I wasted 8 months with this company."
bad,as shift supervisor i would usually do one of two shifts open up or close the store. a typical day would include dealing with a high volume of customer in a fast paced environment while leading and supervising my team ensuring delivery of exceptional customer service and experience.
bad,the regional manager is very two faced and he plays favorites. management alone is a good reason not to work here
bad,"Management is full of buzz words, and are really fake. Avoid at all costs. Customers are also really rude."
bad,"Starting at Starbucks was wonderful, but it only went downhill from there. I was a barista for one year; in that time it became clear that most of the management truly did not care about their workers and cared much more about looking good for the higher-ups. Company policy was frequently broken to try to force baristas to compensate for shifts they had to call out sick for, either by showing up sick or by finding coverage that often wouldn't be available. Passive aggression was rampant in the workplace."
bad,"Are you a jerk, a snitch, and a brown noser? Just in it for yourself? Willing to screw over coworkers? Starbucks is the employer for you."
bad,everytime i go in i’m on the verge of tears. all of the employees except for like 2 are so rude to me and they never let me off for things i need off for
bad,"Management sucks. Corporate supports managements scandalous, wicked ways. Only reason I didn’t sue is because that would take time I didn’t have.  Hours are given to favorites."
bad,"Çok Güzel Meslek Fakat Bu Şirket Yapmadığınız Hırsızlığın Muamelesini Yapıyor. Düşük Maaş,Egolu Müdürler Ve Saçma Sapan Misafir Kitlesi."
bad,"Terrible place to work.  The only thing good about it is that you get free food and drinks. You will never have to worry about getting fired after the racial incident in 2018. Low pay, overworked, management was terrible. Dealt with the worst customers in my life. Corp/ management only cared about money"
bad,Minors got booked past the legal limit of hours for their age (under 18). You get undertrained and pay constantly changes because full-time is not guaranteed. One week you’ll get 31-35 hours the next 19-21 hours. Its a very fast-pace environment for those who aren’t good in those type or workplaces I would not recommend this job
bad,I went back to Starbucks to go into their SCAP program.  Though I was helped with enrolling into ASU when it came time to reimburse me for my tuition Starbucks never did.  Now I am thousands in the hole with student loans.  My manager consistently gave be below the required hours once I got a full time job because Starbucks does not pay enough to actually afford living in San Diego.
bad,"Working there is fun, management usually always sucks. Good discount, crazy expectations, customers are so rude, managers usually don’t care, never in the store ."
bad,The job was very full on and caused my mental health to get to an all time low. Sacked for being off sick. No adaptions to help me return to work made. Very unfair company & management is poor
bad,"A normal day will involve making drinks, preparing foods, connecting with customers, and preparing for the upcoming shifts. Involves constant time management, as you balance multiple tasks and timelines at once. I learned that, despite being a quiet person, I have a natural ability to connect with people across all walks of life. Workplace culture is largely dependent on a store-by-store basis, your workers will make your time here fun or not. Due to the structure of the company, at times it feels like no matter what you choose to do in a situation, you are set up for failure in some way- it is hard to uphold policies while simultaneously maintaining the ""make the moment"" mantra. The hardest parts of the job include the physical wear of standing/walking for several hours a day, dealing with difficult customers, and making a livable wage. The most enjoyable parts of the job would be genuinely connecting with customers, maintaining positive energy with coworkers, and for me personally, maximizing efficiency upon a set of tasks."
bad,"extremely cliquey environment. if you're not a 25 yr old church go-er, be prepared to feel un welcomed.  very demeaning job, I do not advise anyone to work for this company."
bad,"I dedicated five years of my life to this company - and I was a very conscientious, very hard-working employee. I became seriously ill and was hospitalized for four weeks. I was fired during my hospitalization because I was unable to submit paperwork regarding my leave of absence in a timely fashion. Fired while in the hospital! And the District Manager wouldn't recommend me for rehire. What a slap in the face."
bad,"From what I learned at my 2 1/2 years with the company, there is a lot of talk about the culture that’s supposed to be followed and the companies mission. In the Philadelphia stores you rarely see that actually happening. It’s a nepotistic and hostile environment depending on the manager you end up working with. These situations can cause great stress. It’s a great job in theory I just wish that after the events at 18th and spruce the company came down harder on their managers in Philadelphia concerning bias and the protection of the LGBTQ community."
bad,"Manager is not mentally stable, dysfunctional, narcissistic, and extremely verbally abusive, talks badly about all coworkers. She is currently on probation indefinitely for her poor behavior"
bad,Management shaves time off of the schedule in order to meet their bosses demands but they seldom are around to see what happens with less working hours. Staff struggle to complete tasks in a timely manner in order to leave the store at the designated time after closing. They often show favoritism towards some staff and chose to write up others to use as an example of what is not allowed.
bad,"They only care about profitability, not the employees. Moving up in the company is impossible unless you're a chosen favorite or if you only want to be a store manager."
bad,"When your job is to translate corporates message to the front lines of the company but they lie and don’t fix what they tell their employees they will fix, particularly regarding pay for baristas. I discovered many years worth of time theft from a highly regarded manager and was laughed at when I brought it to the company’s attention. Disgusting."
bad,"Not enough characters"
bad,Very poor working conditions especially in warm weather. Management have very little authority. Lost of pests including flies and wasps. Lack of respect from other members of team
bad,"I worked for them the staff was very clicky and would rather chat than serve customers.Had to be constantly on their case to do cleaning jobs.Would get new people to do jobs that they were quite capable to do but couldn be bothered like fill their area up with stock, afew staff members were hard working but others not.Management came in and all they did was interfer rather than help"
bad,"Not even 3 months into a 6 month contract I was called after leaving I for the day and told I was fired, not to come in the next day to get my stuff and was never given a reason why. Weeks later still no reason ever given. Far too many useless meetings, department mismanaged and disorganized."
bad,"My manager at Starbucks caused so many problems for me. They arent understanding of alot of things. Unorganized. Lazy behind mangers backs. Okay customer service, not up to par. Shows favouritism. Scheduling is a little confusing."
bad,"you'll find that you either will hate the customers or hate the management. Numbers are king here."
bad,I didn’t care for working here. Management was great but the company is awful. I never felt like I was valued as an employee and noticed their supervisor weren’t either.
bad,"OPINIA BYŁEGO PRACOWNIKA Hej, chciałbym się podzielić swoimi doświadczeniami z tą firmą, ponieważ to co przeczytałem na górze jest marketingowo - HRowym wytworem nie mającym nic wspólnego z rzeczywistością. Jeżeli jest to wasza pierwsza praca - idźcie tam na chwilę, max trzy miesiące - uwierzcie mi nauczycie się życia i ciężkiej pracy za najniższą krajową. Pozostałym zdecydowanie odradzam cały AmRest, chyba, że waszymi oczekiwaniami jest bezustanny nacisk na wyniki żeby zrealizować wyssane z palca cele firmy, brak środków na życie nawet przy pełnym etacie oraz praca w ""optymalizacji"" jak to ładnie nazywa firma czyt. tniemy wszystkie koszty na czym się da łącznie z ludźmi. Atmosfera w miarę ok - też zależy na kogo trafisz, gigantyczna rotacja pracowników - sam przepracowałem przez cztery lata w zespole, z którego dziś nie został już nikt. Ogólnie jeżeli się wkręcisz i lubisz pracować z ludźmi powinieneś wytrzymać, inaczej odradzam.

bad,I presented myself as more than qualified to work there and a year later started to have some health issues. Though my managers have said my health comes first I’ve only been treated like I am choosing to be difficult in the workplace when I asked to call an ambulance.
bad,"I wouldn't recommend it, you don't get payed enough for all the labor you do and when you desire hours they are most likely not available. I suggest finding a better job if you're trying to move out."
bad,"Upper management at frys food runs everything and they don't care about you or your life or your existence as a person. I often felt belittled by them and was denied my pay raise after I had 2 written statements saying I would. Which, by the way, they both ""lost"". Let's not forget the many entitled customers that will add to the stress. Half of the staff was amazing and the manager was nice, but in the end, upper management controlled everything and was so rude to me until the very end and even tried to avoid me at times because I would speak up about the unfairness. Also, you get absolutely no benefits, including tips or drinks, like you would at a stand alone starbucks. Please don't work here if you think you'll be treated as a person. Just a warning. Retention rate is so low it's a joke."
bad,"The job is not hard. It is the PEOPLE that make it horrible. It has a high school feel to it because everyone is so cliqued up. The employees are all sensitive and don’t wanna do their jobs. Everybody just kinda lingers through the day and all the hard work falls on the closers. They have gone through three different managers in 8 months. ITS FULL OF FAVORITISM. If you’re not kissing up to management or the people management like, then don’t expect any hours or for them to go hard on your behalf. People get hired on and literally work three shifts before they realize what they’ve gotten themselves into. The pay is ‘okay’. It is definitely not worth the level of stress that comes with it at all."
bad,There has been quite a bit of turnover in upper management these past few years which has resulted in poor operations. Inconsistency in performance management. Based on personal feelings vs actual performance. I had a very dishonest DM who lacked boundaries and acted unprofessionally.
bad,"Honestly Starbucks is an okay job, but I wouldn't recommend this location. The managers don't care about no one's personal well being. They're Disrespectful and rude. The only way you'll like this job is if you're cliquey with the people there (which the people also talks a lot of cramp about you). Another thing is hours. If you're trying to get part-time or full time, I really wouldn't consider this job. The managers are too busy scheduling their ""favorites"" hours while the rest of the staff get barely any hours. Basically the only way the get hours is to kiss a**. If you're someone who would like to work at Starbucks it's really a fun job, but I wouldn't recommend this location AT ALL."
bad,"Starbucks prides themselves on the benefits they offer, but they don’t give the employees enough hours so the expectation is higher than ones ability to fulfill."
bad,"The Starbucks Roasting plant is an experience that is a low bar for the distribution industry. "
bad,"I worked at Starbuck 11 years.  The first 9 were pretty good, but the last 2 in the City of Chicago was a mess.  It became apparent after the April 2018 in Philadelphia debacle, SB did not care about the partners in the Chicago City.  The Homeless people took over and made it a dangerous place to work."
bad,"Fast paced company.  The customers for the most part we easy to get along with.  No room for advancement.  To many differences between districts (Ottawa East and West).  The company needs to align its standard between district manager/company expectations.  "
bad,"The attendance policy is ridiculous. They work you to death, especially over the holiday period. It is very physical, heavy work and you are monitored for your “numbers” for packing and pallet building. The floor training is poor and is now often performed by temp workers. Unless you go part time (you can always work full time hours but not be required to work 20+ hours of ot a week like full time) one of the supervisors showed his appreciation for us by stating, “Theres always other people we can hire.” Which is true, I went back after a hiatus and most everyone I worked with had been fired. They fire so many people, that they dont even respond to unemployment. It would be a great place to work if they could scale back the overtime and give a longer lunch break. The lunch items are expensive and there is limited microwaves for the amount of people working. They do provide free starbucks coffee and juices. They have amazing benefits but distribution is very overworked and the turn over is ridiculous."
bad,"I learned how to make various drinks in busy times, while still providing great customer service. If you are interested in how coffee is made in a starbucks, this is the right place to start."
bad,The people who work there are the type to be nice to your face and talk about you and stab  you in the back the first chance they get. I worked there for 2 years and at the end it was best to leave. I left with no friends when I thought of everyone as family until the last month I worked there and found out how everyone really was.
bad,Working at starbucks started off with no proper training. As i worked there i kept getting the feeling of people trying to push each other out of a job.
bad,"Working with a company that doesn’t know the separation of work and home life, always tried to make everything personal. Never actually cared for the mentality of the partners there and never focused on the actual standards of workplace, working 40hrs a week because understaffed and not scheduling enough partners for the day"
bad,....just lost for words ................I feel disrespected by manager and dm . And the hire ups at this company treat people like garbage  . Lies about growth and promotion
bad,"Hourly colleagues were taken care of and rewarded well. If this is your intention, it is a good company. "
bad,Management does not allow you to grow within the company. They would rather hire externally. Starbucks does not offer enough hours for full time. Maximum of 15 hours per week per full time employee.
bad,your experience depends on the store.  though starbucks is going downhill on the corporate side.  it's stressful and not enough pay for the amount of work you're expected to do
bad,"This store is completely disorganized, management is unable to work with other schedules. Management is unstable and unaware of how to run a small buisness. Starbucks is supposed to be a fun and welcoming environment, this store is none of such. Would not recommend you aren’t guaranteed to keep your job."
bad,"Starbucks was a terrible company to work for. The management was disorganized and unprofessional, the job was unreasonably stressful and fast-paced, and pay was abysmal."
bad,"Poor leadership, poor communication and planning on part of external hires, their training and post training. As an external manager hired you're hired with what feels like 2 strikes against you. hypocritical in their core values and culture. upper management will always take the words and side of a tenured barista who is 8 years into community college over an experienced external hire because and I quote ""they know our culture more than you"" even without any validation."
bad,"My particular location has many problems with mismanagement and the mistreatment of the employees. Hostile work environments are rampant and the management staff look the other way. Lunch breaks are often overlooked, forgotten, or not scheduled. Issues brought to HR are passed over or told to be given the benefit of the doubt."
bad,"When you get a bad manager, they never leave. No matter what you do. And they chase out all the good employees. That is the reason I am leaving and I am the 7th one in two months."
bad,"angry customers, terrible management. they force you to work when you're sick. it's just awful. too fast paced, and they take coffee waaaaay too seriously"
bad,"Good for a first job, but I would not ever count on staying at a job that is so demanding. As a store manager, the culture requires you to appease the baristas to a point where you can't hold them accountable because if someone quits because the job demands are too tough (which happens often) then you don't have the time or resources to get shifts covered and it takes  months for someone to train."
bad,"This company claims to care about its employees, but is only concerned with selling products. You spend far too much time cleaning drains and not nearly enough time focusing on customer interaction."
bad,A lot of lifting and dirty work cleaning roasters. They don't know what lifting  ergonomically is.  Management and Hr reward people who kiss there butt and don't care that your a good worker.  HR and Supervision sweep important issue under the rug and don't take care about it. They  lack respect for your time off or family life. They force you to work with one day notice.
bad,I guarantee that the worst job you've ever had is heaven compared to Starbucks. I could go on for hours about that craphole but I have to find a job so.
bad,"A company that is quickly changing from a place someone could actually make a career and enjoy their job, to a place that hires cheap high school workers so they can save a few bucks."
bad,"Not sure where to start. I thought I was embarking on a job with a company that would offer a solid future.  Health benefits and vacation days have no meaning if you can never get a day away from the store!  The store I was assigned to was in horrid condition with a drive-thru that repeatedly shut down, a broken safe that wouldn't open, broken water dispensers and faucets, electrical issues - I could go on.  One of the worst issues was repeated flooding from floor drains in the prep areas. It was an issue that I identified for over a year and yet the company would not address. My partners would be working a high volume cafe/drive-thru sloshing around in 3-4 inches of water and still the DM and RM would not let me close the store. Starbucks is an extremely abusive company.  Lots of promises with almost no follow-through.  It's really all take and no give.  Sad to have to learn this the hard way."
bad,Our store was really disorganized and there is no management. The pay is not enough to support oneself. The hours are long and I was consistently asked to work over hours. There was not much of an effort to give good customer service.
bad,"nothing but fun  the quality of the coffee is not the best how it,s supposed to be, bad experience."
bad,"Welll my store is a fast pace location, we are normally short staff and theres always someone calling out. I over work for just a few cents more than the minimum wage. I feel like the management at my store is really bad, its always so stressful."
bad,"Way too stressful for how little we got paid, if you're at all interested in actual coffee education the ""education"" in place is so limited and you're bound to get frustrated because it's such a big company they don't really care about that at all anymore, just selling as many frappuccinos and frozen sandwiches as they can and keeping drive thru numbers as high as possible.  It's all basically just a glorified drive thru ice cream shop at this point."
bad,I had a poor time at Starbucks  I worked there nine months I was not well trained unfortunately. I was supposed to be full time but never received full time hours. My manager let me go then told everyone that I quit 🤔 Just tell them that you let me go no big deal. Sometimes people are not the right fit. Anyway I only worked at a small StarBucks so I don’t know what the whole company culture is I don’t think it’s fair to rate the whole company by my one store but I don’t want to go back either. I think that we just were not a good fit for each other. But I like their products and still buy them.
bad,The management was poor. They were rude and didn't care about me at all. I was hired to be a manager but told after I started they weren't going to do that anymore.
bad,Did not enjoy the culture of the company as so many claim they do. I just plain and simple did not fit in. I enjoyed the people I worked with but the advancement at Starbucks was not the direction I wanted to take my career.
bad,"Long and hard days "
bad,"For their size, success, and reputation as a great place to work, it came as an unpleasant surprise that parts of the Starbucks HQ is so poorly run. If you've worked almost anywhere else in the last 10 years, working at Starbucks will make you feel like you've fallen into a technology time warp of some kind -- archaic software, stagnant, inefficient processes, key applications that don't talk to other key applications, and (some) people in leadership positions who either don't understand why these things are problems or don't care. "
bad,"Flexible they switched me from 2nd shift to first shift."
bad,"You have to remember that this is a licensing store so everything is really different. You have multiple managers who want you to do everything different, you have to usually close or open alone which sucks, only good thing was the people I worked with"
bad,"management is horrible at every level. I was with Starbucks for several years and had many store managers and district managers and each one was just as bad, if not worse, as the one before. The employees are treated like trash, and not valued whatsoever."
bad,"Starbucks was a company that was worth working for, once upon a time. They set themselves apart from other fast-food chains with a focus on customer experience and employee benefits."
bad,"I will not recommend to anyone who is looking for along term career at Starbucks. "
bad,My managers treat me in a very unprofessional manner. I feel as though I am always under personal attack. I've experienced retaliation when trying to resolve this.
bad,The recent shift in management to those whom even MS did not want anymore has left a massive hole of mediocrity within the corporate office.  Barista's are overworked as are many managers while the amount of VP's has grown yet have very little positive impact on the morale or day to day operations.  Very unfortunate that Starbucks no longer seems to want employees to be courageous and speak up unless it's about diversity and even then it really just feels like lip service by so many.
bad,the most stressful job I've ever had. The management is very poor and I have never felt valued or important to the company. Although it was enjoyable to be a barista and the social aspect was good. the company itself is not  one id want to work for again
bad,"Managers were non-stop picking at minute details and reprimanding employees, causing a very stressful work environment. Everyone was afraid of the higher ups, which should never be the case."
bad,"I worked for Starbucks for over 10+ years, and it was the worst experience I've ever had.  The expectations for front line employees are not realistic, too little labor allowed on floor with too much work assigned.  Starbucks District Managers are hit or miss, have a competent one, and work life balance will be just ok.  If you are unlucky like me, you will get a DM who is grossly incompetent, lazy, gives preferential treatment to his/her favorite managers, and has completely forgotten what it is like to manage a store from a front line employee perspective, giving himself/herself a false sense of reality and what can be done on a daily basis.  I have spoken to many peer managers, both current and past, and the consensus is that those that stay are there out of necessity, and those that are no longer there like me, count it as a blessing.  Run as fast as you can and do not drink the company cool aid!  You will have little work life balance, poor job applicant pool, biased District Managers who will make your career progression difficult to impossible, and a unsupportive local and national employee relations department.  RUN AWAY."
bad,"I've been with Starbucks for almost two years. My personal store is the bustiest in my city, being the first Bux off the highway for miles. It's extremely fast paced, almost always understaffed. Being both a counselor for people and their barista is the worst, because we are a lot of the times a kicking post for a plethora of customers. People take out their frustrations on anyone in an apron, but with corporate practically patting people on the back for calling and telling them about their ""bad experience"" , it opens up a whole new level of complaints. Just like at a restaurant, people will say absolutely anything and everything to get something for free, or to get drinks for less than their advertised price."
bad,no work life blance . You have to be management favourite otherwise they don't develop you  and your role. after spending 10y I will say they are mine company
bad,"While I enjoyed being a barista, the cons of working at Starbucks strongly outweighed the pros. Customers are welcomed to act as obnoxious as possible, and management refused to be flexible with my work schedule, despite attending college. I had more overlapping shifts than I could count. I was constantly closing the store, and then opening the very next morning, even though we had a full staff. When I addressed my concerns, I was simply told to ""get used to it."""
bad,"Pay is bad and so is the management but it provides you with job security. I worked there for several years and became used to the work environment. They were always understaffed, one worker would have to serve dozens of people within a shift by themselves. Workers have to beg to get their break because of the lack of coverage."
bad,"I worked in the Houston Downtown tunnels which was very hectic. Only break we really got was lunch hours. Management there wasn't too great.. We had different managers coming in and out of the company. Met great people working there, costumers and my co-workers were great!"
bad,Although Starbucks promotes itself as a partner loving company who keeps its employees happy and healthy I know from first hand experience it does not. They gave us pay raises just to cut our hours. The health care they provide is not good quality. Most health care providers advice against their insurance companies. The management is very poor. I have worked at several different locations and they all have the same problem. The managers that they have do not care about their stores. They are too passive and do not enforce the rules. They take things personally rather than keeping things professional. They hire people who do not show up to work or do not work hard. They are very slow to fire people who do not show up. When you call partner contacts you are singled out even if you try to remain anonymous. It is a very unhealthy work environment. I do not recommend this company. The only good thing is I get overpaid to make a cup of coffee.
bad,"if you want to hang out and have fun with friends, this is the job for you. if you want to better yourself and work hard, this inst the job for you."
bad,Management was fine with people taking drugs at work and was extremely rude. If you had a problem you would not get any help. I would not reccomend working here unless you have a good manager
bad,"Cineworld is all about stirring and poor lazy management this includes Starbucks. I moved into there as thought it might be better some of the supervisors just so lazy and barely do any work and sit on there arses. Ran very poorly and rubbish training, they certainly promote the wrong staff aswell. I would not recommended this to anyone unless you wanna be be on ani depression tablets like most staff there who work hard and those few supervisor that achully do work."
bad,I was a manager working for company but working on the university side . I thought coming to corp would great and it has not been the best quality experience. You work so hard but get payed less  Great Company On Paper But Don't take care of Staff from A financial Point View
bad,"I would never recommend anyone applying to work at Starbucks. Other than the pro's I listed below there is no good reason I could ever give anyone to work there. It is ok to steal tips from your partners, and product from the store.  Just be sure all tattoo's are covered and you take out your peircings."
bad,The company manipulates you and your life. Gordon retail only offers benefits listed to MANAGEMENT not baristas or supervisors. They do not care about their employees only their sales and themselves. Try corporate locations over them anyday! The job itsself Is wonderful and fun that particular franchise is AWEFUL and the management team does NOT support there supervisors unless you are their best friend!
bad,"At this location and a few surrounding stores as well. There is a need for an entire management revamp. For starting pay $8.15/hour with minimal weekly tips it's not worth the aggravation. You are overworked, underappreciated and have no work/ personal life balance. On  top of being mistreated by the manager you are also on a daily occasion berated by a few customers in a demeaning manner.Which would make sense as to why there is such a high turnover rate in this particular store. I would strongly advise seeking employment elsewhere. You will not regret it."
bad,A normal work day at starbucks consist of me being on a shift by myself . generally depending on your shift we have certain routines we must follow . Im generally asisting guest . Training ne w team members or stocking shelves.
bad,The issue I had for this company was that people were scheduled poorly. there was never enough coverage on the busiest of days. Management definately lacked.
bad,"Hard work, high expectations, no managerial support, unreliable."
bad,"I regularly worked over 40 hours per week because the store manager refused to hire enough people to cover the shifts. She then decided to only work one day per week, while the rest of the management team had to work 6-7 days every week. The co-workers were a bunch of back-stabbers and were always gossiping about something. It is definitely not a place to work if you are out of high school and are looking for a career."
bad,"Not a fan of this company at all. Got laid off my first day back to work after my son was born. Either you're into the culture of Starbucks or you're not. Very cult-like atmosphere. As a manager you work shifts where you aren't in control and your subordinates tell you what to do, very strange management structure. For such a large company the compensation isn't great at all. They offer a ""total pay package"" with other partner benefits as a smoke screen for actual monetary compensation. What I mean is that they include your free coffees or beverages on your shift and the free pound of coffee (or tin of tea) you get every week as overall compensation, meaning their rate of pay is a lot less. Their bonuses pay about every quarter and as a SM your lucky if that's a few hundred dollars. So for such a powerful company they really undervalue their ""partners""."
bad,I worked at a Starbucks in Owen Sound - the one location they have - for four months and can easily say they are the most unprofessional staff I have ever worked with. I barely learned how to make drinks properly due to the lack of training and attention afterwards. The management relied heavily on verbal feedback from other baristas in order to know anything the store and its employees. They preached about inclusion and caring about mental health but were the exact reason mine depreciated. Would not work at that location again.
bad,Starbucks is what you’d expect a fast paced environment where speed is more prioritized than quality. Which in many cases is a benefit to many of our customers who just need caffeine. The flexibility is the only upside.
bad,treat you. very unfair if your new they always on you if you don't learn how to make drinks fast management is a joke they say they help with work life balance but they jump down your throat when you miss a day due to health reasons
bad,The standards of the company and the way they look after staff has continuously dropped year after year. No real benefits working for the company for the coffee industry unless it is just for the more premium wage p/h.
bad,"To begin, it is not the pace is wonderful. I quite enjoy the chaos and the rush. "
bad,"High turnover, staffing shortages makes for long waits and unhappy customers. Unhappy Customers giving staff a hard time for things that cannot be controlled other than management. Not worth the stress and the little pay."
bad,"Shartbucks’  upper management, (District,SM,ASM,SS) whatever the role may be at this point has completely lost site of which direction they need to be Steering...Corporate big wigs that sit behind a desk all day and call shots not knowing anything that gos on in the trenches continue to send out ideas that make the simplest job feel like your literally running into a brick wall over and iver"
bad,"The managers are nasty, they don’t make you feel like you can approach them. They speak to you as if you are stupid yet when they need something they are super nice. If they have it out for you your hours will be in jeopardy.."
bad,"You’re better off not going in to this job, you deal with a lot of unwanted stress. At first it seems okay when they’re training you and then once you’re done training, is when stuff hits the fan."
bad,Starbucks has many wonderful ideas. The problem is they only work in theory. It is next to impossible to advance unless you just so happen to be in the right place at the right time. My direct store manager is amazing and I felt terrible leaving them when I did. I had to leave for my mental health due to the stress of upper management and ridiculous write up policies. They take customers completely at their word and dont allow the barista to defend themselves
bad,I loved working for Starbucks until I worked at a store in Kentucky. The manager was verbally abusive and didn’t care about the partners there. Multiple calls to partner contact center and HR by multiple partners and they did nothing
bad,"While the overall company and the benefits it provides are outstanding, the day-to-day in-store work is (subjectively) not worth the stress endured. In my almost-six-year tenure with the company, management was disorganized and often absent. Because of this there was minimal communication between day and night shifts, which led to a division among the employees. Many policies were not followed, the store was constantly out of pivotal ingredients, shifts were understaffed in an attempt to cut labor-cost but only served to put more pressure on underpaid workers. Management also consistently kept on unreliable and under-performing employees in an effort to maintain an appearance of low-turnover. All-in-all, my experience at my store was akin to being in an abusive relationship - it was physically and emotionally taxing and wore away not only on my own well-being, but those of my coworkers."
bad,"A good job if you need benefits. Otherwise, do something else. Demanding, stressful, not enough pay. Management sucks, no presence from upper management."
bad,Don’t get your hopes up they will never promote from within and all upper mgmt acts like you are all Mice chasing the cheese . Then drop the ball on your promotion when it’s supposed to happen
bad,"Very unorganised company, have to provide own uniform, very poor pay, haven't even been asked for proof of I.D to prove I can work in the uk. Or for pay details and my p45 from previous employer. Wouldn't recommend."
bad,"-false promises surrounding advancement"
bad,"I liked my job for the first year and then over 80% of the staff changed, including management. I wasn’t fond of my new co workers. They broke many of the standards and shamed me for following standards."
bad,"This is a great job for high school/college students or anyone who doesn't need money to support themselves. Otherwise, it's not really worth it. You are poorly compensated, you get yelled at by people when they have a bad day, and not only does corporate not understand this, but they encourage entitled behavior from their customers."
bad,The corporation is more concerned with their image than how their partners are treated. The discount is nice but not for the stuff you deal with on a daily basis.
bad,"- Training was treated like a joke, I am now district level trainer and Starbucks' training is a horrible joke. "
bad,"This place sucks. The management sucks, the job culture sucks, the customers suck, and the employees suck. Nobody cares about actually doing there job. Management is disorganized and unfair to your needs. The benefits are the only good thing about working the company."
bad,Extremely stressful job. Not enough emphasis on the partners. Too much emphasis on quantity not quality.Higher ups and management absolutely backstabbing!
bad,"There were several managers that went out of their way to abuse and exploit their power and authority during the time that I worked there, even going so far as to dismiss very serious familial issues I had to deal with during my employment there. Overall left feeling very insignificant and morose."
bad,all my coworkers & i talk about how this job is eating our souls we wanna die. the only positive i can think of is that ur fellow coworkers tend to be really accepting & will use ur preferred pronouns/name.
bad,"Typical day can be very taxing, considering the volume of your store. Labor is tight, so even slow stores are grossly understaffed. I learned that they sell you something they can't provide. Incident with inappropriate staff conversations the first day. My manager wanted me out after I was injured, due to working to fast in an understaffed environment. They try with culture, but fail. Every Sunday I was subjected to group prayer and Christian music. The worst part, I now have a permanent disability because of my time at Starbucks. The one positive thing, pay was SO good I was able to pay off all my debt and buy a new car!"
bad,I didn't like working there verses the fact the interview was amazing. Help start that company up was intriguing I just think they lost the point of their mission target. What experience we're suppose to be for the guest. Very over priced and not at all a repeat place to visit
bad,"if you want to keep your sanity don’t work here . the manager madeline(lacantera san antonio location) is the worst manager EVER . the things that they require for a single shift as a lead is absolutely ridiculous especially when your manager gives you no coverage EVER and you have to squeeze in time for a lunch break, a milk count, inventory count, temps, safe and toll counts . it’s ridiculous"
bad,i never wanted to be a barista but that was my last resort. when i got there it was cool and i was nervous since it was a lot going on. the manager messed up my pay check and confront the manager but she said i was a liar so i let that slide. i didn’t like the job overall because how the manager was using favoritism and treated me wrong. nobody really liked me there so i had to leave sadly.
bad,Working for HMShost in Rhode Island sucks. Don’t apply. Workers do not know how to work together and bad management team. It’s good money but not worth your sanity.
bad,"When I was barely starting out, people kept assuming that I knew everything yet it has only been my first month in. As a barista. I needed more training not judgement and harassment from other partners to ""hurry up"" "
bad,"It is hard to explain in detail how awful my experience working at Starbucks was. It may have only been my store, but hearing the experiences from my coworkers who have worked multiple locations, I highly doubt it. Starbucks overworks its 'partners' and still tries to come out as a company that takes care of their employees. In my five months working there, I saw most of my coworkers have at least one break down from the pressure. So many of my coworkers would be working extended hours and STILL be struggling to make a living wage. Other coworkers couldn't get enough hours, even though we were constantly understaffed.  We never had enough people and were expected to do more and more, without more financial compensation. Doing extra, staying to cover shifts, coming in on days off, was simply not enough; and you were treated as disposable. The customers are entitled, and expect perfection; as Starbucks has convinced them they deserve nothing less. And while everyone deserves quality, employees are still human and need to be allowed the space to make mistakes when they happen. The only good thing I can say was I liked the people I worked with. My shift managers and fellow baristas were awesome and appreciative of effort. My manager, my stand-in manager when the first got fired, and my district manager left much to be desired. Absolutely no appreciation for their 'partners.' If you can afford to work anywhere else, please do. This job is not worth the emotional strife."
bad,"If you haven't considered suicide by the end of your first week at Starbucks, then there's something wrong with you."
bad,The company as a whole promotes everything within the company that it claims it doesn't support. Very judgemental and racist cultured. I had two Managers that shouldn't have been hired but due to their sexual orientation they became Management.
bad,Super click style in every area baristas managers if they don’t like you your gone. Speak up your gone. Act out in any way your job will be eliminated
bad,"*Please note that is applies to the outbound DC side of this plant.*"
bad,I came to Starbucks following on the footsteps of the books written by its CEO. All I at was nothing of what was written in the books. It is a comfortable life for upper management while everyone else runs with its head chipped off.
bad,"I was with Starbucks for over a decade. The company at one time really was a great place to work. They are now riding off of their reputation and luring everyone with benefits. Once your in, they ask you to complete an unreasonable amount of work-with little to no labor to do it. They do not support development and it honestly feels like if you don’t drink the kool-aid you will never get anywhere. The company has created extreme monsters in customers and even though they claim to be a “safe place” it is anything but. In metropolitan areas the manager and staff deal with verbal and physical abuse daily. We were told to pick up hypodermic needles and deal with extreme drug use. We had zero support and were told we were being sensitive and not supportive of the community when we raised concerns. This company is great if you want free education and great benefits but they will expect you to sell your soul for it. Some of the best people I have ever met work at Starbucks and it’s just too bad this is the direction the company is going."
bad,"I loved Starbucks at first, I was happy and loved making the drinks. Now I am just miserable and constantly on edge, have anxiety because I am constantly worrying if we are behind target or we have lots of waste for the day. If we are quiet, we HAVE to send people home meaning their pay is cut short. I lost out on £300 ish one month because we were super quiet. I feel like partners aren’t looked after. I was a supervisor and was constantly trying to motivate my team or make them feel wanted and valued. Sometimes this worked and other times they didn’t care. Customers are rude and exaggerate complaints which then get you investigated. Customers expect you to be able to serve and make the drink within about 30 seconds. When things go wrong, higher management expect you to fix it. Once we were delivered 90 boxes of food by accident but somehow this was our fault?? And we have to throw it all away. "
bad,DO NOT WORK FOR STARBUCKS! I think that the culture doesn't reflect the values or mission statement. Store Manager are allowed no work life balance. The store structure does not allow for any personal time outside of Starbucks
bad,"I'm sure there are some places that have better work environments but the area I am in is incredibly stressful and a hot mess. My manager under-staffs and over burdens the night crew and pushes his work tasks off on others while reaping the reward of salary from his comfortable couch at home. The new baristas are never trained properly and generally staffed in the evening when we really need skilled people the most. If a customer becomes abusive it's your fault, even if you tried to go above and beyond to help them. We've had several really bad altercations at my location and instead of worrying about the safety and health of the baristas, my manager scolded us and made us retake training that basically told us what we did was correct despite his admonishings. You get written up for the slightest things and I'm fairly certain most of them aren't legitimate reasons to write people up (ie a partner spelled her name in her native language and she was written up even though the customers found it beautiful and it sparked a good conversation starter). I was supported by other store managers and several shifts to become a shift myself, but have been repeatedly been denied promotion. A shift at our store asked about moving up to be an ASM years ago and the manager told her he'd help her. In that time he's promoted several others under the both of us to higher level positions (to which they have either left or stepped down from) and recently kept an ASM interest meeting from the other partner. He told her he didn't feel she was right for the job. She's worked at Starbucks far longer"
bad,"Great if you are a student or looking to pick up a few shifts to make some easy money. Hours are usually flexible and work is easy."
bad,Did not enjoy working for people that did not respect or acknowledge my worth. Heavy divide between baristas and supervisors/management. Would not recommend.
bad,"Wasn't the best place that I worked at , management wasn't the best. I did appreciate the employees that helped me along the way. Workplace didn't live up to it's "" standard ."""
bad,"I worked at Starbucks inside a Safeway building. At the time of employment I was given the rundown on all of the things I was forbidden to do. I had to take my plugs, and nose ring out; I was made to cover my silver hair with a hat, as well as my tattoo with a mandatory black long sleeve shirt. I did as they required but it was quite constricting, and made working in the summertime quite miserable. The job itself was quite difficult as there were a ton of rules. You couldn't eat or drink anything while you were on the floor, which in the end, is why i quit this job. I was pregnant with my first baby, and they would treat me unkind whenever I felt sick, and needed to take a drink of water. My manager made it a very uncomfortable working situation, and eventually urged me to quit."
bad,"This job is not worth it. They don't pay enough for their workers to live and their management and training methods are lacking and dangerous. Rather be at Mcdonalds, at least there, you're paid the right amount for the service you provide. Here, you work hard, get yelled at by customers, and get poorly trained, and for what? Just minimum wage. Do yourself a favor, see if literally, anyone else is hiring."
bad,The district level management doesn't value loyal partners.  I worked faithfully for this company for over eleven years and I was not treated with respect. I did not feel valued for the work the I did everyday to make a third place for my customers and my partners.
bad,"staff were so rude to me as the newbie, treated me like I was mud and never cared about me. were never accepting of personal reasons for lateness and I would never work for Starbucks again"
bad,"This is a shocking business, they treat staff with little respect. They expect you to be able to do hours that you said you couldn't do in your initial interview, to which they agreed."
bad,"When I started Starbucks at a grand opening at a new location, I expected the best of this summer job but the management was disorganized. The schedules were wrong most of the time and my  hours were all over the place, not to mention all the infighting on the team. It was stressful and at best my manager was uncaring."
bad,It started off pretty good but the company has changed in many ways since I started. Its becoming more fast food oriented rather than focused on the craft and customers.
bad,"Starbucks was the worst place that I have ever worked. Workers are expected to get coffees out of the drive through window in less than 40 seconds, but we're also expected to connect with customers."
bad,"You have to deal with customers who want a Venti Iced chai tea latte with half a Splenda, 2 sweet and lows, half soy half almond milk, 4 ice cube, and foam on top even tho it’s iced, and 25 pumps of white mocha, then some will come back through and get upset/cause scenes because it wasn’t made right. It makes you feel extremely low in the food chain and management will not stand up for you in any circumstances."
bad,"Everything and everyone at this company is COMPLETELY expendable and replaceable and everyone knows it. Starbucks has created its own consumer base rather than access an existing one, which causes them to have no need to retain partners long-term. Training is a joke, ""benefits"" are a joke excepting their ASU program, and management is incredibly weak. I am abused by my bosses, overworked, underpaid. In Denver, Colorado, Starbucks baristas make the least of any fast food place. Working 35 hours a week (it's impossible to get scheduled for more), baristas can make a maximum of about $1,200/month. With rent outside the Denver metro area being a minimum of $600 dollars, if you're paying off a car at $200/month, you're left with $400 to spend on insurance, phone bills, food, clothes and hygeine, and other expenses."
bad,"Poor management and responsiveness to employees, people routinely overworked. Scheduled outside their availability. Asked to work completely unpredictable shifts, placating management that doesn't actually do anything."
bad,The experience of an average employee at starbucks largely depends on the district manager and the store manager. the experience can thus be either negative or positive depending on the capabilities of either person
bad,When I first started I loved my job with my own team when a new manger came everything changed he only wanted to bring in his friends and people that he know to work and he took our hours so I was only working 20 hours a week
bad,"Never enough staff, always dirty and gross, everyone is rude and in a foul  mood all the time. At least one person cry’s a day. Customers have been known to throw hot coffee in your face. I was verbally abused by many customers, my shift supervisors never helped us clean or do anything. They only made drinks and told us to take our breaks and counted cash at the end of the night. Never helped clean. Everyone is always In a bad mood and will take it out on you. Even if you do your job perfectly, they will find a way to complain about you. Also a lot of drama and backstabbing."
bad,"Starbucks was a very interesting experience. some good benefits... But the benefits did not out weigh the people that worked there. Everyone seemed to just care about them selves and would basically get anyone fired if it meant they wouldn't get in trouble. The people from my Starbucks would talk in front of customers about how they hated them and other workers instead of working, it was always someone else who was the problem. "
bad,Upon hiring very little training is provided. Unorganized. Customers during the club hours can be very rude and even violent. Multiple employees always late or absent from shift.
bad,"The company wasn't so bad until the new CEO took over office. A typical day (depending on the location) involves understaffing, unorganized and unenforced policies, poor management and poor training. The benefits offered are good"
bad,It was a very negative environment. They give you a list of things to do to get done by the end of your shift but you can´t get it done because of how busy you are. The shifts are pretty much by yourself on the busiest days.
bad,"Working at Starbucks was mainly fast paced and very low pay. I could not afford much on the salary as a single mother and was not happy most of the time with the manager that was chosen during my 2 years at Starbucks. I loved the people I worked with, but we did lack people most days and people were not held accountable for not showing up and not calling ahead incase they were going to be a little late."
bad,Everyday going to work felt like going to high school. I was going to mistreated by my coworkers. So at the end of everything i switched to working nights but still i had people coming to me telling me all the poor things my coworkers and general manager would say about me.
bad,making drinks was fun. people sucked. hated cleaning. didnt like the shift lead. nasty people. annoying drinks. starbucks is annoying. i wont work there again
bad,My Starbucks experience was excellent up until about a year into my tine there. Management is terrible at the location I was at. And the culture was much worse. Pay was ok but no hours were available. The only reason I stayed so long was because of my coworkers
bad,"Would never go back here, could have possibly been the specific store I worked for, but they treated me poorly, insulted me, made me feel like complete butt for getting something wrong when you're just learning everything. it's a complete information overload for the first month and it doesn't help not being positively encouraged to do better. You're more or less treated like a slave. I even had customers witness how I was personally treated and they gave the ""oh my gosh that was completely uncalled for"" look when I was belittled in front of everyone."
bad,"It’s a great job with great benefits if you don’t try to move up. When you move up, there’s a lot of back stabbing and pettiness and if you’re about working hard, that won’t pay off."
bad,i loved the over all experience learning how to mix different coffee and expresso drinks. Either cold or hot. it was a great experience.I really liked the job because i love coffee
bad,If you have a good Manager you will be somewhat   happy but corporate does not have your back. be careful who you trust get things in writing. you could end up training other barista without compensation.
bad,"There are a lot of good people at Starbucks. The managers, supervisors and baristas all though an incredible job at keeping the brand strong. However, since Amsric took over and made our store a franchise, it has been harder and harder to work for the company."
bad,"One of the worst professional experiences I've ever had to encounter.  Unprofessional, unsupportive, abusive, and not to mention discrimination management!"
bad,They dont care about you. Management sucks they never have a good schedule.always missing someone.Manager sits in the back on the phone. take all day to do dishes so you dont have the right tool to do your job
bad,"I loved my job and the customers I regularly got, however, the management is atrocious. If you want your manager to gossip about you with the supervisors and visa virsa then that's the job for you. Granted I'm sure not every store was the same as mine, however, I can't ignore the fact that they are manipulative and pushed me out a job I loved so much. On the flip side, the pay was good, especially at a younger age. Hours were very bipolar, some weeks way more hours than I could do and the next week virtually none."
bad,"As many customer service and food service businesses go, Starbucks employs mainly college-aged people. With this group, there is always bound to be drama, and I experienced cliques that my manager knew about and did nothing to solve."
bad,"It was not a great job. It was great at first, but all Price Chopper cares about is their bottom line. They do not care about the customers or employees."
bad,"This company does not value their mission. They do not respect nor honor the longevity  and loyalty of their employees, cares more about labor than great customer service."
bad,"Typical day at work is preparing hot and cold beverages making customers feel welcome and happy, deep cleaning duties  I enjoy been part off a team and am very willing to learn new things the hardest part off my job is the fact the store doesn't have a manager at the minute so ordering and stuff is always wrong"
bad,"My work day started at four a.m. and often did not end until six or seven p.m."
bad,Got worked too hard for the amount of pay received. Lack of professionalism and leadership. Company only cares about higher level management not baristas who do all the work.
bad,"Starbucks has been hiding behind a shroud for years now that they still care about their employees but just like fast food, they don't want to pay well, you have to deal with really bad customers and corporate hires district managers that know nothing about the company and take steps that inhibits production and development. They also  have unrealistic expectations on sale output."
bad,"great for college, but really doesn't pay you enough for your time. I would say the benefits are good but the current health care system is ruining that. Best part was the flexibility while I was in college but it seems they are getting more and more demanding there as well. "
bad,"trabajo hace 4 años, y cada año es peor, menos sueldo y mas carga laboral, Starbucks se convirtió en empresa dedicada a vender y los clientes son números, cero preocupación por sus trabajadores. El buen ambiente lo crean los mismos baristas, eso es irreemplazable, se conocen buenos amigos, sin embargo no quita la mala calidad de la empresa durante los años que han pasado. mucho foco en la venta y la meta, poco foco en el incentivo al trabajador, hace tres años habría recomendado Starbucks como buen lugar para trabajar por los compañeros de trabajo que se conocen, hoy en día... Mejor otro lugar... la paga sigue siendo mala."
bad,"Poor leadership on every level, poor technology, roadblocks to success at every turn, complete chaos at every busy store, poor coffee quality, gimmick-driven marketing, incompetent management, overextended corporate oversight, poor training programs, and unrealistic metric targets."
bad,It is not place to work if you have children. They play favoritism. Management sucks. They do not care if you are being harrased by a higher up or not. They will sweep the problem under the rug and pretend as if it never happened. They do not care about what your availibility is they will schedule you out of it. There is no such thing as accountability you can get away with anything. They don't fire anyone and if you are a manager rules don't apply to you.
bad,"The managment is not supporting the team at all to develop,"
bad,"Team effort therefore baristas who don't know as much get the same amount of money you do, but work but less and don't have to try. Hours are terrible unless you free up your entire schedule, gives the illusion of flexibility, smart by Starbcuks. They set unreal expectation which can only be achieved with a team of experienced baristas, but the turnover rate is insane. Overall not very pleased."
bad,"Starbucks may seem like an attractive place to be, but was overall a rough experience for me. Minimum wage, rough hours, lack of respect for employees, lack of sleep (due to the late hours, etc.) among other things make the job not a worthwhile career. The high turnover rate was extremely discouraging. "
bad,Depending on the manger it can be a great job or a nightmare. Never good enough results. You can bust your butt  and they will be like thats great but we want better. Never satisfied
bad,I worked here for a year before I found out I was pregnant. I was treating so poorly and given the worst jobs and hours while being pregnant. I was given grief everyday about being pregnant. I had to wait 6 WEEKS AFTER going on short term disability(I went into early labor and was put on bed rest) to get ANY pay from them.
bad,Beware it's bad here. Just because they give you benefits they feel the right to treat you like sh**. The money is ok but not worth it. There's other places out there. Keep looking.
bad,Starbucks does not take care of their employees financially.  The pay is horrible for the amount of work you do and for how hard you have to work there!
bad,Management is overworked and underappreciated. More often than not they are treated as glorified baristas with keys. Most district managers are not supportive and do not understand the realities of day to day management.
bad,"This review reflects Meijer run Starbucks, not stand alones and not Meijer grocery store in general. "
bad,"The Magic Bean Company is a franchisee of Starbucks and is the actual company you'll be working for, this company is a joke. Numerous problems with pay every month, always deliberately understaffed to save money but results in overworked staff under pressure and bad customer service. They will dismiss you for the smallest of infractions and if you leave within six months you'll be charged £250 'training costs', this is Magic Beans policy not Starbucks, when there is actually very little training and you will be pushed in at the deep end. Avoid like the plague."
bad,"Hard work  and no money "
bad,Working at Starbucks taught me a lot from great customer service to learning to stay out of drama between co workers and management. I've learned that everything in writing is best and to save on file due to these lessons.
bad,"Very deceptive when they bring you on board, culture is not what they express it to be It was also a big dive for me from large retail to small retail and they never said what they expected to be an 80 hour work week.,"
bad,"Training was absolutely horrible. Its a 8 week training, but after 10 weeks of almost no training, I had enough and left. DM refused to help get it going."
bad,"Again, catty social ladder mentality. No focus on customers, inappropriate use of company policy, favoritism, Skills were not seen as valuable because of lack of involvement in childish social behaviors."
bad,"Starbucks itself is a brilliant company to work for, very well known, beautiful coffee, generally enjoyable job, some customers are brilliant, we get our regulars, and there are some really miserable ones that treat you like a piece of dirt too.."
bad,"All employees are paid low wages, when asked for a raise, my manager laughed in my face and said he had to change jobs for a raise instead of take me seriously."
bad,"You are just a number to the company, it is extremely  hard to advance, or even take time off ex:having a child. They try and be all about safety but also want you to be quick and get their number higher."
bad,"Stressful, fast paced. Learned customer service skills. Management was terrible and the most enjoyable part was creating friendships. Culture was basic and the hardest part was standing for 8 hours."
bad,"Starbucks is a grear company for its perks but as far as in the store, getting berated by teens and ederly jerks management and corporate dont back you up. In fact they make you apologize for customers spilling their coffee on you."
bad,"Before the turn of the new decade, Starbucks' focus was on the wellbeing and advancement of the partners as much as it valued the satisfaction of the customer. In recent years, however, it has become increasingly difficult to uphold the morale of the partners in order to deliver world-class customer service due to the disregard of the simple, basic needs as an employee."
bad,"A lot of interaction with customers , co workers are very fun to be around and work with , most enjoyable part of the job is making the customers morning with making their coffee just the way they like.Ive learned that customer service is a very important thing , they way you satisfy a customers needs has an affect on the company.Hardest part of the job is not being able to help the customer"
bad,"I had worked there for about 2 years and I loved the job. Everyday I was learning something new about coffee or the company its self and how it worked as well as the history. My fellow co-workers (Partners) were all very wonderful people, but the corporate system is corrupt as well as the discipline of manager misconduct lacked. I was promised to be worked up to a shift management position and had people hired over me then I was forced to train them. The actual store manager had physically put her hands on me and drug me across the back line floors to force me to do perform a task I was not comfortable with. The shift supervisors were encouraged  to  threaten jobs and curse employees to make them do as they please. I am not saying this is every Starbucks at all. Just the one I had worked at."
bad,"Management only gives 5 days of training and then employees can be off for up to a month after training which is not conducive to helping employees understand their job and to be able to perform properly. Management wasn't very helpful and always denied time off even if it was important or you  absolutely could not come in."
bad,loooooooooooooooooong lines unprofessional employeeS... MANGEMENT NEED RETRAINING . they need to have at leats a 2 week training for new employees so they can be informative & knowlegable aabout the product
bad,"Starbucks was not for me at all, part time hrs every week wasn't even bringing home 200 dollars a week. No overtime even if you stay to close and have to clean, I use to get off at 10:30 pm (which was closing) and always had to stay till 11pm or 11:30 but still was only paid for my scheduled hrs. Most co workers were catty and mean and lots of younger people. this job is for young people that don't  really have large responsibilities or REAL bills to pay 40 hrs is  deff not something you should look forward to. because you will not getting it atleast at that location."
bad,"I loved the company just not the store I was at. As a new employee you get paid pretty well and they have good benefits too."
bad,if you want to get threatened with flying hot coffee being thrown at your face at 8 am then id say this is the place for you! if not then id say that you find somehwere else to go toherwise youre going to be rather dissapointed.
bad,"Each location is different, but the one I worked at was below par."
bad,"Management Accountant role, involving COGs and inventory."
bad,"A typical day at starbucks is very fast paced, just the way I prefer.   I learned how to make hand crafted and blended beverages,as well as brewed coffee."
bad,"Came to work clocked in and work hard until shift was over."
bad,"My typical day at work was Count the money of six registers. Count money from our sfe box. I learned to work in a fast pace. I got along with all my co-workers. Hardest part of the job was being in the bank for a long time depositing  starbucks money, Knowing When I get back I need to give breaks and lunch time to partners. The most enjoyable part of the job is work with customer all day."
bad,The pay at Starbucks suck! If you werent a favorite of management you had no chance of advancement.. Didnt care if u had to catch 3 buses to work and would still place you on A night schedule with no running buses
bad,culture of starbucks really left a little for me to boast about. Not a great work environment to work for. very dissapointed in the starbucks culture.
bad,At my store my manager sits on his but and works us like slaves.
bad,Under paid lack of support from mangers. No flexibility in schedule. More cleaning then actually making coffee. Over worked management team. Very fast paces Environment.
bad,The customers where often times rude. Tip out is based off how many hours you get in a week (I barely made $10) co-workers can be quite rude and condescending.
bad,"If you want to work for a job where the management doesn’t care about their employees, this is the place for you. Benefits aren’t any better than other employers, except for the free stock. Baristas are great but management sucks."
bad,A typical day of work was stressful and mentally draining. A combination of poor management and a bad clientele made the job a nightmare. Overworked and Underpaid.
bad,.............Well since you made me have 150 words. Come home after being yelled by snobby customers. Occasionally I would have positive interactions with customers. I usually cried after my shift
bad,"You get everyone from the mall, everyone right off the highway, regulars and new comers, so it's a mix of some really nice people and then mostly people who want you fired because your store happened to run out of packets of honey. Yes,  packets of honey. Or they are upset because they're ordering frappuccinos on a happy hour (which also should only be one or two hours because it really makes everyone want to walk out here.) and they can't deal with the fact that it will take a long time because every customer has 2 or more drinks, we only have ONE BLENDER, why only one you ask? For such a high volume store?  Hmm. This behaviour from my fellow humans has really really put a huge damper on my mental health. Employees shouldn't have to go to the back and cry during a shift at work,yet almost everyone has done that here. I cry on the way to work, while I'm there and then on the way back home. We go above and beyond for these customers for them to belittle you,  degrade you. It's not the end of the world when we run out of product,  yet we get to hear it about ""how are you guys out of peppermint?!"" Followed by an annoyed sigh or snappy comment. Well,  you see,  everyone wants peppermint right now,  so,  we can't keep up with the demand. I feel that if more people would be considerate and patient, because this is a coffee shop after all, not fast food,  this job wouldn't make me want to not want to be alive. Also, the management here is not the best. The store manager is always on a leave,  when they come back they doesn't talk to any of the employees or shifts to try and get to"
bad,"Customers are the worst part of the job. If you want a life don’t get this job, you will have no free time. The pay is horrid for the stress that you will have to deal with."
bad,"It is a while since I worked for them now, but needless to say I left the district followed by another 5 managers within 6 months, including the district manager who was next to useless. The regional ""director"" was utterly vile and totally got off on knowing she made people scared and stressed. If you are looking for a job in which you will be supported then look elsewhere"
bad,"schlecht bezahlt (Mindestlohn), oft Spannungen im Team, Arbeitsdruck (Zusatzverkäufe), oft negative Erfahrungen mit Gästen, inkompetente Führungskräfte"
bad,Managament was very poor. I would not have left if it wasn’t for the Managament. I really enjoyed my job and the costumers. I enjoyed working with my co-workers as well.
bad,"I had unresolved racially biased issues I addressed several times,mainly due to unevenly distributed work and purposely ""forgotten breaks""Their solution was to fire me. Even though I addressed the issue, with being one sided they were only focused on me working my shift."
bad,"A horrible experience: overworked, underpaid, under-appreciated, and poorly managed. Worst job I've had, within six months almost every single person I was hired with quit."
bad,"For starters, I would say that my time at this company has been terrible. "
bad,"The company offers an extremely competitive benefits package, but under-compensate the managers for the amount of work and dedication required. The benefits package does not properly compensate for a lack of competitive pay."
bad,"The Starbucks Mission Statement is:"
bad,Company that was not worth the time and energy employees put in when managment and corporate are unwilling or incapable of showing support for them beyond benefits that are now standard across the industry
bad,They did not care about my training and blamed me for not knowing how to make drinks. They only pretend to care about hygiene and food safety but behind the curtains its filthy.
bad,Young adults acting as if it’s High School. Incompetent pathetic managers who are child adults. Immaturity and depression motivate these young adults. The costumers are cruel and so are the workers among themselves. Girls are filled of jealousy and boys are perverts. It’s not worth the benefits. Favoritism done by the manager and shift leads. Managers are just failures with useless degrees.
bad,"The most horrible management I have ever experienced. From fellow shift leads, to the general store manager, to the district manager's inability to do anything about it."
bad,"The job was fun, but a coffee shop just isn't the job I'd like to work for. The manager was unprofessional but my co-workers made up for it. It's an easy job really."
bad,Run this is one of the qorst companies to work for. They'll offer you benefits starting at 20 hrs only because ypu want make much mpre than that. I repeat run!!!!!!
bad,"I enjoyed working for Starbucks, and likely would have stayed had the compensation been decent. However, they simply do not pay a living wage despite the majority of the workers in the store I worked at being college age or older. Starbucks desperately needs to increase their pay."
bad,"Management is terrible, don’t be a manager unless you want to pick up everyone else’s slack, my store manager was a very questionabale person and only cares to complain about what was wrong rather than all the good things you do. Honestly just don’t do it to yourself!!! People quit all the time which meant you NEVER had a barista know what they’re doing because they were always new. At least not a Starbucks in Boston. I’ve heard of other successful stores but that district needs some serious help. The managers in this district also gossip a lot so the toxicity is enough to stay away!"
bad,"Does not really care about their partners, only the customers. Willing to cut people whenever it suits them without proper cause. So much work and stress for very little pay."
bad,"Working at Starbucks was not what I had expected.  I thought it would be a place that I could expound on my customer service skills and work with a great team, but I was way wrong!! The supervisors that I worked with were not great at all and liked to use their position to their advantage in a power-hungry way.  They would create a very stressful environment for me, knowing that it was stressful and would not give me a chance to catch my bearings before giving me more tasks to do, and then proceed to get me in trouble with my manager claiming that I had been disrespectful to them even though I was in a hostile environment.  Also when I would try to give the customers a great experience by helping them to customize their drinks by giving them recommendations, I would get a ""talking to"" because I was taking to long with the customers even though the customer was grateful for the extra time spent with them.  Also, I would be blamed when a drink was made wrong because, I must have put the order in the computer wrong when actually the person making the drink didn't pay attention to the customized order but since they were friends with the supervisor, I was in the wrong.  I would not recommend working for the company because they do not stand by their values!"
bad,"There are some good perks to working here, but not enough to over come everything else.  Maybe it's just Midland, but they always tried to get the most out of as few staff members as possible, more concerned with bottom line it seemed."
bad,"They pay decent , but they use you . You can never leave on time , they have you wait until someone can cover your position. They also treat you like you are nothing  ! Also 2 much drama ! The managers dont try to help with anything. They are lazy they just walk around stores all day. But they do pay 1.50 more for 3rd shift so my salary was 12.65 but on the paystubs it says 11.15"
bad,Management was horrible and the overall work experience was horrible. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I received my break. What I learned was that an inexperienced manager that never works and always runs off when it is the busiest is a horrible work experience
bad,You work hard for little to no money. Starbucks corporation thinks that by providing you with free drinks for the entirety of your shift that it's enough.  The hardest part of the job is having to work with little to no people and it gets very busy. Not worth your time at all.
bad,"make drinks- quickly , to standard (sanitation and building steps wise), and to customer's satisfaction"
bad,"24-hour drive-thru/cafe store is a complete mess. We are constantly out of products and drinks, high volume and chronic understaffing have led to long wait times and angry customers which the underpaid baristas are left to deal with. Baristas complaints to management are met with ""if everyone did their part"" or ""we just need better customer connection"". In addition, I was given only one or no days off a week repeated without my consent and in spite of my repeated requests to receive two days off. Turn over is extremely high due to these problems which is only compounding the problems already in existence. Starbucks is a profit-hungry company who is good at PR. All their talk about partners being important is just that, talk."
bad,"People were rude and they all ganged up on people and 5alked behind each others backs and started stuff that wasnt suppose to be there."
bad,I would not work here as a first job due to the lack of caring management. The store I worked at was very catty and picked favorites. It's fast pace and stressful.
bad,very hard working here. we were not compensated for all the work we were in charge of doing. Management got worst over time. Co workers began quitting all at the same time
bad,"mauvais management , planning change tout les jours ."
bad,"Very understaffed, lots of pressure on the few members actually working to give up days off because of this. Worked 14 days in a row and had to take personal holiday as the manager would not allow me a day off because there was no one else to work."
bad,"starbucks offers great benefits but i think the district managers need to be more outgoing, they seem to care more about the numbers rather than the actual customer experience."
bad,The job was okay very fast paced and stressful because they hardly scheduled people correctly. The manager was tough even when things were not your fault. inconsiderate.
bad,"Never in my life have I had someone belittle me and make me feel so worthless. I ended up having to leave because of how little they did for accommodating my university studies. I had been working for the company since I was 16 and you'd think the loyalty of 4 years within the company would be recognised, but it wasn't. Wouldn't recommend them to anyone."
bad,For the pay they offer for all the stuff you deal with and the people you deal with it just isn't worth it. Everyone is on you like you do not know how to do your job. The customers are rude and entitled. Staff is low.
bad,"very fast paced job, however some managers had their favorites and I would even see said managers allowing their friend/family behind the counter to make their own drinks."
bad,"Management does not back employees, allows employees to consistently lack in employment.  The job is stressful unfulfilling and a gossiping runs rampant and unchecked"
bad,"I had a terrible experience in this Company, I know for a fact that it is not the case with every employee though I met some that are indoctrinated to the point of a cult. I passed 5 District managers and the last one I dealt with before my departure was an interim that did not stay in the job for more than 3 months. With stores closing and Upper management changing constantly it is difficult to deliver results in a market that it is assumed rather than studied. "
bad,"very competitive without even realizing it!! great coffee, meet great customers. very competitive very fast pace depending on time of day. very competitive and that's all."
bad,"I worked approximately one week at Starbucks and knew right away it wasn't for me. They literally work you to the bone here. I was expected to know all the recipes to the drinks and how to handle the cash register within three days of my time there. My fellow partners made me feel unwelcome and discouraged - some were nice but not many. I felt like a burden to everybody. It also felt like we were all in some kind of competition. Favoritism in the work place? No thanks."
bad,"This job is absolutely thankless. Baristas exhaust themselves every single day making countless frappuccinos, running around cleaning up inconsiderate customers' messes, and dealing with ungrateful, unreasonable people. I would not wish this job on my worst enemy. HOWEVER. If this is not your primary source of income and you would like to take advantage of benefits, flexible hours, and free online schooling, by all means. I needed to make a living and this was not the place for that. I have learned customer service skills and extroversion, but at what cost. As a supervisor and veteran of 5 years, I made $12.55."
bad,Tirelessly working to keep up with corporate standards with not enough staff to make it happen. Shift managers are not trained well in customer service and do not do well in keeping up morale of underpaid workers.
bad,"horrible place to work very stressful travel time to and from work was not good "
bad,"Never knowing what time I was to start work or go home. Manager kept changing my hours on a weekly, daily basis. I never knew when my  end of day since all employees had to ask manager if it was time to punch out. Manager micromanaged all employees and was always criticizing employees. "
bad,The management at the Starbucks I worked in was seriously lacking. The management (along with supervisors) bought personal drama into work and were very unpleasant to work with.
bad,"I've worked on and off for starbucks for such a long time I don't know why I keep going back to it. pay is a bit better than most jobs but it's not worth it. every store I've been too lacks in quality of service, quality of product, and quality of morality. they don't care about you the customer or the product."
bad,"a typical day - short but enjoyable."
bad,"It was an experience non the less."
bad,"Management is not very professional."
bad,"My experience was very bad, I had uncaring management and team. They care more about numbers than the actual drinks theyre handing out. It was hard to care when no one else cared."
bad,"Managers dont want to do their jobs so the pawn it off as ur fault, stems from corporate down. Managers are unqualified- MGT degree are told it means nothing. Make sure if you work for Starbucks that you are prepared to work even when extremely sick and throwing up because managers dont want to do their jobs and come in to cover and tell you it's up to you to find coverage (good luck with that). Also be prepared for 2faced people who talk about others behind backs like high schoolers."
bad,"Managera usually don't manage, just sit in back. Benefits were not bad, however stress due to being made to close then open the next day definitely affected my mental health."
bad,I was expected to learn everything on my own with little to no training. It was a very rude and unprofessional environment. I felt mistreated and I was harrased by a manager.
bad,"I was paid very close to minimum wage to deal with a rude manager that was very discriminatory towards those who do not agree with his ideology. I was made uncomfortable and called out more than once for slight mistakes. Although, I do believe it is more than likely better at other locations."
bad,"Never, 0 hours contracts, and just let you know after you employees , on interview don’t telling, no and one more time really no , you just know your work hours advance 1 week, plus it’s 8,21 all time,"
bad,"Starbucks is a very fast passed work environment you get good experience working at Starbucks, dealing with the good the bad and the ugly you get happy customers and mad customers but you still have to keep a smile on your face regardless :)"
bad,"Working for Starbucks is rather painful"
bad,I learned how to make coffee. But we mostly cleaned and made drinks while restocking the store. The management wasn't all the greatest because he didn't really seem to care about the store. Most enjoyable part was talking through the head sets.
bad,"It’s supposed to be one of the worlds most ethical companies, but I feel like there could be improvement.  There’s a lot of weird pressures supervisors and baristas face.  I worked there for three years at five different locations.  Be prepared, it can be a hard job.  It can be fun and sometimes an easy day, but it will never be consistent.  The tips at drive thru locations can be atrocious.  It seems like it’s more work for less pay.  The DMs seem more preoccupied by numbers like drive times and waste, despite having multiple employees do no call/no shows and still retain their jobs. And the new ones who do show up (with limited hours) don’t actually get trained past register until they show initiative and learn for themselves, which creates a lot of miscommunication on drink recipes.  Lots of times they get overwhelmed and quit the next day once a customer throws a fit. During crunch times, it’s just easier to put the more experienced barista on bar.  Hours were not flexible for this reason, and finding coverage was a nightmare.  There seemed to be a huge staff shortage and some cafe stores closed.  We worked a three man shift in a drive thru on a Saturday morning by the beach because no other stores could help staff us and our manager and DM was unavailable.  Some customers will throw trash or play pranks on you.  If you’ve never had someone or an animal relieve themselves on the floor and calmly walk away, I can tell you, it’s an experience.  It happened in my district very often. The last two years I’ve had bodily fluids other weird unidentifiable liquids on walls and floors,"
bad,"24/7 under telefon"
bad,miserable job that has fantastic compensation because they know how bitter and unforgiving their clientele can be. I was trained in one of the least hospitable and busiest locations in the area.
bad,"The job itself is cute and wonderful; weekly tips are good too. On the contrary, 100% would not recommend my store. They ask for too much for such little pay. The fellow partners love to create drama and cause problems. The customers are extremely rude. You will never be trained and will be expected to know everything one random day. Maybe other stores are better, but store 10643 is not it."
bad,They try to live by core values but they don’t management got off by making employees cry and abused his authority will never work there again never ever
bad,I worked there for 5 years worked up from barista to shift and when I wanted to become an assistant manager there were issues to why not instead of them telling me what I need to improve on they fired me Starbucks is a straight joke
bad,This job is temporary job. It is good if you go to school full time and work 2 jobs. I was working 2 jobs when I was a starbucks. They were flexible with the schedule but the management was super poor.
bad,"I started my career in one region and loved it! There were high expectations for performance individually and as a team.  I transferred to a different location in another region. I quickly realized the District and store managers had little to no knowledge of corporate policies and/or procedures.  It was a real s@!# show.  Filthy stores, managers who don't work, no training for new hires"
bad,Starbucks can be great but is very flawed. For the amount of work one does one does not get paid enough. And the customers can range from phenomenal to get out.
bad,"Lack of respect and equality from management and co workers.  There a certain way a company should be ran, and personal conflict shouldn't be involved. Inappropriate to bring your outside life to work environment."
bad,"Im normalen Verkauf war es sehr viel, jedoch mit dem richtigen Team macht die Arbeit sehr viel Spaß. Leider fand auf der Arbeit ein Übergriff von einem Arbeitskollegen auf mich statt, welcher von dem Teamleiter nicht entlassen wurde."
bad,unless you want to be neglected do not work for starbucks. It is an elitist company that favors lazy workers who get stuff done rather than innovators who actually care for the job.
bad,"You’re expected to do too much with little pay, rude entitled customers who insist that you to do everything for them ( literally things like they don’t want to pour their own milk into their coffee or sugar and they expect you to do it ),  customers are treated better than the employees, and it’s rare you get a minute to breathe because there’s customers back to back without the proper amount of staff to handle all those customers. So you get over worked everyday, with just a 10 minute paid break and a 30 minute unpaid break. The minimum wage in nyc for 2019 is $15 and baristas starting pay is $15.02. Completely not worth it."
bad,Starbucks works it’s employees to the bone just to flip a profit. Minimal pay for the amount of work completed and terrible opportunities to advance within the company.
bad,Your experience is greatly dependent on your immediate boss.  There is a lot of micromanagement and mixed direction.  You are not given enough labor to attain the standards required.  You work exhausting hours and often cannot get a break.  The best part of this job is the team you work with.  The benefits are great if you have the time to utilize.
bad,"Company is great but the people that they hire are questionable. I had a great overall experience however, it felt like the ""new"" district manager wasn't the most accommodating. Starbucks went through a who phase with racism and i don't think they truly understand biases."
bad,"This job sucked the life and soul out of me. Management will manipulate, lie and jerk you around. I wasted 5+ years here. It's overrated and a waste of time. The wages are too low for the work they are asking, especially of shift supervisors."
bad,I worked at starbucks for two years. during my time there I was taken advantage of by a shift leader. I had to take a medical leave and was ghosted when I was ready to come back. No one will speak to me or tell me why. I have an infant daughter and could REALLY use the benefits at Starbucks. I was a good partner and they treated me poorly. It is unethical to just cut a partner off with no explanation.
bad,A very fast environment. Friendly staff. Management cares about development and moving people forward. Free college through Arizona State University. Sharpens your time management as well as multitasking skills.
bad,"There was a point in time where I was really excited to go to work for Starbucks, but throughout my time of over a year with the company I have seen my own store and other local stores gradually decline to the point we were struggling every day just to get basic tasks done."
bad,"Bizar wat ze verspillen aan producten om nieuwe mensen in te werken!!!!"
bad,"You will wake up at 4:00am, get to work and open by 6:00am. You will then be harassed by the customers for an average of 12 hours a day. The male customers will do their best to pick you up, in an inappropriate way, and when you decline their offer YOU are the one who will get in trouble. The expectations from upper management is that you do whatever you have to to make the customer happy. They don't have any interest in their employees well being or safety. I've had to call the police twice. This company demands that you give every ounce of passion that you have and then shoves insult after insult in your face. It's hard work with little return. The experience you gain here will not help you in any career that you want in the future. I made a huge mistake by working her."
bad,After working at Starbucks for a week and a half I decided to leave after being used to do the jobs no one wants to do e.g. physically clean the toilets (hands down them and everything) and also spoken to like dirt by the management team. The staff I worked with were lovely and the benefits of the job are great however working long hours with awful and half hearted training wasn’t for me. When asking questions during the time I worked at Starbucks I was felt to feel stupid by the managers and this is not what I want from a job.
bad,"Great place to work as an entry level, high school job. I simply wanted more out of my life; thus, I decided to leave and continue my education. I did have a great experience and have many fond memories of my time with Starbucks."
bad,"This is a terrible place to work. The company itself isn't bad."
bad,"Starbucks is great as a corporation, but on the store and district level, it is a joke. Loved helping customers and helping fellow partners. But management was never happy. Policy changes almost every week."
bad,"Starbucks isn't anything special, and in my opinion, a blight on the coffee industry as a whole.  Thanks to them no one in the US (or at least a majority of people) have any Idea what good coffee tastes like."
bad,This company was the worst the management honestly was...I did not like working here at all if I could work with other people I would but other then that I wouldn't want to work at this location
bad,Nie polecam osobom niezależnym  z zyciem prywatnym i naukowym
bad,"The high cleanliness and customer service standards are impossible to meet with the amount of labor we are given.  This, in turn, makes it difficult to hire, train and keep good employees.  Training time is also very tight and it's not enough time for the new hires to feel comfortable in their role, making it stressful on seasoned emplyees who need to pick up their slack during the learning curve.  Starbucks has created a culture of the customer is always right, even though we hav estandards to adhere to, if the customer wants something, they get it so we are not supported as employees if we receive a complaint about something that was due to us upholding standards.  Instead the customer is rewarded with free product, which just perpetuates the behavior.  The company keeps rolling out new items and new drinks.  They should just stick to the basics and let the employees master those things.  By doing this, it would allow for the exceptional customer service standards they expect.  When helf the team doesnt know what they are doing because there's no time alotted for proper training and mastery, it's just a train wreck.  Also, in CA, we were paid a salary as managers but also received OT for working over 8 hours/day or 40 hrs/week.  We were only alotted 10% of our time for actual administrative.management duties and the other 80% we were basically high paid baristas.  OT was frowned upon but the demands of the job really didn't fit into an 8 hour day, especially when only given 8-10 hours of admin time/week and the other 80% of our hours were included in our labor alotment so"
bad,"they ask for alot, except it all to get done but you are constantly understaffed, run low on product ALL THE TIME. I used to love my job and love people"
bad,"Want to work at Trinity Commons Starbucks? Be an experience brewistia. It is absolutely insane with the all of  the 900 customers that go to that store every single day. The amount of unnecessary stress I have for a job that only gives me $11.40/h is ridiculous, not to mention they only schedule me for 13 hours a week, I can't support myself this way. Its not all cute cups and fancy drinks, the job is extremely hard. Good luck trying to please snobby customers, because if you make one little mistake prepare to get yelled at. I can't say that all Starbucks are like this but i can guarantee that this job is nothing like you thought it was."
bad,The staff gossips all the time and the pay isn’t worth the amount of work or stress. Management was okay but talked behind your back at least at the location I was at.
bad,"jobs a joke, 0 accountability. if you work hard, you get paid the same as the people who talk and dont work..................................................."
bad,"I only worked there for a weeks and I already knew that I was gonna quit Starbucks. My first trainer was the store manger who was awesome,  but my other manager couldn't care less where I was. He would disappear and I wouldn't know where, or how operate the machine and bar. He wouldn't let me do anything,  cause apparently I'm to slow. Well news flash!! I'm still new. When I quit and I told the store General manager what had happened, he quickly told me to basically that he didn't give a care and told me to hand in my badge.  Like it was my fault their staff sucks at training people and that some employees are so lazy. The people are nice,  but at the end off the day,  they play when the store manager wasn't there to observe their childish behaviors."
bad,"They tout everywhere how wonderful they are to work with, and they do have great benefits, however, they abuse their employees. I could not continue down their management path the way they work their workers vs. how much they pay them."
bad,"Full of promises they don't intend to fulfill, Starbucks is the image of a major greedy corporation. The only thing valuable is the benefits and sometimes the coworkers."
bad,"The management team were all extremely unprofessional, colleagues and myself often felt victimized, it was a difficult place to work. The workload is insane to do alone (i.e. close shifts and cleaning to a time limit) and it's not just the job role because I'm still a barista and find things much better. I soon left to join a competitor."
bad,Just that rough. Management was terrible. I did not enjoy coming to work because the customers were exceptionally hard to deal with. I did enjoy learning the bar though.
bad,"I worked at the worse Target: Starbucks ever! Horrible management, horrible cleaning habits. I was never able to clean the entire section of our Starbucks in an hour. We kept failing our health inspections. We had rat traps under everything, fruit flies everywhere! People kept quitting after a few days or weeks from how poorly managed this location was. Do not work at a Starbucks inside a big chain store the actual Starbucks stores are much, much more bertter and clean."
bad,"this would have been a better experience if they had better traininers. To many different directions leading to unsuccessful work loads, then you are blamed for not knowing how to do your job correctly"
bad,The staff were jerks and management had good intentions but didnt really see what went around and didnt really care to see. Staff were awful to me.
bad,"Working at a Starbucks is extreme stressful and you are always trying to do your best, although that is not good enough for them. The management needs some help."
bad,"Typical day would be getting there at 2 pm or 3pm. Id clock in, grab myself a drawer for the cash register and immediately taking customers order and helping on bar. During slow, or down times, we'd stock and clean and start some of our closing tasks. I'd be the only one their from 10pm-12:30am. We close at 12am, and I was a closer working full-time. I enjoyed working with almost every one of my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was probably when we'd have a rush, or school bus, and the line would be out the door and there would only be two people working. Which meant one took orders, one made drinks. The most enjoyable part was working with coffee. I am in love with coffee. Also I love the diversity of customers we would get and hearing their stories or simply about their day."
bad,"Una cultura buena con buenas personas, cultura del café."
bad,"The most worst place on earth to work.  Starbucks preaches safety, but with the over all politics its all about saving money at the end of the day."
bad,"I want to think that my experience was not indicative of all Starbucks stores, but this was the most demoralizing period of my life. Management will berate employees in front of customers, talk about employees to other employees, asked employees to complete manager's personal inventory tests (ie compliance and supervision tests) and was basically cruel. I loved my co-workers, I loved my customers, and I worked harder than 90% of the people I worked with. Is basically impossible to ever take time off, expected to be available at all times and schedule would change the day before your next shift. Request off calendar was deliberately held back until the first day of that month, and if you had to make an appointment, too bad, and have to get coverage for the shift of be written up - from other employees at under staffed store. Then blamed. Manager personally changes date dot (expiration on food) to reduce waste. Had a workplace accident and was made to go to the hospital although I said it wasn't necessary, then was never reimbursed the cost. Loved my regular customers, working hard and staying busy, and co-workers. Was thrown away like trash by management. This job should not be this complicated."
bad,"A typical day, would be me getting in as the other co-worker leaves for the day. I hand make specialty coffee drinks, run the cash register, make good conversation with new and returning customers, prep the fresh ingredients, throw out old ingredients, stock and clean the whole kiosk, and then wait for a ride home."
bad,"customer service"
bad,"Everyday is a fire fighting days."
bad,"Once everyother week I would have to come in at 530am after working until 11pm the previous night. Holiday Season at a shopping mall was fast paced and demanding. I learned that no matter where you work you should not fratranize with other employees. Management was mainly in front of a computer screen or critiquing an employee. My co-workers were incompetent, lazy or jealous of my position. The hardest part of the job was meeting labor requirements. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customer interaction. Four years later and I still run into smiling faces."
bad,"I liked the space, nice location in the city. Surprisingly  customers weren't as bad as I expected attitude wise, but the workers themselves had a lot of drama that made the space unbearable to work in."
bad,"Starbucks is great and all, but I only love the people I work with. Customers have gotten the whole ""customer is always right"" embedded in their brain so now any inconvenience  they have, they call corporate and we, the baristas, get in trouble for it, no matter if the customer was 100% in the wrong. Some customers even get rewarded with gift cards and free drinks or whatever Starbucks can think of to kiss the customers' butt . It's annoying. If it wasn't for the flexibility, I would've left a long time ago."
bad,"You have to be fast , nice, and it gets stressful.  When your store gets busy, you and your workers have to be able to work together to be able to satosfy customers"
bad,The only complaint I have for The Marriott Starbucks is the management. They are collectively unorganized and unqualified and manage absolutely nothing. I was very disappointed with this location but I love the Starbucks company and would not hesitate to work here again if given the chance
bad,"For very little pay, you will be doing much more than making coffee (what most people assume). Almost all shifts you are short staffed and you are stressed the entire time because you are micromanaged every second of your shift"
bad,Unprofessional lack of hours and everyone is rude and two faced. Tips suck and the customers are rude but however always right. Not worth the pay at all or stress.
bad,"Zowat alles klopte niet. Lonen, kilometervergoeding, maaltijdcheque’s, soms stond er op mijn loonbrief dat ik maar een paar dagen had gewerkt terwijl ik een hele maand mooi 36 (of meer) uur had gewerkt. Bazin is hier niet aanspreekbaar voor en respecteert haar personeel niet, alleen gemene en afbrekende commentaar en nooit iets positief. Als je iets doorgeeft van informatie (bijvoorbeeld een adreswijziging of vrije dagen aanvraag) word hier niet naar gekeken tenzij dit in hun voordeel is. Echt teleurstellend."
bad,"It was fun, Co-workers became family to me and my manager made the environment more welcoming and less stressful. Stressful because the window times had to be a certain amount."
bad,"On the surface starbucks likes to convey themselves as being fair and caring for their employees. However, there are certain people there who complain about others almost on a daily basis, or complain to management that so and so aren't doing things by procedure. Meanwhile they are breaking other procedures that are actually way more important as far as safety as well as doing things that can avoid losing product. "
bad,"In Eureka, CA, we were mostly ignored by corporate as long as everything was legal and the store was making money."
bad,"Good benefits, horrible pay, horrible management.  Not worth your time.   Not worth your mental health. Corporate will tell you to do one thing and when you do it and the customer complains, you will get in trouble and most likely fired. Your job is 100% on the line no matter what."
bad,Starbucks was a hectic environment with little to no support for employees needing it. Upper management had a poor concept of what support was needed.
bad,"As much as I learned from Starbucks and as great as my coworkers were, the manager at this location was less than competent.She would belittle newcomers and demand that managers come in even during family emergencies."
bad,Management speaks to you as if you are a lesser human to them. Fellow employees are vendictive and aggressive and are out to get you and will even tell you they are. Pay is low and there is little to no movement within the company unless you are liked by a member of management.
bad,"This company as a whole is great to work for, however the management they put in place get little to know training nor do they care how they manage a location.  Typical work day, you show up to the store trashed on a daily basis, baseboards walls covered in milk or syrup, trash littering the floors, lines out the door, nothing stocked on the floor, no counts done, they don't hire enough or care enough about their staff on the floor, five years ago the company or district did, however now its all about getting the extra buck from customers no thought goes into customer service anymore."
bad,"There is a lot to learn to become a barista and morning shifts can be brutal if you do not have stress management skills. However I always enjoyed coming in to work because the environment is very homey. also, you and your coworkers become such an important part of each other lives and that to me makes up for the stress of the job."
bad,"Of all of the jobs I worked, Starbucks was the most disappointing. While I got along well with some of my coworkers, the others treated me terribly because I was newer. There was no sense of community or family and everyone was talking about eachother behind their backs. The customers treated us all terribly. It was just an extremely negative environment."
bad,"I would never recommend this as a full-time bread winner type job. This job is for usage of benefits only and even working as a shift supervisor or even an assistant/manager you will not make a fair/living wage for what the job requires of you. Full availability for maybe 20 hours a week at times. Low staff counts continuously, high expectations of customer counts and unachievable tasks are given consistently. The only pros for this job is the tuition assistance program, stock options and insurance benefits. Again I would only recommend this as a ""I'm bored and just want extra cash"" type of job."
bad,"When I started Starbucks many years ago, it was a great company that truly cared for their employees. Not so much anymore.Partners are hired on need to fill a spot rather than actual experience or qualification. When I had leave of absence issues due to their LOA company Sedgwick I was basically brushed off even though Sedgwick was at fault for the denial of my claim. I was told they did nothing wrong even though they didn't give me the information I needed to properly do things for them until after my time to submit everything was up. Even though I had been trying for weeks to get the stuff to them but was told they didn't receive it. Starbucks was of no help. "
bad,"I love Starbucks, and the company as a whole treats their employees incredibly well offering excellent benefits, tuition reimbursement, stock options, pay increases, and flexible schedules. However, I would recommend working at a different Starbucks location under a different manager. I went to school for leadership and learned very quickly that the manager of that store is a tyrant manager and does not deserve to be called a leader. She yells at employees, calls them names, and once she is fed up with you, she will find a reason to fire you."
bad,"Not a company that values hard working people, management is bad and coworkers often too immature."
bad,Loved the job and the people so friendly always was on time and ready to learn the people was nice and once I got the hang of it I loved it but I got hooked on coffee
bad,A typical day at work is very busy with not enough time or coverage to get my job duties done. I have learned great management and time management skills and have been able to improve on my training abilities. My direct manager is very supportive and helpful but her managers were not supportive of Starbucks or helpful to us when we needed it. We were left to fend for ourselves and just figure everything out on our own. The workplace culture is filled with stress and lots of necessary pressure. Most management duties fell onto other people rather than management actually doing it themselves. The hardest part of the job was getting anyone to listen to us when we needed help or support. The most enjoyable part of the job was the baristas I trained and worked with on a daily basis.
bad,I learned how to working in a time management way. How to get tasks done before the deadline and in a fast and productive way. Made drinks while making sure the customers had a great experience.
bad,"I learned how to make all drinks, serve customers, work a drive thru, deal with heavy volume of customers. Hardest part was the consistent rush with no breaks."
bad,"Tiene un excelente ambiente laboral pero no compatibiliza los estudios con el trabajo, ya que no exten normas distintas para aquellos que estudiamos"
bad,"Almost nothing about this job was rewarding. I worked at 5am somedays, until 2am other days... often within the same week. I almost never got a saturday or sunday off. I never got 40 hours a week. And although I was moving up, just as I was asking for a promotion to Assistant Manager Starbucks made a new policy that eliminated half of the positions nation wide. They also began understaffing more, and more, and more."
bad,"Starbucks is going through a lot of company changes and depending on what level you are in the company those changes can produce great stress for you, very long hours at work, as well as undue stress in your life.  To be a store manager in this company was one of the hardest things I have ever done."
bad,"No me gustó la experiencia, pues era demasiado esfuerzo físico y cuando solicité apoyo y flexibilidad en los horarios pues estaba en exámenes finales, no me la dieron. Las posibilidades de ascenso representaban una inversión alta de tiempo, cuando la remuneración no era la que yo deseaba."
bad,the job started out fine until the manager would play mind games with you and give you 25 hours one week then the next week only give you 3.
bad,Typical day I will honestly say was almost poor everyday. During
bad,"El trabajo en general es fácil, lo que no te dicen es que tienes que soportar que los clientes hagan lo que quieran contigo y no te puedes defender, más los dichosos clientes de Starbucks Rewards."
bad,"At my Starbucks location, the manager picks favorites and does not treat fairly. They would not work with school schedule. I would consistently go over my 5th hour without taking meals breaks. I would at times not get my breaks. Over all would not recommend going back to this job. The customer at this job were the best because they really felt like family remember their drinks and making it before they order was always the best and seeing there smile once they reached the windows"
bad,"starbucks maintains a culture that encourages self exploitation by not affording the store the necessary labor hours to staff accordingly, leaving baristas to sacrifice breaks and store cleanliness to support the team in maintaining customer service work flows"
bad,"The best part of working for Starbucks for me, was all the friendships I made with coworkers and customers. I did get management experience and learn what practices I would never do. The worst part of working for Starbucks was the disregard for employees health and negligence of poor management. I worked in a toxic environment where we could not call in sick without getting in trouble, and constantly being talked about negatively behind our backs by management. A perfect example was when a coworker came to work with Strep throat to show our manager that she was physically sick and not faking, but instead of sending her home she put her on the espresso bar so she didn't have to talk to customers. What officially drove me away was the lack of resolution or action after reporting said actions to my district manager and HR. Working with great people is what kept me going but when everyone starts leaving, one can only take so much."
bad,Everything is focused on numbers. Few times was I actually happy at work. And when I worked at the manufacturing plant it was way worse. They are so focused on numbers they don’t care about coffee craft or customer service.
bad,"The employees are bullies, have zero patience for new people, they questioned how I even got a job there when I have two years of experience. Couldn’t even ask the shift lead a question without getting yelled at. Shift lead would keep me at cafe ringing my whole 6hr shift. There are people that have worked there for 3 to 6 months without being put on bar. The whole store was a just a bad vibe."
bad,The only way you will get noticed is if your friends with everyone at your store if not you will get lies told about you and when you walk in the whole store looks at you like u are a bad person and u do one thing wrong and they will turn on you in a heartbeat and then pretend to be your friend
bad,"Typical day on the job would depend on the time that you clock in, obviously opening the store would entail cleaning and prepping food and coffee for the morning rush, mid day is more about pumping out product as fast as possible with as little mistakes as possible, and closing tasks include store cleaning as well as prepping the store for the opening crew the next day. The amount of people that are given to work on the floor at any given time never seems to be enough, as cleaning tasks get further and further behind while serving anywhere from 60-80 customers in half of an hour that doesn't stop for hours on end some days. The job gets extremely stressful when you fail to get a task done and are left to feel the work and money that the company already makes is not enough. Management and district management only seem to care for the money and numbers rather than the staff and crews mental state and pay. The partners and baristas are the only thing that make it even feel worth to work hard. Its hard to stay passionate about work when everyone is underpaid and not rewarded for the hard work we put in."
bad,"Upon hiring was told I would be driving to another store to,be trained for 1 month. Nope 1 day on computer and 2 days training. Back to,my store expected to know everything. Pushed and bullied by the staff supervisors who yelled at me constantly and when I didn't know everything instead of teaching just shoved me on register or drive through. When I would ask a question on a difficult order they would huff and roll their eyes. I didn't get my first paycheck for 3 weeks because they screwed that up by not sending my I9 through even though I gave them my info and asked them about it for 2 weeks. First tips $9.00."
bad,I enjoyed my job I wish we made more an hour. The tips came in handy but never made a large difference. One of my favorite things about working at Starbucks was all of the friends I made and the interactions I had.
bad,"good job for kids in High School or College students. "
bad,"Being a barista started out as the best job I've ever had, but as soon as our store manager had to transfer things immediately went downhill. Hours were cut for baristas so they can now only work 5 hour shifts, which means that in a regular work week if you work 7 days in a row you still cannot make full time hours. Many baristas have to find new jobs simply because they can no longer live with the amount of money they're making. Also, there is an overhearing issue. There are so many of us that work in one tiny store that hardly anyone gets hours. When I first started their were five shift supervisors and maybe eight baristas and because we were a tiny store inside of a Chapters that worked for us. We were rarely understaffed and everyone maintained the minimum 20 hours to qualify for benefits. Now there are 13 baristas and people are being scheduled 5 hours a week and are expected to live off of that. Also, when the new manager arrived people became very gossipy. There is one supervisor in particular who has gone on to tell the new manager to ""look out"" for specific baristas because they are ""bad people"" simply because she doesn't like them. She has also admittedly told multiple people that she is trying to get someone fired, WHAT!?!?! It is insane to me that she is doing all of this with the intention of getting ahead in the company and no one seems to care about the way she is making her coworkers feels. When I first started here, we were a team and when we added new members it was awesome, our team was bigger. I still love every single barista there, but the attitude and"
bad,"I found myself stressed as soon as I saw a line of people confronting the cash register, for my first job, it was the worst experience, that is how I found out food service and customer service was not my type of job. Getting home sore and out of energy everday was not fun. I already had getting a bachelors after high school as a goal, but working there inspired me more to go to college so I would not have to work these types of jobs for my whole life."
bad,"Beware and stay away. This company is a wolf in sheep's clothing. They don't care about you, and while the school program and benefits are good, they will never be satisfied with your work and always demand more while paying a garbage wage."
bad,"If you love coffee houses, you can enjoy many aspects of working at Starbucks -- the aromas, tasting a wide range of coffee and tea beverages, flavors, and cafe food, meeting and working with some fun and interesting people.  Cafes in general can be wonderful places of happy gatherings, friends hanging out, people studying and reading."
bad,I loved the job however the people was very mean and did not care for you to advance skills or opportunities. I felt like I am a bad worker at the time but I was not trained enough but they wanted me to do something I was not taught. And veery person taught me different /wrong ways to get things done so then the manager would always give me a hard time why I keep doing it wrong although I was just doing what I was taught. and they would talk bad right behind your back that is loud enough that you can hear. would like to work again with the company but Never with the people.
bad,"work days are typically planned out and managed by shift supervisors who alternate you between positions throughout your shift so things don't get too monotonous. customers are enjoyable, benefits are also enjoyable."
bad,"Don't work here. My manager was OK,but, they ask you to work at multiple stores for your full hours and the managers at the other stores are horrible. people get yelled at by managers. the other employees are emotional and super unprofessional. You can not move up people have been there years."
bad,"We were frequently harassed or sometimes even assaulted by customers or other people at our store and received little to no support from upper management. "
bad,The job its self is fantastic and working for this company can be amazing if you have the proper management. This is a fast pace job and they're very serious about their guidelines.
bad,"I loved the people I worked with - they were friendly, outgoing and always had great attitudes. "
bad,"Like working fast-food, but worse. Not only can customers specify every detail of their drink order, but they can ask you to take apart food items that are shipped in frozen and whole, to fit their wants, no matter how inconvenient it is for the servers, and most likely at no extra cost. Managers at Starbucks give customers whatever they want, no matter how poorly or abusively they treat their baristas. This is a fine job to take if you want lots of hours, because your co-workers will likely call out or not show up. You would be extremely lucky to have a good manager who treats you like a human, but customers have majority rule on how you will be treated; which will be closer to custodial staff."
bad,Will break anyone. You either conform to them or die. You wake up at four in the morning to open the shop with your fifteen plus year lifers and hope that you can get through the eight hours of coffee and tea and entitled people that lie ahead of you.
bad,"Even when telling times I COULD NOT work, she would schedule me for them. I had to call out more times that I would have liked because I was having to work around my husband and had no family nearby. Due to personal reasons, I didn't want people besides family watching my child and she didn't seem to understand that."
bad,"Overall, I wouldn't recommend working here. This job is very physically and mentally demanding. Often lunch breaks are skipped due to busyness. Not a guaranteed time when to take lunch break. Understaffed almost always. Don't expect to be just a cashier, you're more than that. You are a plumber, janitor, table busser, garbage remover, handy man, and last but not least food and drink preparer. Drink preparer being the most physically exhausting position. With the amount of work you do you are not compensated for it."
bad,"i worked for Starbucks for 6 years. i was able to move across the country and still have a job. i enjoyed most everyone i worked with. Management in this last district i've worked in is shady and cut throat. they don't care about senor partners they use who and what they can to get where they want, no matter who they screw over."
bad,They let me go with no reasoning. There was no communication between supervisors and management. Supervisors would tell me how to do something and I would get yelled at by management for doing it wrong.
bad,This is a fact paced company and the work place is very intimate. Its also very team oriented. People are very specific and they expect a lot out of you.
bad,"When I started working for Starbucks in 2011, I loved my job. The culture was unique, the products were of quality and the consumers were great. Over the years, the company has gone downhill. The quality of a good beverage is now sacrificed for the speed in which a beverage is made. Corporate cares more about getting customers in and out as fast as possible, and less about employees connecting with customers. It is barely about a good cup of coffee anymore. Instead, Starbucks is about pushing 1,000 calorie milkshake like drinks to teenagers. "
bad,"bad customer service, dirty baristas, always on there phone, store managers never pop in on weekend, other shifts leave there task for people, manager does not resolve issues, manager plays favorites"
bad,10 pois gostei muito de trabalhar na loja da Starbucks
bad,"I absolutely hated working at starbucks. It wasn't the customers that made the job unbearable, it was the staff and managers. Rude to customers, employees and just anyone that would walk in the door. Hours are short and inconsistent, scheduling is very unorganized, pay was just over the minimum wage."
bad,"For as busy as it can be, it's fun! No matter which branch you work at, the people and the customers are amazing. It's such a collaborative environment."
bad,"Working at Starbucks was the best experience I had have, I learned lots of new things from my team and how to working with others. I also learned how to make different drinks at Starbucks and gained experience."
bad,It's a fun workplace it for me and everybody loves it there  think its great I need a new job because Starbucks really far away from Springfield so I need a job that's like 1.2 miles away
bad,"The stores I worked at were incredibly understaffed, which lead to over worked and untrained employees. Upper management was not trained, and put everything on the assistants and shift supervisors. I often worked 12-14 hour days without a break."
bad,I hated my job and so did everyone I worked with. every day was either boring with nothing to do over the top busy. how to cashier provide good service to my customers and hard work. management was crazy  my coworkers were rude and lazy and drama starters dealing with everything at once taste testing samples
bad,"Had to wake up early and make coffee. People were generally nice, but sometimes a customer was difficult to deal with."
bad,"New manager out to get everyone fired 4 people in two and a half months. Never tells you if you are doing a good job only bad jobs. "
bad,I don't really want to review this job. J don't have much good to say other than you get free drinks on your shift and their insurance was baller. Management was TERRIBLE!
bad,"First Manager use to tell me to not flirt with the new guys she’s hired, when we never had that kind of work relationship where I felt comfortable for her to say in front of my coworkers. Second manager never trained people properly so had to do extra work during rush hours and peak times."
bad,"Staff is unprofessional, didn’t even finish my training all the way to the end and would complain unprofessionally when asked how I execute a certain task, shifts were cut due to the manager just not liking me because of another staff members opinion of me, only good thing is the pay, but they don’t even pay your full months wage all at once and instead in bitparts over the course of a few months, wouldn’t recommend unless desperate for a job, barista work was pleasant, but it’s highly unlikely you’ll be placed on bar. Got stung by wasps several times as they have an infestation inside the business in oswestry."
bad,"Been with the company over 10 yrs and still making under $15 an hour. Only really here cuz the benefits are actually really good. If you've been with the company along time as just a barista they make you pick up all the slack. My significant other is a shift supervisor also at starbuck and with both our incomes, we still can't afford a place of our own and are renting a room."
bad,"It's pretty chill for the most part. They usually hire cool people. Or ""cool people"". Be ready for drama with coworkers and customers alike. Many customers are spoiled and entitled. Some simply have no home training. Most are just trying to get in and out as quick as possible. You are not a person here. You make coffee happen. That's what you are. They won't pay you enough, unless you live with your parents and need some cash to hang out with your friends. Honestly though free frappuccinos is pretty nice."
bad,"I have enjoyed my time at Starbucks due to the awesome environment and my store manager was incredible. Unfortunately the district manager I work for only cares about lining her own pockets and has made it clear to all the ""lowly"" baristas that they are only objects she will use to advance her own career. It's disappointing because Starbucks propaganda will tell you that they are here to build up the community and they are in the people business not the coffee business. How can you be in the people business if your dm is not even treating her employees like people? My experinece has taught me that this is a very hypocritical company."
bad,"It's was awful, working with different cultures, manager was horrible."
bad,we got everything done in a timely matter and helped customers acheive the best day possible. we closed and reopened the stores stock the shelves and clean everything wed do dishes too
bad,"I worked for two Starbucks locations in Reno Nevada. Plumb and Arlington, and 7th and Keystone. At both locations the management was subpar I often felt the management was drowning in work and therefore could not focus on employee needs. My starting wage was $7.35 an hour. Working hours averaged 26 hours per week and employees were tipped out once per week. It is a fun job if you don't have any bills to pay at all. Ten minute breaks were timed for employees and breaks started as soon as employees were told to go on break sometimes busy leaving employee little time to enjoy perks of job."
bad,"I have learned more from this job then ever thought. Ive learned how to resolve conflict with customer, how to always make the customer happy but not at the expense of anyone else. How product matters exact numbers if over or under it affects you fiscal year. Accounting every thing must match up, all numbers have a place and an explanation. Hardest part has been the lack of advancement. A normal day at Starbucks is in short organized chaos. It has to be in any fast paced customer based job where goals are 3 mins and under life can be crazy, but you learn very quickly how to balance all of it. Im always amazed when people say your always so nice and make it look easy it makes me happy to know I can even in a crisis put them at ease..most enjoyable part has been just putting a smile on a customer and making there day. Even making my other employees happy watching the confidence grow inside"
bad,"My typical day at Starbucks was busy, yet enjoyable. I love the diversity of coworkers as well as managers, very nice environment too."
bad,Pay is low and you’ll be expected to work above and beyond the pay rate. Unrealistic targets and no time to do any of the tasks you need to. Always under staffed because we weren’t allowed to have too many on shift at one time. Customers rude and training poor!! All the training resources are great but the manager hasn’t no time to let you learn them or go through them!
bad,Its not what it was and won't be again. Good for high school kids and potheads. They just use good workers up these days. Use them for tuition reimbursement and move on. They don't really even promote from within the company anymore. If your a good liar you might make it.
bad,"The work was fun and customers could be great, but not enough compensation for the amount of work necessary per shift.  Nor were there enough staff to complete all work necessary."
bad,"Condescending manager that doesn't care about employees. Constant call outs and no call no shows- no type of consequences. A lot of uneducated workers who insist in fighting other employees, on and off the clock..."
bad,"This job is a real test while the atmosphere with your co workers is always a blast the people who come in to Starbucks treat the workers terribly, frequently criticized for simply trying to do their job and no respect for the people behind the counter"
bad,"Je suis déçu car j'aimais bien bosser la bas j'ai eu un accident et toute monde m'en a mi pleins la figure"
bad,Lack of management. The manger in West Bloomfeild is very unprofessional and disrespectful. Make sure to choose wisely at what Starbucks you choose to work at.
bad,"Unfortunately, my experience was far from enjoyable. My mental health suffered massively from this employment. I would like to say that the majority of the team are great people, however the management make it very difficult for you to feel like a human being."
bad,"Apart from having the name ‘Starbucks’ it is far from company. Upper management do not care, no HR, irregular payroll (and payroll management). Will happily let good staff walk away."
bad,"Unfortunately i work for a franchise store through K Beverage,no full time positions available with the franchise, no real perks as such, slightly above minimum wage which for a supervisor running shift, cashing up, bancking etc is very poor, most of the team are on a six hour contract,"
bad,Not nessacerially Starbucks but the people who work in portrack Starbucks are awful too work for never had no time too help new starters and basically just employed people of friend groups or friends of friends .. one also has a disgusting attitude too new starters all members of staff were very two faced
bad,"Based on the location, management could be better & a little more supportive instead of being one sided. Baristas feel like they can do w/e they please w/o getting in trouble."
bad,"Starbucks takes all the joy out of coffee. Most days I'd go home with migraines from the stressful, loud environment combined with next to no support from management. The job titles (other than Manager) are a joke and the benefits package is laughable. Avoid working here."
bad,"You work a lot get not much in return some managers think they are God almighty, they head office is always on your hear if you don't lick their a**es you'll get nowhere. Wages are a joke after years they'll give you a few cents thinking that's a lot barely above minimum wage."
bad,"Súper poco tiempo de adaptación, encargada borde y con malas formas"
bad,Do not work as a store manager at Starbucks in this area!!! The upper management tell you 40 hours then work you to death. When you speak up that you are burned out and need to take some of the many vacation days they give you they  do not try to support your store and you are not allowed to take it unless you have everything running smoothly. The stores in this area are ALL high volume so they never run smoothly for very long. Thought I was set for life and what a big disappointment!
bad,"terrible experience , co workers and manager were disrespectful and the job is very overwhelming the manager is very petty i put in my 2 weeks to be professional and she just told me to not back i even came for a shift , and she sent me off."
bad,"A toxic and harmful work environment due to use of drugs on premises! The baristas most are high or having severe drug addiction! The CORPORATE cares about their money & do not care about a serious complaint! If you want to learn about a covered up way to do drugs. Then "
bad,"Fun environment with coworkers. Not so fun when management isn't held accountable for actions. Fast-paced environment, stressful without the proper deployment on the floor. Often times short staffed. Not enough hours. Good for part-time work."
bad,"This place really only cared about production numbers. There benefits were great and pay was good but biggest complaint is having mandatory overt at 12hrs a day, six days a week."
bad,"At first it was a fine job, then the manager at the time slacked off and then it felt like I was back in high school with all the needless drama not to mention it felt like no one had your back while there."
bad,"I’s a very quick paced environment, so be prepared for that, but manageable over time. The problem was ir was absolutely impossible to find coverage for anything because every store overworks its employees so finding partners to cover your shift from all around rarely works- you call stores and get numbers to call for people who aren’t working that day, and these employees don’t know you and won’t give up their one free day to cover for you obviously. They also treat symptoms like vomiting as a biohazard and send you home but not diarrhea, which it is, and I had a terrible virus once and needed to go to the doctor immediately but they made me wait around an hour while I was in the back calling stores nonstop to find immediate coverage. You can request days off 30 days in advance but if you don’t get it you’re responsible for finding coverage and if you can’t you get disciplined, even if it’s something you absolutely can’t miss. Glad I quit."
bad,felt it was more of a retail store instead of restaurant.  Disregard for proper handling of food contamination and health codes.  Also had high hopes for a career with company until realizing that experience and knowledge in restaurant industry is seen as a bad thing...
bad,"Fuiez..."
bad,Very clicky and judgemental. If you do not fit in to their click then consider yourself miserable everyday. No respect for you as a person or your authority as a manager nor do the managers have eachothers backs. It's more about the friendships than whats best for the business.
bad,"Noen ledere på hovedkontoret er veldig bastante og tunnelsynte ledere som ødelegger arbeidskvaliteten. "
bad,"Corporate does not value their front-line retail workers who actually interact with their customers. Stores are understaffed, under-trained and management does not support its workers. Toxic, unprofessional and disrespectful workplace. I would not recommend working for Starbucks."
bad,"Starbucks is a corporate company that cares about one thing and one thing only, MONEY. They do the bare minimum to satisfy their employees basic needs but past that they are your typical greedy corporation that will do anything to make more money."
bad,"inhumane company, wild customers, physically and mentally taxing. little pay. not flexible. everyone who works at Starbucks develops a a very apathetic attitude towards life and has a hard time getting out of the environment due to an unbelievable work load expectations."
bad,"The summary says it all. This job was nothing but stressful. I met some wonderful people who were my coworkers, but that has nothing to do with the company of Starbucks. It is run quite horribly in overall treatment of employees."
bad,"Working at Starbucks was fun (for the worst two weeks). This company makes everybody but their partners happy. I was EXTREMELY overworked and under-payed until i couldn't handle it anymore. But management is great and cooperative, coworkers support each other, and customers make your day."
bad,"Coworkers were very rude, tips were never on time, customers were the best and the reason I worked there for so long. The customers loved me, so therefore I had a reason to wake up and get to work on time and serve my customers with a great big smile and a joyful greeting."
bad,"After being with this company for only a couple months I've realized the store manager was the issue. Multiple people have admitted and quit due to that fact, me included. Supervisors weren't recognized , and baristas were always gossiped about by the Store Manager."
bad,"You don't get paid enough, managers aren't capable of making schedules that fit the needs of everybody, not everybody is held to the same standard, low wages"
bad,"Starbucks is awful and very biased. They play favorites when it comes to promotion etc. You do happen to learn a ton of knowledge working for them though, and the benefits used to be great"
bad,I loved working for Starbucks.. however I soon found out that it was mostly filled with petty drama and if you didn’t fit into a certain mold you weren’t welcome or made to feel like you didn’t belong
bad,"Starbucks was  a difficult place to work because of the sheer amount of shift supervisors and manager, it was almost impossible to learn ""the correct"" way to do something. There were constant contradictory statements and the blame always fell on the barista instead of the management when the training was inadequate."
bad,"i currently work at starbucks and i dread going in every single day. the people i work with do not know how to treat other people or customers.  not only are the co workers rude, but customers treat us terribly as well.  the hours are extremely harsh and i as exhausted throughout the rest of my day.  my boss is a great guy, one of the nicest people i have ever met in my life, but when problems are brought up he does absolutely nothing to handle them."
bad,"I was never told the truth about the job from day one.  They lied about the pay, and they lied about the job, they also lied about everything from the start.  I worked hard everyday and cross trained on all jobs in my department.  When it was time for my review it was done by supervisors who didn't work in my department."
bad,"This particular location was in a heavily populated area of college students, and made for many new faces and a general laze-fare attitude towards employee needs"
bad,"starbucks was a friendly environment It would helped people that had work or had to be at work early in the am so having a french vanilla coffee would helped brighten up their day as barista that was our responsibilities  their would also be people that would like to come in and do their homework or assignments they had to do the environment overall was a good place for our customers to bring joy into the store also we had good food services as well we had egg and sausages that went out like hot cakes we had other food that customers loved that would sell out also our drive thru was pretty popular as well we had a line that would go pass the bank and cars would be lined up to have their drinks because starbucks was that good and people loved it as cashiers as a barista's or at the drive thru we had to make are costumers happy and satisfied "
bad,Starbucks over all was a great place to work with great. benefits but sadly I had a store where the manager wasn’t a good manager he was young and his attitude was not manager like
bad,They suck they have no help everyone needs to get a new role in also need more Professionalism in the place.................…….....................OH our managers need to be re-hired
bad,"Most of my day is spent managing a floor of student workers. While the job is fast paced and a lot to handle at times, it is not a bad job. However, Aramark as a company makes it very difficult to pay their employees a fair wage and they make it very difficult to give promotions and raises."
bad,"worst place to work. management was horrible. They tell you, you get all these benefits but do not. The job was easy work but that's about it. Wouldn't recommend this job to anyone"
bad,I am no fan of starbucks! I worked there for years and they screwed me over two days before i was suppose to transfer to a different state. that's management for you i guess. they are horrible to their employees and the people picking their coffee beans are getting paid like 1 cent a day don't support it!
bad,"Meet some really nice people made some friends with customers, manager  and supervisors treated staff very unfairly,disappointing really considering such a successful company"
bad,Hated everything about it from the over needy and complicated customer to the cringe worthy company mission statement. Maybe it was just the district that i worked in but my starbucks career was definitely not a time in my life I enjoyed.
bad,"I enjoyed working at the store I worked at with the people I worked with but Starbucks as a company I can't say anything positive about really, the work wasn't particularly difficult and at the store level they do their best to set their employees up for success but after working there for 4 years I felt no respect or care from the company itself, despite claiming to care about their 'partners'."
bad,i very much enjoyed working at starbucks most of my 6 year career however i have personal reasons of unfair treatment by specific management and HR keeping me from giving a good review
bad,The work was fun and I enjoyed the fast-pace but the management at this particular Target was awful. They were constantly understaffed but still expected you to do all of the work that was supposed to be done by multiple people.
bad,"ASM @ Starbucks since Sep 2015. Unfortunately, I was trained by cutthroat, unethical, SM's that were bullies. It became an unbearable, toxic workplace which ultimately led to my medical LOA due to severe occupationl stress. The stress was exacerbated when I ran an entire store by myself for 4 months as the acting store manager only to have it taken away from me overnight. The interim DM simply promoted another ASM b/c they had previously been their shift supervisor. Favoritism was commonplace. I worked tons of OT during my time w/the company, but was always advised that ASM's were not allowed to receive OT, but we were still expected to do the job until it was done no matter how many hours that took. I am still on my LOA and was denied my STD benefits. I am very, very seriously considering getting legal advisement regarding the denial as well all of the unpaid OT. I was so thrilled and honored to be hired as a partner, but over my time w/the company I am utterly disappointed. A fellow SM told me that my 'integrity' would get the best of me at this job....odd because i would think that would be an asset instead of a hinderance to my development. There is sooo much more I could say, but it will end up being a novel. I hope no one ever has the experience I have had while being a partner."
bad,"I don't recommend this job, I didn't have any positive things to say about the job so I instead have decided to talk about the joys of Spaghetti. It's delicious, Spaghetti is rich in flavour and nutrients, especially if you make a wonderful meat sauce comprised of sausage and garlic, it's to die for. And also, if you put a bit of Parmesan and black pepper in there, you can really maximize the flavour. I'll give Spaghetti 5 stars out of 5."
bad,"no existia el trabajo en equipo, lo prometido como experiencia starbuck no existe es pesimo"
bad,"fast paced, a lot excepted of you for little money.Nice co-workers, horrible work environment.  On our feet all day long for 8.36 per hour, lef tup to the co-workers to make decisions"
bad,"Was great working for Starbucks when my original manager was there had a great time, had fun got on with everyone, and then when she left we got a new manager in and he changed everything the way we work and how everything was and this out a divide the store which was a main reason why I left"
bad,Starbucks doesn't care about their employees. they will work you to death with no care about your health or personal life.
bad,The workplace was not a fair place to work. You received hours based on how well you were liked. I was discriminated against at that time and I left due to that situation. This was that ONE specific starbucks which is now closed. I am not under any circumstances referring to other Starbucks at all.
bad,"This was my first job when I was 15, and they paid me under the table. I didn't fill out a tax form and they paid me in cash. I worked far too infrequently to make a sustainable amount. It worked well for a first high school job, but not for anything more. I believe they're out of business now anyway."
bad,"I worked the morning rush hour shift, so the time always flew by."
bad,Co-workers were fun and helpful.  Management did not care about the employees.
bad,Preparing beverage and ensuring quality freshness standards are met
bad,Boring hated packaging one spot hrs 8 or more little rude higher up employees just to much unstructured things going on
bad,I had Customer Service skills my days can be worse but i get the job done.
bad,"Staff constantly on your back, although amazing experience in the store, manger wasnt too friendly, the regular customers are amaing, lots of evets happen"
bad,"Starbucks is growing further from what it started as, and not in a good way. They stretch further from coffee at our core, reaching ever-farther for new customers, while ignoring the regular customers who have been loyal to the coffee and the culture."
bad,"An over-view of a day working a 7-hour shift at Starbucks; hard work of taking out trash, constantly cleaning when no drink was being made. Awful time."
bad,"it was okay , you gain a lot of experience like talking more to people and get to know more people , there was no hard job , its all about how much you can work hard ,"
bad,"Working with lazy people. Want you to break your back for little money. Mangers where cool at times. The hardest day was every Saturday, because we got a big order in, juggling that mess and what is a ludicrous amount of customers for a Starbucks. Peoples addiction to caffeine is magnificent."
bad,"I was never a coffee person so this job was totally different for me. But it was very fun and interesting, my training included workbooks where I had to actually read and answer questions about the products and yes you really had to read and do these workbooks because questions will be asked. It was very different but in a good way because they actually want you to know everything about the product that your selling. They even had you taste everything on the menu whether hot or items you would even have to taste the ""bad"" coffee, that would be the coffee that sat out past its expiration time."
bad,"Starbucks cares more about making money for themselves rather than the wellbeing of their baristas. They purposely cut hours so that they don't have to pay their baristas. "
bad,"I enjoyed this job very much, it was great time of learning and enjoyment of the job itself. We always had a fun time and got the job done as well as giving the very best customer service at all times."
bad,"I loved my coworkers, but I had to give up most of my personal life for my work."
bad,"my typical day at work is getting up early try to do some physical activities get to work whit a positive actitud and try to give the best of me as a person and as a server to my community and try to have a nice enviroment whit my co-workers and all the staff make them have a positive influence on them and make them have a nice day also for the client, another thing i like is that the company gives you the opportunity to grow and develop as a solid man it gives you the chance to work and studie at the same time and this is great because you can start being independent, the most enjoyable part of the job was working whit new people that teaches you a lot of new stuff and as the company grows allows the crew to grow"
bad,"friendly and welcoming staff, enjoyed learning to make the coffees and engaging with the customers."
bad,I’m a former Barista working for Starbucks was the best job ever loved the staff customers where amazing made lots of friends. When I had my interview it was awesome I was welcomed in the cafe it’s an amazing place to be
bad,"Good job for high schoolers but not really people needing to pay bills. Customers can get really mean about coffee, it’s more common than not. It’s alright though ."
bad,One of the companies to work for. The opportunity for growth is constant. One of the greatest perks is the ability to go back to school and attain a bachelors degree online fully reimbursed!
bad,"Greet the customer as they come to the register. You take drink order, get them their food if they wan it. If it's busy, you work as a team to complete this. The bar drinks can sometimes be tricky to make due to the many varieties that people ask for. Steaming milk can be challenge to get the right anount of foam. Being very polite and customer orinted and wiling to work as team is extremely important."
bad,"Open/Close store."
bad,"Thought it would be great but lack of staff meant longer hours and days. Management have no idea on what happens in store."
bad,"Most drinks are commonly consumed."
bad,"I worked here for nearly two years. As an employee, I was constantly pressured to work while sick, to ignore my health and safety, and disobey policy. When my coworker fell on the ice going to work one day, dislocating his hip, I covered his shift so he wouldn’t be written up even though he had to go to the hospital. As a woman, I was frequently harassed by a select few customers that were never asked to leave or stop . When I was terminated, it was because I complained about how mid shift never did their dishes and left it all on closing shift and that manager fabricated that I got violent."
bad,"Great store great brand great drinks the customer base is the absolute worse I mean I get they “pay the bills” but holy moly "
bad,I never had a sense of value in the company and had an education and advise outside my initial role. For Starbucks culture a more organic mainmast structure would benefit the company.
bad,"The managers were very rude and stressful. A milk crate fell on me once and they could not do anything about it. It is very fast-paced and stressful."
bad,Can't follow their own rules and awful rota schedules. Actually awful but could work better with better management hiring staff. Do not follow staff availability that they have. Blind leading the blind. Sign people off too soon just to  get that position filled but only 2 weeks of training. Utter joke.
bad,manager was lazy and blamed night staff for all problem was never around to help or answer.questions trianing was a joke. 3 weeks in 3 days staff very unhappy.
bad,"Starbucks had its fun moments. I learned how to provide great customer service. Management needed to be tighten up. Workplace could've been better for the employees. Hardest part was  work life balance. Customer service is what I enjoyed the most, I had some awesome experiences."
bad,"It's a nice experience and extremely fast paced which I did love but they do start you off bare minimum, even though management was bragging about my previous work history. Was told I would be promoted just to never hear anything again about it."
bad,My supervisor took a lot of things very personal. Which I know it is started taking effect on the other workers. Since she only had girls working on most of the shifts there was a lot of drama what shouldn't have been in the workplace.
bad,"I do not recommend working here. It is a stressful environment that does not allow for people to freely be themselves. Also, it's just depressing. There is too much going on all the time. It definitely needs more organization."
bad,Heavy work load with very little appreciation or compensation. Stressful environment. The most enjoyable part of the job was satisfying customers. The most difficult part of the job was the heavy responsibility without feeling appreciated for going above and beyond.
bad,Very stressful and do not give you the state mandatory breaks one needs. Poor pay and poor team effort. No body likes to help one another. Horrible training.
bad,Don’t work at this Starbucks you will be screwed over after your 3rd week of working there and sometimes you can’t get a break. The management is horrible they don’t know what they are doing. The work is easy but learning the pumps and shots can be confusing sometimes. The hardest part of this job is taking a lot of orders at a time so customers don’t get mad if you take too long. The most enjoyable part is working with the coworkers and making new drinks and discovering new drinks.
bad,Anyone can get hired. Training is not done chronologically. So your picking up the slack of other workers. Getting stress from customers and the manager who’s blind to the fact
bad,Had horrible management and team members. Entire store was toxic and unwilling to change. Tried for nearly 2 years to get the store in a good position but nothing worked.
bad,"Constantly understaffed, underappreciated, and underpaid. The amount of stress and time put into this job was not worth the pay at all whatsoever. I worked for this company for almost 5 years and was getting paid the same as someone who worked there for 3 years. I worked my tail off and did everything i could for this company."
bad,Poor managment. Employees are numbers not people. Power tripping individuals. Disrespectful superiors who talk down to you. No potential to grow. I don't reccomend if you want to grow and build with a company. More of a pitstop.
bad,"Fast-paced atmosphere that is always changing its Rules and Menu. When you finally learn everything, they introduce new food/ drinks to memorize. The manager is always on everyone's case to be Perfect when they cannot maintain that themselves.... and no mistakes are allowed. You get Written up immediately, even if you did not make a mistake but one of your Co-workers made the mistake. Terrible Management."
bad,It was a bad place to work I did not like the environment or the managers and they did not consider if you had personal problems or emergencies and scheduling was horrible.
bad,"The job was not paid enough and we were not allowed to accept tips. very stressful and not a fun place to work. Would not recommend to anyone, only had this job because I needed something on campus."
bad,"At this Starbucks their not enough employees so the 4 fully trained baristas were consistently running around doing 2 to 4 jobs at once. With that being said MULTIPLE people complained so baristas were always getting ""talked"" to. People would go as far as to complain if i had to close down the counter while on my 30. i worked inside a target so i did NOT get any of the real Starbucks perks (EX: free food while on the clock, free drinks, tips.)"
bad,"The workplace was extremely stressful with employees calling out all the time and management doing nothing about it. However, management would write up employees for the smallest of things. Poor respect for authority and overall poor employee work ethic. Extremely stressful job."
bad,"If you don't mind working part time, this is the job for you. Starbucks doesn't give any labor so prepare to work HARD. Yes you get a pay raise but that means less hours and more work, especially if you are at a very busy location."
bad,The pay was great if you actually got hours. But management is horrible they do not make sure that you understand the job they just expect you to know
bad,I did not enjoy working at Starbucks at all. There were tensions between staff members and a major push from the managers to go above and beyond regular duties and responsibilities. They had no accountability or responsibilities and were unfair and rude to their staff.
bad,Working at Starbucks was not ideal. The management was unfair with hours. Scheduling was always an issue. Favoritism was given to employees whom the manager liked.
bad,"the job was too much to handle for one person, they had no training program,the mangier was not willing to negotiate and i was let go for going to the hospital and called out for 2 days. they refused to train properly or compensate a reasonable pay for the work that was going on the only plus to working hear is the free coffee or things that broke during shipping and handling."
bad,"Split shifts - I would be scheduled two hours for the morning rush and then scheduled for two more hours for the after school rush. "
bad,"The only good thing are the people I work with.  We have gone through 4 managers in 7 months.  I feel like I am working in a position of a high school mentality.  If you are looking for full time work...do not look at Starbucks.  Full time is unheard of unless you are a manager.  It is a very demanding job and there is very hard manual labor involved where you think there would not be.  Unless you are in college or just need some extra spending money, this is not a job for you."
bad,"It's pretty intense working at Starbucks. I'm not sure if it's the location of the store I'm not liking, the management, or just the company in general. I feel like they don't treat their ""partners"" as partners."
bad,"Not a nice environment, mean shift leaders, hard to get along with, I ended up cleaning the starbucks cafe a lot because it was always filthy and unstocked and I was being yelled at to do the tasks I was already doing.  The inspector came in and was upset and the employees and management did not care it was dirty and they scolded us in the present in front of the inspector  but behind the scenes they did not care at all if things were dirty and unstocked. I was also treated like garbage in the food ave side."
bad,"If you're looking for a fun, but quick paced job this is the place for you. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customer interactions you get to do on the daily."
bad,"Not a career. They never promote within the company, they always hire outside. There is always drama, no matter what store. I did make some lifelong friends though and the free drinks/food is cool  I guess."
bad,Stressful. Not a great workplace.  There isn't enough help. Manager is not the best to work with. Not a very understanding person. Refuses to give days off.
bad,"Starbucks was a different experience. I enjoyed learning to make the multiple variety of beverages provided by the establishment and run the register. I enjoyed the culture friendly environment however management made my job a problem. Inspite of a excellent 3 weeks training, I was not given a proper schedule. I was told the night prior to me having to show to work I had to be there. Communication between employee and management was obsolete."
bad,"Overall the Company is great, but the Utah shops are an embarrassment. They are in the GOOD Ol Boy style."
bad,"back to back shifts, making drinks, cleaning "
bad,"A typical day at Starbucks required attentive listening, professional courtesy, manage interpersonal relationships in an ethical manner, and maintaining company policies. I learned how to deal with diversity and demographics of all races. The management and co-workers strive hard to maintain total quality services. The hardest part of the job was dealing with chronic complainers. I loved the opportunity to help people and I have lifetime friends from working at Starbucks for 5 years."
bad,Supervisors and Management caused a lot of tension with staff by treating everyone unfairly. They forced rules on some employees but not others.  If you aren't there 15 minutes before time you're considered late and most likely you are going to sit outside for the 15 minutes until they decide to show up for work.  Supervisors had no control of their shift; completely unorganized.
bad,"Run into any former long time Starbucks employee and you'll share a special bond. This is the hardest place I've ever worked, and I was in the infantry for 2 years. At least when you join the army, it's understood that you'll be treated like complete s#!t. At starbucks, they want to push this idea of the ""third place"" where its an extension of your living room and you feel at home. Well, you night feel like home but the barrista sure doesn't, because they have to make the coffee, run the cash register, mop the floors, clean the dishes, clean the toilets up after homeless junkines, all for minimum wage. How do they manage to get all this from their employees? the same way any oppressive organization does it, get the people to police themselves! your coworkers are much more ruthless than managers will ever be. I don't regret my year and a half working there, because it was honest work and I learned a lot, but don't fool yourself into thinking it'll be some easy part time job while in school."
bad,Management and wages  here were poor and lead to a very high turnover.
bad,wasn't a good place to work at when I was there but that was a long time ago don't know how it is now.
bad,I didnt like working here because my manager always made me work alone on holidays and only trained me for the job for one day with her then put me into the kiosk by myself not knowing what to do.
bad,"There's a lot of pro and cons to working here. GREAT benefits but there is such a huge turn over rate, even with the managers. Cooperate loves to cut hours after holidays to leave the part time employees with nothing while the managers still get what they need. I love the work but hate the atmosphere they the managers create."
bad,Starbucks is an okay job if you know your not going to be there for long.  The managers kind of expect you to know everything and learn real fast. Also the store manager wasn’t a big help either
bad,"Management is terrible."
bad,"I was thankfully tipped off to my work hours (usually 35/wk) dropping to around 18 if I was LUCKY during our off-season (February-August). This is a job for a college student, not for someone trying to make a living."
bad,"Working for Starbucks probably just wasn’t for me, I worked for the company for a year, showing up on time, in dress code and with a great attitude everyday. Being put in difficult situations every time I was at work, being called in ever day even when I wasn’t working, and being over loaded with work. It was a very stressful environment, with little to no help from managers. I will say if you are taking advantage of the benefits it might be worth the struggle."
bad,"The Starbucks inside of Price Cutter may seem to run somewhat smoothly to customers, but management is awful. (I also worked as a cashier and office manager in the grocery store.) The store manager is incredibly rude, careless, and does not value his employees. Management for Starbucks itself is definitely subpar, mostly because training for the position is also.. subpar.. I did not feel valued as an employee regardless of my hard work and flexibility for this establishment."
bad,A typical work day requires remembering the little things such as restocking product behind the bar and merchandise stocking to the big things such as quality control of making beverages and customer support. Social skills are a requirement to create specials moment for guests. Communication is needed with coworkers to convey the needs for the present and future.
bad,"Starbucks pays way less than they should- ESPECIALLY for the labor worked. This was the worst job I have ever had because customers are rude and the company cares more about production than their own workers. Some of my co-workers were awesome and the other ones, couldn’t care less about my existence."
bad,They don’t have a union. You don’t get good tips. You get maid min wage. It’s really not a great place to work for anyone over the age of 18. Be a waitress. Not a barista.
bad,"Favortism, bullying, harassment on the floor by coworkers and supervisors. If you tell, you are targeted and eventually fired. Temps are put in an environment like college hazing....DO NOT APPLY HERE!"
bad,"Customers treat you so poorly it is shameful, they are always right in managements eyes and you will always be wrong. Expect to be treated like human garbage."
bad,"Mission statement means nothing  Treat employee like under valued people  Not inspiring, more like slave drivers   Who can live on 9.50 an hour part time"
bad,"The pay, as well as benefits used to be much better, labor cuts, micromanagement from senior leaders, as well as incompatible goals has left the job lacking- I can’t remcomened enough to walk away/don’t apply."
bad,"Customers are horrible people, you have to deal with them with no thanks given, you're busting your butt for minimum wage and it doesn't get you anywhere. Lots of physically demanding work to do. Didn't learn anything other than not to drink the corporate kool aid. Management is absolutely awful, turnover is high which is a good thing because the company only promotes incompetent people. I'm not bitter I worked there a really long time but its true. Catty, drama filled, and unsupportive work environment."
bad,not worth the minimum wage you get paid. corporate does not care about their employees they only care about customer satisfaction even at the expense of employees. Overworked and under appreciated.
bad,"The company refers to its employees as partners, but make no mistake they do not treat their employees with respect.  Some ""partners"" would often be scheduled for 10 hours but often called in to take over a shift that someone called out for.  Upper management was concerned with too many people of the same ethnicity working in the same location because according to them we would all try and call out on the same day.  It was assumed that because I spoke the same language as my coworkers that I had to be related to them. Constantly understaffed and reprimanded for things we had no control over."
bad,"The only people I would recommend this job to are those looking to get a Bachelor's degree who are willing to do the ASU online program. Other than that, this job is riddled with terrible, incompetent managers who ask too much with too little staffing. Job is stressful and customers are some of the worst people you will ever encounter. Pay for a supervisor is only $14.66/hour (less than most retail places pay starting) and you will be expected to devote ALL of your time to the company."
bad,"I enjoyed my coworkers greatly, but our manager didn’t know how to lead us. They constantly scheduled incorrectly, and several employees quit in the middle of shifts out of frustration."
bad,The job isn't what's hard. The job is quite easy and straightforward. The problem lies with either the management or fellow employees. Lack of accountability. Poor compensation as far as pay vs. living wages. Managers constantly scheduling outside of availability and disregarding time off requests because of lack of staffing or ability to write a competent schedule. Absolutely no quality of life if you're in a store with a bad manager.
bad,I liked working here I just thought our manager was in responsible and lacked on communication. I was left by myself a couple of times while their was people in line waiting to be helped.
bad,"Very high demands, with little rewards. This environment was stressful and not enjoyable. Management only care about themselves and how to make their own achievements."
bad,"I applied because I loved coffee and I have an unconventional appearance and it looked fun."
bad,I dont like it very much thats whty i am leaving beceause it makes me jaded and sad and its very physicalld hard work and Im tired and I need a change.
bad,The managers were super rude. Maybe part of it was that I worked an early shift. The only good thing was free drinks. They worked around my class schedule for a semester then insisted the second semester that if I wanted to keep the job I had to work during a time I had class.
bad,"Starbucks baristas need a union. If you want to remain as the working poor please continue your application to Starbucks.From store managers and up, the only thing that matters is their sales targets. it's insulting to anyone who wants to give ""genuinely legendary customer service"""
bad,"Starbucks Coffee Company has spent 4 years cutting labor so bad that employees regularly have mental breakdowns on the floor because they are expected to do 15 different tasks at once. You are offered insurance benefits for a part time job which is great, but you have to be working over 20 hours, which can often vary by location but you are often never given. Stores are expected to make each order in less than 30 seconds, but some drink recipes require more than 30 seconds to make. The company releases training material on respecting others but does nothing when employees are verbally abused by customers and middle management."
bad,"Overall the job is a good temporary career. I’ve heard several different opinions on the work experience with Starbucks but, what I’ve heard mainly is compliants about how they treat their partners. It’s a very hard job to be calm in that’s for sure. But the management is just very intimidating and rude and there’s not much wiggle room with failure, it seems, with new partners. Partners should not be having mental break downs in the back room bc of the lack of sensitivity in the work place"
bad,Never would work there again.  Hours are horrible. Tips suck. Not enough pay for the work you do.  To stressful depending on the location you work. And don't ever call out sick.
bad,It seems like anyone could do this job with ease but on a daily basis people prove me wrong. managers are unreasonable and dont stick to anything they say. DONT work here
bad,"Before employment we watch a video indicating the sustainability and  fair trade nature of Starbucks. However, the food waste, plastic waste, and lack of recycling is disgusting. It makes the video seem like green washing or window dressing, which shows lack of integrity. On my first shift I was required to make one of each drink, only to have them thrown away immediately. This is absolutely shameful."
bad,miscommunication across the board. and with the struggle of being hired as a starbucks barista but really be an albertsons employee meant every dispute or situation was handled by someone who wasnt apart of the starbucks family and poorly conducted the management and execution of resolving issues.
bad,"Though you may think there is an opportunity to grow, your future with the company is decided by management. Management does not d a good job of utilizing and growing potential talent. "
bad,The fact i have no choice in writing this and am required to add to my hatred of the company. They sit on their pedestal acting as though they care about their employees and the environment when in all realty could care less. It's just a corporate money grubbing company and I wish they would own that and I might actually have respect for the company.
bad,I was told I was a mean hearted person after a mistake in the schedule which resulted in an 8 hr shift on a Saturday BY MYSELF.  I had a mental breakdown because there was no support or backup.  I was unable to take my breaks because there was no one to cover for me.
bad,"Too many meetings, lack of employees with technical skills, No clear guidelines/direction/strategy from upper management. Chaotic work environment, No clear/realistic plans"
bad,Not paid enough for what’s expected.  Some partners have bad work ethics.   People make company decisions without ever working in a store.  They make tiles for you to follow. And then sometimes when you follow them. They get mad that you did.    But I guess it’s a better company to work for on the fast food world than others.
bad,This company is all talk and no follow-up.  Loyal employees who have worked their way up the company ladder for years are treated like dirt and are not given the power to improve the workplace.
bad,"If they say they're hiring full-time, they're lying. Starbucks staffs a copious amount of people with terrible hour distribution so they can avoid giving employees benefits. Hours across the board have been cut, and has become significantly more stressful with less staffing, low pay, and weekly double star days and happy hours with minimal staff. People are scheduled 5.75 hours daily to avoid giving half hour breaks, and 8 hour shifts are usually only available for shift supervisors."
bad,"In the beginning, it was okay to work at this establishment but the long hours working behind the register or changing trash became boring, it no longer became challenging nor fulfilling."
bad,Do not work here if you have school. It is a terrible company who does not really care about their employees. You will get understaffed constantly and your mental capacity will shrink as a result of working here
bad,I would be the closer most the time so id come it about mid-day. There would maybe be 2 people working before me but when I came in I would work alone. It would get really busy and I had to struggle to make everyone happy by myself but it was alright. Barely ever got tips because I was told we couldnt get any but the other workers got tips so it was really confusing.
bad,Co workers weren’t honest with each other. Management was either always late or never showed up to work. Some days were aggravating  where we would short on staff and management would do nothing.
bad,"Don't work at Starbucks, but if you like under pressure jobs and don't mind Not having a life outside of work then that's up to you. It does provide a lot of benefits but they don't pay the employees enough..."
bad,"I got the job at Starbucks thinking it would be so fun to work at. Boy was I wrong. The employees that had been there for awhile were very rude, and treated u like you were stupid because u didn’t know something( that u were never trained about) I worked there for 7 months before i was even taught how to make drinks. I’m a very hard worker and was treated so bad. I would go come crying because I’ve never worked some where that I was treated so badly."
bad,As s shift supervisor I had a lot of responsibilities of my own while making surethe team was in good conditions. I work morning shift so we are required to meet competitive company drive thru times so the store manager looks good. The hardest part is the under staffing to keep abor down to keep store mangers bonuses up. I love the customer connections.. but a lot of the partners are impatient and not very understanding. My favorite part of the job is creating hand made beverages fastly and smoothly
bad,"Would I accept a position to work here again? No. It's a sinkhole of my productivity. Everyday I put all my energy into the shift and watch it get wasted by the time I come back. Any single positive interaction I have a with a customer is replaced with 3 bad interactions. If I deep clean one area the following shift fails to do the minimum cleaning on another area. "
bad,This is a review for Starbucks at Barnes and Noble College and has nothing to do with Starbucks the corporation. The hardest part about this job is the environment and the other staff. Management is poor and does not take responsibility for any of their own mistakes.
bad,"I worked at two differen't licensed locations in two different states.The first one I worked at in Columbia, MD was alright. I did get the hours I needed and I was crosstrained for other Target positions to pick up shifts if I needed the hours. "
bad,"Learn as you go."
bad,"Manager was highly unprofessional. Would make rude comments, try to deny bathroom breaks because they cost her too much in labor. Frequently called employees minutes before a shift to cut them."
bad,"Both Starbucks I worked at had very poor management. While I enjoyed most of my co-workers, there was very little accountability and serious discord between day and night shifts.  The presentation on interview sounds great!  But the reality is much different - but again, management would ultimately play a huge role in your experience. Keep in mind - I'm 50 yrs old with many years experience in business sector.  My expectations are much different than someone younger, however, my co-workers picked up on many of the management issues as well."
bad,"I sought out a job at SBUX for it's values. However, in very short order, it became apparent that they don't make it to the stores. Your culture is only as good as your district manager and most district managers were over extended, shady, or out right incompetent. "
bad,But working with people like ignorance or like layback management is sucks . I had an opportunity to learnt most of it from this job. I’m hoping that it goes better every day and glad I was part of team
bad,"Es happert überall"
bad,"They pay you as little as possible, while expecting you to go above and beyond your job. Management doesn’t care about you, they just want you to show up. Staff is often stressed and over worked, because it is mentally exhausting it often leads to people calling in sick more often. Full-time is anything higher than 32 hours, and unless you pick up shifts you will NOT receive 40 hours. Customers are rude and you will get in trouble for not sticking to the “customers always right” even if it goes against company policy for safety reasons (steaming water)."
bad,"The leadership has changed 4 times in a year, causing constant changes in values and job culture. They do not promote from within, but rather continue to change   leadership with external candidates. It makes it impossible to move up in the company or advance."
bad,"I was working there while finishing my education to obtain Bachelor's degree.  The staff turnover was terrible, and the atmosphere was not encouraging or fun."
bad,"Starbucks is a great first job, but in order to advance in life and earn more money a second job is beyond necessary if you are wanting to stay with Starbucks. I would like to work 40 hours per week and not feel dog tired and still stressed about money."
bad,Poor management. Mangers got away with whatever. Calling corporate doesn't help. My Husband worked for this corporation as well. Manager verbally abused and would physically shove him.
bad,"Not fair advancement opportunities and a very harsh point system. Give a Allowance for lunch, but if busy dont have time to eat or use lunch discount."
bad,"I have nothing to say about this place. There is nothing that I want to tell, I want to keep it in the past. It was just a job to pay my bills. I did not like it and don't want to go back."
bad,"Not a fan of work culture, management, or the treatment of employees. Terrible pay. Not enough training. Want to see the company invest a bit more in their employees."
bad,Your experience at Starbucks depends on if you have a good management team or not. The stores in Cranford as of today both equally are terrible places to work at. For starters the head managers all give lip service: meaning they say one thing but do something completely different. They never listen and when you give them constructive criticism they take it personally and become even worse. They do not care about their employees whatsoever and are extremely selfish
bad,Starbucks sells you the idea of working there as something amazing. It really isn't. It is very stressful and the management is just terrible. They sell you the idea that you can grow as an employee and that the sky is the limit. I met people that had been there for 5-6 years and they were still waiting for a promotion. Overall I was very disappointed since I quit my management job at a restaurant for Starbucks when they told me that I would be a manager in 6 months. The only perk about it is that they have decent benefits. Other than that I do not recommend it.
bad,If you are over 20 years old you will be treated poorly and be shunned. The management is judgmental. Hardest part of the job is picking up the slack of you other employees. Lazy staff Lazy Manager.
bad,A job at Starbucks is perfect for those writing ground-breaking case studies on the human race in their most vulnerable state. Or for anyone who enjoys nearly crying every day before work.
bad,"The stand-alone stores may be a different matter entirely, but my experience working at a starbucks inside a grocery store was this: "
bad,The company that has the license to run the Starbucks is brand new at this. Management is very unreliable and no advancement is available. Typical day is making coffee and taking care of students orders.
bad,"If you are looking for something that's not serious, this is the job for you. There needs to be more support from management  and the other departments."
bad,Expect to not have a great work life balance at starbucks. Their goal is to make money at the cost of their employees and good people. They will drive you into the ground and overload you until you break then replace you.
bad,"Upon starting, I provided my school schedule to the manager. I stated which  days I absolutely could not work. Everything started off great until I befriended a supervisor, which whom they did not like. From there, I was only scheduled on the days I could not work, but schedule off on the days I stated I could work. I worked many hours while still in school and never let any issue between myself or manager have an affect on my work ethic. They were eventually fired and replaced with a new manager whom I respect very much. I unfortunately resigned due to having to focus more on school at the time."
bad,I have worked for this company for years and although I understand why food and drive throughs have been heavily partnered with stores I feel that the European cafe experience is lost. Expectations are high  and the pace is relentless.
bad,"Worst job Ive had so far. Terrible management and customers are very rude. The only good thing about this job is the coworkers are like family but besides that, its awful."
bad,Worked at thw starbucks and kemah boardwalk was fun in the beginning as a first time job but management was terrible and extremely unorganized would never work there again
bad,Horrible company pumping high fructose corn syrup into everyone. Most customers were cranky and rude. Highschool kids would come in every day and clog up your line for an hour wanting waters. And the food we sold was just terrible. Full of tons of artificial things.
bad,I loved working with the other baristas but when it came to working with my manager I really didn't like the job. She was very rude and didn't care about any of the employees and treated all of us poorly. The hardest part of the job was having to work with my manager and her saying I wasn't doing anything right when I was trying my best.
bad,"A week at this job...."
bad,"Very few hours, very hard to make ends meet. Closing shifts could extend working time by a significant amount for the amount of work to do."
bad,"People are pretty confused about Starbucks.  The reviews online are stellar - four-four and a half stars out of 5, right?  But, then there have been the articles (New York Times, 2014; Time, 2015) about how ""miserable"" partners really are.  Well, I was a regular at Starbucks for years before a became a partner, and I'm glad I worked there, because now I know not to support the company at all."
bad,"On a typical day i would get to work about 15 minutes early, and wash get ready to clock in for the day. I would clock in and get straight to work, there is supposed be a book that has all of our duties in it, MOST of the time that wasnt filled out until about 20  minutes before I had to leave and all the tasks they had me do were very long duties, such as wash dishes, sweep and mop floors, clean the bath rooms, sweep drive thru,(hat was all the things i had to do in 20 minutes). Then my assistant manager would be hateful to me and say that i had 8 hours to do all my tasks, when i only had 20 minutes."
bad,They do provide benefits but they don't say they are good benefits. Health insurance is expensive and terrible coverage. Pay is way below livable wage. Some District Managers are just pure bullies and making it a hostile work environment. Age discrimination galore. l harassment by District management rampant. Partner resources is a complete joke.
bad,"A Empresa tem um porte grande,e por ela ter NOME deveria ao menos aumentar suas totais responsabilidades com funcionários.Lá apendi a ter totais responsabilidades,e ""viver""pelo o que faço."
bad,"I find that every day drags as I work in a quiet store. I find that in order to be satisfied with a job, I like to be kept busy. "
bad,"Opening:"
bad,great job with tons of drinks and learn new things everyday but the other employees were rude and went against the rules of the company.
bad,there is absolutely no job security and management couldn't care less about some employees. a typical day at work would include about three people doing about five different jobs.
bad,"Constant changes in management, reorgs and a focus on a “select few” create an environment where you cannot advance and learn or grow as an employee long term"
bad,"Terrible Management"
bad,They don't pay for your skills or quality of work performance. They don't value tenured employees. They don't give consistent hours. They don't give you enough staff to serve customers with quality service.
bad,"The typical day at Starbucks was extremely repetitive. There was a lot of turnover especially in the management department. They would much rather hire from the outside for management so there was NO chance of moving up. Also to be a Shift Manager, the pay only went up a couple dollars and it was NOT worth it. The workers were very cliquey and were overall not very kind."
bad,"if you don't like people/pressure, not for you. have to do several tasks, multitask, get things done even if co-workers decide not to show up and leave you on a busy day with anxiety-causing lines of angry people blaming it all on you; anyway, just because I had a terrible experience, does not mean it will be the same for anyone else."
bad,"Starbucks was a neat experience for a person in school. My manager gave me flexible hours, but at the end of the day, the company is only concerned with money. The company could care less about you as an individual. it almost seemed like the higher the ladder you go in Starbucks the ruder and almost arrogant the upper management became. One of the higher-ups refused to shake my hand because of my position stating,"" I only shake people's hands when they wear suits and ties."" Overall, it was a great learning experience."
bad,Work life balance was tough and management only cared about their bottom line and bonuses do not work here if you plan on making a career out of starbucks because they dont care.
bad,"I worked at Brompton Road, one of the busiest stores in London. "
bad,"My manager was garbage and I never got properly trained I was “trained” for less than a week for everything. But I did get “certified”. I hope you have a better boss, training, or/and experience."
bad,This company only cares about profit and their drive thru times. The only good thing about working for them is the regulars and getting health insurance at part time.
bad,"They are not inclusive or respectful of those who observe religious practices. I was given an ultimatum to stop observing my religious practices or work during college classes. If I refused, I would be cut to 4 hours a week.  HR was less than cooperative.  All of this despite being told the schedule could work around my classes when hired."
bad,"This was a difficult job. After being assigned back to back close open shifts twice a week with only a few hours of work, I decided this job was not worth my time."
bad,"In sum, the partners are very clique-y and there is a lot of favoritism. If you aren't fast enough for drive times or in general, they'll leave you to take orders. Furthermore, there's no growth opp. unless you are very fast @ the job & you show ur managers u want it; very hard though. Pay isn't good because every barista doesn't get paid the same even if u do the same tasks. I'd say work at IN N OUT for a part time jb or another, not SBUX."
bad,I would not recommend working here. Most of our employees quit because of mental health reasons. It is ridiculously stressful for very little pay. Management asks for way too much from the baristas while not even paying $10 an hour. Very little opportunity to move up.
bad,"The specific Starbucks location I worked at last year was extremely disorganized from the top down. The constant rotation of District Managers caused increased confusion for our store manager and thus our store ran poorly throughout the year I was there. The training was extremely relaxed for a coffee chain who prides itself on keeping up with ongoing trends. Unfortunately, the company is too focused on making Instagramable and kid-friendly beverages, which at face value seems okay; however, once you are the one making the drink while customers complain about wait times and other nuisances it gets to be a bit much for minimal pay."
bad,I had an amazing time until we switched over managers. She gave everyone a hard time which made me pressure that working there was not the life that was meant for me and that I need to advance in life to have the career that I would love to have in the near future.
bad,As a store manager for starbucks you are required to work any and all shifts that employees call in on.  So an 8 hour day can quickly turn into a 16 hour day.
bad,"I worked at Starbucks in Fort Lauderdale/ Hollywood Airport , and the management was awful , and the place was not thoroughly cleaned after each shift. I mentioned to my supervisor and was ignored. I LIKE THE BUSINESS MODEL,  But it was not at this place, I asked for a transfer to another location ( in  supermarket ) which was better in cleanliness , but , still had a bad manager."
bad,It said full time and later found out it was part time. Rude employees across the store. Does not train well. Wont get rid of bad employees. Blame you for everything. HORRIBLE CUSTOMERS!  Expect you to know everything. You will get pulled to do one hundred things at once. It is not worth it if you have a degree. Go somewhere and find a better job
bad,"I had worked with the company for almost 5 years at two other stores before coming to Oregon. The job is stressful but with the right atmosphere it can be a fun and challenging place to work. This location however has a manager who has no sense of team work, goes against Starbucks standards, is dishonest, and is very disrespectful and unprofessional to her employees especially in regards to family and health issues. "
bad,I was tired constantly and not given requested time off often. Causing me to ask all my coworkers for help covering my shifts. Making me ostracized as the one who didnt like work when I just wasnt given needed time off. It's a game of social gymnastics where if they like you they show it if not you know it.
bad,"Starbucks is a very unique work environment in that two employees working at the same store at the same time can have two very different experiences working there. My experience started very positively but ended with me cursing the company and everything it stood for."
bad,"The forced corporate structure, along with the focus on speed and profitability, create a poor consumer coffee experience and lower quality products, as well as put unnecessary stress on its employees"
bad,There is a tossup between having great and terrible management. Depends on location. The pay is horrible and fixed. Not merit based. Get raises every year only 2%. Every one gets them. Benefits are nice if you can afford to take part in them. Shifts make much less than starting pay at Chick-fil-A for a regular worker. Understaffed floors especially after mornings and expected to have meaningful conversation s with customers and have DT time s down. They do not truly invest in their stores.
bad,"I loved the customers, the busyness of the store and pressure but management played favorites, played people against each other for the benefit of themselves and super manipulative."
bad,"Working at Starbucks has been, hands down, the most stressful and irritating job to ever have. The management is the worst part. They aren't considerate whatsoever of your life outside of work (i.e. school and social life), make you work the most ridiculous hours, and work you to the bone. This may be because it was a Starbucks owned by a university, but that doesn't change how awful my experience has been."
bad,"If you get put in a store with bad management, this will be a horrible job for you. The way they handle promotions is based very heavily on who the manager's favorites are. The work environment is so fast paced, with customers always being terribly troublesome, and all of that would be fine if starting pay wasn't below $10, abysmal for the amount of work and stress the employees are put through. Bottom line: don't work here unless you want to be overworked and underpaid, with a great chance of having a bad management team."
bad,"Todos ao entrarem , recebem treinamento dos próprio colaboradores que estão há anos no mesmo cargo e fazem de tudo para que você seja minado da companhia, mantém relações diretas com outros superiores e o Feedback da gerência é dada pelos baristas. Muito aquém do que eu enxergava da empresa."
bad,Team work does not exist there. Everyone is rude and you aren’t allowed to stop working for a second. you’re always being told what to do. I would not recommend this job to anyone.
bad,My store in particular is very toxic and poorly staffed. We are always short staffed and stretched thin for mediocre pay. It's not worth the time or the energy.
bad,They pay (even for the managers) is so low I dont know how anyone who isnt a store manager can afford to live. It is constantly understaffed because the company is cutting labor. There is no reason for a billion + company cant afford full time- part time hours for all employees. I worked at two locations in two different cities and it was an issue at each. I have multiple friends who worked their way up to manager (after YEARS) and had to leave or step down because of the stress load from being understaffed and unsupported my their district manager.
bad,"Not a good place to work if you have children. My boss was horrible. Hours were never set. Not trained by management, but by other staff. Unpaid, late staff meetings."
bad,"hostile environment when coming in, personal favorites between management. Never knowing how to make coffee, this was the wrong place to learn. Don't work here."
bad,"I used to LOVE working at Starbucks. However it’s not at all what it used to be. Constantly understaffed. Not paid fairly. It wasn’t just the store I worked at that was in disarray, it was the ENTIRE DISTRICT absolutely heartbreaking."
bad,"Starbucks could do a lot more to create a happy work place for the partners. It's hourly pay is behind most of similar employers. Little accountability for store managers maintaining a happy content staff. Changing focuses, relaunchs, policies coming and going, doesnt make for innovation it makes for confusion and disengagment."
bad,"At this particular location and it’s surrounding locations they were all very messy and grimy. At the Alvarado Starbucks, there was and still is a maggot infestation under the 1st bar coming in contact with drinks all day long. The company made no effort to exterminate the maggots which led to them spreading throughout the store. The back rooms house mold near and around the sinks and the food case consisted of nats and was only cleaned every other day regardless of the fact it was real food in the case. Floors are only mopped once a day and trash is pulled and stacked in the back room and only take out once or twice a day leaving around 45 bags total throughout the day in the floor blocking the Emergency fore exit. Many cameras on the premises don’t work and are just for show and have led to dishonesty among the partners. The company promises “free” Spotify premium account with each partner but doesn’t tell the partners that it is actually being take out of each check same as taxes."
bad,My justification for this horrid company doesn’t do it justice. It’s just bad management and horrid work culture and even worse customers. This company creates those customers you hear about
bad,"Early on I started to realize they don't want you here unless you're willing to agree with everything they say. No individual opinions are welcome. Management is really passive aggressive and will never let you know they dislike you, but will punish you by calling you in on days off just to work for 5 or 6 hours. Keeping you away from making drinks and basically just shaming you into quitting. They'll never tell you that, but it's well understood that if you want the freedom to be yourself then don't work here. They don't like you unless you're lgbtq or super progressive. Basically if you flirt with the girls and not the boys too that's unfair to them lol. Again they'll never say it, but it's understood."
bad,"When I work, which is barely during the week, but then full days on the weekends, I am constantly being scolding for doing things I was trained to do. The management has no idea what is going on, because no one is there to begin with. The manager spends maybe six hours a week at my location."
bad,"I started at the Bux and loved it until we got a new manager. Starbucks is headed in a bad direction for it's employees. They increasingly expect managers to treat partners like they are numbers, not people. I was working on my development with my first manager non-stop then this external hire came in and our whole store either left or got fired and he began working everyone to death and there was zero opportunity to grow. For a company that claims to care about their employees, they do literally nothing to help in questionable situations. Starbucks is a great stepping stone but nothing more. This isn't the kind of place you want to pursue as a career."
bad,"Just you will do the same steps everyday, changing roles during your shift. No flexible in the schedule. The management is poor. The most enjoyable part is learning the coffee smelling and tasting."
bad,Really stressful day where we are understaffed as always. Gotta be fast paced. Managers are not helpful. Some co-workers are nice so it makes my day better. We are asked to do a lot for how little we get paid.
bad,"You'll learn a lot - but not by choice. "
bad,"Working there was really stressful. We were always understaffed. They never saw what you did right, only what you did wrong. Very wasteful with water."
bad,No one stays more than 1 year without losing their soul. Head office wil lteeat you like morons will working you as hard as they can. Don't care about their employees at all.
bad,Would not recommend unless attending school or something along those lines but is not enough to live off of or let alone deal with horrible customers who act animalistic just for a cup of coffee.
bad,"As an employee, I did not feel supported, I was overworked, underpaid, and we were all constantly being reviewed. We were in one of the highest volume stores on the east coast and would consistently be understaffed. there would be many times when two baristas would be expected to serve around 100 people per half hour while upper management reviewed our performance. wed often be told to 'smile more' and 'make connections' with guests, but that's just not possible with the volume of drinks being served."
bad,"Incredibly unrealistic expectations, not a great deal of leadership at regional level and incredibly rigid."
bad,"More trouble than you are compensated for. Unrealistic expectations forced onto you, without the means to implement. Constant degrading comments. Very different from what the public perceives."
bad,"My typical Day at work involved being constantly put down by my coworkers, and being disrespected by my supervisors. The management was awful and listened very little to my complaints. While the customers were very nice, the coworkers were awful. The Starbucks company is perfectly fine, but certain stores are horrible."
bad,"You would think that a place like Starbucks would provide some kind of book to make it a little easier for new staff to learn how to make the drinks, given the ""secret menu"" and the limitless customizations people can make with their drinks. If you thought that, you thought wrong. You're expected to just memorize everything, which isn't helpful when the store is slammed and you've only worked there for a day or two. If someone orders something off the ""secret menu"", you're on your own and at the mercy of the customer who either understands, or throws a fit depending on their mood. Their on-the-fly training is a mess, the bars are louder than you think (no, your barista isn't deliberately trying to misspell your name, they probably can't hear you correctly), everyone is too busy to help out and if you're not sure on how to make something, your coworkers are less than willing to give you a hand and tend to give you an attitude about it. Overall, I wouldn't recommend it."
bad,"Not just one or two stores, I worked six. They kept shipping me to troubles stores to ""fix"" them.  The company needs fixing. Horrible place. Never again, no matter how desperate I get."
bad,when i worked here the manager was new and had no clue what he was doing. Not the conventional Starbucks due to its location in a university library. always a line out the door and would constantly be short on supplies.
bad,"I used to absolutely love working for Starbucks. Whenever anyone asked where I worked I was exceedingly proud to say I was a barista at Starbucks. Then, management thought it would be a good idea to put a 23 year old in charge of a store. From there on out everyday became abhorrently stressful. Every shift was a nightmare and our store manager would be outback for the entirety of their shift, and we never got the support we needed. It came to a point where my hair started falling out and I had to go on high blood pressure medication. I would wake up every morning before work overwhelmed with anxiety. Every barista was getting corrective actions for the most ludicrous reasons and every barista that the previous managers hired were either fired or treated so poorly they willingly left. Also, calling out isn't an option, baristas and shift managers are written up and/or fired for being sick even though in the state of Massachusetts it is illegal. Save yourself the stress and stay far away."
bad,"It used to be great, but they changed their structure and forgot about their lowly baristas. We used to get reviews and raises 2x a year, nothing huge, but enough to make you feel you were getting somewhere, but with the structure change we were no longer valued as people let alone ""Partners"". Raises were non existent. Management and district leadership was poor- DMs would refuse to fix items necessary to operate because it cut into their yearly bonus. Which caused a lot of hazard, injury, and even (for me) the loss of hearing."
bad,"I did not stay long at this job. I was supposed to be trained at one store and was immediately pushed off to a different store where I was supposed to get training for a shift lead position. This did NOT happen. I did approach the manager multiple times, but it became overwhelmingly clear he did not care.  He definitely played favorites with some of the coworkers and anyone who closed or worked night were all made up of people he didn't like.  "
bad,Didn't like the ignorant co workers who bullied me to the point that I left. Racism and rude co-workers who were ratchet and cutthroat and unprofessional.
bad,Bad experience with staff and manager. Pay was the only good aspect as well as having free drinks on your lunch break besides from that there no time off
bad,"The short amount of time I worked at Starbucks was due to them wanting get me to work during my school hours (example; working on a Monday at 5:45 am and I had to go to school)"
bad,Easy and fun job but the managers where very nosey and rude. They seemed to want to get people fired. They didn't care about their hard workers at night shift because they never get to see them to talk to them about the nightly problems.Hard to get a raise in every department. Management has had a history of being bullies.
bad,"Starbucks pay is great! While i was there it was predominantly women whom were upper management so kudos to that! However the culture is very cut throat, secretive, favoritism heavily rules, and if you aren't apart of a management clique of some kind, you can forget advancement. They specialize ""CYA""."
bad,"I originally fairly enjoyed my job within the first year and a half, of course there were some ups and downs but the store was handled well. After the my first manager had left to run a new location that was built, the store kind of couldn't find it's groove again. There was always some new issue each week."
bad,I was working at a high volume store and it was way too stressful. There was no communication and the boss was rude. I was going through times where i was very sick and she gave me no warning and called corporate because of being sick. You are suppose to be given chances and was suppose to have her help work with my schedule and she did not.
bad,"Floor supervisor typical day is putting out all merchandise, assigning cash register to assigned employees, maintaining all lunches and breaks to keep the flow of business. 2nd shift consist of preparing employees for the evening rush."
bad,The health benefits were decent and you were allowed full time benefits for part time work. They would only work you part time unless you were willing to work nights.
bad,This company is all show. Once you get inside you realize that all they care about is drive thru times and cutting labor even though the demand is high. There was never really any support from the higher ups and the managers are very messy and child like. God forbid you get sick and have to call in. It is impossible to get a shift covered or take a sick day. The standards they want their employees to uphold conflict with what actually happens inside the store. The managers are lazy and put all the work on the supervisors who are under paid and always stressed out. Overall this place will drive you crazy.
bad,"while the most stressful job for the least amount of money ive ever made.... lets just say I learned alot. Great for college students and someone needing a part time gig to fill time. make money. Stressful, too stressful for those who try to make it a career."
bad,"the best part is that you get free food and drinks, but the workplace culture is tough because it's super busy and fast pace. You got to be quick, patient and hard working."
bad,"Serving customers on drive thru and on till, cleaning and tidying, restocking."
bad,"No opportunities for raises, poor management, no advocacy for employees, no paid time off, poor sick policy, most employees can't even afford to get the health insurance."
bad,"Labor hours are significantly low, so stores are hardly staffed to handle the amount of business they experience within a day. Supervisors are only earning $1.40/hr more than the barista position below them, yet you expect them to be the manager in charge when the store manager is gone? Employees are not paid enough and stores are not staffed well enough to meet the standard corporate, or the customers, hold you to. One of the only things I appreciated this job for, was being flexible with my schedule and supporting of my education."
bad,"Manager didn't trust workers, so she would spend all day there which stressed everyone out. Half the workers hated her and some tolerated, only maybe 2 enjoyed her. Micro-managed me into depression. Managed every aspect of my job constantly having me re-evaluate everything I did as if I wasn't ever doing my job right. Would threaten (not openly threaten) to send people home if they didn't have the right ""attitude"" (overly peppy, never showing sadness). Constantly invaded people's personal space during live work hours, asking intimate questions on how people were feeling in front of coworkers and guests."
bad,"The company is great, but management is awful. Very stressful working environment, due to lack of communication and rapid changes. The benefits are great, but the pay is to low for the amount of work."
bad,"I experienced a significant amount of lack of organization and the managers did not know how to properly do their job. Many people had to work extra hours due to scheduling issues and the lead manager would leave work before he was supposed to, leaving the other employees to do his work and more."
bad,"As a Shift Supervisor (manager), I was not eligible to make over $10/hr. Limited resources for inventory management, no opportunity for overtime, very difficult to advance with the company."
bad,"Turn over is very high, customers are difficult, and management is not great. They do not usually promote from within and can be difficult to advance."
bad,"HMS Host has lost the majority of the Airport now.  When I worked there they had 100% of the Airport, but do to poor service and product, they lost most of the Airport to outside vendors."
bad,"Long hours"
bad,It was a love hate kind of work environment . It turned into a revolving door and there is a huge lack of communication between everyone in the store.
bad,Just no worth it in the end. The pay is super super low and not really worth the amount that they have you doing. Plus when you get a rush a people it can get over whelming super fast
bad,"Scheduals changed completely every two months, no one knew what was going on because the business changed owners multiple times in the past year and it was just a horrible experience overall"
bad,"It felt like the only way to succeed in this thankless position was to put your head down, do your work, and only get up if you're going to discuss just how great black coffee is. The only way to move up is to stay there long enough that the person ahead of you gets promoted, and only then will you succeed if there isn't someone that's vying for the same position. Management was awful and gave no instruction nor criticism - yet they felt comfortable winnowing you down to a number they called ""productivity."" Even as someone who did well there, it felt disingenuous and Sisyphean - struggling to impress someone who didn't even know the process, only how to measure the result."
bad,"During my 3 years with Starbucks, I loved the culture and the art of making coffee. However, my love for latte art was overshadowed by selfish managers and ridiculous hours."
bad,My particular store has many things wrong with it. I'm not happy with management or the minimal pay I get. The turnover is ridiculous and many of us get treated unfairly.
bad,A typical work day is very fast-paced and busy. I learned how to assist customers with quality service while being a part of a team. Management was under Target INC. and not Starbucks. Workplace culture was very upbeat. The hardest parts of the job include; having rushes when you are the sole barista on deck and fulfilling all duties in fast-paced environment. The most enjoyable part of the job was collaborating with an amazing team.
bad,"i met a lot of great people. the management wasn't great and i didn't enjoy the job. typical day at work would be taking customers order , and making drinks and stocking up and following clean , safe and ready. i learned to be patient. the management lacked coaching. they would use aggressiveness as a form of coaching. my co workers were great. the hardest part about the job is learning the recipe. the most enjoyable part is you meet great customers."
bad,"It sucks, but its a job. Don't think you're a fancy hot shot barista, this is essentially a fast food job. Its not any more dignified or fancy or artistic than a job at mcdonalds or Taco Bell. And honestly mcdonalds probably pays better just saying."
bad,"I was constantly and consistently taken advantage of, and never once saw a decent wage or benefits I was promised. I was threatened by customers regularly, and lied to about promotions often."
bad,Working here is high stress and very chaotic. My boss is in another country and speaks very broken English and is a poor leader. They are constantly changing our schedules and asking us to rearrange our lives at a moments notice. I do enjoy my co-workers and the team we are on.
bad,"All of the people who i've worked with at starbucks (inside safeway) were pretty much children or too old to work, i worked 50+ hours a week for barely over 10/hr overtime, was a really bad job, worked my (you know what) off and no appreciation other than the offering of more hours was given."
bad,"Starbucks Coffee Company was a great place to work with unlimited resources.  I went from running day to day operation at our plant for 9  years ,to being the project manager for a new 4 million dollar production and packing line for Starbucks."
bad,No one in the whole café washed their hands at all.  Complained to Mgmt nothing.  People with 10 plus years did not care.  Sanitation was an after thought.
bad,"It is unfortunate that Starbucks allows its district managers to change policy from area to area. The compensation for the workload is ridiculous. It used to be a great company however recently it has become one of the worst, Brevard county Florida is by far the worst, Stay away if you want to have a life."
bad,"Fun people to work with, challenging and rewarding work assignments, the best part is working with the frontline employees"
bad,"worst company i've ever worked for. managers didn't do much to work with you, nor were they flexible with any arrangements. The college tuition help doesn't actually kick in till you've been attending for 2 years. Not worth busting my butt for minimum wage."
bad,I like the job but was not to happy with management. My fellow barista however always made the job fun and manageable.
bad,managment was rude customers were friendly though co workers were helpful
bad,its tough consists of mulitasking and memorization if you cant do that that place isnt for you
bad,great place to work as a team
bad,It’s impossible to have time off even if you schedule it in advance or if you are sick it’s then your responsibility to find coverage. If you can then you have to go to work sick.
bad,"The startbucks  I work for lacks a strong and supportive management team. Which makes the job awful.  Also from what I hear, corporate Starbucks are better then the license stores.  I work for a license store."
bad,"We built a great team of supervisors, and all our great ideas were hamstrung by the district manager. The company itself encourages a culture of toxic competitiveness at the supervisor level and above to generate a feeling of job insecurity. The company's benefits package is a form of union-busting, and all of the company values fail to extend to protecting employees and disadvantaged customers."
bad,"If you decide to work for Starbucks, remember, their benefits don’t make up for not having a union."
bad,"As barista jobs go Starbucks takes care of their employees. However, they care way more about their customers than the people who work for them. There is room for advancement but you might have to fight your way to the top. Just be aware that if you're trying tor rise in the company it is going to be way more emotional energy than you are expecting. They also will not respect your boundaries when it comes to scheduling within your availability or contacting you when you are off the clock. "
bad,"Place sells coffee, can confirm, I was there."
bad,"Starbucks can be a lottery. Some partners will find stores with an amazing environment with helpful partners while others will find stores they hate. There is also the two way road, where you start with a store with an amazing environment, and then the unfortunate happens. Managers move and then you are stuck with someone who claims they care, but creates a really toxic environment. You try to do something about it, but the upper echelon do nothing to help. I would say scope out the store you want to be a part of first and get a feel for how the environment. I would not wish any partner to end up in the type of environment I reside in now."
bad,"My poor experience with this company was largely due to management or rather, lack there of. The manager at my location was overbearing, micromanaging and dishonest in personal interactions."
bad,"I use to love starbucks as a company. At this point, I feel like the culture has depleted. I'm not sure why the manager was so rude, but I'm sure it was the pressure."
bad,"I really enjoy my job. However, there's very little room for advancement and when it happens its usually to people who aren't reliable or respected by the team. Builds poor environment for everyone. Management feels so fake sometimes. There's no raise in sight as a barista, and if you cant become a shift... good luck keeping a roof over your head, even then. Most of my shifts are kids. It's just a weird environment sometimes. It can be great but a lot of the time... it's really sad."
bad,"I had heard great things about working for Starbucks: great benefits, fun people, a company that cares about its employees. These are only true with good management. I was denied the hours necessary to maintain a residence, despite working 3-4 other part-time jobs. and the health insurance is a joke."
bad,Working there I had the worse experience ever. Management rarely even cared about what was going on. Nothing was handled the way it should have been. They didn’t really seem to care about emergencies where you had to leave or couldn’t make it.
bad,"The place is horrible, they say about diversity but it works only for gender. There are a lot of discrimination. The worse experience in my life. Competitive, stressful. I can say: "" catch me doing something right"", because they only looking for mistakes.  Salary is not bad. They give benefits, free coffee, but the stress level is so high that nothing worth. No enough ppl to work and a lots to do. Anyway I don't recommend work there."
bad,"When I started at Starbucks, 12 years ago, it was an ok job because they worked around my college schedule. I could work 4am-12:30pm & could attend my classes in the afternoon. The pay was very low & ""tips"" would maybe give you $40-60 a week, if you worked FT. Despite popular belief, healthcare WAS NOT free, but offered to purchase at a slight discount (deducted from your paycheck). Being corporate, they were always changing the rules & how they wanted things to be run, which was exhausting to keep up with. "
bad,"While I have enjoyed some of my time with the company, I feel that they take advantage of hard working people by overworking and underpaying them. Your availability will be ignored, and you will constantly be called in to cover shifts when you are off."
bad,"The problem which is a lack of communication, a toxic gap arises between departments that leads to unresolved issues between managers, employees, and customers."
bad,"I was hired for a part time job as a full time college student, gave my availability for 20 hours yet i worked 40+ WEEKLY. They created the schedule to be for the entire month so I could not change the hours I was given. I quit on the spot."
bad,I have worked for this company for a year now. My first manager did not care about the company or the store. He never set us up for success. I moved stores and my new manager cares and is very helpful. I would not recommend this company due to the fact they preach a false work environment. This place is toxic.
bad,I worked at a license store so I had no benefits and a bad manager. I would highly recommend applying to a franchise instead where there is more structure.
bad,"Management was annoyed when I called in sick due to being in the hospital, was asked to come into work when I was not physically well and would breach health and food safety regulations. "
bad,"its ok, the work environment definitely could be a lot better. A typical work day is very busy and hectic. There is the regulars that come in everyday that you get to know and like that , makes the job worth going in for and go smooth."
bad,"""You get what you paid fort""  - is the common attitude. Hence mediocrity is promoted and celebrated with laughter.  Most people don't care they just get by.  A lot of waste of time and money. Frustrating if you want to getting projects done on time in most projects.. Not in all cases but alot of projects can just roll from year to year under different names and different budgets with no tangible achievement. It seems "" the Journey"" is more important than the destination/objective. Hence you are always on a journey with very few tangible benefits or objectives. May be ok with some people."
bad,I really liked the team I worked with however the management was poor. Furthermore the benefits are few and far between and the pay is terrible considering the early hours they expect you to work.
bad,"They trained me for maybe a total of 6hrs over one week and then let me loose. I struggled. I had encouraged them to  re-train me but they didn't. My coworkers helped but obviously they were tired of helping. The manager all but told me I didn't belong there. They (the manager) threw out drinks I was making that easily could have been fixed and chastised me in front of a customer. "
bad,"Expectations are high and pay is low. Hours can be hard to come by. Manager burn out is a year or less and no one within the company wants to move up. Because of this, Starbucks almost always hires outside management that do not know the job."
bad,"There were some good aspects about working at Starbucks. We got free drinks and free food which was a plus. And I would rather smell like coffee and milk then greasy fast food any day. However our store went through 5 store managers in 5 years and that put a lot of stress on us baristas. Staffing was ALWAYS an issue and seemed to never be addressed properly. And I'm sure this is common with most jobs, but compensation was just barely over minimum wage. Each shift takes blood, sweat, and sometimes tears, and just above minimum wage didn't   even come close to cutting it. Some customers were very fun, and granted I did meet my husband while working there... but with how big the company is, they could afford to make a few changes."
bad,"They want bodies there, regardless if you are sick. Hard to find coverage. I would not recommend working there. Then benefits aren't great. However you can get health care if you work part time."
bad,I worked for Starbucks inside of Smiths Market place the manager at the time was a good one but the HR and asking for a more efficient schedule was a joke.
bad,"I liked working with the people at night time, but the head management was too poor. Overall the daily problems of irresponsibility and not taking ownership such as treatment issues of other leadership isn't worth the pay I received."
bad,"Starbucks can be a great place, at times. Good customers and co-workers. However, senior level management were, on the whole, not inspiring people to work for."
bad,"The actual job itself was amazing. So fun, work collegues were lovely and you were always kept on your feet with things to do."
bad,"The manager was more concerned about getting bonuses and taking vacations than actually worrying about her staff. She would understaff the location just to be bonused out for saving on labor. She would lie to employees and make them responsible for extra work that was not required of them to save herself time and effort. The manager also exuded favortism by giving certain employees the best shifts, the most hours and also weekends off. The manager continues to take vacations up to three weeks in length even though each time she has done this it highly affected her store."
bad,"Very unsure of the company it wants to be, benefits are standard for the area and the pay is slightly worse than what you could normally get in Seattle."
bad,"If you enjoy cliques, this is the job for you. If not, you will be targeted for gossip, rumors, and bullying."
bad,"lets Just say I’ve never cried so much at a job before. Management sucks "
bad,"As both barista's and shift leads, you are expected to dedicate a majority of your time to the job. While the job is fast paced and can be fun at times, it is a lot of work for very little recognition. If you have a good manager/supervisor that appreciates the staff, then the working conditions are better. But if you have a manager that shows no interest in caring about their employee's, then it is a tough place to be."
bad,I left the company due to the manager. Always hot in the cafe because the AC unit broke every week. Manager was lazy to call things in when they needed to be fixed like the AC and many other things. Relied on others to do her job.
bad,"Too much work and not enough admin time (always had to work during my break and after shift)"
bad,"If you have other choices somewhere else , please go. $9/hour No raise ever .New management in JAX= careless . Got stuck here because of free school ."
bad,"Headington Starbucks is in dire need of a refurbishment, there is a high turnover of staff. What staff is there is overworked and underpaid. The management doesn’t act professional at all, talking about people behind their backs, creating a toxic work environment. You get discount on drinks, except only 30% when the drinks are already expensive."
bad,"I had worked there for almost a year. Most of my coworkers were low key bullies. At the end of my job there I was dealing with health issues that were causing me to get sick on the job and continue working. They weren’t flexible with my last minute doctors appointments trying to figure out what was going on as my health was deteriorating. "
bad,"Work at Starbucks is stressful- it's always fast paced and customers get testy quickly. Store was always understaffed and we were constantly running out of products. Each employee had several jobs that they had to complete on a continuous rotation, and if something was missed they would be harshly reprimanded. Manager ended up leaving and was found to be harassing employees and customers. Perhaps this is more as a result of it having been a licensed location rather than corporate. At least making and trying new drinks was enjoyable."
bad,"I have so many mixed emotions about my job. It truly depends on management. If you have a manager who is understanding and willing to work with you, it is amazing. If you have a manager who truly does not care about their staff—only the profits, it will be more of a struggle."
bad,"To be honest, they overwork you for minimum wage. They aren’t as considerate about your working hours when you are a student. On top of that human resources doesn’t do a very good job at defending the employee."
bad,"a typical day at Starbucks meant as soon as you wash your hands your coworkers are already yelling that they need something or fighting with customers or simply complaining about something. its very cult-like here. there's no way of ever clearly understanding dress code. write ups are handed here like they get raises from giving them out. I've met many people that have worked here for years and have worked at 4+ locations and it seems like they complain about the same thing- management. and truly, I 100% agree. Starbucks needs to do something to get better managers. please find a better job. minimum wage, horrible work environment that'll leave you angry all day RUDE customers and absolutely the worst management I've ever experienced. talk to former baristas about the culture here before applying. also you have to go into work at 3am sometimes. not worth it at all. I promise."
bad,"Your experience is highly impacted by the leadership styles (or lack there of) of upper management ie. district manager & above"
bad,Not an understanding company. They are not accommodating towards normal life issues. Everyone gets sick and they couldnt deal with that. This I was fired. Despite my having a doctor's note.
bad,"Starbucks was a fun job, but was completely not dependable for getting work hours on a regular basis. The management was poor, but the customers were a joy to work with. You don't get paid enough for the work that you do."
bad,"Bottom line, if you are entering the job market for the first time, Starbucks may be a good fit.  Be prepared to be abused by customers tho, as the customer is always right.  If you are looking to be a manager, you will be required to support your team 24/7, with you being the person who shows up when your employees cant find coverage, or call in sick.  No room for advancement above store manager, unless you want to wait years and do extra projects without pay to try and be developed, for only a few positions which may come up every few years for a District Manager.  Majority of managers last for 3years due to high stress and burnout."
bad,"Better benefits than most, if not all, other positions closely related. Horrible company though, they don't care about how you feel at all.  Be prepared to be overworked and yelled at for minute issues. If you don't hate your life, you will."
bad,"Every day I come in to work, we get hit with the fact that the closing crew hasn't done their job properly. The morning crew (which I'm a part of) has addressed this with the Store Manager and the closing crew multiple times. NOTHING has been done about the fact that the store is so dirty all the time in the mornings. We come in and the counters haven't been wiped down from the previous night or the coffee didn't get dumped the night before. There are about a thousand things I hate about this job."
bad,The tittle pretty much says it all. They somehow believe their $0.25 above minimum wage pay is exemplary. They run on extraordinary effort on the behalf of a few and offer little to no actual management training so store managers are just whoever hasn't quit yet.
bad,"Company flat out does not pay well enough for an adult to support themselves fully. Even shift leads don't get full time hours. I've never met a single person who was able to pay for housing, a working vehicle, a phone and groceries without living with at LEAST one other Starbucks employee. I was NEVER able to afford fresh groceries. I made just enough to drive to work and back. They tout their tuition reimbursement program but no one ever mentions how you're supposed to be able to afford the first semester on the insultingly low wage."
bad,"No work balance despite claiming to encourage it, with very basic training from the first day and the expectation that you should know it by the end of the week. If a new drink comes out you're expected to know it by the end of the day, even when its not being ordered or you haven't been on shift. If you take too long to learn they begin questioning if your trying, but offer no more training or support. Shouted at on the shop floor by management, have had customers complain due to it. "
bad,"I experienced a few different store managers with my time at Starbucks but my final two created a destructive environment. When I reached out to my District Manager about the toxic behavior I was told that she already knew about my ""strong character"" and that if I wasn't happy I didn't have to be there."
bad,The store manager is expected to work as an individual contributor for 36 hours/week before their real work starts.  We were never afforded close to enough labor hours to accomplish the cleanliness and customer experience we were after.
bad,They have benefits but that doesn't even out the low pay for overworking and being understaffed. my entire store is looking for new jobs right now due to exhaustion after each shift. they go back and forth on their values and starbucks is really not what it used to be.
bad,"this job, while very demanding and stressful at times has taught me patience with customers and how to fix a situation. but i would not recommend to any of my friends to work here. management is way too disconnected from the baristas. things should really change."
bad,Very childish work place with people on their late 20s acting as kids. I’ve been here for 3 years and honestly I’ve delt Racist managers and workers that get different pay rates with the same job position
bad,"Great opportunity however no advancement, no employee reviews... Nothing. Would only recommend it if you like wasting time in a demanding environment with little pay off."
bad,"While working here, Randalls would break up to 3 labor laws a day per person. Terrible scheduling, especially since I was hired with the understanding that I was a student and part time, which they somehow continued to disregard by scheduling me full time. Randalls didn't care about labor laws, health, or safety. I'm not exaggerating when I say that over my 7 month employment at Randalls, I literally was given 3 lunch breaks. Most employees would stay dehydrated during their long shifts to avoid needing to use the restroom. They put profit over safety, while understaffing and squeezing as much money out of each employee as they could."
bad,"My experience working at Starbucks has not been great. "
bad,"1. a typical workday is very busy "
bad,"I love Starbucks as a whole, but the district I've worked in is not the one to join. The management shows blatant favoritism, as does the district management. The benefits from the company are great, but the stress from the job overall in the end wasn't worth it for me. There were many days where I would come home feeling defeated and exhausted. Some of the customers were wonderful, but others were just flat out rude and condescending to us."
bad,"initially when i started to work there i was very excited. However the training there is not very good. They give you the bases of everything, but when you work with different people the standard is different. We are always short staffed. back in 2018 we had a good number of staff and everybody was tight knit. Shortly in 2018 many staff members and management staffed left. We cannot keep people and some of the people we do have, have a terrible attitude and most of the management staff is stressed most of the time. Too much bickering, gossiping, not treating each other with respect and most of the management team does nothing to alleviate the problems. Also, when we are extremely short staffed due to call outs, we cannot close a store because the company gets fined."
bad,"If you're in a good store, you'll meet some cool people and it can be fun. But management can be really rough, and a lot of baristas take themselves far to seriously. When you work as a supervisor, you basically run the store and the pay isn't worth it."
bad,manager has no idea what shes doing nerve has anything nice to say constantly putting down workers never back anyone up. Never helps on the floor and you get no hours
bad,"Far too much politics from people who don't realise they're stuck in retail... also, never expect to leave on time if you work in a somewhat busy store. Never work at Starbucks if you're a free-thinker and don't believe in everything you read on social media."
bad,"Expectations are very high of management and overtime is absolutely expected.  Do not apply if you prefer work life balance, they will say it exists but it does not."
bad,Très bon flux clients le Point de vente est grand et permet à l’ensmeble de l’equipe D’avoir son petit coin
bad,Starbucks culture is not appreciative of single parents and you have to find people to cover shifts if you are unable to be there for one.  If a kid gets sick you are treated like you did this just to annoy them. No one wants to cover your shifts for you. It is incredibly stressful to work  there and very physically taxing. At least half of your shift is spent lifting and cleaning more thoroughly than you might even clean your house. That being said I know starbucks is a safe place to eat !
bad,"It was a horrible place to work, the expectations of the perfection they expect you to give are not work 9.50 an hour for the form of treatment they give their employees."
bad,"A typical day involves finding out what hasn't been done yet and working mainly on those tasks, while making drinks, taking orders, and other daily tasks. Starbucks greatly rewards those who take to the stated company values and praise them, though the company itself does nothing to actually support those notions. The hardest part of the job is continuing to smile while breaks are withheld as privileges and customers behave like children."
bad,Starbucks only likes to hire management from outside and will not promote hard working people after they make promises to. The company cuts labor and hours for employees but will add more labor intensive drinks and create a larger work load making it harder for employees to focus on customers. This company claims they care about their employees but that’s far from the truth.
bad,"Given my limited experience as part-time worker, majority of the co-workers were very welcoming and patient teaching a newbie like me but as in any organization, there will always be that one exception/person who probably have been on the job too long and lacks the motivation and feels the need to assert her seniority in the  position.  Can be overwhelming to learn everything in the beginning.  The hardest part of the job - the usual challenge of a new employee trying to learn fast,  fit in and belong.  Most enjoyable part of the job is interaction with customers."
bad,Doesn't pay enough plain and simple .  Why am I even wasting my time with this? haha met some cool people and got training for higher paid barista gigs though
bad,Nice for a few months then things start to change. Typically good coworkers but management is questionable. Would not recommend for someone needing stability.
bad,"The more company culture and menu item addons change the less people were assign to man extra stations i. e. mobile orders. Everyday was stressful. Especially for Female employees, most of us did not feel safe and/or at night. Selective customers constantly harassing employees and our complaints were never taken seriously."
bad,"Customers are frequently rude, tips are few and far between, management generally distant. Cliques form in the mornings, if you don't work peak you basically don't exist to most of them. Supervisors mostly underqualified and have overinflated opinions of themselves. "
bad,"Worst district manager and the worst store manager at Millhopper. Purest form of incompetence, lack of professionalism, and no compassion. You are treated as someone who doesn't matter and that goes completely against the company's core values."
bad,"El primer dia te pintan el mejor trabajo del mundo todos te apoyan, el segundo los compañeros si no eres como ellos te hacen a un lado, el tercer dia apenas te conoce tu gerente, al cuarto dia te dejan solo a tu suerte, al quinto dia vez como los que son barberos suben mientras a ti nadie te quiere enseñar, al sexto dia eres el mas malo del mundo porque no sabes hacer nada y al septimo quieres renunciar porque asi es este trabajo si no andas con ellos en las pedas, tienes hijos y eres responsable no te aceptan."
bad,if you dont care what your doing get this job because they pay pretty well. just be firm that you dont want to work long shifts and your schedule is not flexible
bad,I would not work at star bucks again due to it has a lot of things going on that I would not like to be around. But the discounts and the weekeley pay was nice as well as the free food and free drinks.
bad,"Honestly, anyone who has been with the company for more than five years has seen a significant decline in the culture and the incentives to stay. The previous standard of two performance based raises per year has decreased to one uniform percentage increase for all hourly employees per year. I think it's two percent. Starting pay in my area is $9/hour, so it will take a barista a very long time to attain even a dollar increase in pay. The work is physically demanding and involves a fair amount of emotional abuse from customers, which Starbucks almost encourages, as they set certain standards and policies for employees to follow but the moment a customer doesn't like it, we are told to ""make the moment right"" and give the customer whatever they want. The work is doable but has become increasingly more difficult since they are consistently cutting labor hours while the customer counts grow higher than ever before. The only reason to stick around is for the tuition reimbursement program. Once you finish school, get out. They aren't really worth investing anymore of your time and energy into after that."
bad,"You will be expected to do the work of 2 to 3 people. All while being bright and chipper and smily. "
bad,"the job was fun at times, but there was a lot of high stress, and demand, and false promises for promotions and raises. The rate of pay hourly was not worth the stress of the rush and rude customers. The amount of benefits from the company besides pay was phenomenal but if you don't really use the benefits its like not having them."
bad,Most of us either have to live with our parents or have a second provider. I maybe make 1000 a month on a good month. Im lucky sometimes to have 20 hours in a week. It really does suck sometimes to work at starbucks. We are very competitive and it makes it even harder to try and enjoy our jobs.
bad,"Starbucks is all about profit and doesn't treat its employees like people. Baristas were expected to do the work of 3 people and the management did little to help when there were issues with customers. Good medical benefits, but not enough to make it worth enduring the stress of working there."
bad,Management is poor. Like most places. They cut your hours because you cant work outside of YOUR hours. So say you get 32hrs a week? And someone calls out sick and you cant be available to cover 24/7? Oops no longer a valued employee.
bad,"For a company that prides themselves on being a family friendly company, they really don’t care that much about their staff. One occasion I was bed bound with an illness but was forced to come into work still even though three customers commented I shouldn’t be there. Also management have their favourites; if your face doesn’t fit then good luck with any kind of progression"
bad,"I liked my job at Starbucks, except I had to leave due to issues within management. I wasn't even part of the problem but it became an everyday annoyance and I didn't want that to be my environment any longer."
bad,"I hated my experience working at Starbucks, the managing style simply didn't work for me and even though I worked hard it was never recognized. I got a friend to work at the same location and she also quit."
bad,I either didn't fit or this company sucked to work for. First of all the rules are strict. There is a certain dress code which is pretty laid back if you plan on not actually working throughout your shift...
bad,They wont work around your school schedule if you are a full time student or in more than one school. You put in your availability just to have it questioned and then told if you don't change it to fit their needs you will be replaced.
bad,"I had such high expectations for my Starbucks experience. I was hired as a shift manager from outside. I didn’t want to be shift manager but the extra pay was important at the time. I felt extremely under trained. My training was rushed and incomplete. I was often overlook as the shift because of this and was forced to ask seasoned baristas how to do things because I didn’t know. The other shift managers were very petty and bossy during shift change and spent more time telling me how they felt I should be running my shift to make it easier on them. The store manager was very nice and could be encouraging but it wasn’t enough since lack of training was my issue. The baristas didn’t listen to my direction and many times listened more to other shifts that where working  just as baristas.  It got to the point that I felt intimidated to even ask questions cause I didn’t want to sound stupid. I just withdrew more and more and finially quit. 12.00 an hour wasn’t worth my stress, the toll it was taking on my body and lowering my self esteem.  "
bad,"I've been with Starbucks for five years, and the ability to do our job has exponentially decreased with the nonsensical marketing and the complete lack of concern for barista emotional or physical well-being. Stores are invariably understaffed, SUPPOSED to be understaffed, schedules are inconsistent and vary wildly day to day. "
bad,terrible management and a hostile work environment. i would not recommend working here at all. managers care about the sales more than the employees getting assulted by customers
bad,"This job, like many other of the sort, can trap associates with small merit-based promotions. I have seen many talented kids limit their vision to work here. Generally, Starbucks teaches associates to work hard and utilize systems, but offers little flexibility."
bad,"I was overworked, grossly underpaid for having keys and a code to the store and SAFE. Very tough to make a decent living even while working F/T. You get free coffee, and beans. If its your first job, do it. Good experience, if youre older, find something else. I ran breaks, did food pulls, jumped on bar if a barista was not available, did money drops and counts at the end of the night."
bad,"Management were very prejudiced, good work but bad environment.  "
bad,"Misthous peinas, den aksizei, gia Ola auta pou kaneis!! I diplomatia boithaei na pithontai mikra paidia !!! Prosarmozoun tous kanones opws theloun aytoi!!!makria!!!"
bad,"honestly just a terrible place to try and develop a meaningful career, the corporate culture is palpably fake and the management style is essentially nonexistent."
bad,"Dont really have much to say about this place i woked at the one in Wingfield Springs and the manager was terrible. The hours were fine. The money was horrible, you did so much and got paid so little."
bad,This is the franchise at the airport in Kansas City Kansas they have no lack of concern for employees you go hours and hours without breaks when you need to talk to somebody in HR there's nobody to talk to but it's not even even a business number to call
bad,The manager ruined a wonderful team. With new management the store would be great and would run smoothly. The stores needs help and someone to come in and take it over.
bad,"I found the work load to be a bit much with the time shifts given, and the amount of people on shift, there is a lot of strain to get everything done and not get very behind."
bad,"Favoritism runs rampant at my store, and any promises of hard work leading to promotion from within were certainly broken. The environment feels toxic, and many of my peers are unhappy."
bad,"Doesn't give you any good experience and will always be mocked. Only exception is if you want to continue in a Customer Service career."
bad,A typical day at Starbucks included being berated by customers two faced management who would flip on company policy to avoid customer conflict at the drop of a hat.
bad,"cult like values, and no protection from customer harassment. Unreliable hours, small discount and a very small wage increase for much more work, with the promise of advancement that never comes. Expectation that you take ridiculous customer complaints seriously and encouraged to be over friendly and personable often resulting in vulnerable situations."
bad,"its an okay job for student, difficulty getting the hours i requested, always having to look around for more hours. must admit the culture is a little bit sketchy. I sometimes feel they dont really care about the employees At least you get free coffee and meet cool people."
bad,A very bad experience.  I worked there for 5 + years and was treated horribly.  I was not treated with respect and everyone I came in contact with was with it about themselves.  Cutthroat was the norm at headquarters.
bad,"my manager at starbucks was very rude and picked favorites, but only at the second store i worked at, my first manager was amazing, my newest manager gives me terrible hours and she chooses the people she likes to give hours to even though theyre terrible at their job, and she also has no idea what shes doing"
bad,"Most of the days I worked were awful. I asked the management for more hours(at least 15 hours a week), however at times only received 8. Was not trained at my official store very well. Only two managers would encourage and help me when needed. The rest put me down if I made the smallest of mistakes. I was always put as a cashier giving me no experience in making drinks, however the few times I was put on bar, I would get yelled at for messing up in any way or being to slow. They told me to have more confidence, but its hard to do that with everyone breathing down your neck and making you feel you are a big screw up."
bad,"The customers were enjoyable, I'll never forget some of the people, I enjoyed making the drinks. To this day, I am a loyal Starbucks drinker. So far as my work experience, it wasn't so much the company as a whole,  love the company, I would say it was the location I worked. The staff nor the manager I had were very welcoming. They actually made work  very unpleasant which was what led me to find employment elsewhere, however, just a personal experience. On the other hand, this would be a great job for teenagers making their entrance into the workforce, very flexible schedules."
bad,"Great place for students and part time partners, they have a fantastic atmosphere to work in. The training is well thought out and detailed which is fantastic. "
bad,"Busy, managers have one focus and that is not their staff...money money money is all they care about not the end result and defiantly not the consumer."
bad,"It would days that I had to work rush hour alone with no help even if the manger was present. They where hiring people that didn't understand the job title an duties that had to be done every day, I would have to go behind other employees to redo the work the right way. Some days you would have to deal with a lot of attitude even being nice an understanding. Days some things would not work an or would break down."
bad,The management makes or breaks it. At the tail end of my time there there were three store supervisers who were extremely competitive and petty to each other. This made for many uncomfortable moments stuck in between the varying bosses. The store manager was the worst though; he poorly communicated any direction and was always trying to cut store costs for the sake of his bonus.
bad,"I loved working at Starbucks in California, but in Colorado everything is very different. There are mainly drive through stores and they push us to upsell like crazy and have insanely fast drive through times. Then when we have good times they tell us we're not connecting enough with the customers. It's a vicious impossible cycle. We are also told to push things on customers to the point where people don't even want to return to our store."
bad,"At first it was a fun job, the hours were super early but got off in the early afternoon. After leaving I wouldn't recommend anyone to work there. There's too much drama and it's created by the manager and shifts. Toxic place to work and it will make you never want to work customer service again. Needy and entitled customers."
bad,"Due to being located in an area with a large, high-volume mall, the store's environment is very fast-paced and high-strung.  Employees are expected to come in when they are sick and knowingly contagious, and are treated with disrespect when things are not done the same way the manager does them.  Lack of labor causes a lot of stress for both employees and customers, which is the hardest part of the job.  The best part of the job is working with the customers.  Making their day and ensuring they leave happy makes my day and really boosts everyone's mood."
bad,"THEN WORK AT STARBUCKS. Very stressful. You will work more than you're supposed to, be held accountable for things not in your job description, and might not even be paid at all for it. I worked for this company for 3 years and when I finally applied for leave of absence disability they denied it and fired me without even telling me so. Plus, the manager's certainly have no problem dipping their pen in the company ink and that was not something I, personally, signed up for."
bad,"They are always short staff and that makes it super stressful because there is always a super long line. The person that makes the schedules will schedule you for more hours than you want. In some cases that is good, but I am a college student that needs time for school. They also wouldnt work with me to fix the schedule."
bad,There is little room for growth they have started to hire outside the company. The management  is unorganized and very unprofessional. I have worked as a supervisor for 5 years and I only make $13.00. There are raises once a year and they aren't determined by your work so everyone gets the same amount.
bad,"This place is a collective of bad management, overworked/underpaid partners, and an absurd degree mixture of tasks, cleaning, while providing the very best customer service with a flawed labor metrics. So always understaffed."
bad,Starbucks management is unorganized and unprofessional. I am work all weekends and stay later due to others nor doing the right jobs. I am unable to do family events due to working every weekend and it is frowned upon to take off on weekends.
bad,"Work at Starbucks is not only very-fast paced and stressful, but also soul-crushing. Customers are frequently rude, and management does not seem to care about workers' work-life balance."
bad,wasn't the greatest experience i had at a job. The management was poor in all aspects of the company and the usually is drama filled. Also a problem if you want a day off or any time off
bad,"my experience in working for Starbucks was great in the beginning but then i had coworkers who mixed personal with business which lead to conflict in the shop.my manager was rude and only cared  for herself and not for others in the shop working as team in Starbucks you are suppose to work as a team in order for the shop to run successfully in dealing with others we did not,but my most enjoyable moment is interacting with different people everyday."
bad,"In my experience, the typical day here is being mistreated by your superiors and the guests. I've definitely learned how to hold my tongue in this job. The management is clique-oriented, you will not be able to grow in this company unless you practically worship the management. People do not stay with the company long, and if they have, they are miserable. The most difficult part of this job is the toll it takes on your mental health. The job itself is not hard, the constant belittling and complaining from management and the guests is what will get to you. The most enjoyable part of this job is the kind guests that are seldomly found, but when you encounter one, your entire day seems to be less daunting."
bad,Its a good place to work when everyone is on the same page good job if you like to be busy all the time always something to do like making drinks taking orders helping customers pick a drink i love that part i love my customers
bad,its very fast passed which makes the day go by fast. some managers take their job way too seriously. coworkers are great. the pay sucks 8.45 hr. no paid time off.
bad,"At first it was great. I worked 4-8 hour shifts, 5 days a week but in a couple of months, other co workers either quit, stop showing up, or got fired so I was stuck with more hours. As far as management goes, both quit at such short noticed so it was hard when we were out of many certain things in stock and scheduling. I enjoyed working as a barista but did not enjoy being and feeling alone."
bad,Place for very young people only. Needs lots of management improvement. very low salary compare to the amount of work. Very demanding customers. Great partners and team work.
bad,"i do not want to discuss my experience!!"
bad,"If you're looking for a job that doesn't require much of you other than to show up and smile, this is the place for you."
bad,District managers are total jerks and will fire people on a whim. Stress of the job is overbearing due to under staffing during peak hours because everything is done by algorithm. Benefits are decent. If you do not lean to the liberal side you will not last long in this job.
bad,"Typically, you'll be working alone for many hours."
bad,"Unfortunately, it was the location that killed any or all want to remember this job ever existed. The location has since been closed. The management was overbearing and confrontational. Coworkers where shallow and insulting. The company was decent and i have no issues with them."
bad,"You work way to hard for the amount they pay you, employees get mad when things aren't set up and people don't always do their jobs properly. The customers are the worst part about it"
bad,"A typical day at work starts with rushing in two hours early to cover someone dropping their shift. The place never hires enough people. This is Euro Garages, not the actual Starbucks company. Then it was all about following a guideline with only two people. The customers at this store are completely entitled snobs and you hear about it every second of the shift. "
bad,Overall place was fine to work. Until management are quick to tell you when your store cannot meet high targets of sales as opposed to when you are doing your job to the best of your ability. I wouldn't recommend working here.
bad,In my second attempt working for Starbucks I found the culture very different.  Hostile and simply not supportive of my graduate school career.
bad,It was harder to deal with the staff than the customers. Unfair management with very little personality. This job is nothing like the description and extremely hard to be happy in
bad,"I worked for a company named Sodexo inside of the NSA facility in a cafeteria. A typical day of work for me would be strenous. I had to work multiple positions day I was there for almost 2 years and never recieved a raise. I originally got hired for the Starbucks but ended up doing so much more, I would work two to three positions a day, I learned every position in the cafeteria, and worked in two different buildings. I had some co workers I really enjoyed working with but I did not enjoy working with all of them. The management was terrible they had alot of dishonesty and things they would do that was against policy. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the managment. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my favorite co workers in the Starbucks she made the job alittle bit more toreable because she was put through the same thing I was to an extent."
bad,"While working for this company is did have fun doing the actual job. Management is ok, very unreasonable. And they do a lot of favoritism. They fired me when I made samples for the store and there was a little left overs and I have not tried this drink yet, therefore I grabbed a small cup and had the rest. Management had told me we were aloud to try drinks we have not tasted. Also, numerous employees had made themselves drinks and did not pay, so I figured that was ok. But no, they fired me, LOL. but overall it is a fun job!"
bad,"Starbucks from Grouse Mountain is a place that provides you with the opportunity to start a job, but it is with frustation that I realized how efforts are not well compansated and managers lacks experience to notice and recognize good employees."
bad,"I had to stand for hours, we also had nowhere to have a comfortable break and bad pay. I did learn to make coffee though and some of my co-workers made it a little less stressful."
bad,"Best part of the workplace is the co-workers (partners) and the customers. Management is horrible and completely disengaged from the business itself. Mainly numbers driven and unconcerned for customers and partners alike. Benefits keep diminishing throughout time, less and less perks. You will not build relevant skills for a professional career working at Starbucks. Great job for very small scaled part-time specific work. Managers take advantage of employees and schedule outside of availability, make requests that are unrealistic and insincere to the common good of individuals. Starbucks is open 365 days a year and holidays are included, even if you request not to work a day you are not guaranteed to have it off. There is no work/life balance, the pay is low, there are no performance reviews for merit increases which is why there is no incentive to do a great job here. Honestly, you're better off babysitting or dog-walking."
bad,"Good for first time jobseekers, but takes too much time to advance within the company. Pay is not competitive and one cannot live off of wages alone. Supposedly the benefits are good, but I have yet to see them."
bad,"Though this may seem like a great company to work for, because of the benefits. The pay is incredibly low and there is little to no opportunity to move up because the company hires managers mostly from ""the outside"". There is a SINGLE RAISE each year of 25-30 CENTS that is no longer based off of merit. Minimum wage increases happen faster than the raises, which means that new people tend to make the same amount of money as you. This is NOT a long term company to grow with and it is clear that they do not want long term employees. The benefits are ok if you take advantage of them, but what are benefits when you can not afford to live. This is a high stress job that is meant for the young ""new to the work force"" generation."
bad,"I think my trainer needs more training."
bad,This used to be a great place to work but up until Starbucks bought the La Boulange bakery which turned out to be a massive $100 million dollar failure. Extreme pressure is now placed on all workers constantly up sale all the time. Most store managers in my district have been fired and replaced by outside hires that don't know what they're doing forcing all the people below them to work 3 times as hard stressing them out.
bad,Great job for a high school student or college student. Pay is decent and hours are flexible which help. Tough working in a small area all day.
bad,"I greatly enjoyed being able to teach others the skills of the trade, and helping those who have been with the company for a while. The job required me to be self sufficient and had a lot of responsibility. Since I was the only trainer, I was responsible for every employee our store hired. While it was difficult, I liked being able to teach and watching fellow employees grow."
bad,"The practices set by corporate are wonderful, but are often not followed through with at the store level, and are sometimes discouraged (WSIB claims specifically). The company recently has cut extra programs and benefits (Partner Appreciation Week specifically, a program that costs approx. $2mill.), citing too much expense, despite neting Billions of dollars in the previous calendar year. Other initiatives have been cut, including keeping orthopaedic floor mats, because they take too long to clean. There are also many flaws in the management system hierarchy, often leaving store managers grossly unmanaged, and leaving other partners in the store with no place to turn with complaints."
bad,"A typical day for me is clock in make drinks and leave."
bad,i loved working here in a short period of time you attend to alot of costumers and that makes the time go by fast the hardest part was keeping all the customers happy and satisfied
bad,Great benefits and flexible hours. The workers are nice and friendly as well as the customers. Tons of regulars. It requires you to do a lot for little pay. Pays better than most fast food places but not enough for the task you complete each day.
bad,"Typical work day was hard"
bad,"Im sure other starbucks are fine, the one i worked at was run by an ex drug addict, so it was ridiculous. was scheduled on days i had books off 3 weeks in advance more than 10 times, and when i didn't show up, i was written up, and when i took this issue to higher up people, nothing was done, do not get a job at starbucks."
bad,"Supervisors had the worst communication for new hires"
bad,"Depending on which location you work at, each management team is different. While some managers may be very understanding, some are not. "
bad,"While I certainly learned a lot during my tenure at Starbucks Canada, the Canadian division is not a great place to work. Work-life balance is non-existent and anyone below Senior Manager level is treated like a cog in the machine. There is very little room for advancement as the older members of the Marketing team refuse to leave, to the detriment of the organization. Don't be fooled by the title Brand Manager or Assistant Brand Manager - you aren't really managing anything from a marketing perspective and this is not your typical brand management role. The majority of the job is determining what US products to pick up and release in the Canadian market and lots of number crunching. If you're looking to stretch and extend your strategic and creative skills this is not the place for you. This is an operations driven organization so the majority of resources, effort and focus are on developing employees working in the stores. It doesn't really make the ""behind the scenes"" people feel appreciated or inspired."
bad,"You will see the same customer everyday at the same time for the same drink.  Some can be very pleasant and can brighten up your day, some can be very snotty and bring an attitude with them everyday, but after dealing with peoples beverages food and coffee I learned that patience is key, whether the customer is wrong or not just go along and make them feel right so they can purchase and you can continue your day. I really enjoyed being a barista and in my free time mixing up my own recipes."
bad,I just honestly wish the company had better leaders. They are not willing to work with individual employees who have children. They are really under handed when it comes to the hiring process. At one point you had to be like related to another employee in some way in order to even get in the door.
bad,The hardest part of the job is multitasking and picking up the slack because many people cannot keep up with the work level.
bad,"I worked at the same Starbucks for a little over two years. It was fairly busy café store. Something about this store deemed it unable to have a good store manager. The manager that was there when I started was ok at first, but it went down hill after we had a remodel of the entire store. She was under a lot of pressure by her higher-ups and I understand that but she just started to not care. She was never on time, never worked until her scheduled time, didn't care about the partners personal needs no matter the reason. Long story short, all of her employees, including myself, got fed up and reached out to corporate. They began an investigation on the subject and the DM personally interviewed almost every partner and after all of the partners had the same complaints, she was given an ultimatum, and decided to resign. So we ran the store on our own for a few months while they looked for a new manager for the store. "
bad,"A typical day at work was either funny or upsetting - depending on what standpoint I took. "
bad,"While working at Starbucks I served and made cold and hot drinks and food. Cashier. Stocked shelves with new products inside and out of store. Promoted new items and beverages. Cleaned store in its entirety. Management was inadequate, they did not live up to provisions that were agreed upon when I was hired, which made the job uneasy."
bad,"Starbucks is a great career anywhere else in the country. People look at it as such and respect you in your role, both inside and outside the company. But in DC, there is an ""us vs. them"" mentality that is next to impossible to break through in retail management."
bad,"Make coffee, serve drinks, cashier, cleaning. I learned food service is not easy. management was okay."
bad,"Typical day included being screamed at by coffee crazed rich people, being asked to buy drugs from my coworkers, and doing everyone else's job for them. "
bad,"I think that Starbucks is an awesome company, and I would have loved to stay working for the company, although there's a lack of respect for new baristas."
bad,"When I first started working there, I was thrilled and ready to start the new journey ahead of me, but only time could show how bad it would get. Management at 147th and maple don’t care about your needs or well-being, and will blame you for something going on in their life and do it in front of customers. If you want advancement, make sure you’re best friends with any management anywhere because they won’t consider you for the position and will bully you if you do anything wrong  also, if you aren’t great friends with your other co-workers, expect them to bully and talk down on you with no support from your manager because they are never around, nor do they care enough to help you  also I had to get  4 surgeries due to making drinks and holding the gallons of milk  so be careful of your arms and wrists  basically if you like coffee but want a terrible work environment, go work for starbucks"
bad,"A typical day is a constant rush. I've learned to be observant to everthing and everyone. Management is so biased is ridiculous. The culture is cool until they start hiring stagnate one sided ,unreliable employees. But the most enjoyable part are the travelers."
bad,"Starbucks fancies themselves a ""cafe"" environment, but applicants should be aware that Starbucks is more akin to fast-food than they advertise. "
bad,Bad part about working in such a small area is that if your coworkers are not good workers then you’re stuck doing all the work & there’s not even a manager on duty half the time so you’re just out of luck. Also as a person of color I felt completely out of place because of certain comments that coworkers made. Nothing unbearable though.
bad,"The culture is very excluding not inclusive. They pound a standard and a lingo into your head, it's very cult like, do this, be this or your out. A bunch of snobby mindless robots who don't care about the world, the peopl3, olnle their team, only themselves"
bad,"Just don’t work at Starbucks  it’s cool at first but just don’t. Management doesn’t care. The customers are awful, the pay is garbage. Just all around bad. I did seven years before I finally woke up"
bad,"A great place to work if you need a second, college, or just part time job. Fast paced and intense environment encourages team work and community spirit. There is very little advancement or meaningful pay raises and management will almost always advance the least qualified. Corporate is out of touch with the store/consumer, it takes them years to figure out what the bottom level already knows, but they will push new marketing or policies regardless."
bad,"Job becomes very demanding, for little monetary reward. Used to have to message my manager daily to see if I was useful for a few extra hours to try and make 40 hours weekly. They schedule you well below 40 hours at full time, and you have to scrape for more."
bad,Area directors are disappointing.  Very robotic in their approach to management and therefore are oblivious to identifying talent.  This translates down to the store managers who are often entry level for the industry and simply lack experience in handling conflict and developing team members.
bad,Very little support from management. Company is less supportive of their older partners and often pushes them out.  Benefits are good. No work-life balance
bad,The manager was not wanting to work with a person he did not like and he did not work evening shift he thought that he would only be able to work morning and afternoon
bad,"Starbucks is owned by shareholders.  Decisions are made at the behest of the price of shares. 2009 they let go of thousands of staff, closed hundreds of stores cause shares were falling because corporate grew to big too fast. And all the little people payed."
bad,"Empresa que se preocupa muy poco por sus baristas, la gerencia es muy turbia, sueldo bajo, poca flexibilidad horaria, se discrimina si estas en el sindicato y en base a eso las amonestaciones surgen y surgen. Falta de criterio absoluto y poca empatía con los baristas."
bad,"Coffee culture is always a fun place to work and you get to know people over all their returning visits. Also, although the compensation is not commensurate with the work, the benefits are great."
bad,Managed poorly and stressful. I loved the job honestly it was the managment that ruined it for me. I would work there again if the management changed and they paid better.
bad,I've worked for Starbucks on and off for five years; I use to be excited to work for this company but Starbucks doesn't care about the partnersanymore
bad,They talk a good game but do not back you up as a manager. They will hang you out to dry if you make a mistake. The District manager was always looking to dump on you.
bad,Never be a manager. Terrible higher ups. Terrible hours. Must meet sales targets or get disciplined but expect customers to pay $10 for a coffee the competitor is offering at $1. Goodluck
bad,I enjoy the people I work with and making drinks! I love the premium spotify and all the holiday cheer we would have each season! The partners are the best!! ALLLLL Managers just care about there bonus and connect with customers who dont want to connect with us!!
bad,"Ok place to work, good colleagues good environment if you enjoy fast-paced coffee making. Store dependant as to how you will enjoy it."
bad,I enjoyed the customers and performing my duties. The lack of leadership and rumor mill were horrible. They did offer good benefits but they didn't give you enough hours to qualify for them
bad,"I loved my job when I first began, that lasted about a year.  My boss left, I got promoted, then I moved stores.  That’s when things changed.  I noticed the company changing and the management changing.  We seemed to be losing sight of what the mission and values statement actually is.  I worked for this company for six years and it definitely changed me in more ways than one.  I once loved this job, I’m sad to see what it has become.  The stress is not worth losing yourself."
bad,"Almost no training, understaffed, unfair management. Management usually won't defend you against customers who can be cruel. Expected to put way too much of yourself into the job for barely over minimum wage."
bad,"Everyone stressed all the time, management only caring about profit, petty coworkers, promised advancement in the company for months but never happened, only enjoyable part of the job was getting coffee"
bad,The management was very friendly. The environment was not. People had their own little cliques and let you know that you were not apart of them. Shift leads would not let you learn on your own. They had to hover over you like you were incompetent of anything. Would cut you off in the middle of doing things so they could do it themselves. Would not recommend working for the Effingham location at all
bad,Typical day would be me getting to work wondering where my crew was and i would just have one new person with no training provided by management. Customers start coming in and I get stuck helping customers and we go down hard to busy to even ask for help and no managers in sight and no cumunication. sometimes no break or food. Managers don't take the inihitive to help. You must ask or basically tell them how to do there job. If you didnt ask and tell them its your fault for not communicating. I Learned how to be a 1 workforce barista with customers all around me thinking how cool it is with how fast and friendly efficent I was. I had to learn this skill just to keep up with orders. I wished my job was as cool as customers saw me but utter chaos lies on the barista side.
bad,They do not pay the baristas or supervisors well. Policies are very vague. The culture is not what they claim. Zero work/life balance. Management above is no help nor is level above.
bad,"While Starbucks offers many benefits, your experience will wildly vary from location to location. "
bad,"You get ridiculously little pay to do absolutely EVERYTHING. There is more to be done than there is time to do it in. Management is abismal; company is beyond disorganised; zero work/life balance; little regard from management and head office.... I was there for almost 2 years, and in all honesty, the only good thing about the job is the free coffee and the regular customers who understand you!"
bad,"Scheduling was very flexible, however if you want to move up it takes a long time. High favoritism. The partners I worked with were nice, however very young."
bad,Stuffy and uptight in some ways while lax in other ways. Fast paced environment puts employees on constant edge. They say one thing while pushing for another. Attire policy doesn't make any sense. Friendly people but atmosphere feels off.
bad,The manager at selden starbucks is verbally and emotionally abusive and corporate is impossible to reach. Tips were not done right and stolen. Manager does not allow you to switch shifts at all
bad,"My starbucks location was the 3rd busiest in utah, i had very poor management, the customers were some of the most rude people I’ve ever met, but the job itself without those cons being a barista was such an amazing experience & i would love another local barista job!"
bad,I just need a job but once I find another I will be quitting. It is a really stressful environment and my coworkers are rude. I never look forward to coming into work.
bad,"working at starbucks seemed the ideal job and was a very enjoyable atmosphere. However, the companies management is awful and they more often than not underpaid all of their staff and had very little concern when it came to help them."
bad,Bei Starbucks ist das Team mit am nettesten. Die Geschäftsführung ist grauenhaft es wird nur ausgenutzt und gelogen. Der Chef braucht ja nicht wirklich arbeiten Hauptsache die Mitarbeiter arbeiten für den Chef. Die Personalabteilung trägt die Nase ganz weit oben.
bad,"Intentionally overstaffed in order to make sure no one got more than 20 hours per week. Everyone talked negatively about everyone else, creating a negative atmosphere full of drama. No raises were ever given and only two select people were ever disciplined for no call no show, while the others could no call no show as much as they pleased."
bad,The job seemed good for the first month. Then it started to fall downhill very very fast. The job is way too demanding for the very little pay that it offers. Favoritism is very present in the store. The other baristas are very nice and helpful. But management is a train wreck. Work times are all over the place. Sometimes you work 19 days in a row without a day off. Management is extremely rude. Management keeps scheduling high school students during high school hours. And if you ever need to call in get ready to be told that your reason is not valid. Mom is in the hospital? Not a vaid reason. Have to go to a funeral? Not a valid reason. The pay is absolutely terrible. Tips are so inconsistent that you cant rely on them for anything. The pay per hour wouldn’t be too bad if your hours were not a chaotic mess. But with how hours are and the $9.23 an hour your paychecks are terrible.
bad,I had a stressful experience.  The management was careless and my training was all over the place.  It was not a pleasant experience.  The customers were demanding and the work was degrading.  I made barely enough to live and pay my bills.
bad,"The benefits are somewhat nice, the insurance plans and all... but the work load and expectations from management are completely insane... if you work there full time that is. The amount of things you have to do in so little time, pushing promotions, and quota sales per day tend to drive everyone a little crazy... I worked there for about a year and a half and we changed manager 4 times... staff turnover is frequent and and is a perfect example of how insane that company is, at all levels! Whether you're a manager, barista, SL..."
bad,"I can't say that this review is the same for all locations but this one is poorly managed. Every day I would have to pick up the slack from the morning supervisors, many people would not show up for work or be late constantly. I loved being a barista and my baristas were trained well, but the culture of the job was hard."
bad,"Typical day is making the drinks to Starbucks standard, cashier & get things ready for the morning staff.  Most enjoyable part of the work is working with good partners and most of the time the customers are pretty friendly.  It is a good part time job.  What I learned about is making drinkings to Starbucks' standards and also listen to customers when they want their drinks modified."
bad,"There were truly a lot of good people here, but they were afraid of telling the truth and or getting fired for being honest. If you got on the wrong side of the list, you paid for it. You will be pushed into a corner you don't want and told to leave if you don't like it."
bad,"Depends on the manager, district manager and coworkers. it can be fun but most of the time it's stressful and not worth all the training and strict corporate policies. you don't even learn about the origins of coffee anymore.because no one cares. it's all about nitro. better off working at a local coffee shop. tips would be much better and you wouldn't have to deal with the nasty customers and co-workers who get away with everything."
bad,"I hate working here and I've worked just about everywhere. As soon as I find another job I'm gone. "
bad,"The hours were constantly cut to less than 20 a week, after taxes and union pay you're required to pay your left with less than $100 a week. The management never listened to employees and never made proper compensations for the crowds of people coming in, despite being over staffed in employment there was rarely more than 1 person working. You would often be berated for not accomplishing tasks much larger than the allotted scheduled time with only one employee, as well as scolding employees for not accomplishing tasks that were not theirs to do. It was alright for the first 2 years but management changed over and it has gone downhill ever since. They constantly broke Western Union Law on breaks, hour devision, and treatment of employees, and the union would never respond."
bad,I worked at multiple different locations over my three years with Starbucks and the culture in each store was not welcoming and even isolating if you weren’t part of the stores “friends group.” After being isolating by the people I worked with they lied and exaggerated the truth to the point where I was fired. When I tried to defend myself they all stuck to their story. I unfairly lost my job due to their actions. In addition to to the other employee issues my location also closed shortly after I was fired and I can’t help thing that I was fired after the plan was created to close the store and they didn’t want to deal with having to having to be laid off.
bad,There was a lack of direction and structure due to store manager being unavailable a lot. The hardest part of the job was having zero support with call ins and shortage of staff from store manager and corporate.
bad,Starbucks is a great company to work at if you are not in management. There is little support from upper management when you are a manager at Starbucks. It is an environment created to support the support staff not the management staff. Bonus is based on what corporate says you need to meet and some of the goals are not attainable when you are in an old store in a rural environment.
bad,"Generally, I don't think Starbucks is a bad company but the store I am working right now is ghetto and hood like toxic work environment. The management is very terrible. It is full of lazy rude unprofessional ghetto women. There is very high turn over. I am about to quit and find a better job in a better and productive work enviroment. I don't recommend this place to anyone who is "
bad,"It's hard work. There is drama. The culture is all flowers and sunshine."
bad,"typical day at work was chaos."
bad,"I’ve worked at Starbucks for over a year now and although I’ve had a few good experiences, overall I feel like it was a waste of time. The pay is terrible, you’re always stressed out, it’s always busy. I feel like there’s not much room for advancement and even if you do, it’s still not a livable wage."
bad,"Awful place to work at  the salary was smaller than the official store, this specific store had no manager and when we did they didn't last long meaning supervisors had to do the job of a manager without extra pay and management higher was also terrible as they didn't take care of stuff that was needed to be fixed."
bad,"I only spent a year here, but many of my close friends have spent years here and never seen a pay raise. Every 8 hour shift turns into a 10 hour shift. The company is ALWAYS trying to save on labor of all things, even though they hardly pay their employees. Almost every other fast food place starts at $2-4/hr more. You’re permanently understaffed so it’s hard for new employees to keep up with the fast pace. Extremely high turnover because of this. Most of the long time employees end up working 10-14 hour shifts 3-5 days a week just to make up for everyone else’s slack and the lack of labor scheduled."
bad,"A typical day was either very stressful or very collaborative depending on the team you got to work with. expectations of roles were never clear and would change depending on who was shift lead. "
bad,"This isn't an overall review of the Starbucks company, simply the store I've worked at. Unfortunately the experience there isn't stellar but the staff are incredible to work with."
bad,I did not enjoy working here. I struggled to get the right hours due to juggling high school and another job. My manager wasn’t  very thorough or communicative.
bad,"making drinks at Starbucks is fun, but not a lot of hours are offered. barely anyone gets hours, everyone tries to be the boss so they can be promoted, the pay sucks, the tips are given at the end of the week, you will get tips based on how many hours you worked. managers are always favoring who they like. employees are rude, it was such a hostile enviroment when i worked.you get treated bad. the job isn't hard at all."
bad,"Management wasn't mature enough for the position. I went to work feeling bullied and under appreciated. Manager was dishonest and did not hold a professional demeanour when she was stressed. Was treated very poorly and felt like the work environment was hostile and uninviting that i no longer wanted to go to work. management was complacent and didn't pull their weight in action or on the floor coverage. There was no ownership or accountability from the management. Very poor training and role modelling for the younger hires. So many of their ingredients are processed and felt like the brand has lost sight of love of coffee and becoming to corporate. Sliding away from their mission statement, which is too bad. Would not consider working here again. Very disappointed with management attitude and  lack of professionalism or time invested in training. would suggest a stronger link between employees and head office, revaluate managements credentials. if employees were trained better, customers would be happier, and more positive experience for baristas and customers. training from head office was great, training on floor was lacking implementation by manager."
bad,The company use to be a fun place to work now with all these rules on what you can and can not do it makes it hard for someone to have fun. No advancements after becoming a shift once in that role you will be stuck.
bad,its okay some days are rough but customer connection used to make me go to work everyday.      management in broward county sucks and don't do enough for a hardworking person
bad,"Management (especially the temp agency supervisors) are incredibly demeaning, inconsiderate and condescending. Rules are illogical and unfair. Communication between the various supervisors, leads and trainers is pathetic which leads to consistent conflicts in the work place. All of this is most likely what contributes to the huge turnover rate and thus if you're a temp, you will probably never become a permanent employee."
bad,"upper management doesn't listen to anyone under them. SMs only care about their ASMs, they choose favorites. Baristas and shifts are under paid! its a horrible job and terrible communication. Most people if promoted to shift quit between the first and second year. Baristas are always in and out, and if they stay then they are the lucky few who got Favorited and cared for."
bad,A typical day would consist of getting harassed by my manager and employees. Poor training was provided and a healthy atmosphere was not present. Might have had a better experience elsewhere.
bad,"My coworkers were the rock to me working here so long, besides that Starbucks is a toxic work environment. The expectations of a scripted customer conversation takes away personality of the barista. Feels very robotic. If you don't follow the scripts they give you to the exact point, be prepared to be penalized"
bad,"I learned the importance of good managers and team work , also communication. Being new helped me see the great value of following the directions given."
bad,"It was okay for a high school job. The hours were good, corporate didn’t really care about us though. I remember once there was a terrible terrible snowstorm and the big boss wouldn’t let us go home an hour early even though there was like 6 inches of snow on the road and a total blizzard, we were also all about 16."
bad,Experience will vary by location but the location I worked at wasn't cared for very well by district manager which caused a very stressful work environment. One of the busier locations yet was never given enough labor hours to compensate for the standards demanded.
bad,"Starbucks taught me numerous every day skills that I did not even realize I was learning. The company taught me a lot about myself but it is currently headed in a different direction. The job lacked growth opportunity from inside, they tend to hire more outside hires for leadership positions rather than promote from within."
bad,"Truly the best part of the this job is the customers. "
bad,"lots of not so great, overpriced coffee. i would recommend this place to someone who needs a job and can handle the fast paced environment and the window time, would not recommend this to someone with an autism brain"
bad,"Starbucks cares more about standardization and sales scores than the actual partners who work there. They overwork us and underpay us, then treat our winding stamina like it is our fault. They also treat us, even seasoned partners like myself, like we're expendable. Management doesn't care about anything, but keeping the store running."
bad,"I can't speak for company-owned stores but like and franchised store the benefits are non-existent and resources and staffing are kept to an absolute minimum. "
bad,"Too stressful for what you get paid. More like underpaid. Customer is always right , even though you wanna enforce policy. It’s a joke. Customers are morons at times."
bad,"I see a a lot of play time with staff and managers are too young to control the locations and don't care. District manager just comes in and "" barks"" orders to everyone and does not help at all... Lazy. NO team work at all.. what happen to clean as you go!!! Syracuse area NOT GOOD all all. Other areas I have too are been much better."
bad,"Starbucks is a billion dollar corporation. They do offer benefits after 5 months of employment a free meal and drinks while on shift but the job is stressful and shifts are consistently understaffed."
bad,The starbucks way is to make the company or store profitable and then peoples needs come after. I worked for the company for 8 years and never made more than 11.00 an hour.
bad,The Starbucks I worked at was not a good one. Management didn’t support employees and didn’t know how Starbucks work. I had 5 managers in the time at I worked at Starbucks and not one was able to help me move up in the company. I tried for a very long time and nothing came about it.
bad,"I loved working here in the beginning. Until they stopped hiring people. They are extremely understaffed, and think that your work should be top priority other than your life. "
bad,"*typical day*"
bad,"If you like doing things with your hands, interacting with people, and moving at a hectic pace during your whole shift, it's great. No major advancement opportunities. Not great benefits, wages are not good at all, management is not consistent from location to location."
bad,"The job required long hours on my feet while doing the work of 3 different positions because the store was always understaffed, management would find any reason to criticize employees and sometimes sent people home early who needed the hours"
bad,"The problem with Starbucks lies in the management's approach to customer service, and how it effects the partner experience. At Starbucks, the customer is always right, to a fault. Threats of violence are met with apologies instead of ejection. Customer behavior that would be unacceptable in any safe or professional environment is coddled and rewarded with free drinks. Partners are expected to provide great customer service at all times, but receive little to no support from management if a serious problem arises."
bad,"Run please, they are flexible in terms of the hours but it's not worth the headache to work there. It's mostly an issue with the management, and lack of respect form customers. I know partners from Starbucks in different area's that have had hot coffee thrown at them."
bad,"My 6 months at Starbucks was very stressful. The work environment was very hostile. I expected the customers to be challenging, but it was more so my fellow coworkers. Working in an environment with people who think they no more than anybody and are just flat out rude, does not make a person want to go to work."
bad,"I have nothing to say than don't bother applying unless you don't mind being treated as nothing but a number."
bad,"its cool. gotta imrpove the team. not everyone respects eachother , everyone needs to be on the same page and work for each other. it felt like some of us were being taken advantage of"
bad,I don't have much to say about working for Starbucks other than I would never work for them again. Indeed.com wants me to write more in this review but I don't feel that that is necessary.
bad,"Working at Starbucks is only worth if you worked directly for starbucks, not as a  contractor.  It's tough to convert to contractor to FTE because you're only allowed to do that if a FTE leaves.  Which rarely happens."
bad,"The benefits are fine, I don't use them. There is never time to pursue what the company wants because they dont know what happens everyday. It's stressful, hard and unfair. The pay is pretty much nonexistent for how much everything is and your responsibilities"
bad,"Starbucks can be a good and heathy place to work, depending on the people in upper management. Upper management chooses who the like and don't like, almost immediately after you introduce yourself to them. The way that some people are treated is objectionable, and a lot of people are worked to the bone."
bad,"Great if you're a high school student. Other than than that... benefits are good,but not worth the environment you're in everyday. No room to advance or move up."
bad,"Overall, Starbucks is a decent place as a starter job. The benefits aren't bad, having the ability to build a 401K is something not a lot of young people can say they can build, and the hours a flexible. Working with Starbucks is overall a 7/10, because things aren't always as they seem."
bad,"Sometimes I think it's just me that realizes how badly Starbucks actually treats its employees. Sometimes I believe it is just the decent benefits and flexible scheduling that gets people stuck there. Sometimes, that's not even enough. There's a reason the turnover rate is high. It is because a company run by corporate who doesn't understand the necessity of making those who are actually working in their stores feel like they actually care makes the day that much more stressful. Oftentimes employees are treated like complete trash because Starbucks wants to ensure every customer comes first. And yeah, sure the benefits are decent; but having that much money out of your pay check when you're living solely of your income is close to impossible. It's all a scam."
bad,"Coworkers harass you, manager is terrible, only 14 hrs a week when you ask for more it gets denied.  the only good thing is you can request off just about anytime you want"
bad,"Je suis arrivée chez Starbucks en pensant arriver dans une équipe jeune avec laquelle tout se passerait bien, on nous vends lors des formations que nous sommes tous égaux et que nous sommes tous des partenaires pas de hiérarchie et beaucoup de sympathie. On m'a bizuté, mal parlé, si tu ne t'impose pas on te bouffe, je me suis faite hurler dessus par des employées, j'ai été la bête noire de ce starbucks et on m'a viré à la fin de ma période d'essai et ce n'était même pas mes managers mais un manager d'un autre café qui était venu nous aider qui me l'a annoncé. Je recommande très peu de travailler là bas ou du moins trouver un starbucks avec une équipe au top qui saura vous accueillir normalement."
bad,not a job i recommend unless you can keep up and have a great team as well as management. please keep in mind the Starbucks i worked for was located in target.
bad,"Nice people . Very poor compensation for amount of work expected.  Chaotic scheduling.  High turnover of staff"
bad,"We got a new manager and everything changed. Everyone wants to quit (including me). Bad management, we get less hours, low morale. The DM doesn’t care about us, they only care about the money."
bad,The managers are more concerned with their every other week vacations to pay attention to the majority of the staff. The people you work with are great but management acts like they want to promote within and have people advance in their coffee knowledge and then never get the opportunity despite repeatedly showing an interest and asking when the classes would be offered.
bad,I had too many personal things happen at this job I would rather not discus. Starbuck as a corporation might be okay but the store I worked at had a lot of issues and they are the reasons I left the company.
bad,"Huge staff retention, zero hours contract"
bad,"For me, I was in a Target cafe. Dealing with the flow of shoppers from Target and constant children and single mothers changed the atmosphere from a regular Starbucks."
bad,"It is extremely difficult to source, train and retain baristas and supervisors, causing store managers to work up to hundreds of hours per week to keep stores operating."
bad,"This company has the best healthcare options and education programs however this company also suffers from racism, unfair conditions forced upon employees of color. Its no tolerance policies has holes in it and starbucks continues to brush things under the rug."
bad,"This was a job that the company was really great at portraying to the world that they valued their employees and were great people. However, they set us up for failure often by poor management and lack of support in staff members. They would often implement things that were impossible to achieve well and maintain great customer service. There is so much, but ultimately I believe Starbucks hires some of the best, hard working people and wears them down with low pay, overly high expectations for small pay, lack of support, and lack of tools to succeed. Maybe it wasn't always this way, but I see amazing, hard working people get so worn out and stretched so thin that I decided i do not want to move up in a company like that."
bad,I hated working here because the management treated the staff poorly and didn't allow for any time off even though they are zero hour contracts. I worked hard and tried my best at working as a barista but got told off if I got an order wrong.
bad,"Working for Starbucks, and as a whole restaurant brands was not a pleasure at all. I found working there stressful, training of staff under par, and responsibility of management lacking. I did not feel like a valued member of a team, and did not see any incentive to work hard and drive sales.  I worked for Starbucks for just short of a year and will never go back."
bad,This company has been successful by driving its employees to the ground. There is no loyalty and management does not back up employees. This job is best fit for recently graduated high school students looking to earn a little extra spending money.
bad,"Joining Starbucks in 2010 I was impressed with the benefits available for part time work. The company was very Partner centered. Today teams are told what should be done, when it should be done, who should do it, and how long it should take. They make is so easy  and wonderful to be a customer and teams are expected to make every moment right, aka “just say yes “. This has created a culture of entitlement and demands from customers who know a call to customer service or the district manager will get them $20 on their account. Teams expected to deliver more items with complicated builds, faster and with ever decreasing labor allowances. Pay is low for baristas who aren’t interested in perks such as health care, free food, drinks, Spotify, or even college at ASU. They need money for food and rent. Demands are increasing and trust, resources, and motivation are decreasing. Retention is at an all time low and managers are leaving in droves. There is no appreciation for managers who carry the load for low sales across the board, attendance issues that require them to work 16 hour days, cleanliness issues arising from not having enough people to serve customers and attend to the store, and last minute changes made to offerings with limited supplies available to provide them. The company has turned a dark corner and is headed down a bad road."
bad,Very hectic and exciting place to work. Never a dull moment until after closing time. I did enjoy working alongside most of my fellow baristas. I will miss the good times we had.
bad,"If you want to work for Starbucks for ""fun"" then i'd recommend working for them. Starbucks is constantly changing the rules and expectations of the baristas and do not pay for it. The pay rate is absolutely ridiculous, i work full time and still cannot afford rent, it barely pays my bills. i like how i can get discounts on drinks and free food and drinks on my shift but other than that theres no other benefits that i would recommend working there."
bad,My manager user to ask me why I worked so hard. This was a direct reflection of the lack of work ethic from the managers and the employees. They would also schedule me for 39 hours a week so they didnt have to give me benefits.
bad,Learned how to multitask in an extremely fast paced environment. This job is perfect for young adults attending college.  I do not believe this job is meant for people to work for years at a time do to the strains it puts on your body.
bad,"I worked at Starbucks for a little over 2 years. One store is the suburbs of Maryland Waldorf for 6 months and my second location was Navy yard Washington dc. Overall Starbucks was a very difficult job due to the disrespectful customers in Washington DC. Maryland the culture is better but the pace is slower making the job a lot harder to cope with when you are not busy or moderately busy but not busy enough for time to pass. The best part about working at Starbucks were the free stocks after being a partner for one year and the weekly free tea and coffee is so sweet. Also the flexibility within your schedule. The cons of Starbucks the addicted customers, low pay, poor management. Hardest part of the job getting through the day. Most enjoyable part the free breakfast but my store did that Starbucks actually wants you to pay for it. I did learn a lot and later worked for Verizon Wireless with the skill set it took to work at Starbucks for that length of time. So I guess it paid off. Still rate them 2 out of 5 stars."
bad,"Starbucks et les valeurs qu'elle prone s'arrete à l'entretien d'embauche. "
bad,"No positive reinforcement,  no support for staff at all, problems just get brushed off. Eurogarages don't care about their employees, only care about their standards. awful place to work."
bad,"A typical day at the famous Starbucks Coffee Company as a barista is both hectic and non-rewarding. Given I left this employment due to a change in management and personally i believe a downgrade in management. I started at Starbucks working for a skilled, team-oriented manager that put herself among the baristas as an equal. The last manager I had directing me had been transferred from a completely different company and lacked knowledge or experience of being at the lower levels of Starbucks Company. Aside from the management problems. Starbucks has a lack of praise for their worker bees. Buzzing from one task to the other, all while keeping customers happy and displaying a pleasant smile for all to see, there is no reward or bonus for continuous sales or best on bar or even over the top customer service skills."
bad,"Had a lot of problems with scheduling and management, to the point where I would be personally blamed by other staff members for not having covered a shift I had taken off weeks prior, even though THATS THE MANAGERS JOB. Handed in a letter with my two weeks and never heard from the company or my team lead since. Pretty sure I'm blacklisted, but oh well."
bad,"I was given basic training on becoming a barista (three drinks, types of roast, and cup size), and on day one was put on register. I had never before been on a register or seen their set up, so I was highly stressed and massively unprepared to assist the customers that came in."
bad,"The company really does try to make it seem by title and vocal encouragement that you are able to advance and have a half-career, but with this type of environment, I do believe that this is a job for people under 22 years of age."
bad,"Management is lazy and treats everyone like a number."
bad,"Starbucks is by far one of the most stressful jobs I've ever worked. Management doesn't really care about you, and you are in danger of losing your job at any moment no matter your skill level. Nobody is truly an asset to a company that is slowly losing it's focus on product quality and customer connections."
bad,"My manager failed to follow through with my training, even when I brought it up to her on multiple occasions. I was paired with kind and experienced workers, but due to the lack of training could only help them by keeping the kiosk and dishes clean, restocking ingredients, and brewing basic coffee. My co-workers helped me get unofficial training in the few moments when we wouldn't have a customer. In the end my manager stopped scheduling me without giving a reason, I had to call in and ask about it, I was not officially fired but when I asked if she was going to schedule me again she said no."
bad,"In my 2+ years as a Starbucks barista I feel as  though it started out as all that I could have dreamed and then slowly that dream became a reality. Ultimately the job is what you make it and I have had great days, however the treatment from management can often be unfair. The environment can become very toxic and some managers choose to neglect it and allow it to build up. They will skip over promotions and there is definitely favoritism among the ones I worked at."
bad,"Don't work here unless you really have to and you need their insurance.  It's an overrated overprice company that serves the rich.  The management is horrible.  They treat their employees like dogs, especially the ones that do the most work.  That day of training where they had to close all those stores.  That was an excellent idea.  Get your employees trained with some courtesy and respect. Managers and employees who not only care about the business but the customers and their employees.  Instead of these heartless caffeinated robots."
bad,"Starbucks is a fantastic place to gain or sharpen certain job skills. However, if you are looking for a career there be ready to put in a lot of time and effort for a very minimal payoff."
bad,A day at Starbucks is like any other day at any coffee shop. We Try to make every customer day better as they walk into the store. But in my honest opinion the mangers are not very respectful.
bad,"The culture had changed by the time I started my tenure, so I believe I had an experience in the shifting Starbucks landscape."
bad,"Not feeling valued or supported by the company. In regards to scheduling and weekly hours, there is no guarantee to the weekly hours or a set schedule, making it hard to support yourself and count on those paychecks. The work load placed on us is far too much for the pay we receive."
bad,"Starbucks expects you to work, which is great.  However, management frequently sends mixed messages.  Need to work to get projects done by set date, then after date passes and project is delivered, you are admonished for putting in the extra time and energy to meet the assigned deadline."
bad,"Not the best pay, decent benefits, but the corporate culture at Starbucks sucks. When Shultz was CEO, the company felt better to work for, but recent changes in upper management in the company has made Starbucks an unpleasant place to work."
bad,The management at the specific location I worked at  employees out with rude and childish behavior. Will never go back. I watched valuable employees leave one at a time due to poor management
bad,Wasn't worth the hours you put in to the amour you were paid . It was a joke they wouldn't even give you a shift drink. I worked at one in Fred Meyer which didn't allow you to work more then part time 25 hours
bad,Poor and shady management. They were highly over staffed meaning very few hours and low pay for the amount of effort put into working at the establishment.
bad,I disliked working for Starbucks. You are definitely not paid enough for the required work. It's a very fast paced environment with many rules to follow.
bad,"I loved making drinks and getting to make drinks for myself, yet the management was very poor. It was difficult to stay on my feet for hours on end and it was very fast paced."
bad,"Remained a store manager for several years, no opportunity for advancement.  Required to work several hours/week.  Manager played favorites, and if they did not like you, would find reasons to get rid of you.  Not a healthy work environment."
bad,"This is a great job if you're just out of college. They rarely ever give raises and there is a lot of talk around career advancement, but it never happens. There is a lot of corporate push on local store who do not understand the obstacles the baristas face on a daily basis- upper management is more concerned about numbers and district quotas."
bad,This was my favorite job because of the people I worked with. The management was unprofessional and had lots of room for improvement but the overall culture was incredible. It was fun to be in such a busy location on a college campus
bad,This job is good as a starter job not really that much room to grow. Not much culture diversity depending on the location. Management could use some serious work.
bad,Management did not care for any previous responsibilities prior to working the job.Requesting time off was always a struggle. Manager did not perform to the right standards
bad,"Good for students, Very much team orientated, Very high paced environment and you have to be able to multi-task efficiently, there is room for growth but it really depends on the fairness of management, fun job. pay is minimum wage."
bad,"The training was poor from the start, the management was not particularly skilled at dealing with the public let alone managing employees.  Over all it was interesting, but sadly poor leadership lead me to leave."
bad,"While my fellow employees were fun in spirit, the mood was sour and the management poor. There was only one location (of three) that I worked at that had exceptional management."
bad,"Managers had no idea how to run a cafe, understaffing was a goal. I've heard other Targets are better to work for. But my location was awful, and we were constantly coached for coming short on cleaning and slow service, but we often were working alone or with only one other person during peak business hours."
bad,"A typical day at work would be an environment where it's packed inside the cafe and through the drive thru. All day we would be busy but continue to have a positive outlook and a smile on our faces no matter how difficult the situation of lack of employees. During peak hours from 11-4 pm, we would only have one person on bar, one person on drive thru, one person as customer service, one person on front register, causing the line inside and outside to be of upset customers who waited entirely too long for their drinks or food. Not only were we not allowed to handle out free drinks for the wait, or recovery cards to apologize to the customer for waiting 20 minutes, but we weren't allowed to call others for help, due to them wanting a specific set of hours given to each store. The only solution to complaints or upset customers that we learned from other stores and other employees, from managers to shift supervisors, were to input the customer's drinks into the system, and if they were upset over how long it would take to make the drink, or if it was incorrectly made, was to hand out the drink as a ""free"" drink or a right now recovery drink, or to give out service recovery cards. And due to the lack of communication, we are no longer allowed to do so. The lack of concern for the customer service and the concentration on income for this Corporate company has become corrupt."
bad,"Gave me more anxiety, stress and depression. I had a love hate relationship with starbucks. Its time for my chapter to end.There is alot of racism and favouritism in this company. Baristas often steal and slack off."
bad,company leaderships vision does not make it down the ladder appropriately. Expectations in every role are incredibly high for the amount of pay. Very little work-life balance.
bad,The first store I worked for had a good team spirit. The second store I worked at was horrible with a completely incompetent manger. District managers do nothing to control issues at the store level and do not seek input about the store from anyone other that the store manager. (in the Portland metro) Each store is on its own.
bad,"Leadership doesn't know what they are doing. Scattered strategic focus; always chasing shiny new toy. The corporate politic cliques are unlike anything I have ever seen. There is no support in development in order to move up, no clear career development or support; you are on your own."
bad,Jobs here are for very specific type of personality. Very high stress and fast paced. Benefits are good but come at a cost. Company values customer satisfaction and brand reputation over employees.
bad,"It was a fun job to be in. The coworkers were great, the customers were nice, and it was a good atmosphere over all. The job itself was not super demanding but did require very good customer service skills. Managers are notoriously bad and are not dedicated to the Starbucks as they have other responsibilities as Kroger emplyees"
bad,"The quality of shift managers basically determines how difficult the job is, in terms of emotional, mental, and physical strain. Shift managers who are unqualified and do not fulfill their duties make Starbucks a difficult place to work; the baristas already have their hands full with their own tasks, but it can be hard if we have to take on extraneous duties that the shift managers should be taking on. On the other hand, competent and helpful shift managers can make a shift at Starbucks one of the best parts of my day. Also, the amount of physical, mental, and emotional labor that the baristas have to exert is worth way more than $11/hour."
bad,"It was an efficient job, despite the incredibly low hours for someone who was hired on the base of 32 hours per week. At present I am working less than I am not, and as such i am struggling to pay my bills which include rent, utilities, and overall eating."
bad,"Starbucks is overall a great company. What they stand for and the benefits that they offer their employees are great. The only thing that is terrible and that might make someone think that Starbucks isn't a good place to work in is the location and the management team that there is. The management team for example where I am located are hostile, child-like, and they talk about all the employees in a very unprofessional way. They also mess with your work schedule if they don't like you. They don't give new baristas the chance to learn and to grow. They expect you to know everything and to work at a fast pace. The 10 year partners don't even work as fast or as eloquently as they expect the new partners to work."
bad,Trying the new drinks. I didn't care for coffee or coffee related drinks until I started working there. I'm a huge fan of Chai Tea Lattes and the Strawberry Refreshers now.
bad,"very stressful ,not that flexible and the pay is not great either ,difficult to get a 40 hour week . there is much better options out there so my advice would be to try other options first ."
bad,"Was not an enjoyable place to work. The staff was rude, the pay was low, and the stress was high. It was hard to get most days or hours off even when i requested them months before."
bad,"poor management, stressful work, no work life balance"
bad,"If you are looking for a career or job that will take you places, Starbucks is not the place. This job is meant for college students or people who have retired."
bad,"Management was almost always terrible, and we never had the same manager for more than 6 months at a time. Pay was average, considering that on a weekly basis you are constantly being told to cut your hours (because surprise, they don't want to pay you, even when you want to work and do a good job)."
bad,"Very bad management"
bad,Everyone thinks Starbucks is a large rich powerful company but as a store manager I had little payroll to run my store. I was shocked by the culture behind the scenes vs public perception.
bad,"Hardest part of the job is all mental.  "
bad,"In order to qualify for benefits, you need to average 20 hours a week.  Management only has people 24 and under working these hours as they are still covered under their parents insurance.  Management says that they cannot give more hours to the rest of us, but they do for their favorites."
bad,"Starbucks is all politics. Most employees are younger which increases turnover. The benefits are great, but if you are supporting yourself on this job alone it is hard to make ends meet."
bad,"Starbucks Ireland has great co workers but horrible management. "
bad,"Worked at a licensed store in a hotel, so a corporate Starbucks may have been more enjoyable to work at. Recommend working at a real (corporate Starbucks) to be part of the real experience."
bad,The hardest part of the job was making drinks but after it got easier and you start learning everything by yourself I had to teach myself and the supervisor had help me to.
bad,"Management was unreliable and stretched thin, too much pressure on lowest level employees who had no power over how their job was run. Stores were cramped and packed too tightly, no room to relax and have time off. Schedule was always made in advance and then changed sporadically with minimal warning. Employees expected to adapt to the constant changing needs of the job and let their lives be secondary."
bad,"A typical day was standing at the sample cart, trying to invite people into the store. Starbucks has put in new changes to the company that have turned it away from the once-great ""tea & customer first"" it used to be. Now, it is all about percentages and who sells what. This was my favorite job, but I had to leave because of constant harassment from management, even after I reported it to HR. Nobody ever did anything, so I separated from the company with much sadness."
bad,"My first job at Safeway Starbucks was difficult due to its memorization/customer service nature. Each day had regular breaks, and most of the time you would get off when scheduled. However, the turnover rate was high and stress was daily. This night not be the case at every location, but it was my experience."
bad,The general job at Starbucks is fun and relatively easy. The specific store makes all the difference. The staff are very into their cliques and it's hard to penetrate and feel like a member of the team.
bad,"Company preaches Job work/life balance but does't allow management to practice that, you are on call 24/7 even when you are on vacation. Salary was good if you were only working 40 hours/week. Benefits and partner perks were good. Lack on consistent support from DM's and RD's. Never challenge the status quo!! Company has changed and store managers are not as important or valued as shift supervisors and baristas in my opinion. There is a lack of consistency across cities, and provinces."
bad,Very welcome place to work when i started. A lot of regulars make working there like a second home. New management aren't as considerate and flexible than the old manager.
bad,"Very busy work place , some days youll have fun & loving customers other times youd have your bad days due to all the bussyness but over all fast paced,"
bad,Better off working for Costa. I was installed as store manager and it took a year to train me even then I weren't trained  property ended up doing 60+ hours a week on Baristas pay. Then when they did a store Refurbishment they got rid of previous staff and moved in Staff from there Company owed store. Which was done in a sneaky underhanded way.
bad,"Effectively communicates expectations"
bad,Have to be able to multitask. Move quick and have good sense of urgency. Time management is very important as well. My co-workers were all great. Except the manger causes a negative work environment by being hostile.
bad,"Upper management at this particular Starbucks location tends to make passive aggressive remarks to employees rather than directly confronting them or providing constructive criticism. Shift supervisors are great, but tend to be overworked and underpaid (partly due to upper management). Co-workers tend to be friendly and personable."
bad,"nasıl çalışanı sömürürüm düşüncesi hakim, kahve bayatlığı cabası"
bad,"Be prepared to work VERY hard as a Barista. Co-workers come and go before you can even get their names straight. Management is rude. There are some nice perks, though. Health insurance is a plus. Free coffee beans every week and a free cup of coffee every shift is also a plus."
bad,"Starbucks does not pay enough, what an understatement. Pay your employees more, and give them a little credit! Your insurance is crazy expensive for being so ""cutting edge""! You don't care about the individual. I with that I could give negative stars for compensation. I sold my soul to Starbucks for $8 dollars a forking hour. Nice."
bad,The stress and harassment that has occurred in the store that I worked at for many years was not worth the time being employed there. Manager at that store I worked for was verbally abusive to the staff all the time. But overall the customers and my employees made work bearable.
bad,"Starbucks is a great place to work and I sincerely loved the atmosphere and my coworkers. The company went through 3 different managers while I worked there, and unfortunately the last one was awful. She's responsible for half of our staff leaving the establishment and I would never work for someone like her again."
bad,A lot of responsibility given of which i was quite capable but when questioned certain duties was never given any answers.
bad,"Enjoyed working with the public"
bad,"We didn't really do anything, training was a piece of cake, the Manager was a joke, she can't even swim. It was more like working with the ""Housewives of Reno"". Constant popularity contest between the manager and the patrons."
bad,"I wish I would've appreciated Coffee well I worked there, I wasn't there yet. "
bad,"few words can describe what a hellish experience working at starbucks is.  everyone knows retail in general isn't the most glorious job type, but theres just something specail about starbucks that is so decisively evil and tortuous that working here may actually turn you into a worse human being, your coworkers will be your teammates, your family, your brothers and sisters in arms who stand with you against the tide of caffeine zombies who assault the store regularly. your mangers however will generally be hypocritical troglodytes who sold there soul to the corporate demons for slightly more money. the customers treat you like lesser humans, unwillingly to show any kindness or pardon for poor management or things beyond your control as is typically the case with retail."
bad,This place should be shut down or get new management.  Atmosphere sucked and no one should work there.  Management don't care about employees but only about themselves
bad,very fast passed job. the management at my specific work location was quite unorganized. i felt there was a lot of responsibility for very little pay or appreciation.
bad,"Taking drink and food orders, filling orders, cashier, stocking, cleaning, inventory. I learned a lot about about how to make the drinks and how to create your own. The head manager was great but the guy below him was a jerk to everyone would yell at people in front of customers and would accuse people of things they didn't do. A lot of the other managers for the other parts in the store were great I had worked for a couple of them prior in other parts of the plaza  but the manager of Starbucks was never there. She wouldn't train you. Everyone did everything differently so no one knew how it was supposed to go. She would help every other part of the plaza when things got busy except for Starbucks and then yell at us because we weren't going fast enough or we were understaffed. Co-workers were great. Hardest part was remembering the ingredients for the orders. Most enjoyable part was being able to make people's days by making their orders to great standards."
bad,"same as receiver, opening and closing the store , making coffee every 30 minutes, providing a friendly and uplifting experience , every job is the same just different environments , co- workers lol like I said make customers happy and co-workers get jealous call it positive reinforcement. Helping others and getting help. Going home after the work is done."
bad,Working from a franchised Starbucks to an actual Starbucks was a difficult transition. I was paid lower than what I earned at the franchised Starbucks and I was not tipped as much. Also the work was very physically demanding. They would also cut my hours without permission and would also dismiss me when I did come to work
bad,"Great co-workers, good manager, sociopath DM"
bad,A typical day of work depends on where I am stationed.  If I am stationed at the bar the day is jam packed with making drinks.  If I am stationed at the cash register I interact more with customers and make sure I write down their drink correctly.
bad,"Regional Management in the Los Angeles Market was not up to par, with the vast territory and verity of culture in each neighborhood, District Managers are not able to have personal input on how to increase sales."
bad,Worst job I ever worked the managers  was kinda rude and racial I didnt like it at all
bad,"I enjoyed working there due to the building, but it did not feel like I was welcomed even by my boss."
bad,A typical day at work is a lot of standing and a lot of walking back and forth. A lot of cash handling and orders. I learned responsibility to wake up in the morning and leave in a reasonable time to get to work on time. And I learned how to handle money and work a cashier. Also I learned how to make delicious drinks. The management was poor I didn't have work on the day we get our paychecks so when I went back to work the supervisor found my paycheck in the garbage. I was so upset about that. My co-workers were good except for one. Their always one rotten egg.The hardest part of the job was doing everything you had to do at store support within 15 minutes. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting free food and pastry's.
bad,Working here you are expected to work at an insanely fast speed with no to little experience. The co-workers at times like to gang up on people for no reason. Co-workers don't show up on time and believe they deserve special treatment for it. Hardest part of the job is to not let all the rude customers and rude co-workers get under your skin.
bad,"good for a beginner for a coffee shop industry."
bad,"Starbucks does not make it easy for their employees to become promoted and if they do, it takes very long and it is an unorganized process."
bad,As a barista--> Great job! Shift supervisor positions can be good but manager positions are a min of 50 hours per week for 40 hours of pay
bad,"Very fast paced. Lots of customers, not so great of employees."
bad,I have been with the company for 8.5 yrs. Tons of movement with upper management changes
bad,"Working there used to be fun. I had no problems waking up at 3:45am to work at 4:15am to 12:30pm. Or 4 pm to 1am. It was a fun job that wanted us to focus on the customer and make connections. It then started to to focus on the time. How long it would take to make this drink and get it to the customer and send them on their way. So after all the training and time spent on getting to know some of the people we would see every day the company told us to give them their stuff and hurry them along."
bad,"I worked at several locations."
bad,"Youre always forced to push product on people who dont want to buy them and tell employees they have to sell more more more (which involves a lot of lying). People come to Starbucks to relax, not to get product shoved down their throat. Management (which I am sad to say I was apart of) forced others to take away the great experience i know Starbucks can over. This was a completely different company 5 years ago. "
bad,"Practiced the art of making coffee beverages"
bad,"There's not much to say about Starbucks. Since I was in training during the time I was there, I can't touch basis for a typical day at work. Though during training I did learn how to make multiple beverages and understood the basics with the timing of everything in the store. "
bad,"I had the pleasure of working for this company while they were doing budget cuts and store closings. this was terrible as it threatened to put me out of a job at any given time. the company even switched the health plan mid year so all deductibles were reset, terrible business! They used to care more about their employees than a dime. Now i feel like they have become a full-fledged ""craporation"""
bad,"I worked for a Licensed Starbucks in the PDX airport. To compensate for commuting time, shuttle wait time, and waiting in security lines, I had to leave an hour and a half before my shift. I only lived 11 miles from the Airport. Shifts were very fast paced due to the constant flow of passengers on and off flights. Most day shifts consisted of a constant line at the registers. Both morning and afternoon shifts only made from 5-20 dollars in tips. Only enjoyable experiences I had as a Starbucks employee were the conversations I had with customers landing from international flights. I loved hearing about where people have been and what they experienced."
bad,"Starbucks is essentially a dressed up fast food coffee house. The benefits are great and inexpensive, however the partners (employees) are not valued as they can be replaced easily and a new one can be hired at minimum wage. We work our tails off, get talked to like we are indentured servants by some customers and the tips are so so. Managers can be lazy, and work less than 20 hours a week and keep their positions as once you get to that level-your job is very secure. However, everyone under them is dispensible and has to work like a dog."
bad,"Partners at the upper rungs of the ladder are treated more like partners (bonus/perks) whereas, the lower level are treated as illerate and incapable. I have a masters degree and have not been able to move up the Sbux ladder. In part, due to managers past work relationships ie: (bring in their prior staff) and lack of on-the-job learning opportunities for current partners (raise the job descriptions where only exterior people are qualified to fill (systems sub-par). Current partners are stuck in dead-end jobs and are subject to (revolving door) dictator-like managers who immediately after their immersion methodically fire current partners and fill with their selections with a new job desciption and higher salary. Stay away unless you want a dead-end repetitive job. Howard Schultz is unaware that his managers treat their staff poorly due to small staff silos. Typical department has 2 mgrs; 2 salary; 2 hourly, & 3 CW's. Bad managers are moved from department to department."
bad,"I learned how to make a lot of different kinds and types of coffee and other beverages. It was hard trying to remember all the drinks, but after making them a few times it all came to me. The hardest part of the job was the busy mornings and having to make everyones drinks myself in a quick manner. Some customers were nice others were not so enjoyable dealing with, but that is working with food for you."
bad,They did not train their employees in a professional manor.
bad,"Working in a team of 50 people-all work falls on a select few while others have a lacky daisy attitude.If you ask for help from someone in a leadership role they ignore you or pretend they are busy.No respect or dignity. It is like you are back on high school dealing with gossip,bad mouthing.etc."
bad,"le rythme est très soutenu, il y a du stress par rapport aux chiffres à faire et il faut retenir toutes les recettes"
bad,"the one i was in was terrible. the leads would not train well and get mad when something wouldn't go their way. i would get compliments from customers and the leads would just brush it off. i will not say all Starbucks are like this because iv seen so much better in others, but the one i was in was horrible. i kept seeing people leave just after one month and i didn't know why but when i was in, i knew and understood. beware when getting hired, know your leads!"
bad,"But actually sucks the life out of you with next to no compensation. Will lead you on for more than two years about promotion. Will leave you with two months with no response after interviewing for a promotion within the company. Will juggle you and your needs as if they are less important than the store  ; will ask you to work outside of your availability, will not often grant over time, will often be understaffed"
bad,"Overall the company is too large for everyone to align. Having been in a few districts and also having several district managers, I can safely say that experiences will drastically vary. It all felt like a roller coaster ride, lots of ups and downs, but in my case it only took one extremely discouraging and disappointing superior to ruin 10+ years of commitment."
bad,My particular store was a disaster. It was falling apart which affected the workplace culture and overall morale of the employees. We were the busiest store in the state and on many occasions we not given the tools we needed to succeed. Overall very stressful work environment which led to high turn around.
bad,peaceful place to work especially in the mornings during the winter. for the most part everyone was fun to work with. it was a 2nd job at the time so i didnt get to learn and do as much as i would like
bad,"working there can be good, working there can be bad. its one of them jobs where its hit and miss on some days. usually customers are friendly and cheery, however you do get the odd miserable person which can bring your whole shift down. Its also really important to work with people you like, it really helps the productivity and the work flow in general."
bad,"The customers can essentially do whatever they want because ""the customer is always right"" and it is very exhausting dealing with Starbucks' customers. A lot of people don't work at this job and having a bad manager or shift supervisor really affects this job. Either no one does anything and the manager is incompetent or the manager is competent and they suck your soul out trying to get you to work harder than anyone one person can."
bad,"Company used to be great. Has changed a lot. Very little play, way too much work. You will get stressed and no one will care. They will take advantage of you and work you to the bone."
bad,"Fast paced environment for someone who is efficient, quick, and loves to give a hospitable experience. They are flexible with your school schedule and are willing to pay for your schooling."
bad,Constantly expecting higher results with less spend on labour. KPIs quickly become unobtainable unless you are willing to completely destroy you work life balance and spend everyday in store!
bad,"When I worked in the Savannah location, I really enjoyed my time there. We were a high volume store, but we were very organized, worked as an organized team, and delivered excellent service while having fun. Management was amazing there, and made even the hardest parts of the job fun. At the Marietta location, I had a miserable time. No one listens to each other and everyone has their own idea about how things should be ran. Very little communication on serious issues and in high-stress situations, the store manager and shift leads could not get anyone's attention or respect. The environment was toxic and dysfunctional. However, I really loved connecting with all of my customers and forming relationships with them and some of my partners. My favorite days were when we could get a lot done, very well, and in an organized and positive way."
bad,"This job was highly stressful and the managers undervalue their employees because the company is all about driving sales and making profit.. Not much thought actually goes into the customer in my experience, and it made me sad because I very much care about delivering a good experience to the customer, which is difficult when the managers have created a high stress environment in which the most important aspects of work is to push sales and always be doing something 'productive.' I understand that there is a need to finish the work that has to be done, of course, but there should be enough leeway to allow for conversation to create a nice experience with the customers, and a more holistic and friendly environment for the employees. Managers were also not very good at communicating their values and teaching employees. Learning here felt very much like a free for all."
bad,Die Firma hat in den lezten Jahren das Kunden und  Mitarbeiter focus vergessen. Profit auf jede Kost ist nicht gut.
bad,"The team you work with make the job bearable. And management quality varies HUGELY from store to store. So hope you’ve got a good/useful/kind one. Otherwise: leave, "
bad,Buenos compañeros pero mucho estrés. No ponen mucho esfuerzo en formarte .
bad,"Your experience at Starbucks is based purely upon your manager. If they aren't following what this company stands for, than it isn't worth your time at all."
bad,"Has changed their culture and support, respect for their employees in such a negative way since Howard left. The company drains their skilled employees and replaces them with partners that make less so they can benefit themselves. Cut to labor and partner raises made the work nearly impossible. This company used to be so wonderful. It’s very sad."
bad,"I worked for almost 3 months, it is ok for individuals with the interest in getting quick cash and involvement in the Canadian work place. i do not  identified myself with the company org culture"
bad,"they would schedule me under 40hrs (30-39) a week so i wouldn't get benefits. i did not enjoy working at starbucks, it felt very robotic and corporate.  i felt like i didn't mean anything to the company"
bad,"Starbucks, unfortunately, does not pay enough. Customers are typically unreasonable and management is typically underprepared to effectively manage. "
bad,"Everyone complains about how much they dislike working here. Multiple people have quit including the previous store manager. Every location is different of course. But the one I’m at is h e l l. It’s affected my mental health negatively to the point where i was depressed for a short amount of time."
bad,"This was my first job so I did not complain at first, we all start off somewhere and free food and drinks always sound good. This is not a job to make a living off of, you will rarely get raises and even though benefits start at 20 hours per week average, managers will find ways to give you less. I really miss being a barista but had to leave due to homophobic partners, I spoke to my manager and HR and nothing was done. I would recommend this job if you're starting off in high school and can handle the stress, otherwise, look where the grass is greener."
bad,I loved my job at Starbucks at first. Until I moved out and realized I was living in poverty with no regular raises. The management is corrupt and there is little room for advancement.
bad,"Starbucks uses great marketing and buzzwords to pull in both customers and employees, but most of what it claims to offer or combat is in direct conflict with the company's practices.  For instance, Starbucks promises  ""ecological sustainability,""  but creates so much waste from single-use plastic alone as all of the products from pastries to reusable cups come individually wrapped in unsustainable packaging. Starbucks is not a good job for most adults. It is great for people who have outside financial support but want the company's discount for insurance or college as the wages at Starbucks are not enough to maintain any adult. It is an okay side job at best. There is ample room for improvement, starting at the top."
bad,"management was flustered, training was good though. I was disrespected and put aside. They ignored my hard work ethic and was unable to give me a fulfilling position"
bad,"Overall this job is ok, if you do not plan on moving up & don't mind getting a small raise after a year of being there because it's a licensed Starbucks. If your not too serious about how coffee should be made right this would be a good place to to start, plus they are flexible & will work around your schedule."
bad,"Make sure you set your limits and stick to them, they will absolutely push every limit you have. Nice if going to school, you can work your schedule around it but they will try to schedule you doing your off time"
bad,"Worked for 2 different locations and both treated me bad and unfair.. customers loved me, but the company didnt want that so they teamed up to get rid of me"
bad,"It's a fast food job. there can be big differences across stores, districts, etc. This company does not care about you. The typical day is stressful because you're perpetually understaffed and nothing gets repaired. I learned only how to make fast food coffee, not anything useful about making coffee. The hardest part of the job is not killing yourself, most enjoyable part is talking to your coworkers."
bad,A typical work day is walk into a constant string of customers who either dont want to order properly or dont care about your existence but you're supposed to great them warmly any way right? Theres never enough of anything and by days end i'm so emotional drained I refuse to talk to anyone.
bad,Worked at two different locations and helped out at several other locations as well. Loved working at my first store but highly unsatisfied with my new store. Supervisor at both locations and management fell very short at the second location. Good place to work for benefits but asked to do too much for the pay received.
bad,"Many customers will stare directly into your face (sometimes a dozen or more at a time) while you make their drinks. Customers will critique drinks that aren't even theirs. Management is obsessed with drive-through times over anything else and if it's busy, you ""will not"" get a break. "
bad,"My region is constantly understaffed which leaves the employees stressed to the max. the burn out rate in my area is insane, due to the fact that they dont want to spend money on labor so instead they just work those bending over backwards until theyre just so tired, they upand leave."
bad,"I feel like I work a lot more then shifts and do more of the work, when they get paid more. I am not satisfied with the way I am treated here at times, and have had a lot of trouble with scheduling and not having the hours I needed taken into account. It is also very hard to find time to take off because the system does not work well."
bad,"Not the best company to work for. I have to be up stupidly early for work some days when the store opens at 6am, also find it extremely hard to fit family life  among work life"
bad,"I spent a majority of my work and social life at Starbucks. The hours are pretty good, if you enjoy working a lot. They expect you go to above and beyond for the company. Not a lot of room for growth."
bad,The company its self is great and they want to see you grow. coworkers and management are way to sensitive and talking to them you are an outside r and they do not want to welcome people to the team.
bad,"the shifts are a huge incovinence. The pay is bad, You work very hard and have to deal with mean customers. Managers did not care about pregnant women."
bad,The job really demands a lot from both physical and mental areas while paying you the bare minimum. They demand things that are nearly impossible for humans to accomplish
bad,"If you're trying to figure out if you should work here there are a few things to consider: Are you in a big city or small town? Do you really want to work or are you trying to find a job where you can be lazy? I started in Washington D.C. in the flagship store and from there worked in over ten stores in that area before going to VA, and then landing in Los Angeles. The LAX area and D.C. area have a lot in common in that management is extremely cut-throat and (generally) engage in horribly unethical behavior. Turn over rate for management is insanely high and it's even higher for baristas. As a result you have managers that abuse their power and will throw you under the bus to keep their job. Customers can/will be abusive to you and you will be completely powerless as Corporate leans towards terminating partners regardless of wether or not they deserved to it. And that's even if your manager fights for you. Also, their back end systems (like HR and their ethics line) are very slow and clearly act in the their legal and public appearance interests only. "
bad,"If you get a good store manager and then you are lucky! I got the manager who’s fake and really pretentious and I with other people hated her! She was transphobic and not a good leader. I complained to corporate and they just filed a complaint and never looked into it. "
bad,"I worked at Starbucks for 2 and a half years. In my time at the company I transferred stores once. Frankly the job just wasn’t for me, you’re not paid enough and have far too much stress to deal with. Not worth it."
bad,"Though employees got decent discounts, I never felt we got paid fairly for the work we did. A lot of favoritism with in the company. Not everyone was treated the same."
bad,"Very stressful place to work, not a place I would recommend. too many drinks to memorize how to make, not filling to really work around your schedule, people there are rude. customers are nasty."
bad,"I only worked weekends so my typical day was busy, ques out the door from the start to the end of my shift with only a half hour break."
bad,"The pay is more than minimum wage. And tips are good when there are tips. A lot of the partners rely in the tips weekly to make ends meet. Starbucks is great to have as a second job. Or while in school. Unless you are the Store Manager, pay is not enough to survive on."
bad,upper management was not good my boss was never in the store she had favorites that I performed better than but she looked out for them only and over looked me.
bad,Didn't state rules about college students and working from school and their home store. Kept it to themselves and just told me while I was at school instead of telling me while I was there.
bad,"Starbucks has a great team/relationship atmosphere, but if you want to be treated like a human, and paid enough to live- Don’t work there. It’s stressful at times more than others- It taught me to be able to handle those tough situations. It can become a bit overwhelming at times though. The pay is sad, although the benefits are great I cannot survive on benefits... The pay needs to increase."
bad,"Free coffee is nice.  Bonus structure is good.  Hours are horrible, especially if you open early.  Managers are expected to be on call 24 hours a day and go in if there are staffing issues.  Typical work week is 50 to 80 hours a week.  Expect a lot with low pay and not a lot of resources.  Company could do better."
bad,"I loved the staff I worked with, but my manager was very unprofessional. I didn’t feel the hourly compensation was enough to sustain living in California."
bad,I didn’t really like working for starbucks but I believe the location had a-lot to do with it. I worked at a starbucks inside of a hotel and casino and it got old quick.
bad,"If you enjoy work place atmospheres that include bullying, cliquey and resembles a middle school drama- this is your place. management was part of the problem"
bad,"Worked as a barista off and on for years. Starbucks' customers are the worst. You make the same drinks for 8 hours a day, and about 1 out of every 3 customers is a regular who expects you to make an unnecessarily complicated drink without tipping. The culture surrounding Starbucks is asinine. It'd be an effortless job if it weren't for the clientele."
bad,The company expects you to remember 50 recipes in 3 months or they'll fire you next time. They push you to talk to people who don't want to talk to you
bad,Always short staffed with several people to serve.   Management was very distant and not involved in training any new employees. Extremely stressful location to work at!
bad,No thank you after working ur bum off. District Managers are good people and their culture but all head office need to be wiped off. Payroll ladies are nice people but the bosses are just coffee drinkers paid for nothing and don’t know the progress in stores to at least compliment what’s going on.
bad,There was only a couple people willing to help but otherwise you had to figure things out on your own and if it wasn’t done right you got your head cut off. Everyone was very rude and unwilling to help and constantly demanded things etc.
bad,"Supervisors seemed to mostly stand around the exception desk, telling jokes.  Although Starbucks has some progressive policies and decent benefits, it's really kind of a grind-house once you get in the door.  The turnover is very high: About 40% per year.  For each position, there are what I would call ""secret quotas"" against which you are being measured (these are not disclosed up-front).  There is a lot of cut-throat activity wherein co-employees can effectively ""poach"" your work product.  Example: If one is working at loading pallets, the products coming down the ""spurs"" (sloped rollers) to be loaded on the pallets have to be scanned with an RF gun to read the bar code (to ensure the right items are going to the right locations).  In the guise of ""helping"" you, fellow employees will come over, scan your boxes, and then leave you to move them.  The problem? ""Credit"" for having completed the job is given at the point of initial scan, so it is to the benefit of other employees to scan your boxes, get credit for palletizing them, but then you are left to actually move the boxes with somebody else having received the credit for doing so.  This common and dishonest activity was not seemingly noticed or cared about by the supervisors (if they cared, they didn't make that evident).  As long as they (the supervisors) reached their desired overall shift production quota, they really didn't care if individual employees (partners) suffered at the hands of others.  The shifts are too long for the heavy work expected.  On the Distribution Center (DC) floor, there are only 2 shifts: 5 p.m."
bad,"The district manager was a nitpicker who claimed to give autonomy to the store managers but then berated them for not doing things his way. The company doesn't focus on what matters (people). They focus on money at the cost of exhausting their employees, which leads to a high turnover. DONT CUT LABOR JUST TO SAVE A FEW BUCKS. The trickle effect is so much worse than they think it is"
bad,"Only have this job if you are passionate about coffee and don't need large income. Environment is stressful but easy work once you get familiar. Students are encourage to take this job or if you are looking to go back to college they provide some college course,"
bad,"Performing tasks via bar, register (P.O.S.), customer support, order support, and staying in those roles. Learning names of customers, and their orders/preferences. I learned a servant's heart, and how to truly take care of the customer. The most enjoyable part of the job was developing relationships with customers and coworkers alike. The most difficult part of my job was appeasing management and their unrealistic ideals of a non-playful work environment where no one was allowed to be friends in or outside of work. Micromanaging, passive aggressiveness, lack of constructive criticism, lack of encouragement, preferential treatment, and discouraged advancement. Management, management, management. It makes the store. I would have never left otherwise, best job I have ever had despite the cons."
bad,It’s was a fun place to work however management takes advantage of employees as often as possible. I was mostly at the bar and drive thru except for when I was doing verismo presentations.
bad,"I've only been working for Starbucks for one year and I feel that it has been the most stressful, dramatic and stressful time."
bad,District manager has gone as far as to say that if Starbucks doesn't like an employee they will fire without cause since they have a great legal team. Highly unethical behaviour demonstrated. Starbucks also claims to have help and mental health services for employees but those same services will let you get bullied into a corner by management with improbable cause. Mens mental health is also treated as a joke within the establishment.
bad,My main issue with this company has been lack of leadership. I worked at a roasting plant. They culture there is very toxic. The bosses pets get to push there work off onto others.
bad,"While Starbucks has great benefits, it's not worth the stress and poor management. Availability is rarely adhered to, hours are either too little for full time, or too much for part time. You're more likely to work 15 minutes short of getting a lunch, constantly. Also will require staff to drive in unsafe weather conditions to work, then become angry when they refuse. You will work 5 hours and 45 minutes of a high stress job with one (1) ten minute break to last you. This is done on purpose often because management doesn't want to schedule lunch breaks."
bad,"The boss never had my number . So I couldn’t ever communicate with the guy. Him and other employees would always be on there phones. My friends have received poor customer service from my former co-workers. The boss doesn't read your requests off or does not give them to you , no matter how desperate you needed a day off for a holiday/family vacation, he simply won’t comply or cut your days off shorter ."
bad,"nothing to say wanna move on bye. poor management, poor scheduling, and lack of direction and initiative from associates and leads to clean and keep stock organized and stocked"
bad,I did not like working with starbucks. The Starbucks was more worried about the fastest service rather then the best service. Managers had favorites and they could make no mistakes and things were blamed on hard working people that did their job. They do have great benefits.
bad,"Despite saying that they care about their ""partners,"" they don't pay a living wage and the managers treat the baristas like disposable tools instead of people. Great benefits though and lots of opportunity to move up in the company, though I wouldn't recommend it"
bad,"I have worked at many jobs before in my very short time as a potential employee, and I have never disliked a job as much as this one. The job itself is stressful, quick-paced and I didn’t feel that it was fulfilling in any way whatsoever. While the shift leaders I had were excellent, the main manager would get visibly stressed and take it out in the employees when we would be slammed, which isn’t right. The job itself of making coffee and warming foods is menial and not exactly hard, but Starbucks (maybe just this branch) is totally concerned with what we call “times” and that is to get the orders out in under a certain time. While realistic in some instances, if we have a line of 12 cars and the person ahead ordered 12 Frappuccino’s, it’s unrealistic to be out in under 50 seconds and then we would be reprimanded verbally or something for not getting times down. They are completely centered around times and it makes the job i enjoyable and stressful about 85 percent of the time. The benefits of free drinks and one food item a day is nice, and a free bag of coffee once a week. There are benefits, but the cons outweigh the pros exponentially. I would not recommend this job to anybody, as I feel like I am not contributing to society one bit by just making their coffee and being yelled at by managers and employees alike. I have 2 overall stars because the benefits are nice, but the environment at Starbucks is not something I would want to have as a long-term career,"
bad,"Management don't really care about the drive thru starbucks in livi. constantly under staffed, having to work overtime all the time and heaving with no one to support you. Hours are ridiculous with 5.30am start to 10pm, possiby even later finish, really bad just a coffee shop. Don't get paid unsocial hours for these times. The pay is good though at 8.21 though. The staff themselves that are left are really friendly as well. Also if you work long hours you only get a 30 min break with maybe a 10 min later in the day if they have enough people to cover you."
bad,"First of all I loved the staff I worked with they were all fantastic, but the company itself (upper management), although calling their employees ''partners'' really see them as expendable and replaceable. Staff turnover is ridiculous. Pay is comical considering there is a maximum effort expectation from minimum compensation and a lack of intensive. Training is minimal in the beginning and is relegated to the baristas (who are trying to hit targets, while training and at the same time being paid the bare minimum). Would not recommend, unless you enjoy making coffee and cleaning toilets."
bad,"as a manager you have very long days and a lot of coming in on your days off for orders schedules and others that call in sick."
bad,"I thought working at Starbucks was a good experience but not for me. I found it very stressful to have to make drinks as quickly as possible while also keeping up on cleaning everything, and making sure you're on schedule for closing."
bad,"Starbucks has been okay to work for. Hard work, not great pay, not great advancement. Need to look deeper into the culture. Need to address labor and not working people the way they do."
bad,The min wage and assistance is mimimal. Have many mgr that do not help and get you where you need to be and to love your job. to much refunds done for non sense problems.
bad,"My manager was the only good thing at starbucks, and she was not the norm. She went above and beyond to provide a positive working environment. Starbucks corporate polices weren't her fault."
bad,can be fun and the customers are great but bad days are really bad.  There is no incentive for the employees to do good other than not loosing a job since pay increases are not based on performance
bad,"The shipments need to bring us everything we order and ON TIME. We are always short on something. Ideas that could benefit the company need to be taken more seriously. Give partners a voice. Could implement better training tactics. If more than a brand and rather a group of people who have a purpose to their work, hire accordingly and work accordingly. Half the people are just there to make ends meet."
bad,Not the best place to work. Your coworkers and customers make the job better than what it is. Management was not the best. Everyone was always in a funky mood and management was always out to get someone for no reason.
bad,"The Starbucks corporation tells you about all of their benefits and how welcoming their environment is, but neglects to mention the lack of stable work hours. The managers they hire rarely care about the well being of their employees, forcing them to stay open in snow storms when there are no customers. Customers will devalue you as a person, and your coworkers will place unreasonable expectations on you. "
bad,"Did not enjoy the job. Wasn't paid enough for how hard I had worked, Training was too short. It was very stressful and my coworkers weren't nice. Only part of the job that I enjoyed was that it was in a barnes and noble's"
bad,"A shift at Starbucks is determined by when you clock in and how bad the rush was, you're on the back foot until you're set to close so proper staffing is essential. Unfortunately, turnover is high and hours get cut often so difficulty is expected. A cafe store is nice, could not recommend a drive through less. Customers can be an absolute delight and once you know them it makes it hard to leave. You cannot negotiate pay with your boss, you have to go the district manager and they will most likely turn you away."
bad,The job is good but managers can make it difficult. I didn't really mind the job but my boss was not ready to manage as store that was as busy as mine and took his frustrations out on his workers.
bad,"the company itself has decently progressive culture, lots of perks and benefits like partner beverages and spotify, but it can be a fairly nitpicky company to work for, depending on your manager."
bad,I love the families and neighbor hood customers that walked into the establishment. I really enjoy how Starbucks Co. allows you to connect with each customer
bad,"the company was decent but the management was biased towards the younger employees. the hardest part was remembering the drink recipes, but the different people that came in made the job worth it."
bad,It took me 6 months to learn how to do the bare minimum of my job correctly. People are rarely scheduled unless they've worked for 2+ years.  Teenagers and students get 8 hours a week or less
bad,"The job was okay, Co-workers were horrible didn't last more than 3 months working here. If you have good co-workers it'll be a better experience. All in all, good if you need the money."
bad,"Whilst I did enjoy my time working at Starbucks (making drinks and talking to customers is fun), the poor management was incredibly frustrating - I was given next to no training, and after 2 x 3 hour shifts I was placed on an all day Saturday shift (busy) without a manager and with only one other barista. I was hired alongside 2 other Baristas who were both working around 35 hours a week, whilst I had had several weeks where my shifts had been cut so i was wokrking 0-10 hours a week (0 hours on several occassions). I was called into the management office and told I hadn't improved as much as the other two baristas (despite working a fraction of the time they had and having no training) and so they fired me. A similar situation happened to a friend who also worked at Starbcuks. Would not recommend"
bad,"For a barista position, the pace is not relaxed at all. We were regularly understaffed and over-scheduled with equipment malfunctioning often. I was often scheduled to work 50 hours a week even though I was hired originally to work 30."
bad,I worked at starbucks for over two years and never was given a raise. The tips are not very much and are pooled among all employees. The only thing that was ok about working there was getting free coffee and that they are usually willing to work with your schedule. The job itself is easy and the same every day. You must be fast and efficient or you will have a hard time working there. Not worth the pay at all for the time and effort it takes to work there. you will be very tired at the end of a long shift and have little to show for it.
bad,"very corporately ran. "
bad,Starbucks was a pitiful job for everyone. the manager was never there and typically had no knowledge of events until the team had already set it up. The pay was very good but that benedit only came from Starbucks pay. All though i do not know the environment in other Starbucks. The Starbucks in Target was entirely biased and unfair.
bad,"truly the worst job i ever worked. No respect for their employees, nor did the understand the daily struggles. response to any situation, "" not my problem"""
bad,I hated this job with a passion. It was a terrible work environment and the management didn't help with any of the problems the workers faced. Don't work here.
bad,"Starbucks does not pay enough for the hours they expect you to work or the amount of work they expect you to do, all while maintaining short lines and drive times."
bad,It was very hot I was the only man so I did everything the women didn't want to.  Rich snobby people would cry if I put three pumps of syrup instead of two
bad,"Your experience is entirely dependent on your management. If your store manager and district managers interests and needs don't match with yours, your experience will be effected."
bad,"Starbucks started off great but while working there I witnessed no less than 3 major and multiple minor ethics violations. I had to fight for months to get full time hours and had to go to the district manager multiple times in order to make that happen. Once I had to pick up a second and third job I was punished for not having completely open availability. If the company had paid me at least $15 an hour here in Kentucky at 40 hours, I could have just kept the one job. Starvation wages in 2018 are higher than you think."
bad,"Management is very poor,  overall. I was always scheduled out of my availability and my manager did not make any exceptions for Christmas either. This is quite sad considering all the great benefits the Starbucks Company offers. Great place to have a career but very difficult to advance with certain stores."
bad,Working for target is a challenge all around but i genuinely enjoyed working at Starbucks it was just understaffed and I would always get called in to work on my days off. At the starbucks inside of target you could be the one to bail them out every time some on called out and they would still give you a bad review if you tried to transfer to another store or try to get a different job.
bad,"culture is cool and you get good benefits if you work full time, however, you don't get many if you work part time. Co-workers are self-centered and unhelpful. Very stressful at times"
bad,"This job is insanely busy and understaffed at most high volume stores I worked at. If you have competent, happy coworkers it can be fun but otherwise it becomes unbearable. Management tends to roll out bad and sometimes illegal policies (break times were a big problem in my district). Hours, even for the reliable and competent employees, are lacking. But hey you get free coffee every week?"
bad,Starbucks is fun if you are a upbeat person. Its a fast paced work environment and you become like family. It is not an easy job but it is very rewarding.
bad,"Wouldn't recommend anyone to work for Starbucks. I did not have a good experience while being there. Customers were particularly rude at my location, and management was poor"
bad,"I would clock in, prepare drinks, prepare the ingredients, prepare the coffee beans, the utensils and take orders at the register  and clean as I went along as well as when the day was over."
bad,"The ""make every moment right"" standard sounds good, but in practice just turns staff into doormats. And if you ever have problems with your store or management, don't bother wasting your time going to your district manager, they don't care what goes on as long as your drive-thru times are good. More bonuses for them, I guess. Granted they provide benefits and free coffee, but considering so many companies provide benefits these days, I'd say just pay for your coffee and skip working for Starbucks."
bad,"It's good if you like to work, it keeps you busy so the time passes quickly. I am being forced by Indeed to write this review that I don't particularly want to write."
bad,The people I worked with were great and some managers were ok. Anyone in a position higher than a manager has no companion for their employees. Higher management is more focused on sales and not their employees. It was a great company 10 years ago but it changed direction over the years.
bad,"I wouldn't recommend anyone to work at starbucks for a few reasons. One, they play favorites. Two, you can't move up. Three, the pay is awful and it's literally back breaking work. I've burned myself so many times, just to smell like coffee and come home exhausted. Four, they're always cutting hours. Five, you can do them many favors and they still won't give you hours. And finally, baristas do more work than supervisors."
bad,"Starbucks was a fun company to work for,  but I struggled to be able to show my full potential. This was a place where I couldn't step out of my comfort zone and I feel that I can benefit with something more of the path of my future career."
bad,"Fast-paced with little reward, poor management, passive-aggressive managers, employees not given raises/pay appropriate for quality of work, but I liked making drinks and also drinking them."
bad,"Young people working with you that don't care about the job, very fast atmosphere, poor management.  Roles are not defined and no threat of punishment when young employees have bad behaviors"
bad,"Lets just say that after a shift towards the end of my career with starbucks, I had to drive myself to the ER because I was having a panic attack due to the stress of my manager. Worst team and management I have ever experienced in my life. This was sad because I was really looking forward to the benefits of working with Starbucks Cooperation. The perks were not worth the stress of the job and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who cant handle stressful environments."
bad,This job is overwhelming 99 % of the time.You aren't given sick time off in certain states. You aren't allowed to call in if you are sick.The compensation for the amount of work you are doing is a dollar more then minimum wage. Its not worth the stress of dealing with young co-workers calling out for shifts all the time. Its a job for teenagers .
bad,"Working with other workers in a collaborative environment is always a great time if the chemistry is right, but management I was at was the only thing hard about the job"
bad,"It was the same routine everyday, which was a fun interactive experience but the worst part is that typically management sticks to themselves and favorites are definitely played. so if you want hours you have to be ready to brown nose harder than ever."
bad,"Starbucks is a decent company that hired me. I quickly realized that if you are not of a certain age, you are not taken seriously. That is why I decided to leave."
bad,"This job may offer plenty of benefits but most are long term benefits that don't make up for the low paychecks offered to those that can't even utilize them. The job is mentally taxing due to severe understaffing, and an inguman push to meet criteria set by individuals who do not take the mental and physical health of their employees into account."
bad,"Started at Starbucks with every intention of working my way up, giving my all, learning all I could, and investing in the company.  Three years later, I hated my life and couldn't get out fast enough.  Starbucks has a habit of bragging about being an ethical and caring company, but its workers will come last when it comes down to individual management units passing the blame. If an individual store isn't making enough in sales, the baristas are told to push products in the sale, even on off seasons."
bad,"Working at Starbucks is not so fun because your managers are either extremely mean or rude, or let the wrong people get away with everything. The district managers are even worse they see you as numbers and not real people, they never give you the proper amount of staffing and still get irritate when you can't complete anything in the time frame they set. Your coworkers can even be the enemy as well, they cause unnecessary drama with everyone else in the store and make some poor people who just want to come in and do their job to the best of their ability a living nightmare. No one knows how to get along with anyone anymore and everyone is just trying to look out for themselves so they don't get fired by the managers who are okay with letting people go when you're already extremely understaffed. I would not recommend anyone to work for Starbucks because the company as a whole really went down the hole."
bad,"The management issues in Bend, Oregon are very unfortunate. The turnover rate for the downtown wall st. store was solely for the fact of the very irresponsible manager. She would leave after only working a couple hours, put all her tasks on new people (sorting orders, organizing orders, pulling sandwiches). Very sad that she was so irresponsible and still currently works there."
bad,"Although not the best place to work for experienced professionals, it is a good place to learn business acumen and experience, as well as team collaboration and leadership skills.Flexible"
bad,"I worked at Starbucks for less than a year at a busy location with a drive-thru. For that reason, it was difficult to make each drink special for customers - the amount of foot traffic was way over our heads and we were constantly short-staffed. I dreaded every minute of working here. The customers felt as if they could walk all over us because of the 'just say yes' policy (as my manager put it...). The company ""prides"" itself on sustainability, yet we were never allowed to give food away at the end of the night to the homeless, never utilized the recycle bin properly, and NEVER turned down a customer's request to remake a beverage... Not to mention, the sourcing of coffee beans are definitely NOT ethical by any standards. During my interview, I was lied to and told that the farmers in other countries who work for Starbucks had great benefits. But through personal research, I found that wasn't the case. I just couldn't work at a place that was so profit driven and hypotcritical anymore."
bad,6am to 1pm my manager pick me up at 4am to go on post and I made 3 different coffee made for costomer and warm breakfast sandwiches and danishes.it was great for awhile it only suppose have 4 people their then it was 10 people there in a closet space it was bump to bumper all morning I was glad they took me out the hospital
bad,Starbucks works their employees to death and while it may be a good option for some with fewer options I would not recommend this job to a friend. Not to mention the fact that they have a siren in their logo.
bad,"Starbucks is no doubt, a fun place to work. It gets you by, as far as providing overpriced medical plans and maybe fitting in your car insurance and phone bill. It takes years to accumulate enough 20 cent raises to reach a viable income. But the pay is not worth the stress. It takes a very relaxed and positive mind to work in this company. The only coworkers I have not seen stress over this job are the people who didn't care about the job, showed up in Starbucks new ""pajama approved"" dress code, and would also call out last minute. Over the years, Starbucks has moved from a respectable coffee company, serving quality cups of right priced java, to milkshake haven for bratty teens that demand half bottles of caramel. Starbucks caters to it's customers, not it's employees. Constantly adding new ways to serve their diabetic beverages while also increasing the labor demands on it's employees. I used to love working for this company. We were educated coffee connoisseurs working in fun environments with managers who were passionate about the morning bar life. These days, its just about frozen sugary sell out drinks and catering to children before and after school. The turnover rate for this company is so high that it makes sense only sloppy teenagers and badly managed teams are behind the counter now serving cold bitter coffee and your expired shot lattes. Starbucks will hire anyone because no one cares about this job anymore. I worked for Starbucks for 7 years. I fell in love with the company in my beginning years. Over time, it became a hate love relationship, and of course working"
bad,"I worked on my college campus, which was very for me. The management was not that great, and and the pay was minimum wage. Other than that, it was an overall great experience."
bad,"This company used to be really great. I had a great store manager, with a very awful district manager. Because of that district manager, the store manager quit. The new store manager was not fit for the store, and that store went down the drain. I transferred to another store, and it's just run poorly. They tell you if you don't like it, then you need to quit. They don't take partners feelings seriously, or even hear you out. I feel like the management is always not what it needs to be, and they can't ever give you the time you need off. There's a lot of ""can't do this"" rules."
bad,Rules of both the Store and Starbucks often contradicted and conflicted with each other making the workplace not only stressful but confusing. Schedules often changed without warning and Managment was somewhat unprofessional in their methods of deciplining employees.
bad,Get thrown onto the floor after 2 weeks of trainign where you have to push to survive. I/f you are lucky you might get a really nice team that supports you. If the team isn't the best then expect a up hill climb.
bad,"- Typical day at work is clocking in and then getting to work hoping that the shift behind you was held to the same standards that you are and then if not expecting to pick up after them so you can set up the shift after you or worry about having a 7-8 paragraph text sent to you on a day off because a standard was not followed and you don't want to throw anyone under the bus so you just shoulder it and promise to do better"
bad,"When I first started, I loved working for the company. The atmosphere, the benefits, and the experience of being a barista is amazing, but the way corporate and customers treat you, and how management can be, it isn't worth it. We used to be focused on Quality, but now it's all about efficiency and speed, getting as many drinks out as possible and getting fast drive-thru times. Corporate keeps releasing drinks that take longer to make, and the way customers can be towards us at times is atrocious. I'm Latino, and i've had racial slurs thrown at me because of a minor mistake with a coffee, that wasn't even because of me. Recently, A new Store manager has cut my hours significantly and is VERY unpleasant. I'm quite disappointed with corporate for allowing her to manage this store. The benefits are great, but the company isn't."
bad,"Terrible management, no way to advance. Very emotionally and physically stressful. Probably wouldn't pass health inspection if it weren't for 3 employees."
bad,Il y a beaucoup d'avantage à travailler dans cette compagnie
bad,"Often anti-social hours with unstable management, bonuses have been cut alongside all benefits. However full of youngsters who make it a fun place to work. Lots of new skills developed e.g the art of coffee etc."
bad,Even though my time at Starbucks was short. I liked working there I loved the people and being able to meet new people every day.  I go in there sometimes.
bad,adamcılık mantığı ile yürütülen bir sistem de çalıştım ve bu yüzden işten ayrıldım.sınavlarda hakkım yenildi.
bad,"Starbucks is a fun place to work, but sometimes management gets in the way of you being able to successfully do your job. Unrealistic expectations are given to you with very little training"
bad,"For someone such as myself, I was staffed primarily nights. we would have only 2-3 people staffed past 4 pm or so and have to do all of the closing tasks plus dealing with customers. Things were rarely dealt with to provide a less stressful work environment. and the company continues to only care about numbers rather than their employees."
bad,"A typical day at Starbucks starts off slow, but gets very, VERY busy. Hundreds of people in an hour. Management gets overwhelmed by lack of staffing, it's unbearably hot without air-conditioning, there's never enough product due to poor product ordering, keeping the store itself a clean and friendly environment is extremely hard when management is so overwhelmed that their actions enforce a terrible and emotionally unhealthy work environment. I would not recommend working for such a company with this level of dysfunction and chaos and abuse towards employees."
bad,"The hourly pay is ridiculous for what the company makes, hours are terrible and it is a stressful environment the majority of the time. I worked at two different locations with three four different managers and only one of them was legit. Its like the company will make just anyone a manager. Incompetent, wouldn't listen to employees about their preferences/needs."
bad,"Starbucks has a very specific environment that is expected. When a customer walks into a Starbucks, they expect to have a certain atmosphere, be treated a certain way, and get everything exactly as they want as quickly as possible. Baristas are treated as cute luxuries for people to take out their frustrations, bad days and emotional baggage on. And, in order to carry The Brand, we have to just take it and act like we're all best friends. So pretty much the bartender experience, except no one tips. After a while I started to feel like a caged animal. Expected to walk, talk and act a certain way or be berated for it. There were days I couldn't help but have my day ruined  by people treated me inhumanely. I was so exhausted all the time that I didn't have time to do anything else but be present at work. It literally ruined my life."
bad,"very cut throat company to work for. it was always something different happening with the work schedule. always working overtime no matter your schedule. they speak a lot of work/ life balance, in which there isn't none, if your working 10 hour shifts 6 to 7 days a week. if you have a family this job is defiantly isn't for you."
bad,"I had to quit because I had a Terrible Manager,loved my coworkers and the free coffee but not the environment my manager created. I would not recommend working here."
bad,"Progressive on the outside, worthless, soul crushing job on the inside. Training is hit or miss and you will be working with a lot of incompetent people and in turn frustrated, wound up baristas who do know what they're doing."
bad,bu konuda yorum yapmak istemiyorum. insanaları değerlendirmeye zorlamayın. haftanın he günü gıda zehirlenmesiyaşanan bir firma işte
bad,"A typical day for me included working at a fast pace and interacting with customers non stop due to the constant business. The hardest part of the job would be memorizing all recipes while preparing them in a rushed pace. However, the most enjoyable part of the job would be talking to and serving the same regular customers everyday. It was always an enjoyable experience to see the same customers that come in everyday because there was always a connection. Unfortunately, I was the only employee that hasn't worked there for years; therefore, coworkers and management made me feel left out and took advantage of me. For instance, they required me to do everyone's jobs when they wanted to sit and talk and be unproductive. They also made me feel as if i was not a part of the team; therefore, a work day included feeling left out and mistreated. Management was poor as well. They will not accommodate for the schedule you need. Also, if any family emergency or personal emergency were to occur, you were still required to come to work. For instance, I was rushed to the hospital and discharged 3 days later. I informed management the day of the emergency; however, upon returning to work with a copy of my hospital discharge forms, I was scolded and threatened to not miss work again ""even if I was dying."" Overall, my experience with Starbucks was negative; however, this experience was only at my location. Therefore, there may be more pleasant experiences and other locations."
bad,I worked at one of the busiest Starbucks (with a drive through) in the area. The instability of the management and scheduling was not for me. The fast pace was excellent for me but the ever-changing management team and the inconsistency within the schedules tended to be distracting and unsettling. The benefits were great (I didn't need to take advantage of any of them) but the hourly pay was not worth the amount of work done.
bad,"After woking there for two years I was finally able to quit. Management doesn't care about you, just how fast you are for sales. I enjoyed making drinks and interacting with the customers. This job is fast paced and eventually takes a toll on you. After two years I was always tired, my feet always hurt, etc. But the company is FUN to work for. My Starbucks home store had horrible management that made my experience horrible."
bad,"This is a great company in terms of benefits.  As for work life balance, unless you are a supervisor or higher, it never happens. Employees are over worked constantly and given less than 24 hours notice of mandatory OT."
bad,"Our GM of my store left and left us no AGM "
bad,"Transition to new store, no sense of team work or community, manager too busy with tasks needed to set up new store to do any work with employees. The company as a whole has a lot of neat benefits but you have to search for them they aren’t explained to you. Individual management tends to be too self absorbed to set up new employees for success."
bad,"As the subject says, it's pretty much self-explanatory. Everyone is really strict with cleanliness and customer service. The hardest part of being there is dealing with the rude customers. Just have to learn how to smile and be kind until your shift is over. Not too much to it. Alot of training in regards to drink recipes and cleaning ovens, drains, coffee machines, etc."
bad,"Just another corporation making way more money off you than you do them. Got me through the bad times, and would reccomend them to someone who is looking for a job. Expect people to be rude, and for every day to be rough."
bad,"Avec ce travail, j'ai pu avoir une vision sur le monde du travail"
bad,"If you are quiet and sensitive, this job will not be for you as it was not for me. I was harassed and bullied, very little was done about it. Management was terrible, and people talked about each other. Work was exhausting physically and emotionally. People take coffee way too seriously, and I was tired of having people hurt me and talk about me behind my back."
bad,"After all the years I have worked there, I have never been more ready to leave a company that fronts itself in the media as ""News"" through promotional drinks, Librial opinions, and cookie cutter barista skills. Inside looking out, I want to work where coworkers show up to their shifts, managers support you as an employee, and the drama is minamalized by professional conduct. I am good at my job and have stayed there for how easy it comes to me after years of service, and the benefits help too. They are flexible with time off. However, It's very hard to get a consistent weekly schedule due to working around everyone else's flexibility. The last thing I'll say is, it's stressful. A lot of people working in a small space, moving fast, talking fast. High speed environment makes for the same type of communication style. Scare tactics."
bad,"the manager there was non-responsive for growth or any real needs besides her own.  The DM was at least wiling to listen to needs of the workers, but no real results were achieved within the store"
bad,"On a typical day I was expected to multi-task and work extremely quickly. I have learned that patience is the key when dealing with entitled and rude customers. In my two years as a barista, I had four store managers rotate through at a single location. This was a challenge because each had different expectations and ideas about how the store should be organized and a different opinion on what ""following policy"" looked like."
bad,High paced stressful atmosphere with a lot of demand physically.  There is a lot of pressure placed on Store Managers by upper management.  There is great lack of encouragement and support especially if you are in a remote location.  Intense demands and unreasonable expectations in regards to timely completion of turning around a broken store.  Upper management should be well rehearsed in working in a way to develop leaders and support leaders not destructive.
bad,No balance between work and life. Managers often are not very professional and lacking interpersonal skills. Employees seem to be looked at as very disposable.
bad,"Good job for a short term duration. Over time, the company kept asking for more yet not much was given in return. Customers are often rude and management does not due enough to help partners get ahead."
bad,"great company to work for. however, certain working environments isn't consistent across the board. you may like the store that you are placed but once they decide to put you elsewhere. you wont have much of a say. there is also a 50/50 chance that you may dislike your store based on your manager, customers, area, etc."
bad,"Great company from the outside, but falls to the wayside once you have been there more than two months. Great job for a college student, unfortunately you wont get hired. Lack of growth and opportunities within individual locations. Management positions from outside stores."
bad,Starbucks was a really cool place to work with all college kids looking to get ahead in life. I really enjoyed the time I work their but felt as if there was no way of job advancement.
bad,"I could go on forever about starbucks culture. Dont buy into the lifestyle, talk to anyone who's been working there longer than a few years and the company reveals itself. "
bad,"This is an okie place to work, fast pace, niice people to work with. You will work with the general public, so if thats not for you, I would not recommend this job."
bad,Low paying even for tenured employees. Best thing is flexibility in scheduling. General Managers and above make all the money. If your store is understaffed you will be overwhelmed and greatly underpaid.
bad,It truly used to be a fun and great place to work but when management changed everything started to get worse. Morale was incredibly low and it became very under staffed and stressful.
bad,Starbucks was fun. Outgoing people. Nice costumers. Once you get to know everyone you know what you like. Free drinks. Free coffee to take home. End of the night you get goodies. I had fun.
bad,"It's a great job for a teenager just starting out in the working world."
bad,Location I worked at was always busy and didn't have much staff. The manager worked on floor with the workers. She was somewhat nice. The staff was rude to each other.
bad,"Claims to have excellent benefits but they're not affordable, Starbucks values have you go above and beyond what normal food service does for customers which creates a lot of entitled people, pay rate and raises are minimal. After working there for a while you get burnt out."
bad,wouldn't recommend to work unless in high school poor quality in workers due to low wages so increased load on short handed staff very stressful a big no for me
bad,"People were rude and very disrespectful. While working there even the employees were bad they didnt get things done so i had to do i while doing other things. Even with the managers, they were lazy."
bad,"The management is poor, with a lack of organization and communication. The store is cluttered and extremely dirty. They pay you a high wage to convince you to stay."
bad,"Horrible management, baristas and shift leads are always overworked in order to save on labour. Unrealistic expectations of employees. Management bordered on abusive and companies were not taken seriously. Managers are stressed and take it out on their shift leads."
bad,meh it was alright showed up at dark thirty to be yelled at by tired people when they grew impatient and treat you less than human because you were wearing an apron
bad,"This is not the place for an adult looking for a consistent 40 hour work week. If you are a college student and just need some change to be able to sustain yourself on more than just campus food then this is the job for you. Overall the company tries very hard to be a great company and has great values, but as far as management and climbing the corporate ladder, that appears to be nonexistent."
bad,busy during mornings from gm employees and hotel guests. roach and rodent problem in the hotel. received hotel benefits and discounts so the Starbucks corporate rules didn't really apply to us at all.
bad,"Fast faced with unrealistic expectations, very low pay, very little job advancement opportunities, customers are, in general, under appreciative. Honestly not worth your time."
bad,i disliked starbucks it was not a great job for me the pay was bad and the management was poor i really disliked the job i will never work for the company again.
bad,Way to go corporate North America for underpaying undervaluing staff. I would never recommend this place to my worst enemy.or anything or anyone. Try other places for work if you have s moment.
bad,"I didn’t like working there was to much drama, no really greeted me when I work there they shut me out. Didn’t make me feel welcomed. Was hired for full time and didn’t get those hours."
bad,Very stressful work environment. Management is very unprofessional and inconsiderate of team member needs. Manager is very manipulative and creates a lot of drama.
bad,"i loved my customers, i loved making coffee. the job itself is easy enough and clean up is relatively easy; and who doesn't love discounts on their daily coffee. Being able to take home a pound a week wasn't bad either. My issue was with my shift supervisors, and at my specific location, my store manager wasn't much help."
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job was the free coffee and discounted food. Customers are usually very friendly. Breaks are usually on time. Busy time are Christmas and weekends.
bad,"Management prides themselves on not only working around the clock, but being more productive on vacation.  Remote work is frowned upon, resulting in pressure to work on-site, even if it means taking calls that break in and out while commuting to the office at 7am. Team members actively complain about others, creating a contentious environment that leads to ostrization by peers and managers. Focus is on compliance to mind-numbing, manually-intensive audit standards that overburden bandwidth leaving insufficient time to manage the functional work."
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job was in the morning getting ready for the day. It was challenging to get everything setup and going but you felt the most productive.  The rest of the day it was very slow.
bad,"It's not a bad coffee job. There's a little too much going on in products to claim it's really just a coffee shop however that does keep you busy. I have only worked in one location so I can't say much for other store locations. The management at this location is very bad at being a leader which is what the entire Starbucks system is based off, leadership. The lies, abuse of power, and head games from upper management makes for an extremely stressful work environment that will effect your health. Again you'll be kept very busy keeping up with the maintenance of a deteriorating building and it will also effect your health. Over the hardest part of the job is the massive negative effect it has on physical, mental, and emotional health. The most enjoyable part of the job will be frequent flyer customers and fellow barista partners."
bad,"I feel that while working at Starbucks, management was lacking. You were trained on how to make drinks then sent to the wolves, so to speak. If you had any questions, there was really no one there to help you. You were kind of on your own."
bad,"Felt secluded from the group, struggled to involve myself in group discussion or group work due to lack of friendliness in the workplace. Never felt welcome which made it hard to work there."
bad,"I liked being a barista, but it did not pay enough, and my manager, was really hard to work with. I said have a blessed day, and she had a problem with it."
bad,"Great company & benefits. Horrible management. job worked well for me, but boss was horrible. people Always left cause of her attitude & Horrible management."
bad,"Starbucks culture in concept is great; however, the management does not follow it.  there is no work life balance, receiving emails at all hours, weekends, etc.  Expected to answer.  Driven very hard in store development with no understanding to consequences of  lack of performance by design, real estate, etc."
bad,"you get good benefits but the level of customer service you're expect to reach is absurd. they expect you to get really close to the customers and it can be invasive. very overpriced as well. "
bad,"It is a very fast-paced enviornment! if you cant handle that, this job is not for you. Also, you deal with many upset customers, which at times can get the best of you. This job is great for young kids just starting out!"
bad,"I hate this job, it alternates between boring and stressful.  People who work with me can be unreliable, entitled and lazy.   Management is not trained very well.   There are a million corporate standards that bog you down and micro-manage.  Your hours fluctuate week to week and days and times you work are not consistent either."
bad,"This is a great jpb to have if your looking for very minimal hours with min wage pay. The company used to be amazing but now its turning more into a McDonalds type job. It offers a lot of pretty cool things in the benefits area but if you utilized all the options given to you, youd wind up with no money each pay check."
bad,"So much potential.  So little concern."
bad,"Want to get yelled at by entitled customers and ignored by management? Then starbucks might be for you! Granted, I worked at a drive-thru, which is probably a bit different than a cafe store. Out of twenty-something employees, I was one of three that actually drank coffee. Best part: telling customers that they can't pay for their $3 with a $100 bill."
bad,"I loved the benefits, the free college, free drinks, free Spotify. But the people you work with always cause so many problems at work. there was also so much childish drama. And the management was so bad."
bad,"Some of the managers are a joke in comprehension."
bad,"While I will admit, the coffee is great, that is where the greatness ends. I would not recommend working at Starbucks unless you have a great passion for making coffee. I found it to be extremely stressful and not worth the time that I spent there"
bad,"If your young and looking for job then this is place for you. Manager was super nice and the people who work there for the most part are nice, few bad seeds, everywhere you go but long as you go in and do your job it shouldn't matter. Some of the customers can be a little dramatic and overbearing about their drinks, food or ""perception"" of service and their experience but those are usually the people who seek attention or have mental problems. Why else would someone try to go to your place of work and tell your manager you made them feel some type of way? I would go back only if I was desperate and needed of a job. The best part of working here is the free drinks and free food and the environment is usually friendly and upbeat just depends when I worked their some of the dudes/chicks had attitudes and there is too many shifts working half time and they can be immature about telling you how to do things but again the job is for teenagers or someone who is in  high school, not a place to make a career or living unless getting into management."
bad,"The job is not intellectually stimulating. You do the same repetitive motions and say the same things constantly. Having to deal with mean people all day negatively impacts my views, too."
bad,"This was my first job, being offered employment just 3 weeks after turning 16 years old. I never dreaded having to go to work, and I loved making all the different recipes at random for each customer. I attracted several customer-turned-regulars which I credit to how much fun I had with mostly everyone that came by. I truly enjoyed every shift, however minimum wage at the time was unbearably low and that definitely affected my time there. There wasn't any room to grow within the company, owned by Kroger, and hours were distributed poorly amongst employees. Besides a couple of complaints, I still have fond memories of being there and always will."
bad,This work place was a good job but the management was really bad. The people there were helpful within each employee but the managers were inconsistent.
bad,"Working at starbucks was alright"
bad,Starbucks has changed a lot over the years. It changed from quality to quantity. The vision is different and it's just another corporate job that cares more about money than employees.
bad,Mon temps partiel à Starbucks m'a permis de payer mon loyer pendant mes études.
bad,"I worked at a Starbucks located in a Target this past summer, so keep this fact in mind when considering these companies on their own. In short, Target managers would give conflicting orders and overrule Starbucks managers causing confusion. In addition, it was expected that you memorize the Target managers drink orders."
bad,"This company puts huge importance on belonging and my experience was opposite that. My typical day involved working drive thru, lobby, or running drinks around to where they needed to be. The management was frequently not around to help with rushes."
bad,"There is nothing really to tell, other than the days are long and with everything you do you get paid very little.  The management isn't so great either."
bad,Starbucks isn't an easy company to work with and there is a lot that goes on behind the scenes that no one knows about. You also get paid very little for doing so much work.
bad,"Starbucks has treated me well for the past three years, the management isn't the best, but then again, where is it good?  The worst part about working at Starbucks is the customer base. 30% of customers feel a sense of entitlement and treat their baristas like trash."
bad,Management did not take skills or ideas from subordinates under consideration. The customer were great overall but the environment was unorganized.
bad,"not as promising as it sounds, only a decent place to work when attending school. Other then that company isn't that great to work for."
bad,You end up working 6-7 days a week and allot of over time. It is a very busy environment that I found quite stressful. If they had more staff I would have enjoyed it allot more.
bad,Starbucks has gone from a company that leads through its people to a company which ignores its people. The Culture has created a bad place to work as it is pushing out talent as people try to cover their butts and blame someone else.
bad,"The people that I worked with, and the regular customers are amazing they made working there so much more interesting. The job has some management issues that need to be fixed."
bad,When I worked at Starbucks the store I worked at went through 3 Managers in 6 months time.  Hope no one else has this problem.  Best of Luck in this job.
bad,Staff is great. The management seems to be under informed and misdirected. Serious lack of true leadership.  The hardest part of my day is apologizing to customers for lack of personnel and product. Most enjoyable part of my day is leaving.
bad,"always short of staff, managers often sat in the office not helping, stressful environment."
bad,"My review on the job that I have right now is UNORGANIZED. I do not like the management no one shows up for work. Its just really hard to balance life when you are always being called into work all the time. My co-workers were very easy to get along with for the most part and even if we didn't get along we somehow made it all work. The hardest part of the job was working on holidays such as ( Thanksgiving, Christmas….etc.) I never got ti spend time with my family.The most enjoyable part was the act that I got to help people with whatever they needed."
bad,"This wasn't my first rodeo in a cafe, however I had been expecting more. The staff was very biased and since i was an extremely hard worker, the staff would generally leave me behind the bar and cash register by myself as they would joke around in the back. Business and work came first so I never stopped working, I would run the store by myself and then the kids would try the normal routine of jokes and comments, while i shrugged them off I would look for other jobs for this one was no the greatest. It wasn't until the kids would give me my weekly tips in unrolled pennies that i was lucky enough to find a position as a barback that would lead me to become a bartender."
bad,"Little upward potential, micro managed, little support for management team, work/life balance nice, high turnover due to payscale"
bad,"I have been working at Starbucks since July 2016 and in reality its a good job, however I have only had one training shift and I haven't learned bar which is very stressful."
bad,"Working Starbucks is a fast-paced work environment that leaves you no room to catch your breath. It's constant hard work and very stressful."
bad,"Depends on management and not as flexible as it used to be, but the work is straightforward, but physical. Early morning shifts are the best. Be mindful of your wrists and other work hazards like razors when cutting down boxes."
bad,"It's a decent job and can be very fun and rewarding. "
bad,"I've worked at Starbucks for two years as a barista. I've had no advancement despite asking after even the most basic one (to become an official trainer, instead of doing the de facto training of new people I've done in the past), and my wage is at the base minimum for employees in my area (because I moved and got bumped up automatically). I've spoken to my new manager time and again about getting more hours, and she is not particularly sympathetic or helpful past ""call some other stores that need coverage."" Meanwhile, I'm struggling to pay my rent."
bad,A perfect first job as you can step your foot into working in the real world but other than that it doesnt pay well and not a lot of room for advancing in the company
bad,"Starbucks is a very liberal and socialist company. That being said, all baristas are considered equal. You are not promoted, given performance based raises, or given any special perks that your fellow baristas don't receive. If you're fine with staying in one position for an extremely long time, working your butt off, and only receiving a pat on the back (or, if you're fortunate enough to be voted for, the silly ""Partner of the Quarter"" award), then this position is definitely right for you. If you're motivated, believe that hard work pays off, and want a good career, then you'll only end up frustrated and disgusted with working for this company. You can be the hardest working, most efficient, most positive and friendly person there, but in the end, your coworker standing over there in the corner doing nothing will get the same, if not larger, paycheck at the end of the day. "
bad,Always short staffed and not compensated. Pay is not competitive. Starbucks is way to much of a high volume store that they cannot compensate for it in terms of labor.
bad,"The opportunity to advance within the company was there, but not completely worth it. Although, wage and rules have changed for the better."
bad,"Starbucks was once an amazing place to work at.  Don't get me wrong, there are still many partners (all levels) who are incredible.  The fast paced nature of the business though has kicked the customer connection to the curb.  Constant changes take place when you are expected to have a schedule posted 3 weeks in advance.  The result is partners frustrated that you constantly have to change the schedule which leads to turnover."
bad,typical day consist of opening by yourself prepping for closing doing all shift work for both shifts. Having to work both sides with no help and get penalized if you have a line on both sides. get penalized for things that they never taught you to do. and have a security guard that only been working for a month to threaten your job everyday.
bad,"-restock materials such as. cups, lids, ice,."
bad,starbucks roasting plant is a place where they set a lot of rules and don't enforce them to everyone but will hit someone with the harshest penalty they can. This being a problem because the rules are being broke by everyone but every now and then they crucify someone for breaking them
bad,"Can't begin to describe my experience working at Starbucks, it is the most confusingly stressful job I think I'll have."
bad,"Disorganized, It was made from scratch so you could imagine how things were like, The most enjoyable part was making the drinks"
bad,tout a changé depuis l arrivé du nouveau DG  depuis 2 ans  et c est de pire en pire
bad,"At the beginning, Starbucks was amazing to me. I had great co-workers, a great Manager, and was respected by everyone in the store even though I was new and just a Barista. The benefits were solid, tips were good and I loved it. When I transferred into another district about a year later that is where the nightmare began. At first it wasn't so bad. My new co-workers were awesome, and tips got better, but the Manager was terrible. He didn't do his job and did some unspeakable things in my time there which resulted in making everyone's job much harder, and his termination. Shortly after this I got a promotion to Shift Supervisor which I had been working for since I began. I started this new position at a newly built store and thought to myself that the nightmare was over, but I was far from it. The Manager of this store had gotten transferred over from another state across the country so she was adjusting to things which is to be expected, but I have never been micro managed so much in my life. She couldn't let the reigns go even when she was gone and she showed favoritism to a barista that had just started a couple of months before the store had opened. He got a promotion to Shift Supervisor in six months due to this, and was already working his way into being an Assistant Manager, while I slaved away doing everything I could and more for the Manager trying to get to the same position. I eventually got pushed out of the company because of this. I recommend this job if you can find a decent store and group of people to work with. It was great to me and I loved it until it was"
bad,"A typical day at work in DKR stadium brings in roughly $200, as it is open mostly to meet the needs of the stadium employees. On game days however, our sales go up to above $5,000 a day. I learned how to manage a 12 hour shift with non-stop attention to detail and consumer experience. I genuinely loved my co-workers although they were all hired with no experience, and I had the same 6-month experience as my lead when hired. Management was incredibly poor. There was a lot of confusion about who our manager was supposed to be as the acting manager was technically a general manager of several other food stores and was not supposed to be our store manager. He was also very difficult to get into contact with on occasion. The hardest part of the job would have to have been watching the store be under-managed with easy-fix solutions and not being able to fix it myself. The most enjoyable part of the job was easily the people that I was able to build relationships with."
bad,Working at Starbucks is a very challenging job but is also very rewarding because it pushes you to learn how to handle high volume and pressure when it comes to customer service. I work with a team that is very supportive and positive which makes it a great environment to help serve our customers. I am always anticipating the customers needs and making sure every second they are at our location is a genuine and welcoming experience. I make sure to hold myself accountable a long with my team to maintain sales goals and help drive the business while upholding compandy standards.
bad,"They have high demands of your energy and high expectations for morale and customer service but do not compensate you according to your ability, knowledge or effort.  All of the ""perks"" are not necessarily applicable or beneficial to all partners, not to mention they can be superficial.  I need financial compensation to pay my bills not a premium membership to Spotify."
bad,great company overall but certainly areas that could be improved on. HIGH turnover rate. management can get overworked and district managers can be way to nit picky.
bad,"Nice environment,multicultural,fast paced, but lovely."
bad,"A typical day at Starbucks insists of making quality beverages, suggesting sales, greeting customers, cleaning and stocking. While working in this setting I have learned to work at a fast pace and adapt to changes. Although, this location has a high turn over with staff including management, I still enjoy the opportunity to get the know the new faces that comes in and out. As a barista trainer, I am responsible for training the new hires. I enjoy working with in a environment where I can build trust with my co workers, and build relationships that will help us before more effective as a team."
bad,"This job is highly stressful and expects a lot from employees with very little return. The benefits Starbucks offers are somewhat progressive, however the cons outweigh that one and only pro. Management is extremely stressed and usually takes their stress out on barista employees unfairly. Noticed the General Manager picked favorite employees and treated others poorly. Management should change for this particular location. The company itself is unethical in several ways, one being that it does not require recycling resulting in MASSIVE waste. Ingredients used in most prepared drinks and packaged foods, especially frappuccinos are questionable with many products containing ridiculously high amounts of sugar or artificial sugar. If you are an ethical and follow your life using moral guidelines, I would not recommend working here."
bad,"As my first job I remember having horrible burns in my hands as a typical day at work from washing them every 30 seconds because the manager told me I shouldn't touch my face . Well every time I get nervous I always touch my face ,  "
bad,El trabajo con el personal de mantenimiento era muy complejo.
bad,"Do not remember much, job was fun, management and co-workers were nice and helpful. The hardest part was being in school so i could not work much. The most enjoyable part was having a job"
bad,"My typical day at work was to service customers, take orders, and prepare different selections of drinks. I learned how to make over 100 different styles of drinks which was very cool and I enjoyed that the most. To meet the hottest part of the job was standing up and not having any breaks for the entire time."
bad,"Great company to work for, current support system needs improvement, a lot of favoritism but you can't beat the benefits"
bad,"Starbucks is a very good company. So good that its one of the fortune 100 companies to work for, but work/life balance does not exist and that is for all positions, from barista and up. New York stores especially."
bad,"I used to love working at Starbucks. My co-workers were always fun to work with, and it was fun to just run the store. This was before I saw the corruptions hidden within the completely unethical company. "
bad,"Great for learning how to deal with high stress people and high stress situations, but not great if you're easily anxious. This job will follow you home (and you will smell like espresso constantly). The hardest part of the job is dealing with the difficult people: they are always right (even when they aren't) and you have to accept it and take it. The benefits don't outweigh the terrible wages or the amount of stress you'll take on with this job (if you work full time). The management is getting better, but honestly your work experience depends on who the manager is and how seriously the people in charge take their jobs."
bad,"Working as a cashier, making drinks. Providing customers with facts on the menu. My coworkers were great, however mananagement needs a lot of work. The hardest part of the job was the begining, learning how to make the drinks because so much goes into it."
bad,"Starbucks is a multinational corporation. Only problem is that there is not a lot of room to move up. The money is not great. There is no real challenge. Management changes from store to store. There is a high turnover rate, and unfortunately it is a less mature environment and something that I found stifling after getting my Bachelors."
bad,This review has already been submitted and some aspects were good while working here and some aspects were not good.
bad,"At this particular job, most of our guests are morning business men and women. Everything has to be exact. Exact measures, exact stirs and twists. You had to extra causious because its a horrible feeling when your guest is upset with the coffee u just made them."
bad,"prepared beverages, cash controller, supervised other baristas."
bad,"= I would start before the shop is open and ensure all is ready to go."
bad,A typical day is very busy which that's something i love but the management honestly sucked. The manager was not fair she was very selfish and petty.
bad,was a good start for me because I was in school but they did not accommodate my work schedule
bad,"Idk what else to say about this company we all know how Starbucks is , very fast pace the people are so mean to you. the only people who actually work at Starbucks are college kids and we get treated bad"
bad,"I enjoyed preparing beverages and making my guests happy."
bad,"bad management, drugs in back room. health codes broken. work never appreciated, picked favorites"
bad,I have worked at starbucks for over 3 years it has been a love hate relationship. The biggest downfall was the very low pay for the amount of work you do and the size of the menu you have to remember. Each day was the same greet customers take orders and prepare their drinks.
bad,"Starbucks was a good job, I learned a lot about coffee and the culture of Starbucks. I loved the fact that both part time and full time employees have the option of receiving health benefits. The biggest downfall with Starbucks is the $18,000 yearly salary and that is if you get the hours to make that which is the downfall of most jobs in the same category (fast food ect. It is a minimum wage job and no one wants one of those!"
bad,it was my learning journey started from this company. i learned about difficulty  and straggle in it you will face in your life.
bad,it was a student job on campus and monitored regualrly and ran smoothly.
bad,"I love my Starbucks coffees in the morning which is why when I worked for the company, I was pleasantly surprised on how different things were behind the scenes. I felt as though the company was a bit unorganized, our store was under staffed a lot of the time which made all the employees stressed out most of the time. Overall for me I did not have a great experience working for the company, but I love my coffees in the morning and am very glad that the company exists."
bad,Great for someone who needs a flexible work schedule.  Bad for someone actually trying to make a living.  I work overtime almost every week and barely made enough.  Worked there for two years and only made .90 cents more than when i first started
bad,"• For this type of job, it is among the best"
bad,Inept manager that twisted the company values to fit here need to control and manipulate employees.
bad,"It's a very stressful environment. The people are nice, but I rather not work in the food industry."
bad,The culture has changed over the years. The company is growing but they're not treating employees like they used to.
bad,"Zero enforcement of EEO policies. Suffer a mental disorder? Expect no sympathy. Over 40? No promotion, or demoted. Male? Less likely to be hired. Even just quiet? You're not Starbucks material. "
bad,"Being a manager with Starbucks is great experience, but be prepared to be over-stressed, over worked, unappreciated, and say good bye to your social life."
bad,"Starbucks gives you a disjointed schedule, with little rhythm or reason to your workweek, resulting in constant exhaustion despite still not making a living wage. While they have somehow conned a number of competent managers into the organization, likely through incentive programs that baristas and shift supervisors never see any part of, they have also acquired a huge array of unrealistic taskmasters, seemingly incapable of human empathy or reason."
bad,"you basically had to be personal friends with everyone here outside of work in order to really ""fit"" in here. pay wasn't great at all , but hey I was a kid what can I say."
bad,"During a typical day at work, we had two other coworkers and a supervisor to work with. we would have stations and rotate during our eight hour shift from the register, to the cold bar, to the hot barista bar, and last to the floater bar where we would clean up, restock, help out anywhere that is short handed."
bad,Some customers can be overbearing but some can be heavenly. First shift is the most fast-paced and the time goes by the fastest. It can be enjoyable sometimes to work so quickly and produce marvelous drink experiences for customers but it can be bad when you dont get paid enough to live in this economy. Always having Managers monitoring you and the company changing policies .
bad,"I learned a lot about coffee and coffee drinkers. It is the type company that attracts a lot of good talent, but unfortunately a lot of talent lost to bad management and low morale. The work itself is not difficult at all. If you can sell, clean and talk to people about anything it's not difficult and hours can be very flexible."
bad,"Work has always been fun and relaxing at this job, but only when it's not too busy. The team members are always willing to help each other, but when it gets too busy for us to handle , management never seems to care. I've learned a lot from this job. From managing while the manager is away, or help improve on customer interactions."
bad,"Working here kept me busy my whole shift, there was always something to do."
bad,I believe this company could be more productive if it treated it s employees with more respect and understanding.
bad,"Perhaps if I had a different DM, I would have enjoyed working at Starbucks. It was like banging my head against a wall for over a year."
bad,"For the highly demanding and tedious work baristas are faced with, the pay is not all that great. It's an ok job if you are a student or in between jobs, but definitely NOT a career choice. Management is also not the greatest."
bad,bons collègues de travail. travail sous pression. bonne expérience
bad,"There are a vast array of other fast food employers that pay more per hour and offer comperable benefits. At one point, Starbuck's employee benefits made them a competative employer but until they raise base pay for employees, seek work elsewhere."
bad,Overworked and underpaid. Management never cared about workers when scheduling because each shift had a lot fewer employees than the number required to have a productive shift.
bad,"If you are unable to have a full flexible availability do not work here. They want you to be able to work like you don't have family while pushing the whole ""work life balance"" speal. Also if you don't agree with how things are or you don't agree with a shift supervisor, then you get singled out to the point where they will cut your hours to get you to quit."
bad,"I personally came in with plenty of experience, and was promised a certain pay amount upon my hiring. I did not receive it and instead of the position promised to me, the district manager laid out a 3 month plan to earn that position. I reiterate that I had sufficient experience for said position."
bad,"The people you work with are usually great. However, the company is shifting to run like a fast-food business. Terrible management that causes the employee to burn out/ experience stress."
bad,"Not enough hours if you have bills to pay, a lot high school drama, mean bosses, Insurance they offer don’t cover much and costs too much , Don’t like to promote from within, High pressure not enough pay for amount of work"
bad,"Constantly understaffed and management is unreliable. In the past 3 years, my store has had 7 different managers. The hardest part of the job is achieving cleaning and inventory tasks when peak is staffed at the bare minimum."
bad,Overall it was an okay place to work at were it not for the terrible management (we went through 4 store managers in my time there). Also the culture of entitlement created by corporate made many interactions with customers not so great.
bad,"I don't know if it was just me but the environment and employees vibes were off. But if you put all that aside, the place is great especially if they train you properly and know what to do"
bad,super disorganized and horrible management. Don't get paid enough for everything you are required to do. Not staffed correctly or trained correctly. It is survival of the fittest and they set you up for failure.
bad,"worked at the 63rd and lexington location. Had great teammates but management was another thing. Had a shift supervisor that would take multiple smoke breaks (10-12 in one shift). she left me on register 30-40 minutes past my shift multiple times while she was just sitting in the back doing nothing. also would wait til i came in to make me do something that should've been done hours ago. had another shift supervisor who wouldn't let me start cleaning and pre close early so many nights we'd be there until 12:30 sometimes later because she always too her sweet time closing (store closed at 11). this same supervisor would scold me and other baristas for wanting to take food home that's being thrown out in the garbage anyway. store manager tried to make me come to work sick (had a stomach virus) when i did the appropriate thing and called out 4 hours before my shift but would let other baristas call out 5-10 minutes before theirs. next time i came to work he told me to my face ""people don't get sick overnight"". My store manager covered for a manager at another store and made one of their supervisors come to work with a broken bone in their foot. overall good company and benefits but bad management at this location"
bad,Team worked well together but the management of the store is poor. Would not recommended. Like the job perks of free drinks and coffee. Good first job but chance for advancing is low.
bad,"Alright place to work very mundane and if you have bad management it makes the"
bad,"While better than other jobs, Starbucks is incredibly demanding and does not compensate you well for the amount of work you do. The emotional trauma experienced on the job by people can be incredibly stressful, and it's hard to recover from each day and put on a smile the next. It may have been the specific location I worked, but it seemed like problems and requests weren't heard unless they were extremely life threatening. Management was rigid, inflexible, and difficult to feel close to. A subpar experience."
bad,"Honestly working there can actually be fun when you enjoy making drinks! But working in the airport is a bad idea because it’s super super busy! And you might need to do over time and sometimes they don’t pay you unless you remind them about these over time hours! "
bad,"Bad experience with management, unreliable and unfriendly environment to work in. Fast-paced job making it an also stressful environment, an extremely serious company that only cares about money."
bad,you’ll hate your life .. customers are rude and creepy and they overwork you so much and its not worth it .. They dont let you do your nails they dont let you do anything they make you clean 24/7
bad,"They were not willing to accommodate for disabilities, when trying to organize my accommodation the general manager did not respond to my calls so I was never able to complete my accommodation packet."
bad,"I worked here for almost a year, I started off loving the job as been working there for almost a year. The management was terrible after the renovation. I was forced to work with the flu, even giving doctors notes and finding covered for the remainder of the shifts. This starbucks is not a good place to work, however Starbucks overall is. Tips are about 40$ a week for 35+ hours"
bad,"They hype you up about all the benefits they offer, but of course, you don't get any of them unless you work a certain amount of hours. I would go a full week sometimes without being scheduled and my availability was pretty open. I just asked for 2 days off during the week so I could attend classes. The pay is low and the tips don't make up for that at all, especially when you already have low hours."
bad,At Starbucks the environment was extremely toxic and I often hid in the bathroom crying because of how rude the employees were. They didn’t pay me for 2 months and I didn’t take into account I just was not getting payed until I called corporate.
bad,"Working here had its ups and downs. I enjoyed my time working at starbucks when I was not being yelled at by my manager. I mostly worked on the register because I did not get any training at all on the bar until I was 4 months into my employment. They made sure to follow a strict break schedule to ensure everybody got the time they needed which was really nice. Mornings could be stressful especially having a drive-thru window, but that is typical in a coffee shop. Cleanliness was not a priority when I worked here there was a day we had a health inspector in and I was instructed to go through and mark every single product we had in the fridges because it had never been done and they were not prepared. The store manager that overlooked me is no longer with the company but it is safe to say we did not get along. If you made a mistake he was quick to chastise you and be very harsh in the way he addressed you. The manager was the main reason I quit!"
bad,"The culture at Starbucks is to get things done fast, not efficiently. A lot of my ex-coworkers would break so many rules and do disgusting things just to get an order done fast. Pay in minimum wage for a ton of stressful work, and frankly no one likes to tips their baristas. I would make an average $4 bi-weekly in tips, for working 20 hours a week."
bad,I didn’t feel respected by my manager and was unable to make it to class on time because I was constantly being over scheduled and not given time off as opposed to the 16 year old who would never show up and was given the schedule they wanted.
bad,"Very stressful work, lots of cleaning with harsh chemicals. The pay is awful, especially for the volume and pace of the job. Management felt very impersonal. It feels extremely corporate and like the company doesn't really care about its employees, just the numbers they're putting up."
bad,"Positive: learning to cope under pressure, meeting and bonding with new people"
bad,"I have had 2 managers with this company, and it has showed me how much having a competent manager can make or break or opinion of the company. There is no accountability for managers. They are not required to clock in or out, so if your manager is only there 20 hours a week (mine averages about 25 hours a week) there is no way for your district manager to know. I have been with the company for almost 2.5 years and have only been given a .50 cent raise. There are health benefits, but over the past year they have raised the prices of what you have to pay. In my opinion the company does not care about its employees."
bad,"I'm an Agile Coach. I was hired to help with a transformation. However, the management is very old school and, as in many places, thinks that all change has to happen in the development teams. Add in the fact that the dev and test teams each have their own hierarchical managers who are more invested in fiefdoms than positive change. In short, I was never allowed to do my job and any attempt to do so resulted in strife."
bad,a lot of expectation without any benefits. Good work place just thanks to people who works there and just if you have a good team Otherwais not really for some carrier progress.
bad,"can't comment anything. The management is too bad bcs a lot of double standart here and too much underpressure as well. "
bad,"I have had a decent experience here at Starbucks. I think the biggest downfall of this job is that almost none of my managers or coworkers had any respect for my personal schedule, however the general manager is pretty good at not scheduling when I had school. I’ve dealt with a fair amount of bullying from my coworkers and a manager and I tried to get it dealt with but no one was willing to help. You just feel like you’re working a dead end job and every barista that I know who’s quit has done so bc for the sake of their mental health or scheduling issues (aka manager not respecting availability). It’s alright if you’re only looking for a short term job. It pays more than minimum wage but I definitely would recommend working elsewhere."
bad,"Personally as part of a minority I felt constantly diminished not only by customers but also by coworkers or even managers sometimes. Overall tips always seemed to me to be short, shifts were unreasonable as well as training. Management was very discouraging and had an issue with my I-9 form that took her over two months to resolve, which meant that for that time I was not paid at all! Once the manager finally requested help to fix the issue it was resolved in loess than three minutes, and the only reason I saw this through was because I felt that if I had quit I would not have been contacted to get payed."
bad,"For a large company like Starbucks that touts itself as a leader in employee benefits, there is little room for advancement for industry veterans. I had worked in the coffee industry for years, and the store I was eventually settled at was weighed down by petty favoritism, endless gossip, and Starbucks' strangling policies that allow customers to take advantage of baseline employees. Starbucks is the ""fast-food"" of the coffee industry, and it would be better if said descriptor was sooner adopted before unsuspecting, hopeful employees are called to their doom by the gluttonous siren plainly visible on their ubiquitous icon."
bad,"It is an okay job. The company expects employees to do the job of two people at once and if it is short staffed expect not to have a moment to breath. Hours are great to come by and there are some great perks like free coffee beans, free beverages and one meal while working. There is a discount of 30 percent otherwise."
bad,"I have worked for Starbucks for 5.5 years now and I have seen many employees come and go. Initially working there was a mixed bag of good and bad. We were almost always staffed well, we were able to meet our objectives, and it felt good to be a part of the team. However, the company began to cut labor over time (I have heard rumors that managers are given bonuses if they go under their expected labor). With fewer and fewer employees being given less and less time to train, our ability to meet goals decreased. during my third year I had a panic attack at work. I got help for my anxiety, but even now I dread going into work because of how stressful it has become. The benefits are undeniably great, but the cost of reduced support on the job is not worth it."
bad,"I came to Starbucks because of the wonderful culture I have heard about and how much they care for their employees. I really wish I had seen that in my time with this company. "
bad,"Very dramatic, manager treated it as if this was our career, would make my coworkers cut class from university across the city for “mandatory ” meetings when they didn’t even have cars and had to take public transit. Everything was constantly broken as well."
bad,I loved working at Starbucks. You really develop a sense of family there with the people you work with. I learned a vast majority of my customer service skills as well as my communication skills.
bad,At my store it was basically a place filled with a miasma of depression. There was no chance of advancement and each day people came in with a lack of enthusiasm.
bad,"I was fired after missing two days. I had a car accident even made it to work the day after my accident, eventually I started to take a lot of lyfts an Uber’s to get to work an my card didn’t work, had the money tho. And was let go. My manager was the unprofessional manager I’ve ever met. She complained to “certain people about being 5 minutes late and “other “ people could be 2 hours late an not even a write up. She’d pick an chose when she wants to come in, even if we really need an extra worker she’d stay home, or come to work hours late....it’s not a secure place for good workers."
bad,"The starbucks I worked at wasnt a corporate starbucks it was a college starbucks. It wasn't the greatest experience and management was not the best. A college starbucks is the same as a regular starbucks, and pay was min wage. I didnt receive many hours."
bad,I work hard at Starbucks didn't get what I deserved people got positions that just came in because I was not like by management supervisor liked my work ethic he was afraid of management therefore wasn't nothing done so I left the job and move to Vegas
bad,"Working as a barista would be an ideal first job. I would not recommend staying at Starbucks for much longer after graduating high school. Do not expect a raise because you will not get one unless minimum wage is increased. It’s a company that has become just another corporation, in my point of view. Baristas deserve more than what they get for doing the work that they do."
bad,"The trainning prosess was extremely quick. I enjoyed my trainner and she did her best but she only had 4 part-time days with me.  2 of the days were mostly computer training. We had about an hour of register trainning ( which was difficult because I had no understanding of how the drinks were made yet) and an hour of bar trainning where we went over so many different drinks I couldn't even remember the basics by the end, I was very overwhelmed. After my first week of working 5 days part-time I was without a trainner and expected to work on my own. I quit my job as a barista only after 3 weeks because I still felt overwhelmed and I was still receiving negative comments from a select group of coworkers and it was extremely frustrating."
bad,"Just out of high school or getting through college? This job is great for you. Trying to live, pay rent, eat regularly and buy things you need/want on your own? This is not the job for you."
bad,The managers are the worst people. They do not understand people have lives outside of work. They tend to over work their employees and treat them with little to no respect.
bad,"Store manager bought their personal problems into the way they managed the store. Lazy, let personal issues affect the working environment, ect. elehgnkjhkj"
bad,"Starbucks clearly thought that because its sales and stocks were up after the 2008 depression, that things were on track. Instead, behind the scenes each department was running in opposite directions, and the impact of that wasn't a problem until a decade later. Management is way too vertical and getting a small project completed that should only take a month ends up taking five years with all the red tape and approvals. My department was particularly bad, but it seemed like it wasn't much better on other teams. Everyone is a manager -- it's literally a company of managers managing managers, but no one really owns the work. Schultz understood people not business, Johnson understand business not people."
bad,"My time at Starbucks was not ideal. The day I was intended to complete my training, the individual set to see to my training was hungover and sick in the washroom. I never received proper training and was met with hostility when I would inquire on learning how to complete my job. The hostile environment carried into my personal life as well, as coworkers would often mock my lack of knowledge on Starbucks beverages outside of work on social media, even though they were the ones who failed to train me. Despite the environment created by my coworkers, I did enjoy interacting with customers and making drinks."
bad,You can end up feeling like a number and people get way too into the competitive culture. Your experience depends a lot on your store manager. Benefits are nice though.
bad,It could be better but management lacks and doesn’t seem like they care about the employees. Always understaffed which is a management issue. Better management better work place.
bad,"Starbucks was a decent job, i really liked challenging myself to make the best drinks as fast as possible especially during the rushes. The only downside to this job was an unproffesional working environment with bad managemeng."
bad,"As a barista I loved my job. I did not like the way the management was run though, for a multi-billion dollar company they should have a more helpful H.R. department, the training is good though, I learned a lot but then again I am self driven. There is really no option for advancement, even if you go above and beyond others in the workplace, there is okay pay for a chain, expect to be watched like a hawk. There is a lot of clique based culture, and work related politics, which was not enjoyable. This is a high stress work environment that can become hostile in a very short amount of time. Though the enjoyment of learning about the way coffee is roasted, cultivated, learning about the regions and process it takes to grow the coffee was very intense and likable. Even pairing the coffees with pastries, learning to develop your pallet is quite a blast. Now the rush of serving a hoard of customers really gets the adrenaline pumping too! If you learn the deployment well and know your part in the barista dance it really is a rewarding job for someone with a strong work ethic and determined attitude. The things that get exhausting are just the lack of professional management techniques, workplace politics, and the cliques that seem to form. Oh as well as a non existent H.R presence to support employees in times of need."
bad,"Pro of multitasking"
bad,"As much as I loved the work itself and the people I worked with, the management always took it's toll. After 3 years and going through 5 managers in one store I had enough with the last one. I mean one awful inconsiderate manager after the next, I had one boss treat us like real robots, taking a water break was something to be ashamed of, and don't even bother about expecting to be schedule in your availability with this guy and then it's us to blame when we can't be there due to scheduling conflicts. It was rough. Don't get me wrong we had two really good managers, genuine all around good people, who cared about their store and the people in it, those two started my career with Starbucks and stayed in contact with me my whole experience there, helping with any question I had since I wasn't able to ask my own manager. The last lady that ran our store was just... I mean there aren't words to say only because I hate to talk so negatively about someone but there really isn't anything good you could say about her... and you know what my higher management did with the two awful managers I was talking about? They sent them to corporate office with a promotion. What about the other two really good managers what happened to them? Well one of them got demoted after not receiving any help from his manager when his store went through sever struggles. As for the other guy he's been relocated over 3 times now in the last year, not letting him get comfortable in any home or store. So to say the least... district management needs to sort their stuff out and start giving a dng about their employees."
bad,"The hardest part of the job would be dealing with the drama between employees. There is always someone mad at someone else for something, passive aggressive comments being made. Often time other employees are not helpful with any coverage and then expect you to give them coverage or your shift in the blink of an eye."
bad,A typical day was easy to make drinks and mostly easy to deal with customers. I learned how to make all the drinks. The management was not very good. Everyone I worked with was lazy and didn't do their job. The hardest part was closing because I did almost all the work the whole time. The most enjoyable part was getting free drinks.
bad,"The location that I work at has serious management problems, and staffing issues. We are the 2nd busiest location in the state yet we work sometimes with 3 or 4 people. Pay is bad, and the benefits are alright, but i do not take advantage of them because i have no need to. I dont think I would work for this company again."
bad,The tipping was a huge part in my decision to leave since I was in a grocery store they were not allowed. It was especially frustrating on holidays when I was slammed and only received minimum wage.
bad,"mauvais managment ; evolution reduite , pas dencadrement dequpe ; "
bad,"I worked here for almost an entire year and my employees and manager made me hate every second of it at my store, when I phantomed (worked at another location for a shift) I loved it, other stores were very welcoming and managers were friendly, my store had very big bullying issues and I constantly avoided any contact with co workers and when I brought up my issues with management nothing at all was done and to make it worse when I tried to transfer to another store my district manager continually blocked it"
bad,Starbucks use to be great until I realized As a minority my advancement was limited.At one point training and people were nice now everything is fast paced and very corperate.
bad,"Looking past the tyrannical manager, the unenthused staff, and the entitled customers this job was almost bearable. A pay that made the abuse fiscally worth it might have been able to keep me there for another week or two."
bad,"The environment was very stressful. Not only did we have to deal with rude customers, but we also had to deal with constant complaining from the workers. Nothing was eve good enough for them and the manager was always calling off sick or didn't know what she was doing. the times were always off or didn't make sense for the time of day. Workers who had been working there for Five plus years would complain more than new people which would put even more strain on the connections we tried to make."
bad,"I did not enjoy working at Starbucks. The first year was exciting and fun, and I learned a lot about the coffee culture and cultivated relationships with the regular customers. However, the corporation became too obsessed with expanding and earning money at the expense of their products and employees, and the quality went downhill rapidly. Employees often felt jaded and ignored, and I often experienced dissatisfaction with the higher management. People only cared about promotions and the Starbucks ""image"" rather than the happiness of their employees. We all were unsatisfied at the store."
bad,"I loved the atmosphere of working in a coffee shop, the customers were great. I did not feel as though management treated employees with respect and dignity"
bad,"I worked at starbucks for 5 years and can say that I met some of the best and absolute worst people in my time there. Most of the time training is very spotty and you cant seem to trust new hires, which is not their fault because time and effort was not put into them to set them up for success. Also management is a joke and will not treat you fairly, in my time there I was promoted to a supervisor and then they let me stay there refusing to promote me to an assistant manager position even though my 3 different store managers all gave recommendations and tried to get me there. So if you free coffee is worth the cost of a toxic work environment then this is the job for you!"
bad,"I'll keep it simple, Starbucks hands down have the worst training I've seen. Starbucks has poor leadership from store managers to district managers..."
bad,"Starbucks was my first every job so it was never intended to be any kind of permanent but the manager kept hiring more people and giving the rest of us fewer hours. It is frustrating not being able to work most of the time because store hours are limited but then to have her turn around and hire more high schoolers who didn't even really want a job. On top of that the schedule is almost always posted late and she will just ignore upcoming conflicts even if you notify her or put it on the calendar months in advance. the other baristas are great to work with and there is a real sense of camaraderie there, in fact a lot of us will hang out together outside of work and will also form real and meaningful friendships. i cannot say enough good things about the staff and their desire to always treat a costumer well, but the store management is a complete travesty"
bad,"Working at Starbucks was a dream come true. I had always wanted to work there as a kid because it looked so much fun. I wanted to increase my standing by moving up to a shift supervisor. Days could be very busy or very slow. Shift supervisors are responsible for connecting with customers, creating drinks and food, and assessing customer concerns as politely and professionally as possible. It also entails dealing with store finances, stock and inventory, managing floor baristas and their breaks, and making sure the store looks presentable and ready for customers. "
bad,the culture is one of bending over backwards for the customer. even if the employee is in the right or following a new policy both the manager and the employee are told pacify the customer at any cost. If you cant handle pure human entitlement you probably dont want to work here
bad,"Working at Starbucks is fun in the beginning, but the charm wears off as you learn most of the duties. The best part of working here is seeing your regular customers often and building friendships with them. The culture of this company seems positive, and I think corporate strives for a very supportive culture and wants their stores to succeed, but I saw a lot of conflict within the stores. I saw in several stores that drama is easily created between employees and there is not a lot of conflict resolution or input from management about these issues."
bad,"Starbucks pushes the bottom dollar and does not provide any incentive to be better. Employee retention led to daily struggles while people learned the job roles and functions creating much more stress than is necessary. I loved working there initially and as time went on, the company moved away from core values that were implemented and lived everyday to a superficial band aid to justify their behaviors."
bad,It's a great place to work when your supervisor gives you hours and your team does their jobs so you don't have to do it for them. The drinks are so easy to make and you can pick up the recipes in a heartbeat.
bad,Very stressful work environment and poor scheduling. The distribution of roles is uneven and there is bias in the work place. Also the store is very busy and constantly understaffed.
bad,make drinks as fast as you can and try to satisfy customers. My experience was great my co-workers were very loving and it felt like we were all a family.
bad,"depends on the person you're asking, some will say its fun others will tell you they hate it, if they don't burn you out they won't use you in the store, on top of impatient and highly disrespectful customers"
bad,"Worked 12+ hour days."
bad,"I don't have much to say besides working there was okay, until I got sick. I worked for the company for 8 years, I thought it was going to be my career. Things change."
bad,my location was extremely brutal between the entitled customers and the rude coworkers. I have heard that other locations have not had the same problems I experience I think it was management. Upper manager however goes out of their way for their employees and customers.
bad,"The tips are horrible, you are over worked and under paid. The only good benefit for working fo starbucks is they will pay for your college education. Which in my experience most people dont take advantage of."
bad,"Working for this company was stressful and the pay you received was minimal for the amount of work that was expected from you.   I was a shift supervisor and enjoyed the responsibility, but the amount of pressure and stress that is put on you everyday is wearing and draining."
bad,"My co-workers were nice, but too many of the customers were entitled and difficult to deal with. Emotionally it took a lot out of me to show up to work and deal with grumpy customers every day. That coupled with management that meant well, but ultimately didn't take their job too seriously made for a less than satisfactory employment experience. It wasn't all bad, but more often than not I was very unhappy working there"
bad,Typical corporate stuff. A great place for someone as young as I am to learn if you're willing to put in the stress and effort. Overall I wouldn't go back for a career. Just if I needed some cash as a last resort.
bad,"No matter the time of day, it is always super stressful and overbearing. The customers are usually very difficult and cranky, but there are some good ones."
bad,"I loved my customers and my team,  I spent my career her working hard, sacrificing time with my family, supporting my team and was passed over multiple times to move up in this company.  I sat back and watched under qualified individuals be promoted.  I watched one unqualified manager after another be placed in my store i ran the store while they made the money.  My store began to struggle and still does til this day.  I still have customers ask me to go back."
bad,I liked all my partners but the manger was horrible. She is so immature and childish. I did like when it was peak when its a crazy rush of people. I like going at a fast pace.
bad,"Starbucks is a very stressful environment.  I was a shift supervisor and I was not allowed to call off. The managers, I worked with were very unorganized. I had to be on call on my days off just in case someone called off. I was forced to be on the bar for 8 hours and when I told shift that my wrist was hurting the shift became upset with me and made me clean the floors. The customers are rude and the stress and the people are not worth the pay. I had such a bad experience working at Starbucks, I no longer buy Starbucks."
bad,"For the amount they pay the employees, its really not worth the stress when you can get paid way more with less stress with a different jobs. I do like the customer networking you can do when you work there, but other than that, it is super fast paste and intense work environment."
bad,"I have worked at 4 different locations, every store always has seemed to be poorly managed and short-staffed. Benefits for healthcare and schooling are great, however, hourly pay isn't that great."
bad,Working there I only earn £5.90 and that's for the next 3 years ..l the mangers and supervisors always slag off the other baristas and they give hours based on how much they like that person so if your not liked you get stupid 3 hour shifts but if you are you get 8 hours +
bad,"Great benefits, but not worth all of they stress pressure and unrealistic expectations managment sets for you (shift supervisors)."
bad,"Super disappointing that Starbucks raves about being a people first environment, but that does not show. You are required to cheat and fake numbers (IE offer free drinks to sell coffee beans, whatever free drinks the customer wants) but that hurts your P&L. The DMs are usually externals that probably interview well but have little to no people skills. The room for internal advancement from SM-DM is small. People never leave because theres very little accountability."
bad,Dont work here. Its very aesthetically pleasing but its not worth it. Just do it for he benefits but management is something starbucks doesnt care about. The 5 different managers and district managers dont care about their employees. all they care about is the money they are making.
bad,Management basically throws everyone under the bus. I previously worked at corporate stores and licensed stores and both were bad. At the licensed store the manager and Asm had No Sbux experience nor did they have Food Handlers. Corporate stores just want someone to promote whether you're ready or not. If you're making a certain amount they either push you up or push you out.
bad,"im just going to cut to the point. i'm not one to be picky, but this was the worst job i've ever had - and i worked there for 2 years. Not like i worked there for a month and said its horrible, no, 2 years. This place is equivalent to helI. Please do your mental, physical and emotional health a favour and don't work here. If you want to keep your sanity, don't work here. Just stay far away, thats all i have to say."
bad,"My manager was always sitting in the back on her phone, only really being helpful if we were slammed. I found it killed morale and many people did not t take the job seriously because she was not around.  And when I needed to change my schedule for my daughters school she said id have to wait three months for it to go into effect which made it pretty impossible to keep working there."
bad,"Starbucks is a great job for while I was in high school and college but once I had my college degree I needed something that could help pay my student loans. Unfortunately, they hired managers who were external hires and it is really hard when you can't rely on your boss to assist you when things get busy."
bad,"Starbucks puts a great face forward, and is a pretty good place to work as an hourly partner but burns out operators and management at an appalling pace.  No care for work/life balance for salaried individuals.  Many times sheer favoritism decides much of the selection process."
bad,"i didnt like working for starbucks. customers in theis area were disrepectful and would lie and cheat and steal. on top of that managemenat was terrible, shift leads absused there powers, kids got hurt, things fell apart from being really lazy and putting other employees in danger. terrible job id never go back."
bad,"The pay here is incredibly low!  Yes, Starbucks offers benefits, even to part-time employees, but I couldn't take advantage of them because I couldn't afford to have that much taken out of my paycheck.  I struggled to pay my bills every single month, even at full-time.  Any time the manager cut my hours a little, I couldn't afford to pay rent.  The only time you get raises is a yearly raise or a promotion, and those raises are negligible amounts.  I also think the pay is not high enough for the amount of stress the job has."
bad,"The day varies depending on start time and deployment for your shift. This is nice so that each day does not seem monotonous, however, certain positions are much more difficult than others and the same few people seem to be placed in the hard positions every shift. This stems from the push from higher ups to get good numbers, so those fastest and most efficient in these harder positions draw the short stick a lot. I learned to be flexible and to wear different hats at Starbucks. I have had several managers while at Starbucks and there is a disconnect here. Each manager has placed a strong emphasis on different aspects. For example, one was ALL about numbers, another was ALL about cleanliness, and another was ALL about avoiding confrontation. The store I am at is filled with burnt out partners. This does not make for a good work environment. The company has a good draw for new employees, such as part-time benefits and tuition reimbursement; however, partners, such as myself, are overworked and underpaid. Therefore, the retention is not good."
bad,"You do not get paid well as you are working very hard."
bad,"I've been completely overlooked and undervalued working here. For working so hard, my management team does not help out or treat us well. I would not recommend working at this location."
bad,"I think had I had different management it would have been a completely different experience. Every single person I knew complained to HR about our management and they never did anything. I ended up getting randomly written up for things that had been extremely exaggerated months after it had happened right after I asked for a transfer. You can't be transferred if you have at least 2 write ups. I had none and in one day had been written up twice, the day after I had requested a transfer because of the childish, highschool like management. I was not the only person this happened too. It became so difficult to work with this person I ended up having to quit and find other employment. Other than that I absolutely loved this job. The fast paced environment, and the amazing customer base. As well as the team I trained to work with me. If they could fix their internal management problems and actually listen to the employees when they complain it would be the best job ever. I was very disappointed that I couldn't make a career out of Starbucks, especially with as much work as I put into the job. If you find a store without the awful politics and manipulative and conniving management, do your best to stick with this job. It will pay off if you have a good team that actually looks for your success instead of being afraid you'll surpass them. I was also promised promotions that never happened even though my manager told me to come in off the clock to learn the job and I did so. Just look for a manager that has a heart."
bad,While I worked at Starbucks I made around a hundred drinks in the hour a majority of the time I worked the bar. I rung up an equal amount of customers while I was working the register. My store made an average amount of sales compared to other stores in the district. It took an average of one or two transactions to pay my salary for the hour out of the hundreds of customers we normally received at the store. I constantly felt understaffed at work and was not given as may hours as I would have liked and had to get a second job to pay rent. This was the case for all of my coworkers that did not live with their parents. The manager was required to cut hours by the corporate office based on computer algorithms. Often times they were miscalculated for lack of variables. Working for the company for over two years has made it very clear to me that Starbucks cares more about cutting the cost of operation and expansion of the business than it does paying its employees a salary that can maintain the cost of living.
bad,"Starbucks is a very demanding place to work. It is fast pace and stressful. It is rewarding due to some of the close customer relationships that you can build. It has some positive aspects to it, but also a lot of negatives. It is great if you have something in your life that takes priority and you want a little money on the side. It isn't worth it if you are only working at starbucks."
bad,"Since the minimum wage hike labour has been too tight, the work culture has become strained and unpleasant for everyone and we all work like dogs and are made to feel permanently inadequate."
bad,"Make sure you are a good fit for the stores and you'll have fun; even on days where you are miserable.  Be prepared to go home smelling like coffee and sugar.  The summers are not fun. If I was in college, this would have been a dope place for me to stay for a while--not ideal for those with families that depend on their salary or benefits."
bad,"Being a barista is fun! I have learned alot about coffees and their origin and lots of different ways coffees can be made. In my particular cafe, we are in a very small space in a mall and its like being in a fish bowl where every body can watch and see what you are doing! Sometimes it gets so busy your running around bumping into each other and its just crazy, then there are a few times when its slow, and your always in such a rush that when it does slow down, you don't know what to do with yourself When its time to close,it seems like that's the time everyone decides to go for coffee or caffeinated drink, so it all stars all over again!"
bad,"My years working for the company, I have seen many changes. In the beginning I thought it was a great job, you got benefits and worked with a diverse group of people and there was more self development. As the years proceeded I found that the work was increased and the demand for drive through times or the workload was increased and stretched with fewer people. The labor hours were decreased but the workload demand from the employees was increased.  At the end I felt stretched too thin, my raises didn't reflect the work I put in and overall coworkers stopped really caring about the company.  Management is sometimes hired outside of the company and there are so many issues with that because they do not understand how the company and environment works. Its a good job while you are in school but its not something you can realistically survive off of."
bad,"A typical day at Starbucks was very stressful. It was about getting the food and beverages made as fast as possible without making mistakes. There was no rest time, you were always on your feet."
bad,District manager was not very supportive and the company cycles through both employees and management often they treated employees poorly at times and spoke to them with serious lack of respect
bad,"Solida azienda in espansione nel nostro Paese."
bad,"Hours are good 35+"
bad,"I worked at Starbucks for 20 months, in 2 separate locations. The first was decent, except for the drug addicts and vagrants who made it an unpleasant and unsafe place to work. Our management did nothing to prevent or solve problems and played favorites when it came to scheduling. The second location was in a hospital, and it was one of the worst work experiences I've had in my life. It was busy nonstop, with some incredibly rude customers. Management insisted on assigning ridiculous, unnecessary busy work during peak hours. One manager was a casual racist. The same manager told me to shut up more than once. I wish I could reclaim the last year+ of my life."
bad,"Starbucks was probably one of the most unprofessional places I have ever worked, the managers along with various senior staff were incredibly rude, unprofessional and inconsiderate. I would never work there again or recommend it to anyone."
bad,"i enjoyed the customer service aspect, although the management was horrible. The drama between coworkers, and all was to much to handle. The flexibility was nice but everyday was a stressful day at work."
bad,I did not enjoy my time there. I was made to feel that the DM was territorial and he had favorites. I was overworked and was not supported in my efforts to try new things
bad,"Serve coffee, greet customers, the normal grind. Best part of the job is drinking the coffee. Hardest part of the job is being consistently under-staffed."
bad,"As a store manager there is no support. You are left to figure out the job and their expectations are unattainable. There is no work life balance and working 60 hours weeks. I got in trouble when I already worked a 12 hours day and didn't stay to cover a barista shift who called in sick. I was told that it is expected of me to work lots of over time.  "
bad,"Im sure there are well managed stores somewhere, I've just never personally seen one. It is a stepping stone. Don't get caught up in the politics or interwork relationships and you ill be fine."
bad,"I have a very biased review because I was treated quite poorly by the management at my location. I hated working at my location, but I am not sure if that is a reflection of the company culture or just my particular manager."
bad,"The management doesn't want to be involved with Starbucks.  We are licensed so that means we actually work for Harris Teeter, however, the management doesn't want to bother with Starbucks so they aren't very supportive of store needs to make things more efficient.  I've worked for Starbucks for over 6 years now and it's very different.  Corporate is much better."
bad,"The job involves a lot of physical work, and is a nice environment for anyone willing to work in it. The pay is decent, though varies a lot depending on where you live."
bad,Un-organized management that focuses solely on numbers and has un-realistic expectations. Claims to provide a culture of warmth and belongingness--although that was never experienced over the course of a year.
bad,"Overall, it's a fun job. Getting free drinks is a great perk. Management is constantly changing. Advancing within the company takes a lot of time. Workload is a lot for low pay."
bad,"I’ve worked at Starbucks for 2 years and I loved it at times but hated it most. This job is not for someone looking for an easy slow paced job (unless you work at a café only store). I pour my heart blood and soul into this place, bring in multiple regulars with my presence and work ethic. But In the end you feel depressed dried up and stuck there for the rest of your life until you get the courage to leave, the team there will typically shun you for leaving and essentially cut off all friendly ties because you don’t want to be apart of the “Starbucks cult mentality”"
bad,I learned alot of very helpful skills working at Starbucks but decided to leave because there was no room for advancment and at this point in my life im looking for a career.
bad,"Working with customers is awful, majority of the time they are unpleasant and rude. Middle aged people (men/women) have never been so rude to me, and made me feel like less of a human than working in this company. Paying baristas minimum wage for the type of service desired is completely ridiculous."
bad,"The training is clear, but that's as far as clarity goes. I am certain when decisions are made at corporate they are cohesive but by the time directives are communicated to the store level they have become opaque with conflicting timelines, focus, and execution."
bad,"Starbucks is a great place to work if you are all about the people. However most of us are about making money to survive, and Starbucks does not pay a livable wage. Management tends to hire from the outside instead of promoting from within, and is not always approachable when it comes to tough situations."
bad,"- Underpay for the amount of work required to fulfill job role "
bad,The company are selling out to franchises and with it their self respect and decency. I do not feel as looked after as I did when being part of the company and supervisor's wages have not been raised in at least 6 years. The job is easy enough as I have done it for so long which is why I am still currently working there until I find a job with more opportunities to step up the ladder.
bad,"stressful, no paid well, poor management, free breaks, no free lunch, very strict policies, dealing with homeless and drunk people, no security, only minus"
bad,"I worked there for 8 years, and the benefit are great, but it really makes you feel unappreciated when less qualified people are being picked for management positions over you. I was my store's longest standing shift supervisor AND I have a bachelor's degree in management, but they're promoting someone who's just plain bossy with an associates degree and someone else who's been with the company only a few months and doesn't have a degree for the same job. Even most of my own shift team didn't appreciate me....mornings vs nights, ya know? I was night shift. I just couldn't take it anymore, so I left."
bad,"I and most people I know have had awful experiences.  Long hours, no time off, short staffed, often untrained, or just bad managers who either breathe down your throat, or don't care at all.  Research the location, look at reviews.  how employees treat their customers is often a result of how the manager is."
bad,"Lots to be said, but here is the summary:"
bad,"Nowhere near enough training given, expected to pick everything up first time, some of the other staff were impatient and sometimes made unkind remarks. It was enjoyable when I knew what I was doing. Very flexible around personal life. Free drinks on shift and most customers were very nice to talk to. Sometimes only 10 hours between the end of one shift and the start of the next. Manager was not easy to get along with. Breaks are very short."
bad,"Starbucks is a fast pace work environment that pushes you to go go go. Your experience there is completely dependable on who your coworkers are and what your managements like. Unfortunately for me, the coworkers i had created a very hostile environment with passive aggressive comments. I use to really enjoy working here until management changed and everyone i work with became just rude. Now I dread waking up in the mornings at 4am to go to a job that i don't like being at with people who aren't even nice."
bad,"Great benefits, enjoyed meeting new people. Went through too many upper management changes. Most recent manager was great, but I did not receive the training that I was supposed to receive. The company values it's hourly employees far more than it's managers. My typical day was spent working as a barista and not enough time to manage the business. The company does not give enough hours to operate successfully without working the employees to the point of exhaustion. The best thing about this job was the people I worked with and the relationships with customers that I developed."
bad,"Was never a fan of the job, but even through that I tried my hardest every day. The management there just never seems to notice or care and when they do, they just try to utilize you rather than integrate you into a team where that pace would set the pace of the store."
bad,"They hype Starbucks jobs wayyy too much! Working here I thought it would be a great experience but it honestly sucks. You have annoying lazy shift supervisors who barely do their job and always on their phones any chance they get , but then try to be a hyprocite when it comes to regular baristas and what they "" should"" be doing. They count your pathetic little 10 min break before you can even sit down and breathe. They gossip and gossip! The only thing I can say good about the company is the wage but then it really doesn't even matter because they aren't scheduling you good hours. So I would say don't even waste your time honestly it's better to find a job paying you $12.50 and your getting more hours then working 15 hours a week for $14. Also the favoritism is way too much."
bad,"Barely above minimum wage and you are expected to fulfill all the duties of the store regardless of your specific role for the day. Each employee received less than full time, and because my location was staffing everyone had their hours cut. It is impossible to make a living working here."
bad,"At the time I accepted employment with Starbucks, it was just a job.  Then life got away from me and I needed it for longer than I expected.  Having been there for several years, here is my take away:"
bad,Trust me its just not worth your time and health to work at one. Way to much unnecessary stress. Customers act like they are entitled to treat you like your nothing. Coworkers tend to turn on each other because of the stress.
bad,"Not what i thought it would be like, but in the end i still learned something. Looking for hipsters and beatnicks and was left only alone on to find the same old story."
bad,Une entreprise ou le management et la qualité sont en déclin. C'est dommage.
bad,"The coworkers are very politically ahh caring, and I felt like I had to be perfect even when I was supposed to be “trained”. Overall it was kind of a bad experience"
bad,A typical day at Starbucks is very fast paced and stressful most days. The hardest part of my job is having to do other people's work and not getting paid enough for it. Starbucks is all about window times now which is taking away all the personal connections with each individual customer. The most enjoyable part of my job is the relationship I have with my coworkers. They are like family.
bad,"Although the benefits and freebies you get with working for Starbucks are great, it comes with a cost. Constant pressure to make sales on the employees to the point of harassment, walking into a stressful environment, and not finding any replacements for very sick baristas, forcing them to come to work sick and serve customers."
bad,"starbucks as a franchise seems to forget about its employees. rate of pay is minimum yet hours are over worked. Prices are way too high for location so often get the brunt of the customers feelings towards it. higher management seem to forget about their staff, offer no bonuses or even a pay rise at all."
bad,"When I started at Starbucks, it was a good culture, focused on coffee. Then, management changed everywhere from the stoe to regional to the CEO. We started getting less labor and more work, fewer partner and longer hours. We were forced to focus all our efforts on customer engagement, while simultaneously having to maintain the store and orders with less labor. The company went from coffee-centric, to Instagram obsessed."
bad,"I am of the opinion that Starbucks was a much nicer company to work for when McDonalds was trying to copy it rather than the other way around. Over the last year management at stores across the country has become increasingly focused on contradictory goals such as making a genuine and continuing connection with customers and making them feel at home, while also getting their orders received and out the door in under a minute. This is especially bad at drive-thru stores, where front of house customers are frequently neglected and made to wait behind drinks for the drive-thru simply because management cares about Drive-Thru numbers rather than front of house. The result is an overall poorer quality experience for the customer and a tense, frustrating environment as a worker where you know you can't put your best work forward due to time constraints and the goals being set for you are often impossible because of staffing issues. In some locations I have worked at baristas burn out incredibly quickly and either quit or stop caring within weeks of being hired, making the overall work environment feel hopeless."
bad,"As a job it was very easy to pick up, simple line work and repetitive simple tasking. Management was iffy and emotional. Shift leads were overworked and overstressed, store manager treated everyone like dirt while expecting to be respected and worshipped."
bad,"with this job yes you make more money but most time you not have help, never really shown on how to do your job, and disrespect on a daily if they follow half the stuff they say to you maybe the job wouldn't be so bad"
bad,"Fast paced environment"
bad,"For all the horn-tooting they do about helping the community and their employees, they pay low wages. Part-employees do get good benefits, but because of the low wages it is a large portion of your check."
bad,"Great part-time job. Great benefits if you have another job where you can actually make real money.  "
bad,"Prepare to be busy, busy, and more busy! This job is great for anyone with a strong ethic and a personable attitude. Product knowledge is key for this job. This job requires that you be present mentally, physically, and emotionally."
bad,This company is not very accommodating when it comes to work schedules. They believe because it's a work from home job you have to be available 24 hours a day. They can add extra hours to your schedule without prior notice.
bad,"Starbucks as a corporation has incredible values, unfortunately whether those values are actually lived out is very subject to which store you work at. This job can be a lot of fun, but also can be extremely stressful. Politics play a huge part in this job."
bad,"a typical day was different depending on who manager in charge was, there was no consistency in training or how store was ran day to day. There were clear favorites among the store management and it was clear in how people were doled out duties throughout the night"
bad,"Over the years I have worked for Starbucks I have seen the good and the bad. "
bad,"It's expected of you to work at least 50 hours with no guarantee of a bonus despite that being the ""pay back"" for 15+ hours of weekly overtime. The company draws untalented lazy individuals so it's very hard to build a good team. There is little support from the top down. They are very good about talking to make you feel better, but when it comes down to it the upper level management is very rarely going to ""get their hands dirty."" There are constant last minute changes regarding promos, and very minimal time to get any of it accomplished. When it comes to actual management about 10% of your paid time in a week is leading the store while the rest is just making coffee on the floor. I'm all for leading by example but a manager needs more time to try and run a multi-million dollar store. Given the high profits Starbucks makes and the large pay checks high level management makes I find it hard to believe we as a company cannot barely keep up with the general market. For pay Starbucks keeps it just barely above the average market pay scale. "
bad,"It is a fun, fairly simple job. Most locations have great regular customers and the relationships you can build with them are amazing. Management at my location is awful and many of my coworkers were extremely young and unmotivated. No opportunities to move up under that specific manager, but very possible in other locations."
bad,Working at Starbucks can be both fun and hard working.  Starbucks has a good healthcare program only to those who apply the 20 hours shift. Fast paced is a must.
bad,"Being a barista for Starbucks is a great job. You really learn how to work well with other people and it helps build an excellent work ethic. A typical day at Starbucks can be crazy, but the team and the environment make it fun. The only issue is that they do not pay their employees enough. Baristas work extremely hard and they do not get the pay they deserve. The job itself is fun, and there's something new to learn every day. I would love to be a barista again if they paid better."
bad,"Not the best job I've had, the experience has been less than admirable. I regularly work with people at the beginning of adult life. It has little to do with engineering but I've learned to work effectively with unskilled workers to accomplish the collective goal of providing a nurturing environment for our customers."
bad,"Smart, passionate people "
bad,"It puts you in mind of high school. Its terrible, management sucks. I think if people were hired who actually wanted to do they jobs it'd be great. But since thats not the case , AND management refuses to do what their supposed to then its bad."
bad,"This starbucks is located inside of the museum of science and industry so its full of people every single day. Very upbeat anf fast paced, but on inside with management and employees it was really messy and all over the place alot of the time. I was trained to work for starbucks/jazz cafe, but was moved around to different spots within the cafeteria. Managers were more of a distraction and had the worst attitudes. I felt like they came off a bit unprofessional at times."
bad,Every store is a different experience depending on the staff and manager. Some worse than others. Little room for growth after you have peaked. A lot of bad management resides in the company and they promote the undeserving partners. It was nice meeting new people everyday but there are a lot of bad customers that come with it. Huge labor cuts leave stores understaffed and very dirty.
bad,Good job if you have nobody else to support. Management really isn't that good because they play favorites. The hardest part of the job is probably learning how to properly craft the drinks.
bad,"Starbucks was a good company to work for as just as Barista. You didn't have to deal with much else other than your daily routine. Once I made it to a Shift Supervisor position, I realized there are a lot of flaws in the company. They teach the customers to complain and treat the employees horribly in order to get what they want. I.E.- Free Drinks, Food, Refunds, ect..."
bad,Managers get all the benefits while baristas deal with intricate orders and testy customers all day on their feet. Not enough incentive to actually care.
bad,"Execution of Reserve Training Manager program is highly contingent on training store manager. Your best option is to train yourself rigorously for eight weeks and supplement that by shadowing shift supervisors at one or more locations."
bad,"awful management "
bad,"Starbucks Australia is not owned by Starbucks, but the Withers group (7/11 etc)"
bad,"A great lively space to work with other co-staff when not being doggedly hounded for not attempting to upsell customers who come in and hand the server the specific amount of money needed to buy their coffee. "
bad,"I love Starbucks as a company. I really appreciate everything they do for the suppliers of their products. However, the company starts you out at minimum wage with little to no advancement opportunities. A company this large and successful should be able to at least pay a living wage to it's partners. If you can afford to be paid only $7.75 an hour for at least two years, it is a really fun environment. You get free drinks, plus a discount on food and coffee beans."
bad,"I started at Starbucks about 3 weeks ago, and I'm actually still working there while writing this review. However, I honestly don't know how much longer I'm going to stay, as I think they'll ask me to leave sooner or later."
bad,"A typical day starts of with a safe audit, emails, planning a daily deployment, counting deposits from day prior, and a placing orders."
bad,Fast paced environment where you get to be sure to start of peoples day with a good experience.   Meet new people and see regulars everyday.  Liked the management and coworkers
bad,"A heartless corporation that only things of basic employees as labor numbers and percentages. Corporate was the worst I have ever encountered, they acted very entitled and expected you to wait on them hand and foot as if they were coffee gods."
bad,High  employee turnover. Very strict management . Great people working and easy to get along with. i made alot of my friends working at Starbucks. Possible advancement
bad,"Being a Barista at Starbucks is a low paying, low benefit, entry level survival job that should just keep you alive until you can find something better. Hardly a living wage, and the 50 cent raise after six months is hardly gonna pay the rent in NYC.  Sometimes working the bar is fun."
bad,I love coffee and I love people so ideally I thought this would be the perfect job. I think coffee shops should be more accepting to everyone and have a more relaxed atmosphere.
bad,"Each day I learned something new. There was never a down time I enjoyed that. The job was very fast paced. I learned to how operate all the machines and appliances, how to make drinks and brew coffee, operate the commercial oven and dishwashing system. Being a Barista consist of so many duties some were to take orders, run the registers, make coffee and teas, make beverages, make foods, clean, stock and clean lobby as well as the store, etc. The co workers were more like family. The hardest part for me at first was getting use to wearing a timer on my apron. It kept me working at an extreme fast rate which I managed. I enjoyed the job overall I loved the duties as well as the people."
bad,When i initially started at Starbucks it was a fun and happy place to work i was extremely lucky to have the great opportunity of progressing further within the company. Since August last year we were taken over by a franchise company and from then the problems have occurred which has now given me the massive instinctive to find something with a bit more sociable hours and a new challenge for myself.
bad,The Manager at my store wasn't very interested in treating her employees like they mattered she wanted to get her bonuses and leave. She had no interest in creating a team or an environment that was prosperous.
bad,"A very top-down organization.  The best idea will usually not win.  New directions are not discussed and not viewed through the lens of those who are on the ground having to execute."
bad,"When I first started working at Starbucks, I loved it. Interacting with people and making drinks everyday was fun! The way we worked as a team made it almost like a game. I loved going to work."
bad,"El nivel de trabajo en equipo que se logra es único, formábamos excelente mancuerna uno con otro mientras nos divertíamos satisfaciendo las necesidades del cliente y de la empresa. "
bad,"it was a part time job with very good benefits, the full benefits at 20 hours a week was the perk that was needed for me at that time"
bad,"Days were extremely busy and ever changing. Everyday the expectations were changing and you had to be able to change direction constantly. I love the job and the customers, seing the same faces daily and I gained a great deal of management experience. My favorite part of the job was being on bar thru the morning rush. Everything moving so fast!"
bad,"Never take anything for granted."
bad,The company is great but retail can be cut throat between store manager and dm's. No one is on the same page. Everyone wants to be a start instead of just worrying about there store.
bad,"Their coffee tastes burned to me."
bad,"A typical day at work is fast pace, fun and pretty much the same heavy coffee drinkers. Great customers for the most part, clean atmosphere, very minimal challenges. The hardest part of the job is not smiling because customers are so happy and friendly. Management is ok but are not big on putting customers first. Room for rapid advancement is not really there in the eyes of the General Manager. Overall with benefits provided, Starbucks is a Decent Company."
bad,"Great place to work in when the Store Manager is a calm, efficient and collected person.  Great to deal with foreign tourists who always feel more welcomed when you speak to them in their own language.  The atmosphere is immediately relaxed."
bad,"Fun to work as a carhop. Lots of customer service. As a carhop you have a lot of tasks, but the pay is very good. "
bad,This is good to work if you have good store management and staff.
bad,"Typically I go to work early, help the morning shift and then i stock up on supplies for the rest of the day. Then I clean and wipe equipment down. I handle hot and cold beverages to hundreds of customers a day since it is a rest stop. Management was horrible they usually just relax while lower level baristas and associates do all the work."
bad,"Starbucks has changed as a company over the past couple of years. its not the same that it used to be. it used to be all about the customer and laidback, now they seem to be more concerned with sales and lowering their labor hours so the employees are overworked, understaffed and way underpaid during long 9 hour shifts."
bad,"The company capitalizes on the concept that ""We are not in the coffee business serving people, We are in the People business serving coffee."" This may not always be true. Sometimes, perhaps due to the fast-paced demands of rush hours, we really just are serving coffee instead of socializing with customers. Though the benefits and pay are competitive compared to other fast food chains, working at Starbucks for almost three years has encouraged me to seek other opportunities because I am feeling stagnant; I'm reading for new opportunities. Promotions are hard to come by at Starbucks and many times offers for such never actualize. Further, the incentive to accept promotions aren't high unless you are lucky enough to be promoted to managerial positions. The customers are always a joy when down time allows interaction."
bad,Great environment but very under paid for amount of work and responsibilities
bad,"A typical day at my Starbucks store is very stressful. About 50% of the time someone calls in sick/not coming in at all everyday. Customers are always rude and seem to never be satisfied despite the fact that there is three partners on the floor during rush hour when normally there is five to six partners. The hardest part of my job is just trying not to show that I am utterly frustrated with everyone and everything since most partners don't care to learn to make beverages. They would rather stick to the register where they can do the most minimal amount of work possible. This all true in about every store I have worked at. Unreliable partners and unforgiving customers. I've had enough of working my neck off to keep the store daily duties completed and motivate new partners, it just seems like everyone is there just for a check & benefits and not because we are a team and all passionate about providing customer service."
bad,- good place to work as starter but not for life
bad,Management is very lacking in every way
bad,"The only thing they keeps me at this job are my partners.   Other than that  your over worked, upper management is awful and a bunch of butt kissers.  Seriously,  I understand the customers come first but not at my expense.   I'm supossed to just sit and bite my tounge when I'm called the N word because the customer is always right."
bad,"Expect this to be one stepping stool. That's always how I've thought of Starbucks and that's what I've used it for. When I started in NC I was making $9.36. I moved back to a big city (Chicago) and b/c of my Starbucks background, I was able to get a way better barista gig for a REAL coffee shop that uses manual machines. was trained to b"
bad,"At the location I was hired at, I was promised a shift supervisor position. During training I excelled through barista training, and the Store Manager started to slowly put me through shift supervisory trainin. After a while, the same Store Manager started to cut my hours, stopped training me as a supervisor, and started looking the other way when other employees would act unaccordingly."
bad,"With 8+ years of management experience, I was treated like a complete outsider at this company. I was treated by management and district management like I was a complete failure. I would go to my car and just cry on my breaks because I didn’t know what I was doing wrong to receive the kind of treatment I did. I was told by upper management that I was not fulfilling the role I was hired for, but when I would ask why, they would have no answer for me. I left as soon as I got the chance. Very clicky environment and poor treatment of anyone new."
bad,I only worked there for around 3 months and had over 5 different managers. The people I worked with weren't that friendly and management was the worst.
bad,we never get the staffing we need and yet we get treated like we just sit on our thumbs all day. the only good part about working their are my co-workers and even then management is treating them all so bad that their all leaving too.
bad,"Although my experience at this current location, wasn't the best. I know of several locations within the district a well a nationwide, where employees enjoyed there work environment. The advancements were available and the management support was as well. Unfortunately I was only able to experience a sense of belonging while helping out at another location."
bad,"Horrible management."
bad,"The company doesn't want to pay for any more labor than necessary, so any time someone calls out sick there will be implicit expectations of people to come in on days off or extend hours on an existing shift. Seems like they rely on dedication built on the friendship between you and your coworkers rather than financial compensation for time and effort. Upper management has no idea what goes on in a store day to day. Unless the store manager really cares, most stores will be literally disgusting in the back of house."
bad,"Your job title is barista but your responsibilities are that of a janitor, a security guard, google maps and more. Never worth $15/hr and it’s even worse for supervisors."
bad,"It is a good place to work while you are trying to go to school, but if you need something with more stability or more than 20 to 25 hours it will not be a good fit. The best part of the job is coworkers because we are like a family, but there are a lot of politics and management issues."
bad,"Sooo at first youll love it, the culture the friendliness the helpfulness, and then youll see how hard it is to be heard out. This company as many as others has standards and rules and ways they want things done regardless if there is faster, easier, moreover better to do them and if you let you store manager know theyll act as if they hear you out and do what they want anyways. Have worked at 6 different locations and every store is different as well !"
bad,"The work and store was fine but some of the coworkers were not. Felt like highschool and the store needed an experienced adult because people were cheating and exploiting the system as they seen fit. Many people quit and the only people who stayed were the kind of people who kept their head down and never questioned a thing and were willing to shoulder 3 jobs if it came down to it, which it regularly did. The main store did nothing for snyone. Corporate did nothing for no one."
bad,"When I first started at Starbucks, I loved it. It's fun to make drinks and get to know other partners. But after only 6 months, I'm so burned out. Corporate cuts hours often, so there are never enough partners working at once to take care of customers and the atore the way they need to be. My store manager is amazing, but my district manager is awful and doesn't understand how hard baristas work, and she doesn't care to make our lives a little easier. We are always made to feel like we are in the wrong, wether we stick to Starbucks policy or cater to every demand of the customer. It's just not worth it."
bad,I mostly enjoyed my time at Starbucks before all the PC culture madness came along. I'm strong opposed to the path and direction Starbucks has gone down with all the PC culture madness
bad,"I got the job at Starbucks at the New Stanton travel plaza. The pay was great and my paychecks always paid the bills. The management was not organized at all due to not helping when needed, not showing up, and continuously messing up the work schedule. A typical day would be ringing on the cash register and making drinks with the help of one other Barista. I loved the job but the management wasn’t organized enough for me to stay."
bad,A typical work day involves working with a sense of urgency while assisting customers. It can be extremely stressful. Management can be chaotic. Fellow partners is the best part.
bad,"When I say not so great hours, i mean this was one of those places that wanted you in 4 or 5 times a week for really short shifts. I am talking 4 or 5 times a week for 25 hours or less in the week. Working for them even as a team lead I was making less then my friend who was on welfare.i really loved my coworkers and the manager was nice ...but was just so  mad."
bad,"Maybe it’s because I was at a keyosk in a Safway but omg, I worked there for maybe 3 months, had maybe 4 days off there was so much wrong with organization and much more."
bad,"your fate relies on your district manager.HR is a puppet. More about lobbying. Very small room to grow. you will never get 40 hours of work, somehow you will end up doing minimum 45 hours."
bad,Working for the company it's self is really great lots of resources and benefits. The management at this location how ever was nice at first but after awhile had a attitude problem! Wasn't help full and very stuck up. I quit before I could transfer
bad,"The company has high turn over so that I was constantly working with new people, which made it harder to develop good relationships with my coworkers. The work is very team oriented which can be a great thing as long as everyone is on the same team. The location I was at did not guarantee hours for benefits so many baristas had to float around town to find the hours they needed rather than be able to stay at their home store."
bad,"Starbucks as a brand is great. They do “offer” a lot of perks, but .... there is always ways around being eligible for them. The benefits for part time are only available if you get 20 hours per week. Most baristas hit right around or under it. The tuition reimbursement is useless unless you can afford to pay up front and then get the money back at the end of the semester. They do provide free lunch, lots of drinks while working, and free bags of coffee."
bad,"Most of the managers that work at Starbucks, do not care about the people that work for them which led to an extremely high employee turnover as people were quitting very frequently. However, the majority of the regular baristas were great people who were treated poorly by management."
bad,"Arbeit ist einfach, Gehalt eher mickrigen aber gute Aufstiegschancen. Nicht auf Dauer geeignet."
bad,"Just no. It's true that you can't afford to be picky when you need a job, but if you have options, please keep looking. You are not paid a living wage and they expect perfection. It is not worth it."
bad,"Fast paced"
bad,"My previous job experience was at a Starbucks franchise/store location, and I loved it! I was excited to switch to work at a corporate location. The 30% discount, extra room, and Starbucks knowledge seemed great! Starting in I received great training, though I had prior knowledge on bar/all areas. After a couple days, it seemed like my trainer turned on me, and reallyyyy did not like me. I am a very quiet and shy person when I start in a new place. For the 4 months I worked at corporate, I did not feel welcome at all! There was even a girl who started after me that fit in right away, AND was put on bar--with no prior experience--more often than I was, with my experience. She was invited out to outside work activities, involved in conversations during work, but I was not included in either. If you are very sociable and bubbly off the bat, you will likely fit in. I am hoping not all Starbuck's management is as terrible as mine was. I called in sick ONCE during my 4 months, and was made to feel like I was absolutely failing them, though they always had at least 4-7 other workers there. My store manager was terrible and never around too, often using a guilt trip to make you do things or feel bad. Luckily, I was offered a Co-Lead job at a franchised store and was able to get out of there. Towards the end of my days at corporate, I was basically crying during each shift! I personally wouldn't work at another corporate store for fear that the management and environment would be like I experienced. However, franchise/in store Starbucks are super fun and amazing to work at!"
bad,"Starbucks culture is disgusting. No matter how well of a job you do, managers don’t care and the treatment from some customers really take a toll on your mental health. A lot is expected from partners and there is never any real recognition. It can sometimes be a fun place to work if you enjoy coffee and you have cool coworkers. Starbucks has created a work environment where customers feel entitled to treat partners like garbage and they get away with it because Starbucks policy allows it. The benefits are really nice though, which is why most partners stay for so long."
bad,Hours were not guaranteed each week and tips were not distributed evevenly. The shift supervisors were very condescending and rude to co workers and customers
bad,"I’m going to try to list the events that took place in chronological order."
bad,"Cons are long hours, no work life balance, constant change, new products are never in stock. Pros are great benefits, free coffee, free drinks while working, free food item while working, mandatory breaks."
bad,"I was blind sided badly by upper management and humiliated in front of customers that I had served for over seven years. Disillusioned by the words not being followed through with their actions. Promising support and then leaving me hanging. My teams and my customers were my passion and the best part of my days. I never felt like i was working, it was like welcoming people into my home"
bad,I really don’t want to take the time to do this for this company.  I’m disappointed in them and what they say they represent. I don’t have anything nice to say so I rather not say anything at all.
bad,"Really gone downhill since they made a few bad business decisions. Swept under the carpet, then the Baristas paid the price. Sold their soul to Nestle for $7.25bn."
bad,"This job was easy, satisfying, and fun to do, except for the amount of unprofessionalism through management, clique like work place, and it may have just been the location, but overall I liked the job. Couldn't do it anymore though."
bad,"Group I was in had few ""results driven"" personalities and mostly ""relationship driven"" personality types. This created a subculture of extreme indirectness.  The group lacked a balance."
bad,The coworkers you have will make the day much more enjoyable than it should. Disillusioned and ill-informed district managers pass down absurd work load demands that are all but impossible to meet. This leads to ridiculously stressful work. Workload for a shift supervisor is ridiculous. You are literally a store manager without the pay. Pay is laughably low. Benefits if you willing to stay that long are great though.
bad,I have loved working for this company but I am burnt out. The atmosphere from other partners and customers is high stress. I thought I could handle it while finishing school but I no longer can.
bad,"Look for a less busy location, less busy the more time to train on each section then if you want in 6 months you can transfer. You be able have to deal with terrible management, high school drama-like-cliquey-ness coworkers, entitled customers. It is a quick pace environment and can be high stress. Also recommend for people who have big personalities, if you are on the introvert side it might be hard bc management expects you to have an eneegetic attidude at all times"
bad,"It is a fun place to work, but over time it does get boring. Management needed working on as shifts would appear out of nowhere. There was no advancements or work benefits except 30% off discount on food in Starbucks"
bad,"There are multiple placements for a Barista: customer support (restock, customer area, do everything else), make drinks (drive-thru, cafe, or cold bar), front (cafe orders), drive thru receive (in the window), drive-thru order (talk to the customer on the headset), and sometimes warming (for food). Later in the day, drive-thru becomes one person and warming is delegated to customer support/drive-thru/front. Mobile orders also do come in through cafe, so it makes things confusing sometimes, especially when solo-barring."
bad,"Entry training is great, & entry pay is competitive.  However, store manag-ement is 180, & if youre not well versed in their specific brand of ""coffee culture"" you're outcast.  In a store down for 10+ years I raised profit 11%, employee retention 80% cust satisfaction 50% and passed inspections nvr passed before, I was constantly scolded for not hitting blanket goals, the stress was so much medical issues where caused"
bad,"I got in with a great group of people and we all became a sort of work-family. New management stepped in at multiple levels and made sweeping changes that increased our suffering and resulted in the highest turnover rate my store had ever seen. What was once a place I was proud to work at became a place I despised, and not just because of the physical labor or constant customer abuse. All of those things were tolerable when we had a kinship with the management; they understood that we were human beings and allowed us to make mistakes to later grow from, allowed us to have flexible availability and take enough sick time to actually get better. New management made it clear that we were not humans in their eyes, and they could care less about us. I personally no longer support this company as a whole because of my experience there."
bad,"Straightforward job, nice people and plenty of opportunities to grow in the company if you wish to. I was able ot relocate from Birmingham to York to help support myself during my studies. There was plenty of flexibility in the hours i worked."
bad,"They will play mind games, mess with your schedule, and your union representative will get payed for doing nothing. The benefits, however, were good. If you are in school, forget flexibility."
bad,this company offered opportunities to grow but they weren't feasible without years of constant dedication to an extremely stressful environment with minimal compensation.
bad,Benefits are great! Overall pay is way too low. Full time isn’t usually option. Some busier stores you are able to get close to full time.  Corporate does not understand the physical demands of job. They want way more than what is humanly possible. If you are in school or a wife  with kids only wanting few hrs And benefits it is a good place for you.
bad,"When the company implemented its ""Everyone is a Customer"" policy, homeless and drug addicts started taking over the restrooms and lounge areas. The company is now placing sharps containers for heroin needles in its bathrooms. This is creating an environment that is unsafe for both company employees and customers. This company has seen its peak and is on its way downhill. Who knows when it will hit rock bottom?"
bad,"This job allows you to have money and benefits with no life experience. Also, you can get these benefits while having a life outside of Starbucks due to benefits being offered at 20 hr a week employees. However, the culture is so robotic that it’s impossible to feel like anything other than a small piece of a giant machine."
bad,"My manager scheduled me 9+ days in a row 3 different times in less than 4 months. We had two sit down meetings about why that was inappropriate. I almost lost my internship with the medical practice I wanted to work at once I graduated from college. Corporate did not even reach out to me when I quit citing this continued issue as the only reason why. The benefits were fantastic, but it was clear that the store and district management didn’t care that they were abusing a cancer survivor who was trying to get back into their life. My max availability was 25 hours a week yet I averaged 32. I told my manager I needed a fixed schedule multiple times, yet she did nothing to accommodate me. When I tried to change my availability to force her hand, she threatened to cut my hours so low I would lose the educational benefits. Again I reported all this to district management and HR before I quit. I invited them to call me and discuss what the issue was and possibly how they could better protect their employees from abusive management tactics such as this. All I got was radio silence. I tried transferring to a new store, I had zero write ups so it should have been a breeze. The manager at the store I wished to transfer to spent our whole meeting complaining about how corporate treats cafe stores. This is a good company to work for as long as you don’t intend to stay with them. Use your time to get the ASU discount and tuition reimbursement, but get out. They don’t care about you as an employee. If you get a bad manager, corporate will not listen to you. They will not support you. They will"
bad,"sucked a lot, watched good employees get fired for things that management did, huge amount of lying between managers and staff, were both racist and ableist to employees, were racist, homophobic and transphobic to customers"
bad,"I I have worked for Starbucks over a year. No review, no raise... I worked for the insurance, but they don’t pay enough for the better insurance without working full-time as a manager. Part time employees can only afford a middle tier insurance. This is their gimmick to hire responsible adults. The rest are crash out of school and call in a lot. Not worth the stress."
bad,"Starbucks is an amazing company to work for. They have open minded views and they have great benefits. However it is a VERY HIGH STRESS job yet the pay for baristas (new and even WITH EXPERIENCE) is only $9 an hour. Be prepared to be worked to the verge of pure exhaustion. The management is meh in some areas but overall gets an OKAY rating from me. Sometimes it’s VERY hard to keep a positive outlook when you’re paid so little for the amount of work you do I.e having to work an 8 person floor with just 4-5 people, so essentially you’re stuck doing the work of those missing people and running around like a chicken with its head cut off. But while exhausting, Starbucks does truly care about its employees so if you can get past the exhaustion and customers that complain about little things then go for it!"
bad,"The company and corporate are excellent, by and large, the problem with working at Starbucks, is usually the people you work with."
bad,"Hit or miss, depends on the managements, which most of the time is demanding and expects too much for minimum wage paychecks"
bad,This was a good job but not for long term. I recommend this job as a starter job. Such as a college student because of the benefits however this is a very stressful high paced job I wouldn’t recommend long-term. Additionally there is not a lot of room to grow or move up.
bad,"I’ve been with Starbucks for 4 years, and have been a shift for over a year. Starbucks is worth it if you have a manager that actually knows what he/she is doing. If they don’t, don’t bother becoming a shift. The amount of work you do for such little pay is ridiculous."
bad,"HMS HOST travel plaza's are always stressful and management doesn't help much. Alot of the pressure falls to the employee's and if they slip up on tasks that fall outside their normal duties, they are still penalized."
bad,"I worked at Pino's Starbucks for three years as a barista and offered as much of my time as I could. I enjoyed some of it, but it was a source of a great amount of stress. I went through two manager changes, and both times the other management within Pino's refused to aid us in the transition. They are also quite open with sharing whether or not a person was written up and have caused a great deal of conflict between between many of my co-workers. A few people in management went as far as to tell co-workers of mine that I was ""lazy"" or ""incompetent"" and that I had been written up for that previously. My write up was not due to my work ethic but rather because of a conflict that resulted from my immaturity. "
bad,"-Every Starbucks store is different. Although, the goal is to have pristine customer service, products, sales and general store upkeep it can be quite difficult for a single store to have every single one of these qualities."
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job was working with cool people who grew to be real friends.  Typical days are hectic and stressful. Starbucks has really awesome benefits but the pay is not good for adults trying to pay bills.
bad,if you want to work at starbucks be prepared to be poorly trained and then thrown on the floor to fend for yourself while customers yell at you for going too slow.
bad,"As a manager, they require you to be available at all times. It would not bother me as much if it was just my operation, but they pressure you to sign up to help out other stores, attend conference calls/huddles (unscheduled), complete hiring events, community service, various developmental programs outside the store, training of staff, host weekly shift huddles, attend store manager huddles, do coffee tastings, business analysis...(i can keep going) THEN also be on the floor and present and in production for both peak periods (2 hours x 2 dayparts). Once again, PLUS running the regular operations like scheduling, payroll, interviews, orders, partner development, inventory counts etc...The work is layered on without consideration of a managers personal time. You are expected to drop everything and respond to phone calls at ANYTIME of the day. And i mean ANY. This is coming from NY Metro. I work 5 days a week for 10-12 hours and respond to calls, texts and emails on other 2 days off. If they expect that kind of “shop owners” commitment, they need to offer an above market salary."
bad,"Was working as a contractor as help desk analyst and there are no raises . Maybe worth it if you were a partner but as a contractor no, just do you contract and get out"
bad,The managers mood is heavily influential to the morale of the partners. Customers tend to be great to serve but some customers as with any similar job are ready to ruin your day.
bad,"It's a good part time job if you are in college looking for your coffee fix and to earn a bit. The wages aren't great if it is your first job, they literally pay minimum. "
bad,The only reason I worked as long as I did was for the medical benefits and 401k. But they do not offer overtime and paying for medical and 401k half of my check was taken after deductions. I was never scheduled over 30 hours and got the 2 1/2 years I work there I received 2 raises of .10 and all the extra effort I put into my job went unrecognised and management always said they did not have the ability to give partners raises.
bad,"Estuve muy agusto allí, con buena compañía y buen gerente."
bad,"Besides having people with very specific and long drinks it was a small space to work in. Manager was biased to who he liked and would alienate who he didn't like. "
bad,I just don't want to work here for a long time. I just want to be able to grow in a different environment. Very fast-paced. It is nice for a college job. I just don't see myself being here longer than I already am.
bad,"It's a mix of high school and college students that do not care about work ethic and managers in their forties that are hard-pressed to make deadlines and fiscal goals. "
bad,It is very fast paced and stressful not a great first job for some people. Manager sometimes stresses you out even more and expects you to come even if it is snowing outside and it’s dangerous to drive
bad,"A typical day at starbucks is coming into work and seeing where you’re deployed for the day. You can’t move from that position supposedly. Not to help out your partners, not for customers or even yourself. Starbucks is what I like to call the mcdonald’s of coffee. The management sucks 80% of the time. Especially the one I worked for."
bad,"Starbucks absolutely sucks the life out of you. The customers verbally abuse you and your job is threatened over a misunderstanding from their end no matter how many times you offer to fix a problem or explain it. Then the mangers also verbally abuse you and make you feel stupid because the customer thinks you're stupid.  There is always gossip spread through the baristas, supervisors, and even the store manger him/herself. A very toxic work environment with no coaching when mistakes are made, only belittling."
bad,"Ive worked for Starbucks for a few years now as a shift supervisor. I wish the job was all about making coffee and talking to people, but unfortunately that is not the case. Corporate and high ups give you impossible tasks to do during the day to day but no adequate staffing to do the cleaning and organization they require. District managers will show up to review the store and show no empathy or understanding if things aren't going as they think it should be. Starbucks likes to preach about how they give employees good benefits and pay but you make minimum wage as a barista and $2 above minimum as a shift. The only benefits you really see is healthcare but you have to work at least 20 hours a week for that and managers don't always schedule you for those hours."
bad,"It was a good first job for me,I just wouldn't go back.  A typical day at work is constantly moving and on your feet. Got to have good memory because their is a lot of drinks to remember."
bad,"The environment was very stressful. Not only did we have to deal with rude customers, but we also had to deal with constant complaining from the workers. Nothing was eve good enough for them and the manager was always calling off sick or didn't know what she was doing. the times were always off or didn't make sense for the time of day. Workers who had been working there for Five plus years would complain more than new people which would put even more strain on the connections we tried to make."
bad,"overworked and understaffed, unorganized and underpaid"
bad,"This is a good place to work if you can handle fast-paced, high stress environments. I enjoy getting to try coffees and pastries. It is not fun to work drive-thru at all, especially if you have to do window and take orders at the same time. I couldn't do it. It is AWFUL when all of these entitled, rude people have crazy complicated drink orders with modifications that are absurd. We are treated unfairly by customers who get mad and they are about 99.99% in the wrong. Starbucks should either stop coming out with SO many extra drinks (it is rough on baristas) or make it so that people cannot make that many modifications. One time I had to remake the same drink 5 times for this one woman because she was that picky. It's absurd. Also, Starbucks is confusing for normal people to follow, and I find that most customers do not actually know what they want nor what they are ordering, so this creates confusion and then they blame US for THEIR mistakes. My manager did not always follow the correct rules."
bad,"Thankless job from both customers and superiors. Long learning curve that gets interrupted by customers being upset that you're taking too long. Working in fast food sucks overall, but Starbucks customers don't think they're indulging in fast food, so they treat you even worse."
bad,"I was working in a store where the manager left within 8-12 months of me being hired and took about three shift supervisors with her. Due to staff shortages and not having a manager we received managers who were working multiple stores until we got a full time manager who had never worked in food service and decided to change everything. We were often short staffed even when we had too many staff members. They cut hours and force employees to come in on ALL holidays and snow days as well as refuse to let staff members close the store during dangerous snow days when roads are closed. Overall, I enjoyed the customers in the area but the store and district managers appeared to have zero compassion for their employees."
bad,"Worked solely as a closing Shift. Company changed significantly from when I was first hired to when I quit. Loved the original crew I was hired with, but this is a job, not a career. They all left shortly after I got the rhythm of the workplace.   "
bad,"The company overall is wonderful with most of their benefits, though the pay is not enough for the hardships you endure. I switched stores three times, the first time was due to training conflicts with a paid trainer not having patience, the second was to relocate down the street, where I originally interviewed, and now I moved to another state and relocated to another store. Overall, the management and team can make or break your experience."
bad,Management tries to brainwash people into their culture while not at all trying to compensate for the labor and general attitude towards their workers. The pay is sub-par to say the least and your work is hardly rewarded. The situation mostly varies on district and district manager: I've worked at two districts the first one was doable and the second actual torment. It's a good first job for highschoolers and college students but eventually doesn't hold up to expectations of such a renown company.
bad,I worked at 14 different stores and there was always a bully. And the management did nothing about it. Someone was always giving me dirty looks or talking badly about me.
bad,"While working for Starbucks I learned a lot about customer service and teamwork. The managers were very hands off and apathetic. That made it hard to be a shift supervisor while being unsupported in that role. The managers were hardly ever there which left day to day operations to the shift in a way that made it a ""learn as you go"", unstructured environment. At the corporate level, there were routines and practices that were great tools to use to run/ grow business. If and ONLY if they were adhered to. I remember the best days were when my manager was not there at all. After becoming a shift lead, it is impossible to be promoted from within unless you meet their ridiculous standard. Managers and supervisors are overworked and under paid. All in all it is a great gig for those who are younger, in school, or seeking part time. I would never recommend this job to anyone who cares about their work or looking for opportunities form within. Howard Schultz's mission statement shows it's hypocrisy on the ground level, with no employee accountability and a general attitude from Baristas that says ""I don't care about the work I am doing and I am not going to hide it."" I love the friends I made, the experiences I had, but all in all, I will never go back."
bad,"So many stores means plenty of variation between employee experience. If you are blessed with a good store manager your experience will be much better. "
bad,"Good seniors, but work culture can be Improved. Okay psolme there, can learn more, can be improved work culture. Can go for more courses and work advancement"
bad,"It was okay i guess, it was very high paced and not really my vibe of a mellow workplace. i learned that the customer is always right. Hardest part of the job was remembering how to make specific drinks. I enjoyed that i smelled like coffee when i get home."
bad,"The company is great if you are a barista.  Benefits are awesome!  However as a Store Manager, you are over worked. action plans on top on action plans on top of actions.  Work life balance is non-existent.  You go home feeling like nothing was accomplished.  You are required to work on the floor 30-35 hours a week which doesn't give you much time to do anything.  If you do accomplish something, it's always on your own time.  You are putting in 60-65 hours."
bad,"Management are crazy rude, they are not an accommodating employer and I didn't enjoy my time there. They definitely pick favourites and wanted to fire me because I was in the HOSPITAL."
bad,i personally fell that starbucks has helped me succeed within the past but however i have seen other jobs that may find me interesting and with that ill pass
bad,"Management was horrible, messing up scheduling and not fixing mistakes. The culture of employees was good across peers, but management was separate and didn't seem to care about the individual unless it benefitted them. I resigned because the pay was low and it wasn't worth my time while I was in school and my manager held off promoting me for months while I was running shifts and training new employees. "
bad,"Good benefits, (free coffee, education advancement, etc)"
bad,"Typical day was to come in and set up pastry case and get coffee started brewing.  Managers would come in later and disappear into the back during the morning rush.  We baristas would joke with each other and laugh and have a good time, however our manager didn't like us doing this and insisted that we stop and not talk or laugh unless it was with customers.  The hardest part of the day were the peek hour rushes."
bad,"I loved the customers and the regulars that came to my store, they always had a smile on their face as we were both the mutual highlights of each others day. Unfortunately, the management was very disorganized and quite overbearing at times. They believed more in intimidation rather than rehabilitation if people weren't doing their jobs properly. I no longer work for the company because last week, 4 district managers called a last-minute store meeting with about 4 hours notice. They informed us they would be closing the store, effective immediately. We were given the option to either transfer to another store, or separate from the company. None of the options were accessible to me, so I decided to separate."
bad,loosely managed and poor oversight across many different locations. workplace culture was thready at best and downright bad at its worst. Most enjoyable part of the job was the connections made with partners and customers. The hardest part of the job was dealing with poor management and the cyclical nature of it.
bad,"The environment is fast paced and stressful due to people not liking to wait more than 5 minutes for a drink. The benefits are not bad and it works with school schedules, thats just about all the pros to it. I would personally not recommend making a career out of Starbucks because connecting with customers is great but the job itself is very repetitive and unfulfilling at times. If you're not a student I fail to see why you would work at Starbucks at all, when there are similar but better paying jobs such as waiter and bartender. Also, short breaks and the work space is small so expect to bump into people a lot."
bad,I started looking for a new job almost immediately. This place was a nightmare. The most enjoyable part of the job was the days I didn't have to work. I definitely wouldn't recommend.
bad,"I would recommend Starbucks. The job was only good when everyone worked as a team player. In my experience management did their own thing and rarely helped during rushes. "
bad,"I worked at an extremely busy local Starbuck for 2 years while at community college. The place was constantly understaffed, we were always running out of things because the managers couldn't get their orders right, and supervisors would give their favorite employees all of the easy tasks."
bad,"Due to the fact that Starbucks' are kind of run like franchises, there is a huge discrepancy in both the quality of work and the competence of management between each store. Additionally the vetting process both for hiring and promotion is questionable and often times results in poor employee hiring, causing heavy turnover and a genuine lack of job enjoyment."
bad,"I learned a lot about coffee and human interaction as a whole, the management was poor because we kept changing them. The hours were poor but the job was a lot of fun I just didn't like the people at my store."
bad,"Not the best place to work. I enjoyed the fast paced days, and the benefits. But neither were worth the aggravation of undertrained, young co workers with little to no work experience and having to rely on them to do your job properly."
bad,"The location where I worked was mismanaged and baristas were frequently expected to work off the clock, sometimes for hours. It was not uncommon for managers to come by in street clothes and do stocking or accounting work without being compensated."
bad,"- Reactionary and hyper-political with a lot of ""optical spin"" between each level of management"
bad,"Good job to start out but not a place to get comfortable. Learn a lot about coffee. Hours can vary drastically. Culture is welcoming and teamwork, although some coworkers are anything but the sort. All in all, a decent first job but could stagnate there if not careful."
bad,"Work days were usually busy and stressful. Customers take their coffee very seriously, and I often got yelled at and berated for simple mistakes. On several occasions I hate to clean up urine or vomit because my managers didn't think we needed to call someone to professionally clean it. For the most part I enjoyed the people I worked with. I had a manager on one occasion force me into a confrontational situation with another that I had repeatedly told her I wasn't comfortable with at that time. Everything was about speed. The company constantly comes out with new drinks and recipes that are extensive and time consuming while also expecting partners to connect well with customers and produce products quickly."
bad,"Overall, decent. Pay isn't great, not much room for advancement due to bias management. Customer relationships formed through the company are rewarding."
bad,"It was hard to effectively work as a great team because the communication wasn't there. In order to work together and be efficient it's imperative that everyone is on the same page. We should care about each other's progress and well being at the job, or else it is hard to maintain productivity at a high level."
bad,"Did not like."
bad,"If you want to move up in the company you only have three options, ship supervisor, assistant manager, or manager.  other then that it is very hard to move to any corporate position.  Take it for what it is, a job that you go into and work for solid 4-8 hours at a time and get paid 9.50 an hour.  no more no less"
bad,"To work here, I suggest learning the drink recipes like it is the back of your hand. Memorization is very needed for the barista position. "
bad,"The job requires a lot of attention and their training is fairly stressful without really learning what to do. It is assumed you just know what to do at all times. Also, not a diverse workplace."
bad,"This company ( particularly this location) has bad management. They seem to dwell on the little things instead of the important stuff. the store manager is very unprofessional, leaves confidential paperwork just laying around and plays favoritism."
bad,"Health insurance, free coffee, etc., were nice, but the labor policy was awful. Corporate has chipped away at allowable labor hours so that you are running on a skeleton crew at all times- and that is incredibly stressful."
bad,"In place of benefits, the company offers college assistance that does not benefit every college students employed. Also not worth working a job that is not tax deductible."
bad,"Working in Starbucks taught me many management skills, it especially taught me to deploy the right person in the right place, depending on their skills and potentials, to be able to do that, it was key to really know my team. Team-work, ethics and commitment of my team were very important."
bad,i would never recommend this job out.this place has no culture to grasp. management was the worst i have ever encountered in any of my past job experience.
bad,"Starbucks is a good company to work for in that they do provide a range of benefit options and some nice incentives, if you qualify. However, hourly pay is ridiculously low and is not compensated according to the work load per store, but rather on the region."
bad,"Work place culture is a little getting used to, the hardest part of the job is the fast pace of everything you have to be on ur toes and on your feet a lot."
bad,Buen ambiente de trabajo pero renumeración ridícula
bad,"The company has amazing benefits, holiday discounts, free coffee beans and more. They take care of their employees on that level. As far as salary, it's extremely underpaid for the amount of expectation, and speed  that is required. Even after "
bad,It was stressful and the lack of employees made everything more stressful and each of us were given less hours after new management. The employees were amazing people who were not respected by a company they worked for for years.
bad,"Worked for the company on and off for 6 years. Completed countless hours of training for a team lead position, trained new-hires at no extra compensation, and was given a new schedule nearly every week. Still, never moved higher than the entry-level position of ""partner,"" and was given a raise once. Very frustrating, constantly putting in the extra effort and expressing eagerness to be more involved with the company, only to be told time and again that it would happen in ""just a few months."" If the answer is ""no,"" tell your employee. I'd not have given up or worked less hard just by being told I wouldn't be given a higher position, but I am now bitter and angry that I was led on and given responsibilities that were meant to lead me into a higher position, only to have simply been manipulated into doing work that was not mine to do."
bad,"That's how much they pay and they indoctrinate you on their programs you don't qualify for. Prepare to either pull your hair out with difficult customers, or make the same drink over and over until you fall asleep"
bad,"Long days"
bad,"Your Experiences may be different in other districts and areas... you will learn lots of things about business, inventory, scheduling, employee relations and customer service. You are expected to do schedules (scheduling software is terrible and time consuming) attend very long meetings, do inventory, rollouts, conduct employee reviews, do interviews, review promotional guides, but you will not be given enough hours to get it done.  This is not a 40 hour a week job. More realistic is 50-55 hours a week. I was expected to be on the floor 34-35 hours a week. New tasks were assigned all the time with no extra time allowed."
bad,"Competent managers are a rare occurrence at Starbucks. My store was left without a manager for a total of 5 months within a 1.5 year period. Then, they put a 23-year old with no experience as the store manager! They don't pay enough, require you to work inconvenient hours, call you in on your off days. The company invested in benefits for appearances rather than raising the pay. The reason for this? Their core employee base is college students. College kids do not need free tuition, as they are already in school. They don't need heathcare because they are still on their parents' insurance. They don't care about 401k or stock! Starbucks invested in the things that will cost them the least amount of money rather than raising our pay. They will give everyone a few cents raise once a year, when many other places give dollar raises at least. Working at taco bell or mcdonald's is comparable. Except here, the standards and expectations are way higher. There is too much stress: being shortstaffed all the time, people calling out, high customer volume, and mean people. If you care, you will end up taking work home with you. Anything good you do will get undone by the next day. No one will notice your efforts and it will take entirely too long to get promoted. It isn't worth it! The pay is absolutely not worth the work. I would recommend this job for--of course--college kids. If you have little to no skills, this job is for you. If you have any skills at all work somewhere else! Use this job as a short term stepping stone and then get far away from it!!! Don't get sucked in for many years"
bad,"Management does not follow company standards. Management only out for themselves.  Great culture for baristas, otherwise higher ups only care for themselves."
bad,"Starbucks has more than cut labor in half since 2006 and has doubled the amount of workload. This company is massively unreasonable. Pay and benefits are good but the demand and stress of the job make it not worth it. As a manager I found it near impossible to find and hire strong employees. Times have changed and millennials are lazy and self-entitled. They complain, call-in, expect too much and put forth so little (not all of them but a vast majority). I just couldn't continue being a slave for a corporation that refused to acknowledge the fact that the current generation hitting the job market IS the problem. I was no longer willing to accept accountability for the shortcomings of others. So long, Starbucks!"
bad,"The only problem I really had with starbucks is that majority of the staff have completely lost interest in work. To the point that both supervisors and normal partners would constantly just put their work off for later partners to do. I unfortunately kept finding myself assigned to either high traffic shifts or ""catch up shifts"" were I had to run around trying to fix and clean everything that was left off for the day... I finally left starbucks after this continued through two different stores and with three different managers."
bad,The managers at Starbucks has favorites so if you aren't her favorite you really won't get the hours you would like. It's best to just do your job and not talk to anyone they LOVE to gossip.
bad,it was great at the beginning just poor management but thats anywhere you go. overall fun different experience definitely faster pace than the normal.
bad,"Starbucks is a good way to start the working life in Ireland, becouse you are in touch with customers and the multiculture workmates. The worse part in this sector, not only in starbucks, obviously is the low salary."
bad,"Minimal training, lots of difficult and overwhelming customers, little to no help when needed during shift. Must make drinks their way (two at a time, while switching off mid drink to start/finish other) or the highway"
bad,"My Starbucks experience was largely tainted by subpar management and a lack of paths for advancement. I worked a year there, mostly kept to the drive-through window because I have excellent people skills and I can work in a fast-paced environment. Other friends and coworkers were given the opportunities to work elsewhere in the store, but not even for the sake of training a well-rounded employee was I but rarely moved from the drive-through area. Work/life balance was alright due to the hourly schedule, but with regards to management or supervisors actually understanding a need to take a break or call in sick, that was a completely different ballgame. Unless you had your max availability given to the schedule all the time, you wouldn't accrue the hours you needed to make rent, much less gas and groceries (and this was working full-time on top of another part-time I had that paid better). It's probably an excellent job for people getting started and those who enjoy treats and, let's face it, mostly burnt coffee beans, but I wouldn't stay there longer than you needed unless it was a side hustle."
bad,"Flexible hours. Poor management. Good for a work-life balance. "
bad,"I worked at Starbucks for 4 years and each day had a different stress added to it. I have had multiple different manager at different stores and at the same store, manager are replaced often and one is not better than the next. All of the managers I had were unorganized, unprepared, and usually always made mistakes on the schedule. Consistently running out of product or have too much of product. Almost always had too many staff members during slow times and not enough during busy. The cleaning was left to those that actually took pride in their job. There was never a team atmosphere and almost always had stealing happen in back area. I worked at 3 different stores and moved my way up, but in the end the Company is absolutely horrible to work for."
bad,"Starbucks is a low level service industry job that doesn't pay well for the issues one has to deal with. The customers are hellish - often every third person in line has an issue with their drink or finds a problem. However, this environment creates a family culture among the employees, a feature of all of the many Starbucks I've worked at. Tipping is virtually nonexistent, averaging about $1-2 an hour. High level of stress and multitasking for minimal pay, but the corporate benefits (such as the 401K) are worthwhile."
bad,"As most companies Starbucks claims to be customer focused, but being behind the curtain revealed their true colors. They make your drinks, without taking the time to get to know most of the cliental, and the drinks in the drive thru are driven by a timer. They short hours for the part time employees and make the full time personnel  fill the gaps, overtaxing and burning out many potential career employees before they are given the opportunity to advance."
bad,"A lot of people I know and have worked with loved their jobs at Starbucks but I honestly couldn't stand the work. During high-volume shifts it was standard protocol for me to not be allowed to operate outside of a range of 5 floor tiles, this was meant to increase efficiency but it was often overly restrictive and only worked as planned when everyone else's stations were in perfect operation, which they rarely were. The repetitiveness of the work could be relaxing, but the cost of that is that almost everyone I worked with had to wear wrist braces because we all had the beginning stages of tendonitis because of repetitive motion injuries. Considering we were all in the 18-25 range, it was hard for me to justify ruining my body for minimum wage."
bad,"The actual job wasn't bad at all, the main issues were caused by employees and bad management. Very drama filled environment with lots of unnecessary gossip."
bad,"When I started at Starbucks I had to study handbooks about health and safety, quality control etc which was fine. I worked there for about 8 months and can honestly say it was horrific. The supervisor cautioned me and warned me that I could get sacked if my attendance was noted; I was once two minutes late at (5:32am instead of 5:30) in the morning, although I explained that my bus arrived later as it was early in the morning. The company was completely money driven and did not care about their staff, well particularly the store I worked in. I had worked in other stores and enjoyed myself there, due to better management and less 'gossipy' environment. I also brought to my managers attention that I wasn't confident on bar and would have liked more training, although during quiet time I did try to perfect drinks; I was brought into the office several times and seemed that they pretty much wanted to let me go because they couldn't be bothered to help me. "
bad,"Standards and benefits are very low, Poor Insurance packages. Low career growth. The work environment is completely different from outside view.  Degraded Salary packages."
bad,"I worked at a license store on a college campus that was also ran by another company called Aramark. I worked my way up to supervisor within the year (which was awesome) however, I was NEVER compensated for my work and NEVER received an increase in pay. Management did not not advocate for me. The district manager was good at her job, but only came into the store 2 times a month, which was not enough to over see the store manager's practices. Standard Starbucks regulations were never practiced because the store managers were never held accountable. Since I also worked on a college campus, I did not receive a partner number, free coffee beans/kcups or any Starbucks Corporate store benefits (even though my location generated the most profit in city). It was a good ride for a short time. After I hit the year mark, it went down hill and no one had the passion or motivation anymore to maintain the glory of the store."
bad,"I appreciate this job, and have made great strides in my ability to manage people. However, my ability to advance has been thwarted and a path has not been provided to appropriately move into a higher position of authority."
bad,I came in at 5am almost every morning. Opening and doing a strict morning routine. I often was one of the hardest workers picking up others slack. I worked at the 2nd busiest store in my state and the pressure to be the best all the time was very stressful and that's why I believe the entire staff was underpaid. The revenue we brought in I'm sure was insane but no one really got good raises. The staff was great but it drained me entirely.
bad,"I worked at a Starbucks (inside of a Target store) as a minor and was not given my legally-required breaks specific to my age. After only two days on the job, I was left to work completely alone, and was rarely supervised from then on. Training was minimal and I felt as if I didn't know what I was doing most of the time. However, I got along with my coworkers and enjoyed the actual job itself of preparing drinks, and the knowledge gained from my experience was quite valuable. As it was a Starbucks managed by a Target, I did not get a special discount nor did I receive free food or drink like many other Starbucks locations."
bad,"It's a good job place if you're in a 0hr contract but as full time job it can be very draining and health affecting."
bad,"Management is great depending on the store, really hit or miss. Constant callouts, lack of organization, and no care for hiring an issue. Loved customers for the most part, no issue there. Pay is decent but almost not worth it for the issues you run into. Also there tends to be a lack of care for associates and a sense of favoritism seen in multiple departments. Associate morale is low in general. High expectations with no overtime possible and lack of filling positions makes working here frustrating. If you can handle the stress then go for it, but if you want organization, smooth execution, and  management being held responsible for key issues then this place may not be for you."
bad,"If your looking for a challenge in your workplace along with a somewhat lackluster pay and stress filled environment, this is a good place to start. Coworkers are indeed nice and can be helpful at times but you tend to get angry or confused customers most of the time along with working weird hours. Speed is everything in this job and if you don't have it, you might not get to stay very long."
bad,"When I started my position at Rose Hill Starbucks, I found the management very poor. ""Partners"" are expected to ""flex"" to an already overly complicated system, that apparently never has enough people. No one is given a set task to handle for more than an hour or two, leaving certain roles completely unchecked at times. The sanitizer needs to be changed every two hours to keep bacteria from building? Well, better hope someone is on duty for it. Oh, but the person that was is on drive-thru window now, and it's been sitting at least another two hours before someone is ""flexed"" into handling it. By then, it will have been used on almost every surface and appliance)."
bad,"There's never enough people to deal with the onslaught of customer orders and MOBILE orders....They tripled the amount of orders coming in, add on new multiple stepped drinks( to the already full standard menu) all the while cutting labor( going from 40hrs a week to 25hrs) and  doing crazy bogo's !!! just so they can make more and more money but wont pay you more for the extra work. They will also cut your pay if you move to another state...which means any raises you have earned by working hard or getting promoted are taken. most enjoyable aspect is the rare mature acting customer and or partner"
bad,"I had previous experience of working at Starbucks, I got dragged into training a new class but without trainer pay. The management team was unhelpful and uninterested in learning about the company they were trying to run. The turnover rate was very high. The hours promised to me were taken away."
bad,Training is all over the place. Some of the people training you don't know or don't know the information they are training. I would not recommend this place to my enemy.
bad,"Coworkers and the occupation is a wonderful opportunity, and I would recommend it to anyone. The benefits Starbucks offers are fantastic; however, the management at my current location is abysmal at best."
bad,"I do not think Starbucks is a terrible place to work overall, just a bad experience at the store I was at. We had little to no management rule so our shift leaders would sit in the back during our busy hours. The night and morning crews would always argue and complain. Not the best place to work, especially when the #1 thing is to make sure the customer is happy."
bad,"Starbucks is not the same company it was when I started working there in 2008. Instead of being the best at one thing (coffee), they have now become mediocre at lots and lots of different things. I think they try to be too many things, instead of really good coffee shop. For the amount of work they expect from their employees they absolutely do not pay them enough. Management is all about the bottom line and not about their employees. It is very hard for advancement. The benefits are good if you manage to work enough hours to keep them. The stock plan is good too."
bad,Management is low quality and the people are decent to work with... wouldn't recommend to anyone for a first job or as a long time job. The tasks are relatively simple
bad,"gostava muito de trabalhar  la , pois o ambiente era agradacel , bons benéficios e otima localização  !"
bad,"I was looking forward to working with this company and was greatly disappointed. There was very little support from management and it was continual high stress,"
bad,Starbucks requires a lot of work and a fast paced employee. It gets super messy behind the scenes and it feels as if there is not enough time to do anything
bad,"It was so fun learning how to make drinks and meet people. My coworkers were great, but my manager constantly harassed me so I quit. Tried to report it to human resources but, they believed him over me. Very sad that I had to quit, but couldn't work with a company that didn't take harassment seriously. One of the worst experiences of my life."
bad,"I have worked at many Starbucks locations and it actually is a super busy yet fun job but there is a lot to keep up with, so without help of coworkers it gets super stressful and you must have a lot of patience with this job! making coffee is a rare yet super fun skill."
bad,"It wasn't great. The management was terrible, we couldn't accept tips or have the regularly allotted free drink per day. We had to do way more than was in our job description, and often did not receive breaks."
bad,Good salary. Well stablished company but not enough trainings and motivation for all the staffs. They have diff rules and policy. Not that much of standard.
bad,"Great first job easy to move up if you have the patience, consists of a coterie of ""partners"" must be able to keep up in fast past environment and be able to deal with explicit people"
bad,"Easy job but very demanding "
bad,"Not recommended for the faint of heart or hard to catch on. Very stressful, especially since it's the only Starbucks in town. Morale is constantly low and panic attacks will ensue."
bad,"The management was lackluster, as well as multiple other employees. The customers were, for the most part, very rude and demanding. Coworkers constantly gossiping."
bad,"-new employee is thrown into fast paced environment and expected to ""just deal with it"""
bad,"I interviewed for the position in April, the manager knew of my situation being a newly single mother of two toddlers. I told them that as of my first day that I would need a letter to help with getting child care so that there wouldn't be an issue with attendance. I worked there for two months reminding them almost daily of the letter than I needed and never received it but resulted in me having to quit the position because I couldn't get permanent childcare with out."
bad,"Working at Starbucks seems like it would be a fun job, however, it was extremely fast-paced and required multitasking skills and the ability to work under stress. The only enjoyable aspect of the job was that I made some genuine friends, and most of my coworkers made the shift bearable. Management was a nightmare, and sometimes the floor would be improperly staffed, causing many problems and frustration among the entire team. The job puts a priority on how sociable an employee is and disregards how well the employee works."
bad,"Starbucks is a large company, I think stores and locations have there own personalities and of course people do as well, corporate does not help with this but pushes for similarity instead."
bad,"Management problems galore. I worked both in Nc and Sc for Starbucks under multiple managers and district managers.  District managers would frequently tell the managers they were adding positions past the entry level of employment, this would lead to managers promising positions to employees. These positions would frequently not actual come open though."
bad,"The Starbucks I worked at garnered most of it's business because of it's location. It was the only place for the huge number nearby workers to get coffee of food. "
bad,"You deal with rude customers, people wanting to get away with free things, constant stress, miscommunication between employers and employees. "
bad,"to upsell food to customers make drinks from cafe lattes to mocha's."
bad,This is one of those jobs where the associates are either there for 10 years or 10 months. Not a rewarding job and very demanding.
bad,The work atmosphere is very positive and uplifting. I make customers drinks and provide them with food. The employees are good spirited. Make okay tips.
bad,"A fun place to work at. Get to meet new guests from different cultures everyday. Helps improve my individual skills as a supervisor also learn how to work with co-workers from different cultures."
bad,"Working with the partners and creating the ""Third Place"" environment for the customers. The store provided a very welcoming environment."
bad,"How is it like being in an abusive relationship? Perhaps they aren't terrible to everyone they are in a relationship with and maybe sometimes it actually works out. However, in my time there I always felt as though I wasn't good enough for anyone else while also feeling that just maybe I could be good enough for them. They have solid benefits that sometimes people need. That only adds to the feeling of abuse, you want to stay with the company because you are afraid of what you will do if you lose this resource to support you.  "
bad,You only get one raise a year and they start you off at minimum wage. The hours are really horrible if you get hours at all. The management is horrible and hate their jobs but are to afraid to leave.
bad,"Full of nepotism, little appreciation of employees. Excuses to not give raise while the owner's wife drives up in a new car yearly. Managers are not consistent is that way they want things done."
bad,"Het leukste van de job is dat je in contact komt met mensen. De sfeer is zeer goed, je kan veel plezier maken tijdens het werk. Het minst leuke is dat je veel te veel moet poetsen!"
bad,"The job as a barista was fine, but i had issues with the staff. The supervisors was very unprofessional and disrespectful."
bad,"Pay for the amount of work is required isn't fair, lots of moving up and down and cleaning. But people are happy and most costumers are nice to be around."
bad,"The job at Starbucks is enjoyable; however, it did not pay well as I always needed a second job, but it did have awesome health benefits. The job itself was good; making drinks was fun as well as personalizing with each customer but the management was absolutely terrible here. They are the reason I left. I would not work there again."
bad,"i was a manager"
bad,"A typical day at work for me was hard work and wasn't my ideal job. Most of my co-workers were challenging to work with. Working within Starbucks I learnt how to work the tills and steam coffees etc.. The management within Starbucks was satisfactory as she wasn't very friendly and didn't seem to try in anyway to interact with her employees. The hardest part of the job was again dealing with challenging customers, but I do like a challenge. Working with Starbucks was an experience and I enjoyed the free coffees."
bad,"I invested a few years into this company, thinking eventually I'd be managing my own store. Wrong. They've changed their ways, and are outsourcing management, even on the shift supervisor level. If your goal is to advance with this company, forget it. The benefits do not make up for the stress, drama, and neglect that goes on in each and every store (i've worked in a few). Only work here if it's your only option."
bad,"Being a shift supervisor you were the manager when the manager was not present in the store. I was in charge of customer services product quality and responsible for money and employees during my shift. "
bad,Feed football player  and students. Make sure serving area is clean at all times.Also prepare beverages for customer .I enjoyed working with all of co-worker.The hardest part of this job was taking trash out.The best part was serving the customers.
bad,The customers are allowed to speak to baristas in a derogatory manner. I witnessed many baristas shut down and cry over this. The store managers are young adults with little to no experience. The stores are consistently under staffed due to company policies.
bad,"Working at Starbucks is like wokring at a Christmas party, a little too warm and fuzzy for me,"
bad,"This company has some good perks such as free coffee while on the clock, 30% discount on drinks, food, and retail items. They also offer a partner markout which is a free box of kcups, pods, via or tea, and/or a free pound of coffee to take home per week. They will occasionally offer other freebies like food samples when new products come out or a free gift after christmas such as a tumbler or mug. These things depend on your district and location. They also offer tuition reimbursement, stock options, and health care. The challenges of working for this company definitely out weigh any pro of working here. The company in general has very strict dress code policies which over the last two years of working for the company, I've met many partners who can agree with me. I have a small tattoo on my wrist that I got before working for the company. At my first Starbucks in Houston, Texas they allowed me to cover it with a small black sweatband that matched my uniform. I moved to Austin, Texas and started working at a store and in this district, they do not allow the use of sweatbands so each employee is forced to wear long sleeves. This is especially brutal during summer months, and also hard since Starbucks has now installed an energy saving air conditioning system which is controlled by a central office in another state. The thermostat will display a temperature reading of 71 degrees but the actual temperature in the building is over 80 degrees. Many calls are placed to the facility contact center, but nothing has been done to resolve the issue. If you are lucky enough, you may get"
bad,"a great place to learn job skills, don't expect to make much money nor advance"
bad,"Fast pace environment, high demanding custom drinks, and knowledge about product. I took extended classes to train new partners and extensive knowledge about coffee and tea.  Management has a lot of turnover and oversees productivity. Co-workers are the backbone of the company and make a store atmosphere. Hardest part of job is costumer service and the hot products. Best part is being involved with the local community and the friendships made."
bad,"Not bad if you need a job. If you love coffee, this is the place for you. It's hot though, and the customers are rude. Lots of fun stuff to do. Never a dull moment!"
bad,"Working at Starbucks was not an overly pleasant experience. Being paid minimum wage for a high-stress job is simply not worth it. The culture is good, but again, you can't live off of $9.50 an hour. Management is just as inexperienced as the employees they ""manage"" and work/life balance is not good because you're contantly asked to work on your days off."
bad,"A typical day at Starbucks requires a store manager to be able to multi-task in a fast paced, ever changing environment. I have learned how to deal with change in a moment's notice and how to ensure that the team is able to adjust accordingly to the change that is occuring in a positive and productive manner. My peers within my district are very supportive and we assist one another as needed. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with a partner on their own personal development and seeing them being promoted to the next level."
bad,"Starbucks hides behind a fake facade that they are a warm fuzzy, people focused, business that serves coffee in a people business. That couldn't be anything further from the truth. They are a large corporation, publicly traded on Wall Street and although at one time they were focused on their people, today they are just another corporate giant that brushes people aside in the relentless rat race of ""IMPROVING OVER LAST YEAR"". I can come across as disgruntled or sound like a bitter ex employee, however, take a look at all the job postings on the career websites for Starbucks district managers, Starbucks Store Managers and Starbucks Assistant Store Managers. With the exeption of the employment agencies, Starbucks undoubtedly tops the list with their monopoly of job postings in every community they have a store. The turnover rate/attrition rates are indicative of todays terrible working conditions of the company. They are not opening new stores at the rate that they are recruiting leaders for their company. Of course some attrition and turnover is healthy but what we see here is excessive. What does that say? .....Bad working envrionment, Bad working environment, Bad working environment."
bad,"A typical day of work consisted of inventory management, shift control, making sure co-workers play their part and have their breaks, ensuring great customer service. I've learned that I never want to work for this company again. Did not enjoy the low wages or the complete change in management even after i lifted the customer voice off the ground for the night shift, and had many regulars who enjoyed my shift as it was tight running smoothly. I've also learned many things on the business aspect of the coffee world, and have successfully trained people prior to my departure from this job."
bad,Good job for students and recent highschool graduates. Good job to work on customer service and muit-task skills.
bad,"I was here for four years and never moved up in the company, I even opened the store and did all that I was told to change thigns in order to promote. It can be a great place to work, but it really depends."
bad,It was a very repetitive long job. they didn't have any type of flexibility. The hardest part of the job was having to lift 50 plus pounds. the most enjoyable was the managers were very nice
bad,I had a poor experience with starbucks. They paid me minimum wage and my boss was an awful abusive bully. I put up with it for months before resigning. She became vindictive after I was absent from a shift I was never informed of. I'm sure others have had positive experiences but I have not. She would only give me one to two shifts a week at 9 am on a saturday which was outside my availability and would never give me shifts during the week when I requested.
bad,"Starbucks fosters an environment where  subordinates are encouraged to go to HR with issues instead of their manager or DM (chain of command). HR automatically sides with the employee against the manager, and doesn't offer any way to resolve disputes without some type of punishment to the manager."
bad,"everything was great tough learning new drinks and ingredients that come with, until we got a new manager from another Starbucks shop  a couple streets down from us was not able to multitask to run drive thru and lobby, running out of food ingredients every week, multiple customer complaints, very sloppy and could not figure out a stable routine, the employees however were great and helped a lot when coming there and being the new kid on the block,nice area very busy and had a smooth system ."
bad,Working at Starbucks was fun but management is terrible. They do not appreciate their shift leaders and other employees and they have bad communication skills. But They do have great benefits and are flexible with any other jobs u have going on. The culture there is mainly diverse.
bad,training process inadequate for management position when hired externally - so many manager and district manager changes on a regular basis you never had a chance to get grounded before moving on
bad,Overall Starbucks isn't bad if you're willing to put in effort and care about your job. There are many cleaning tasks so you will be getting dirty as well as making drinks. A lot is expected of leads with low pay and no incentives.
bad,"It’s not a bad place to work if you’re not stressing for a check to maintain your life as a single person. The hours are random and depending on your Store Manager, time management sucks!"
bad,Often the management at my store made me feel unsafe and like I was being targeted. While many of my coworkers were kind I often felt as if my manager was trying to get me. There was an amount of favoritism that made me get the short end of the stick often. As well as coworkers taking things overly personally. It’s a social environment for better or for worse. It’s a great environment if it’s a more remote store or a more neighborhood store and not a campus based one.
bad,"Hard work on drive thru and cafe for minimum wage with poor management in franchise. Tips were shared termly rather than weekly/daily also, even though some workers may work 150 hours over 4 months and others 600 over 4 months, yet are given the same tips"
bad,Unchallenging and overly regimented tasks constantly scrutinized in often contradictory ways by supervisors. No space for personal judgment or to feel one is excelling. Best case it becomes rote so you don't really have to be mentally present.
bad,"Starbucks can be a good job in specific circumstances, company policy is very strict, which is both a boon and a curse. Sometimes you'll have to do something that takes forever and for seemingly no reason; why? policy. Also in my experience just as you're getting used to a SM they will move on, again also a blessing and a curse."
bad,It was a great place to learn and grow. They rarely promote from within but the wages are more suited for that of a high school student. The customer experience was overall satisfying. This is a great job to learn structure and management skills with good benefits.
bad,"Starbucks was a good place to work, management was okay. Company culture and sales targets can feel overwhelming. Knowledge and skills acquired here served as a good bass line for other barista and service industry jobs."
bad,Poor Management and rude supervisors at specific store. The supervisor humiliated a partner and myself. The manager thought it was ok and said the supervisor is undergoing coaching.
bad,"This workplace has people who are at all different points in their life; School, college, post-college, retired, etc. This makes for a somewhat shakey team dynamic where you have younger kids butting heads with way older adult co-workers and not aligning on day-to-day goals. Like every corporate-owned fast-food chain (let's not kid ourselves, Starbucks is fast-food), the people who work the hardest are the most underpaid and underappreciated. While here, I knew so many co-workers who would have mental break downs in the back room because customers were so terrible and working conditions so bad. Corporate expects the baristas to defend their bottom line when they don't defend the baristas."
bad,"Starbucks is a great company to work for- when you have a good manager. The hours are generally flexible and the benefits package is great, with full medical/dental/vision available at  only 20 hours per week."
bad,"At first the sparkle of working in a Starbucks is nice and in the beginning of your employment. Everything seems like it's a fun welcoming environment.  But after about four months of working and finishing your training is where the difficult parts start to unveil.  For myself everything was an easy process with training and being able to apply what I learned right from the get-go (Common Sense is Required).  Or so it seemed, once you felt comfortable is when the management as well as some shift-leads start to show more of their true colors.  Starbucks has a hidden policy of delegate everything to the lowest man or woman on the team at the time.  So, if you’re new then good luck, the struggle is real.  I worked at Starbucks for two year before I finally said enough.  Before I left the company, they even promoted me to trainer then shift-lead.  But trying to be loyal to companies that treat your “extremely” low wages and you as a person, out of site out of mind."
bad,"Starbucks is a well-known franchise. Personally my personal experience as a barista from working at one of the busiest Starbucks in Indiana (Greenfield, IN State Road 9, & New Road) was a 4/10. I have friends that are partners at other locations who have really great experiences and say it doesn't feel like work because its so fun and inviting. The atmosphere of store 2475 is just very heavy, and strict. Toxic relationships of the boss making and a barista cry or the baristas getting into an argument on the floor happened way too often. Shift managers abusing their power. The order constantly being messed up, corners being cut at the extent of safety, and health is not okay. The favorite part of my time at Store 2475 was the regulars we had and even the new customers the location had a lot of travelers since it was right off of 2 highway exits. I enjoyed the schedule being set three weeks out. The best way to enjoy your time there was to keep your head down, keep quite, and do as you are told."
bad,"Working as a Store Manager at Starbucks is extremely demanding.  You are managing very young workers, workers with limited availability, and turnover among workers is very high.  Running a store with this type of labor is very difficult.  The demands and expectations placed on the staff by corporate are unrealistic during peak hours of operation.  This creates a lot of tension and stress among all members of the store staff.  Drive through times are monitored by corporate.  You will face discipline and possible termination if drive though times, on average, exceed 60 seconds.  The timer starts once a customer drives up to the drive through window and stops once the customer drives away.  That's 60 seconds to cash them out, address any customer requests, have all of their food and hand crafted beverages complete, and have them drive away to stop the timer, all in 60 seconds or less.  All I can say is if you want to work for a company that has unrealistic goals, work at a Starbucks store."
bad,"They are portrayed to the public as a positive place to work, but I would absolutely avoid working for this company. They over work and under pay all roles at the store level."
bad,"Honestly, the company itself has good intentions. They offer good benefits and decent pay, but unfortunately my experience has been quite terrible. My store shuffled through outside hired managers at least every three months and each barely knew how to make the drinks they were supposed to be coaching us on. It was difficult to see the possibility of promotion when outside hires keep being brought in. The company also let's customers get away with murder, allowing their partners to be belittled over $2 coffee. Customer service is important, of course, but I really wish that the company cared more about their partner's mental health at the end of the day. It's just coffee, there's no excuse for what I see partners tolerating from partners. I've met many partners who absolutely love their job. It just wasn't for me I guess."
bad,I applied to Starbucks based on a lot of research.  I was impressed by the corporate culture and the environmental and sustainability mandates.  The store I worked in was an incredibly hostile work environment with no tolerance or inclusion.  I reported my superior to HR but I did not see any concern or follow through by corporate.
bad,"I have spent 5 years with this company. The first 2 were amazing, and then things slowly started going downhill. Stressful environment, a lot of responsibility (as a shift supervisor) with little pay, always short staffed, customers often very demanding and rude, management letting customers getting away with rude, racial comments to employees."
bad,"Starbucks likes to tell you that you are going to move up in the company, yes it was easy to get to a supervisor position but once you get there you are stressed out and underpaid. If you ever try to make management it is cut throat and and people will step on top of you to get ahead. They care about the bottom line not seniority or people who are deserving of the position."
bad,"This district is really backwards, prioritizing transactions over the connections that coffee culture is known for creating. The labor practices are bare bones at best. The expectations of the job as far as going above and beyond are well past what a job paying minimum wage should be asking of a person. Very physically demanding."
bad,"As far as benefits starbucks gives you the best. But as far as working for them that is a big no! I wouldn't recommend staying there for too long. Cant move up in the company , it's good for something in between."
bad,"Working here at the Starbucks in eurotunnel is a fun job, and the team are what make it so great. But the further you move up through management, the less and less they care. Supervisors are great and engage with you, but can get stressed at the baristas. assistant managers spend too much time in the office, and don’t help out, manager doesn’t care much, and the boss above him that will run his staff to the ground to get his bonus. Over all a good job, but only for some quick money, not long term or you’ll go crazy"
bad,"unorganized, always a problem something or someone missing rude guests who can't wait over 2 mins for anything supervisors dont help only complain mentally and physically draining"
bad,"Poor management. Crowded and dysfunctional. Majority of coworkers very pleasant to work with. Not recommended for those with disabilities such as anxiety and autism, however accommodations are available."
bad,"Any company as big as Starbucks is gonna be busy all the time, so if you don’t like people this is not the place for you. All of my coworkers are great, however the management is poor and it is often a struggle to get enough hours to make decent money. Unless you plan on using the benefits like the tuition reimbursement then it’s really not worth it."
bad,"While working at Starbucks, it was fun at first, it was a second home to me. When new Management came in, it was no longer about connecting with the customers, it was about driving sales. So the Part I honestly loved about my job, was then a hindrance. I transferred to another location looking for a promotion, and while working there, I received it. Then I was moved to another location. I was trained poorly and had to learn the duties of a Shift Supervisor on my own and found a way to manage the store. But when it came time for me to try to move up to be an ASM, I was told I couldn't begin training because I was expecting at the time. When I returned, no manager was willing to help me move forward. I was a Partner at Starbucks for almost 6 years, I met my husband working there, but when it comes to the management team, I was not treated with the utmost decency and respect.  I had to train my new manager, only to be told I couldn't move forward with my ASM training. I have even tried reapplying to Starbucks because of my love in the service it provides, but I was told there was a ban on rehires, and that is why I am giving the company a low rating"
bad,"Starbucks is only looking to make money. Management, DM, RM, Corporate; they never actually listen to the needs of their employees. It's all about making sales, no matter the conditions of the work environment."
bad,"Great company as far as benefits and concepts. At the store level, too much harrassment from customers,  no support from management,  no work life balance. As a single mother, this job had no care for my families needs. Much skill is needed here... should be a higher wage job."
bad,"Stressful but fun place to work. It's a corporation so...you're a slave to the corportaion. No room to advance and bad pay. Not a career type job, better for a temporary position."
bad,"Hectic, stressful environment for little compensation. I even tried to transfer and the supervisor disapproved. Would have liked to stay longer and move up but I just could not take the way I was being treated any more. I felt I had no choice but to quite. My own heath was being impacted."
bad,"I have always enjoyed coffee shop jobs because of the constant human interaction, however the starbucks in my area did not pay enough nor did we make enough tips to make it worth it for me. My management was great and productive/efficient, but the business itself offered more benefits that I didn't need, rather than a higher pay rate, which I do need."
bad,"Between the way it’s run and the poor team spirit, Starbucks was a terrible place to work. Little was done to take care of employees even when they were berated by customers."
bad,I worked in Starbucks in a grocery store.Love the job but communication was lousy and young management. Catered to all the teenagers working and have them all the time off.Expected us to train all the new employees .
bad,"En un día típico de trabajo te piden ciertas tareas a cubrir, pero así mismo ""se espera de uno"" que haga todo lo que haga falta o no esté hecho por otras personas, de lo contrario te lo marcan como incorrecto."
bad,"Starbucks is fast-paced, friendly, fun and very busy. You learn about the different cultures of the coffee bean, espresso, tea and different ways to prepare beverages to your liking. Management is okay depending on what district you're located.. The hardest part of the job is trying to cooperate with your fellow coworkers- Starbucks is a hipster-like culture so it can be hard to get through to one another, but as long as you communicate well everything turns out fine in the end. If you enjoy working as a team in a fast-paced environment, learning new things everyday and talking to/teaching others about the culture of espresso and coffee, then Starbucks is a perfect fit for you."
bad,"I loved my Shift Leaders and my Store Manager and the culture was fun and welcoming.  Even so, the work is physically exhausting and the customers are emotionally draining.  I never had a consistent schedule or set hours which made a healthy work/life balance very hard.  The pay was laughable for the kind of labor we were doing."
bad,"This is not the most fun place to work, at least not with what I've been through. People were always calling off, or something else would happen, causing the good, loyal workers to always get the bitter end of it. Most days I'd be without a lunch break, because it'd be me and a shift supervisor closing with no other help for 9+ hours, and an enormous amount of work to do and keep up on, not including the customers that had to be served. The pay wasn't good for all that I had to do for them. I'd find myself sick so unbelievably often, purely from exhaustion and over-working myself for the store to stay afloat. If you can find a store with a good manager and great, hard-working staff, then this would definitely be an easy going, enjoyable atmosphere. Most of our problems came from corporate forcing us to cut down our hours, because we, somehow, in all of the agonizing amounts of people we had, didn't make enough to keep a good amount of people working there, and so we were left without help, that we desperately needed, on numerous occasions."
bad,"At star bucks there is no I in team. When you are there certain times of the day can get extremely busy and you tend to have ""regulars"" come in, and they expect you to know every drink they have. One thing I didn't like about the job most was not knowing for that week when you would be scheduled and what days you will have to work. You also have to keep on track of orders and make sure every one is done hot and to order, because the customer will know. I loved my job and the friendships I made, as well as the conversations I had, but this was a high school job, and I needed to find a workplace with benefits and a higher salary."
bad,Working at starbucks is stressful and its harmful and i dont like it. Great Benifits tho! coffee is great and the food is bomb. but it sucks alot dont work there
bad,Had lots of fun experiences. Worked with a lot of great people and gained lots of experience. Management could’ve been better but overall it was a great experience
bad,"Starbucks sucks people in and keeps them there. Unless you have a store manager that cares about her employees, you will NOT get promoted no matter how hard you work. Depending on which district you work in, it can be very sexist. About the only thing good that came from it was the flexibility of scheduling because I put myself through school and the benefits."
bad,"I had an excellent time working at the Starbucks location in Dupont, Washington.  I learned so much being that it was a fast paced environment with room to grow."
bad,The company i started with is no longer the same company that it is now. We are not paid a living wage and are required to do the work of 2-3 people. The tarining program is lacking and of course turnover is a big issue. I originally worked for them for the benefits but currently they are average.
bad,"a typical day at work was hectic, not enough people on the sales floor, shift supervisors hiding in the back on their phones or listening to music while they put pastries away. one person running drive through and making food/drinks by themselves. i made good friends but could not wait to quit. management never made me feel listened to or heard."
bad,Very hard to move up within. They rather bring management from the outside when they have partners in the company eager to grow for 10+ years. Very good benefits one of the best in the food industry but not very good with promotions.
bad,"A typical day for me involves catering to customers and the completion of tasks to prepare for peak. Peak involves taking and fulfilling customer orders as quickly as possible and solving issues as they arise with the same expediency. I learned to function as a part of a cohesive group centered on open communication about nearly everything that was being done and needed to be done. Management is competent if not exceptional depending on the day and individual managers. The workplace culture is a strong highlight at Starbucks due to how it is very inclusive, often caring for each other both in spite, and because, of differences. The hardest part is maintaining a fast pace with consistency while dealing with rising problems such as the running out of product, understaffing, or multiple customer concerns. The most enjoyable is when it all flows well and helping the regular customers who make us smile as much as we make them."
bad,"Pays well, hours are all over the place, corporate policies are fine, drink complexity and customers are the worst. Good for part-time employment. Generally won't hire people younger than 18."
bad,"Certain stores are fun to be a part of, but the management of others destroys morale and causes a high turnover rate. Company product waste is astronomical, hours are largely inconsistent, not much room for growth after the Supervisor position. The work environment is mostly good from what I have been around. The other baristas are mostly young and chill, but the upper management is a hit or miss on barista skill, personable skills, and micromanagement. I have worked at about 4 stores and seen a similar amount of store managers and my largest complaint might be HEAVY MICROMANAGEMENT with little to no recognition when you consistently do something right. Every supervisor seems to have different ways for doing the same job which causes confusion among the baristas. I severed ties with the company after working for a couple months at a new store with a manager who didn't value or have any compassion for his employees. The management team was also not much better in this regard. If you want something to get you through college, that is the only circumstance that I would recommend this job to anyone."
bad,"It was ok for a first-time job, I enjoyed the culture and atmosphere of working at Starbucks. However, I'd say that the hours were never fixated and were definitely always going to change. I did not like how I was asked to come in on my days off. Very, very stressful work environment. Many customers were rude but some were nice. Some colleagues were bullying me but some were kind to me. Never got full proper training."
bad,"I began starbucks and actually enjoyed working there and my customers. This is the third store that I have been at, and also the worst management. We have the highest turnover rate in the entire district, but the manager still doesn't see anything wrong with her skills. ""The customer is always right"" policy. Be prepared to get yelled at on a daily or cussed out because all you have are holiday cups-and thats against their religion. Also horrible tips $15/week."
bad,"I didn't really like working here, there were a lot of issues having to do specifically with the manager, I felt that there were alot of racial things tolerated."
bad,"Bonne culture d'entreprise."
bad,"Very quick paced and stressful"
bad,"Starbucks has an incredibly fast-paced and stressful work environment that teaches many time management, customer service and problem solving skills. The job consists of crafting beverages efficiently and quickly while connecting with customers, building a strong team, and reaching daily goals. However, management frequently under-staffs and overworks employees and doesn't always lead by example. Learning and crafting new beverages, as well as adhering to customers is enjoyable and can leave you feeling rewarded."
bad,"Starbucks is Starbucks. It’s a common misconception that Starbucks is a good place to work. It isn’t bad. But it is not what people think it is. The hourly wage is just above minimum, tips are never a guaranteed amount (obviously), even play for management is bad. I was offered a shift management position and declined because of how bad the pay is. It wasn’t worth the responsibility for a few more bucks. It is a fun place to work. I’d say good for young kids. But not for anyone trying to make a sustainable living. You have to work i think 300 hours before you can get benefits. I have worked there on two separate occasions. I never stayed long enough to recieve benefits, because it takes so long to accumulate 300+ hours."
bad,I mean idk it was okay but management really sucked and the entry level position was more work than you’re compensated for. Often I was by myself and unhappy.
bad,"I worked for this company for seven years. Most of that time was a great experience (solely the time I worked in Vancouver). I loved the culture, the product, the innovation, and the people I worked with. Due to my proficiency, attention to detail, and expediency, I was able to move up relatively quickly within the company. "
bad,"I really enjoyed the people that I worked with, but found when I tried to move up in the company I could only do so if it would benefit someone else. I was moved to a store I did not want to go to so I could basically run it for the manager that did not know what they were ding as 'training' then after I got the store up to snuf. I was told that I would not get the position I was going for because I needed to apply for it. No one had told me that I would have to do that, so I found it a waste of time. There were a lot of other things but that is one of the biggest ones."
bad,"Once you get the job everyone is generally pretty welcoming, however, the hype over Starbucks having amazing employment benefits are exaggerated. The pay is considerably low for being a multi-billion dollar company and having been holding out for the better side of things in the stock market. In order to get better pay, because I am working to pay for school out of pocket, I am having to find another job to hopefully transfer to. You definitely have to be able to multi-task and handle work well under pressure. If you aren't, and your store is known to be busy, you won't be able to pull your own weight and your co-workers will dread working with you. There are a lot of people who work for Starbucks that deserve better pay, and a lot of those people are also trying to pay for schools that aren't supported by Starbucks. (They only support you going to school if: you go to ASU online, you work at least twenty hours a week, and maintain a certain GPA in which that part is understandable.)"
bad,"If you had a good crew that day, your shift could be fun and enjoyable. But if you had even one bad person, this job could be a nightmare. Training is a joke. They are focused on computer programs that are not very helpful. Otherwise, I was thrown straight in. Once you get the hang of it, the job could be a lot of fun, and customers who connect are the greatest customers you will ever have."
bad,"Management was very unstable, hours are not set, you get paid the same or less than most restaurants to do a whole lot of tasks at once during a high paced environment."
bad,"Irregular shifts, you're only able to plan a week in advance due to the way the roots are written however you are able to put in requests months in advance but response time varies on the stores management."
bad,"I think it was the manegment because it was awful, they have their own group of people they prefer to work with and don’t let others to have the experience"
bad,"Although the benefits are great, it was not enough to stick around. The customers are extremely rude. I have worked in food service for 8+ years, yes it does occur, however Starbucks creates a culture that allows customers to take advantage and ware down employee moral. It creates an inconsistent working experience. If the company gives employees rules to follow in regards to customers, then we should be protected, but never are. I've had customers steal, throw beverages in our ice bins next to hand off planes, and yell at our baristas. On top of this, we are expected to work on the minimum amount of coverage possible. Our jobs as managers is to ultimately run a lucrative business, but you are to do it with absolutely the least amount of people possible. We spread our employees thin, and when call outs occur (happens FREQUENTLY), you can expect to have an extremely stressful work day. It is a thankless job. Turn over rate is high. I did absolutely love the benefits, but again, it did not outweigh the negatives(there are more than this)."
bad,Starbucks is a great company to work for because they take care of the baristas. The store that I worked for though showed favoritism with the supervisors and the baristas. When I was a supervisor I went three weeks without a day off and had at least 60 hours every week.
bad,"The SM usually had a very flippant attitude when female baristas came to them about inappropriate comments from male customers and would do little to nothing in order to diffuse the situation. The ASM was condescending and difficult to work with, making it very tense during their shifts. I enjoyed working with my fellow baristas and the right team would make a shift go by quickly. In short, I would recommend working at Starbucks, just not the one I was employed at."
bad,Management was not good and didn't care about staff as individuals. Was obviously an impersonal big corporation but good to work there if you're a student or just looking for a bit of money. Not good for a long term career.
bad,"It's not terrible. But it certainly isn't great. Be prepared to be stressed out all the time, and feel taken advantage of from customers because of customer service expectations."
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to learn about coffee. but management and company culture are not the best."
bad,"Over my time working for this company, the morale continued to drop for those working in positions under store manager. There really just is no appreciation for the partners who are not in management positions and their opinions are carelessly tossed aside a good majority of the time. The company also sets unrealistic expectations on order times and because of this the quality of what is being served is diminished. They do offer benefits such as health insurance, but for someone who has no need to take advantage of these benefits there's very little value in what they offer as far as working environments. I used to really enjoy my job here until I realized that my opinion or ideas did not matter and were constantly disregarded over and over again. Would not recommend if you are looking for a positive work environment, this is definitely not that."
bad,"That's heard and repeated often. Industry best practices are hard to find here, so if you care about that, get ready for the ""Starbucks Way"" where you are rewarded for knowing less about the real world, and more about the way they do things.  You are rewarded for sticking around the longest and knowing ""where the bodies are buried"", and supporting the status quo, not for spear-heading actual productive and needed change.  And, God help you if you're complaining about status quo to the individual who ushered-in the object of your ire. The bastardization of commonly-used industry-respected practices, processes, tools, is rampant."
bad,"It is a stressful environment "
bad,Manager was not the most professional. Other co-workers were pleasant. Difficult to make very early shifts fit in with my college schedule. Learned how to brew coffee and operate espresso machine.
bad,But just like career advancment employee's and family should be important too. I enjoyed working and worked more then enough hours i could have stayed an employee while my child was in childrens hospital.
bad,Very stressful environment. Unorganized and full of customs service. Little direction of how to succeed is given to new hires. There is a sink or swim attitude and most people sink.
bad,yöneticin eğitimli ve disiplinliyse keyifli bir iş değilse.....
bad,"Starbucks does offer health care for part-time employees, tip pooling, free coffee, and a 30% discount on it's products to employees. They have tuition re-reimbursement, and some free education options. In the limelight, they seem like a company that helms the forefront of employee care. While some amenities are nice, the bottom line is that, they don't pay a livable wage. Behind the curtain, the company is all about the primary shareholders. Shifts are staffed low, employees are pitted against each other for bonuses, and outstanding service is rewarded with stickers. "
bad,"Stressful, unbalanced, poor management, huge corporation that really doesn't care about its' partners. Eventually one grows tired and wants to move on, but there is really no fulfilling advancement at store level. A good place for corporate zombies."
bad,"I worked at a store that included a drive-thre, and we were in constant competition with one other store for fastest drive-thru in our district.  Due to this, the main focus of every superviser was our speed, leaving little room for baristas, or managers even, to expand upon their specific skill.  For instance, if you make drinks quickly that's what you always do, if you can get a customer in and out, you're the casheir.  This, the choice of store management and dissorganization of higher management are the only issues I find in my store.  There is a necessity for teamwork and we all stay close enough to where any issues that arrise in relations can be handled efficiently through one to one contact. There is nothing difficult about the job, as long as you can quickly make a beveridge and provide quality service.  The only stress comes from the pace, but still it's and extremely low level."
bad,"Starbucks wants to put the smallest amount of people on the floor as possible, yet expects expects an ungodly amount of productivity, customer connection, in the smallest amount of time. They create very time consuming products to make for customers, and still expect to keep productivity times super low! Bottom line they expect way too much from their partners for the few ""Peanuts"" they hand out!!!"
bad,ambiance avec l'équipe parfaite ! Mais une fois qu'un manager viens vous parler c'est dans le seul but de vous rabaisser et cela créer une ambiance moins attrayante.
bad,Supervisors would have orders for events and not tell any of the workers or managers on duty so people would call the store and be mad at us when their orders aren't ready. One of the store owners told one of the managers to wash off a sack of potatoes that was infested with maggots and use them.
bad,"Great friendly environment however Managers need more training on how they should speak to their employees, handle stressful situations, and schedules"
bad,"As a Starbucks store manager you are required to work 50-70 hours a week with pay that should be for 40 hours a week. The corporate culture is super weird and if you want to stay around you better drink that cool-aid.  "
bad,"I have been promised, in my 7 months with the company, a promotion to shift supervisor multiple times by 3 different store managers with this never happening. The pretense they hire you under is that no matter your education or starting position, you can be promoted up into the company and a lot of the hiring is from within. Except that these store managers are all outside hires so it's all a lie to keep you hoping for more as they dangle this carrot in front of your face. "
bad,"I say Starbucks is a great first job, you can gain some basic customer service experience and barista experience that will be applicable to other jobs. But, other than that, the job is unrewarding."
bad,I learned how to be very good at doing several things at once. I also learned how to be kind under stressful situations even though its difficult to show it on your face or snap back.
bad,"A typical day at work would include serving customers coffee, preparing/warming foods, cleaning and facilitating various customer/management requests. I learned how to communicate effectively and work in a high-paced environment. It also helped me improve my multi-tasking. The management was good, though they did tend to schedule new employees on very odd shifts, and there was a clear power dynamic among who would get preferred shifts. The workplace culture was not the best, it was an incredibly competitive environment and not a lot of space was given for an individual to learn without being sarcastically reprimanded. The hardest part of the job was the negativity and stress levels of the coworkers. The most enjoyable part of the job was the variety of skills learned, like making various drinks and meeting/greeting customers, especially regular who you got to build a nice rapport with."
bad,"Starbucks used to be a fun, friendly, fast paced environment, with an emphasis on customer experience. However recent changes have put emphasis on moving faster and doing whatever we can to get the customer out of the drive through quicker. Everyone appreciates fast service, however, building relationships with the customers is no longer a possibilty"
bad,"Easy work, fun people, and fast paced. However, no room for improvement, low pay, next to no benefits besides 401k, and can be incredibly stressful due to the high volume of clientele."
bad,"The customers were always hard to deal with"
bad,"Good company with great benefits. Its also very competitive and people that are well liked are advanced quickly. High turnover with upper management, with little to no training to deal with that position. No job security. Cut throat. Hard work. Need to be physically and mentally sharp!"
bad,"Over worked and under paid. Had two managers and they both were terrible, customers are rude, I got a ten cent raise after a year of working there, the only decent benefit was all of the free coffee"
bad,Enjoy working for the company get a chance to meet lots of customers & passengers this store is located at the airport very fun job. I manage 3 stores at the airport and it has been quite a experience working with the company.
bad,"It's not a job for everyone. There are moments where you're really happy with the job, and then there are moments where you just want to drop the milk pitcher and cry."
bad,Depending on store it can be a very great place to work.  Benefits make the low pay seem ok but management and culture in stores can make it not worth it.
bad,"Customers are the worst part of the job.  They come up with the craziest mixes and expect you to treat them like royalty.  The company dosent pay more than minimum wage, hours good then bad in one week. Customers never tip"
bad,"Empresa Com excelente oportunidades de carreira, só basta Dms e Gerente seguir procedimentos de conduta"
bad,While pay was decent here i look for much more than that when working. Management was unreliable and i basically trained myself. Hopeully this job will be better
bad,"I have been working at Starbucks for a little under a year, and there are both pros and cons, but more cons than anything. I haven't been able to move up in the company even though I have 6 years in the cafe business, and I have not gotten a raise. The management works with my schedule, but $9 an hour is the ultimate low."
bad,a typical day at work is fast-paced.  one learns the Starbucks management and routine structures.  management is a hierarchical structure.  workplace culture is open. there is an expectation of a high standard of service to customers.
bad,"A typical day at work includes making quick but personal connections with a lot of customers who have stopped by to get a  little pick me up.  In between these customer connections, there is a lot of cleaning required."
bad,"The other partners at Starbucks are fantastic. The management is terrible. Absolutely zero support for those who are struggling. Store managers micromanage and place no trust in their employees, and give no credit to employees for the store running well. Benefits are fantastic if you don't mind not making enough money to support yourself."
bad,"The environment , the location of the store and the skills of the management holding the store it makes the difference."
bad,"I've worked for Starbucks for over fourth-teen years. The company started off great until recently the company has been cutting back on labor which makes the the job stressful and overwhelming. "
bad,"Management is good but it does not  spend time on manager's training. too much pressure. no family life , you work 50-70 hours and get paid for 40. staffing is the biggest issue. lots of sick call and some days you are working double shifts."
bad,Fast pace work as there are a lot of customers to serve. Co-workers and new faces seen everyday can bring joy to anyones day. Learned a lot in time management and  gained valuable management skills.
bad,"People are able to work as a team, polite and multitasking."
bad,This job has been an absolutely amazing experience I am ready do move on and start working towards my career. This job taught me how important a good connection is and how it can truly impact a person day.
bad,Can be fun and fast paced. Definitely challenges your ability to learn quick but by the 4th month it is second nature. Mornings are busy with impatient to old friend type customer. Afternoons have quick pick me up customers. Into the evening with cleaning up and stocking after the morning crew and helping the strays that are in to relax and use free wifi. Great benefits and pay in a right to work state. Great for working with college schedules but wouldn't work with me on a more consistent schedule needed to help my kids transition into Mom back at work. I was asked to bring in a doctors note when called in sick with Strep Throat.
bad,"After nearly a decade working for Starbucks across more than a dozen locations, I can say a few things with certainty: "
bad,"The training process was horrible, everyone hated their jobs, and the majority of customers are rude. The place is pretty much always packed so you are always stressed."
bad,"Ridiculous targets set daily, and up to 7 questions to ask each customer at the till."
bad,he decir que no tengo ninguna pega frente al trabajo que empeñé en esta empresa.
bad,"Jeden Tag gab ein neues Problem.Die Kollegen waren die netteste Leute die ich bis jetzt kennen gelernt habe,aber es war nicht genug"
bad,"Managers come and go, with no stability of leadership.  Employees pull together and get the job done.  Very busy and face pace, that's the fun part.  Co-workers work as a team to get the job done.  Hardest part of job is not to smile and have a great day.  the customers are the best part of each day"
bad,"People you work with are amazing. But you will get all types of customers, happy, unhappy and they will take it out on you. Be prepared to to be told unnecessary things that you haven't done."
bad,"The working environment is great, great employees, and fun at times.  The pay and hours are not enough to survive, and the management is terrible, with favortism tendencies."
bad,"I've worked at Starbucks Drive-Thru location for about 2 1/2 year"
bad,It was a nice environment but to much to do with no chance for advancement. I love the costumers and co-workers. I learned the costumers service means a lot. I learned money management and how to create schedules. I learned how to place orders. I basically enjoyed working there I just didn't like the pay.
bad,"A typical day as supervisor is to take care of all custmers' questions, to make sure the store is always clean. Custumers is always first."
bad,"When I left my previous employer for an opportunity with Starbucks I was SO EXCITED! I thought I had finally found a company that cared about their partners as much as I cared about the companies I'd worked for in the past. It was supposed to be an opportunity to finally grow within my position and career with an employer as loyal to me as I was to them (I'm a very, very loyal employee). When I first started having trouble I was surprised and spent every minute of everyday trying to figure out what it was that I was doing wrong. I attempted reaching out to my training manager as well as my district manager for help/guidance and every attempt was met with hostility and questions as to why I wasn't ""getting it"". "
bad,"I loved working for Starbucks. The job offered great benefits, and hours. It was constantly busy which made the day go by faster. I learned how unique each individual really is when it comes to their morning coffee. My co-workers always pulled together to ensure customer satisfaction. Overall, it was a great experience."
bad,"My first part-time job was at Starbucks. It might be because of the holiday season but my experience there was a mess."
bad,"i work in a franchise, they pay me the minimum and i have a 0 hours contract, these things are the worst thing in my job, plus the restrictions on my holidays."
bad,"If you want to move up in the company fast, this is your place. good benefit package, not a real team atmosphere."
bad,"Starbucks is usually filled with those friendly baristas that can provide an amazing customer service experience and conversation. However, baristas are very passive aggressive, and if you don't fit in, your hours get cut very severely."
bad,"Entreprise mal gérée avec beaucoup de favoritisme."
bad,"A typical day at Starbucks lasts between eight and nine hours, and consists of a lot of order taking and deep cleaning. It's not necessarily very hard, but there's a lot to do and the pace is very fast. Working at Starbucks taught me the value of time management and how to eliminate waste (Starbucks defines waste not only as the waste of products such as cups and syrups but of unnecessary movements that have no purpose. For example, grabbing everything you'll need from the backroom before returning to the front of house, instead of making multiple trips)."
bad,"Some of the employees are stuck up and rude, barely get hours"
bad,They ask way too much for way too little... Do not expect to have any kind of a life outside of Starbucks if you want to move up... and they will dangle that raise in front of you for years and years.
bad,"I had to get there at 430 am, and start opening up the store so it would be ready for opening at five. You have to have an incredible amount of patience - the people who come in are not necessarily going to be friendly or understanding that you're tired too. But if you work hard, show initiative, and keep your cool, it can actually be a really good job."
bad,"since I enjoy fashion, i actively seeked this job. I was hired as a part-time worker, and boy let me tell you, although these clothes did not come cheaply, profits were not well shared with its employees."
bad,"A typical day at work would start at 4 am to set up the unit and to do the paperwork (check the food, temperatures, coffee machine, seating area....) so to be well prepared to open at 5 am. Then every partner has a certain position (till, coffee station, tables..) in order to work effectively and fast. And the day consists of serving the customers, interacting with customers, filling up, cleaning the tables, ordering the food, filling up the daily planner and so on. All my co-workers were very friendly, helpful and supportive in every way. We had a good laugh during the shifts but also were concentrating to deliver the best service possible to the daily customers. The hardest part of the job was the early hours from 4-1 which are hard to do. The most enjoyable part of the job was satisfying the customers with the best cup of coffee as for many people it is a 'daily fix.' I also enjoyed working in the fast pace environment that always had something challenging for me to deal with. I was never bored which kept me motivated and engaged all the time. It is a good place to work if you like to interact with customers and love coffee."
bad,"Was constantly busy and you had to be a great multi-tasker, as well as great with communication skills. The down fall of it was the lack of motivation to keep everyone going. But I loved the busy enviorment and making customers happy."
bad,"I loved working at Starbucks it was awesome my coworkers were great, Store manager was awesome. But the store was a Francise the owner which is AAFES is horiable to work for got fired. for giving people that were working on something for us a drink."
bad,"You work without resting a minute, you are always under pressure, you have to ask the name of each customer like a robot and you have to smile, it is impossible to smile for 8 hours a day and asking the names of hundreds of people and when you don't do that they say it is unacceptable, often you finish late, but if you are late just a few minutes for your shift they start to give you partner files."
bad,"I have worked at Starbucks going on 6 years now. They have great benefits, I am currently enrolled in ASU through the Starbucks collage achievement plan. That being said, it is hard to have a decent work life balance with the expectations that you are held to, especially considering the pay is not competitive."
bad,"I didn't really enjoy working in such a fast paced, often stressful environment where customers are sometimes rude and snap at me while I was still in training. I had zero passion for coffee and customer service and felt out of alignment with my actual passions and dreams and it made me very stressed and depressed. Also, the amount of manual labor we were required to do, lifting heavy boxes, taking out trash and more, I feel we should have been paid more. The most enjoyable part of the job was actually cleaning the bathrooms because it gave me a break from all of the commotion that happed in the kitchen."
bad,It's a fun and easy place to work but the management can make all the difference. The guests can also make the job worthwhile along with the great benefits.
bad,The overall job requirements were easy to learn. I enjoyed getting to interact with customers and make drinks. The hardest part of the job was the management. I struggled to have my availability be respected in schedules and many times had to request that my bonuses for training new employees be given to me months after finishing training. The environment from all other employees was amazing and very inclusive.
bad,"My only regret was leaving the store I used to be at for a second rate replacement store. It paled so terribly compared to my old store, but oh well... I get that each store is going to be different, but those two were on totally different sides of the spectrum and that's not okay for a company like this."
bad,"This is the type of job that does not pay much but expects you to do back flips. The compensation factor is simply non existent and the management could not be any more difficult. The main manager is fantastic however, the shift leaders all have different expectations and different attitudes. It is pretty annoying to work in an environment that you simply do not know what you are showing up too. The best part of working here is the flexibility that they allow with scheduling and the discounts and perks you get."
bad,"The store I was hired at was very political with their employees. The store was divided and not in unity, there was no support for new hires. The manager set an uncomfortable tone and work environment. Assistant managers were micro managers and also made the work environment uncomfortable."
bad,"While working there was a joy, the management team was horrible and degraded and disrespected me on an unlimed amount of times. I sadly had to quit due to the toxic environment."
bad,"Sure, the online college benefits are great but it doesn't amount to the daily stress of peak/holiday hours.  I felt like a robot working here for 6 years too long. Up selling was also annoying after they overpay for a burnt cup of dark roast.  I was hired as full time in Hawaii and then transferred to Washington and was only allowed to be part-time.  Didn't pay enough to deal with all the rude, needy customers. Work at dutch bros instead."
bad,"It's a fun job and good benefits for college but if you're looking for a living wage this is not the job for you. Yes, the benefits are good but that should not mean that the company doesn't have to pay employees enough to live off of. Everyone I work with has to have 2 or 3 jobs and/or multiple roommates.  Not to mention the harrassment from the customers we are forced to endure now. This used to be an amazing place to work but it has been steadily going downhill  in my opinion."
bad,The people at my local don't care if they have a job.  Management is unstable. Hours are very low and the pay is not worth the stress. You are asked to do things you shouldn't do and get bullied and nothing is done about it
bad,Good wages and good schedule but the management is horrible. Incompetent people either get hired from outside the company or people who have no work ethic but suck up get promoted. Horrible customers and unrealistic expectations from corporate.
bad,It’s fine if you don’t need to make a lot of money to pay bills. You work really really hard for the $10/hour you make. High turn over rate. No education level required and customers are either wonderful or treat you like garbage
bad,"I started working here because of college and moving out, it was fun at first but they expect a lot from one person. It is very easy to get very over whelmed and there's not much you can do about it. The people I worked with were great, but the over all job was just too stressful and I had a lot of anxiety going into work everyday."
bad,"I had a terrible store manager who broke labor laws and was just generally out-of-line, and when he was reported to HR (Partner Resources) they did absolutely nothing."
bad,"Things were always breaking, the manager did not do her job very well, baristas were very competitive with each other. Trying to move up in the company was virtually impossible if you worked at nights."
bad,"Although this is an enjoyable place to work, I feel as though they could pay their ""partners"" more than what they start out as. I am struggling to pay my bills with being paid 1400 a month, its just kind of outrageous for such a big company as Starbucks."
bad,"I learned a lot about self sufficiency and how to smoothly run a coffee shop. I also learned about people. What made them excited, what brought them down, and how they reacted to problems. I also learned that injustice is inevitable in the workplace, that it's something everyone must face at some point in their career, and that a respectful open mind is crucial for getting through it."
bad,Starbucks as a FoH employee is a fast paced environment perfect for people as a first job or if they enjoy that kind of environment.  They are accommodating to your school schedule and understanding about your life outside of work.
bad,"Starbucks was almost always a fun environment, sadly the last few years are plagued with outside hiring management which creates problems of its own as well as just plain mismanagement and petty store drama."
bad,"While the people I worked with was very enjoyable and the pleasant regulars that came by every time, it does not make the lack of proper care from corporate or their decision to have rude and entitled customers walk all over us excusable."
bad,There was A lot of drama With co workers and there use of marijuana. All of my co workers were rude to me and the customers. My breaks were Never scheduled properly
bad,"This job solely depends on how it’s scheduled that day. The right people make the day work, the wrong make it torturous. If you just need a job to pay the bill and get some cheaper coffee this is great, but once in lower management (Shift Supervisor) it can be extremely difficult to move past that. Most of"
bad,"a typical day at work was pretty routine, didnt really learn anything new ."
bad,For the things you have to do and deal with at this job they should NOT be paying their employees minimum wage. They don’t care about their employees at all- I worked there for 2.5 years and never got a raise even though I was the only one that did my job and stayed at the store that long. You can’t ask customers to leave so we had homeless people bathing in our bathrooms and digging through our trash (and I worked in a nice city)
bad,"Partners are hard to deal with. Rather than helping fix your mistakes as a new partner, they gossip about it and embarrass you in front of customers. Everyone overpowered manager."
bad,"Very good daily grind type of job but after a few months of the same people and same routine the job turns into a nightmare especially if the management is disorganized and passes blame onto others. That being said there are many many many Starbucks across the united states. So the experiences I have had might differ vastly from store to store. Overall a good job to make some cash and enjoy benefits from, that is, if you can wake up for the opening shifts on time..."
bad,"Making drinks is fun when the team is staffed enough to fully take pride in your craft. What often happens is shifts are poorly scheduled and the team is under too much pressure to create quality product. The customers are also some of the more entitled. All together its a very draining job and you put up with a lot for 9/hr and a free bag of coffee every week."
bad,"Some stores are managed better than others. I worked at 5 different stores, they all had their plus and minuses. Managers aren’t the best, customers are the worst."
bad,"Days at starbucks really vary depending on the attitudes of both customer and coworkers. Coworkers at this company are emotional sponges, Customers are either really great or really entitled, management would rarely intervene and stick up for staff. The most enjoyable part would probably be interacting with customers who actually enjoy the small interactions, the hardest would just be dealing with negativity from my own staff."
bad,"I worked with several other high schoolers and the place was always mismanaged, messy, and uncomfortable. The gossip ran wild and it was overall not an enjoyable experience."
bad,"The place is very to work out! The employees are super fun and welcoming. Had a bad experience with the management team, a lot of bullying, getting yelled at for no reason, lots of stress for no reason. It was at a point where I didn’t want to work at the same time as the management team. Lots of criticism but no words of appreciation when doing a very good job. The schedule is very hard to work with especially if you are in school, the manager might forget that sometimes."
bad,"Ideal for someone young who needs a flex schedule but this is not a position for anyone who needs to pay bills or survive at all. The pay is horrible, you're on your feet all day and no benefis."
bad,"I really wanted to love working here, but the management was so poor that I couldn’t. I was trained by an SM who had no idea what they were doing, as they were just hired a few weeks prior and had never trained anyone. She would tell me things that were wrong or not communicate at all. I was asked to come in two weeks before I was supposed to start and was never told about the rule of wearing a hat. I was told there was no way to get my work schedule and my DM would just “text it to me.” After reaching out to her multiple times she never replied. I was never paid and no one explained why. Overall it was really fun learning bar and hanging out with my coworkers, but then one of them hit on me very aggressively and I just had to quit. I wanted to love working there because the culture is fun and it’s rewarding, but I felt set up to fail."
bad,was a good job to have in highschool however people are not the most kind and they expect you to remember their drink on the first day no matter what.
bad,"My Starbucks location was extremely busy and fast-paced. Baristas made less than $10/hour plus tips, which was still not enough for minimum wage. Job eventually gave me repetitive motion injuries."
bad,"No te dan mas tiempo para poder terminar de limpiar la tienda, los cierres comienzan desde que la tienda cierra hasta la 1:30 de la mañana, pero dan demasiadas labores que es difícil terminar a esa hora, y si te pasaste ya no te pagan las horas extra."
bad,"the position did not pay well enough for living in Seattle and putting up with as much as a starbucks barista has to put up with. Glad I obtained some coffee experience. Corporate office definitely does not care about their lower level employees, although they try to say otherwise."
bad,Starbucks is a great company to work for in general but your experience will be shaped by the manager you have. In 3.5 years I have had 4 managers and only one of them was an effective manager the rest were a nightmare and made work a nightmare.
bad,"提供有系統完善的員工培訓"
bad,"The constant push to cut labor but also expect employees to do twice as much work really sucked. Constant feuds between co-workers. Theres always q divide between morning shifts and closing shifts, no matter the store."
bad,I truly hated my time with this company.  I was with them for just over a year and they continuously would cut the hours allowed per week while also increasing the duties needed to be completed.  The atmosphere is awful bc everyone is overworked and underpaid.
bad,"Working at Starbucks was not enjoyable. Working a morning shift, every customer is tired and grumpy and just wants coffee. Our lines were long for hours, with constant commotion, with poor organization, management, cleanliness, and care toward customer satisfaction. Starbucks employees got bullied by customers, yelled at, and cursed at for minor errors. The supervisors at my location were uneducated, immature people who took their anger out on their employees, and put blame on everyone but themselves. The environment was built on criticism and no motivation. When there is down time and customers have cleared out for a while, it is required that we stay busy, however staying busy usually meant that if you're not wiping something down that is already clean, you are slacking off. There is no time to breath, lunch breaks are not long enough, and all together the job felt like an abusive relationship that is hard to leave because of all of it's ""perks"". The hardest part of the job was how rude the customers are comfortable with being. They will yell, curse, and throw things at you with no regard for you. My location also had homeless people showering in our bathrooms, walking around the cafe screaming to themselves, or other customers, sleeping on our benches, or attempting to steal, every day. "
bad,starbucks will stick its neck out to keep a customer before it they will decide to help an employee. I have seen firsthand an employee getting mistreated by management and in the end the employee was let go and the management was not held accountable.
bad,Starbucks is a great place to work with no skills entry point. One is rewarded for hard work at a store level. There is little to no room for advancement beyond the supervisor role as the next position of assistant store manager has a low amount of spots in any given district. Competition is replaced with favoritism over competence.
bad,"Would not recommend anyone with a degree or family to work here. Far too many high school aged employees. Pay doesn’t support a living by any means! Benefits are great, but not worth the hassle of living below poverty for free lattes."
bad,I loved working at Starbucks but I worked at a Aramark Starbucks and they didn't treat us well. I was a student worker but they cared more about us making money instead of us as students. I did love my friends I made at this job.
bad,"If you're new, and don't get along with everyone right away, you're slightly getting outcasted. They seem friendly, but I guess to each their own, ya know?"
bad,"okay for a job that pays the job pays for one person income, which is not much when you consider working and income expensies in denver and the rural areas"
bad,you expect window times to be great but do not give enough hours to schedule staff. Or when peak time is over you do not care about drive thru times. So night times become crazy hard on the workers because there is only 2-3 people at times and have so much to clean and get ready for the morning the next day.
bad,"Learnt alot of new things, a typical day at work would be prepping coffee for next day's cold brew, preparing customer's drinks order, topping up food, collecting cups and plates, washing them, sweep and mop the floor"
bad,The manager was very Racist words me. She made it impossible for me to work there until I had to quit. After Quiting I over heard the she started targeting someone else.
bad,"starbucks has something about hiring the coolest people ever."
bad,"I used to love my job. But then I realized that the people I work with tend to be very cliquish and have the tendency to talk about one another behind their backs. I suppose that's just a part of working with people, but I don't necessarily like the fact that my manager ALSO talks about employees behind their backs to other employees. There's very obvious favoritism between a few of the baristas and our manager. If you're not that fast, say goodbye to your hours. If you don't get along with everyone, say goodbye to your hours. If the manager doesn't like you, BYE BYE HOURS."
bad,Not great. A lot of drama and team members are just not friendly. They do not  like to work and it can cause the Manager ( myself ) to put in a lot of extra not paid hours which disrupts work life balance.
bad,"Starbucks has the ability to appear outwardly appealing to a young audience looking for work after high school.  However, it is not worth it with low pay (lower than state minimum) by use of an excuse of tips being included as apart of your pay. My location was constantly busy, but had the 2nd lowest tip rate in the entire city.  Therefore we were always paid under minimum wage.  They were also sued by another barista in the state as they were found out to be neglecting state law on over time.  Their benefits are only usable by those who work a certain number of hours, which any manager seems very keen to make sure any one employee does not hit without themselves being very pushy."
bad,"Long hours, being asked to pick up and transport product DAILY, very poor moral among the staff. My store had girls that would literally FIGHT, and the manager did nothing. Very cut throat and toxic environment. And this is coming from an ex-supervisor who was with the company for 3 years."
bad,A typical work day at Starbucks depending on the time and day is considerably stressful. I work at a very busy location and my supervisors would often have me on bar for my whole shift(5-8hrs) which meant I would go home physically and mentally exhausted. It is a fun working environment if you have nice hardworking coworkers otherwise it can be a very unenjoyable shift. I have had a handful of power abusive supervisors as well as lazy managers. I would only recommend this job if you're looking to be part-time or if you're pursuing a shift supervisor position.
bad,"I worked there as a closer for around a year or so and was often left alone during my shift to handle all aspects of the job. They provide free drinks and food occasionally, but the upper management was terrible."
bad,Clearly a bad match for me in terms of career desires and work demands. 8ppl working in a very small area in an environment of consistent near panic...
bad,"Starbucks has wonderful people working in the store but Store Managers aren't given enough hours to schedule to appropriately staff the store. This causes the people who do work at each store to have to perform in an environment that is stressful and does not allow them to relax. I used to come home every day with high anxiety because I had to make Drinks, take orders and clean the store all at the same time - because the upper management felt having enough people cost too much. This also makes wait times longer which means that the customers are less happy. It's not their fault bean counters (literally) are making the baristas do three people's job at once."
bad,"I'd recommend this job only to college students or to someone looking to make an extra dollar. They are very flexible, however the benefits are not tailored to someone with a preexisting medical condition."
bad,"I had no key holders as the store manager, because no-one wanted to be responsible for a crew of only two during rush hours."
bad,Worked for the company in totally exactly 2 years and had to deal with a lot of mistreatment management has favourites and lets it be known doesn't actually absorb complaints and what they mean to you as a worker . Makes you feel like you can be replaced at any moment you lack job security.
bad,"I loved working for starbucks for years. The pay isn't great but the relations you get with your fellow partners is wonderful. Apply anywhere else but the reserve. Or wait until there is new management. We had 5 people quit within a week period. Including people who had been there to see the store launch and had several season pulls of new beans. I am extremely disappointed in Starbucks. The atmosphere at the reserve made many talented and amazing baristas feel they had to go elsewhere to look for proper management. The work is hard but it make time move by fast, and if you have a passion for coffee...the time will fly. With the reserve you'll learn new brewing methods and for those who are new to coffee- you'll learn latte art."
bad,"I enjoy working at Starbucks I love my coworkers, as well as my customers. A typical day involves me brewing all of the teas, coffees, checking thermometers, and organizing the pastries before the store opens. Throughout the day I take orders, make drinks, make sure the display cases are well stocked, and the store is clean. Cleanliness, and date dots are very important to us. We move quickly, and do our best to avoid causing messes. Customer Satisfaction is our aim."
bad,"My typical day at work involves dealing with a large number of customers and having to work as a team with my other colleagues,  I have learnt a lot during my time at Starbucks, such as how to be patient, what the work life is like and my confidence has grew. the management at Starbucks varies from being good to bad, some members of the management are so lovely to work with and are so kind yet the others are completely different. The hardest part of the job is having to wake up so early for my shifts, which sometimes isn't so bad but other days it can be, and I think the most enjoyable part of my job would be working with people who I can now call my friends."
bad,"Depends on the manager. In general, the story is always the same. Less hours, low pay, especially for people who want to work well. They burn out their good employees and let the slackers stay."
bad,It’s just a job. Work to your best ability. Starbucks exspects a lot from you so be prepared to work more than you exspect to during your shift. Management at Starbucks needs lots of work and baristas need to correct managers almost more than half the time
bad,"The second you move up is when management  starts taking advantage of you. They leverage your pay and benefits as a way to guilt trip you into working outside of your availability. A coffee house should not be such an epicenter for stress or hostility. That being said when i worked as a part time barista it was a blast! The hours were right in my availability, the benefits were more than fair and the work pace was a lot more manageable."
bad,"The ""everyday"" day at work starts out fast and hellacious right from the get go and normally all the way up until the post-afternoon hours such as 10 and 11am."
bad,"Some stores are amazing to work at: the manager is friendly and caring and there is this team effort and camaraderie with the coworkers. Other stores are awful. It is hit or miss, just like anywhere else, how great of a manager you will get. But the ones that are awful are REALLY awful and make every day miserable. All stores experience the same stress of meeting several impossibly high goals. As a Shift Supervisor, you are expected to manage the absolute minimum staff to meet standards for speed of service, quality of beverages, customer service, sales goals and cleanliness, while at the same time managing all the cash and product in the store and receiving and putting in the orders before cut off periods- conveniently right when the busy time ends. Some stores are not too busy. But most are busy at some point or another and very regularly deal with being short staffed. A lot of customers treat you very poorly, but you are expected to get to know and be kind to every single one. Your performance is very highly judged based on your customer interactions. Starbucks has extremely high expectations for cleanliness, customer service, product knowledge, and sales; yet the staffing and training is often very lacking. It is so complicated to learn all the rules that I don't think I've met anyone who has in five years. The company is great in all the benefits it gives and the social initiatives. But most stores just don't follow through."
bad,"Out of all reviews i've read this should let you know what to decide. Honestly it's an amazing company the benefits and all, but the people you end up working with in the long run, DO NOT make it worth it at all. I've worked with so many different managers over 5 different ones in the 4 years I worked there. Starbucks in NYC has great pay, but you won't get scheduled alot of hours and it's not guaranteed. Most managers in Starbucks, treat you like you are lesser of a person and talk down to you as if you don't work for the same company or so. It's just not a realistic job in the sense, where people will ask you for things and expect you to do everything for them. It's pretty annoying. Also Under-staffing is a big issue if you work in a busy store."
bad,"Après un an en tant que barista chez la franchise Starbucks dans le nord pas de calais, j'arrive à Paris où l'on met fin à ma période d'essai (pile le jour de la fin de mes deux mois d'essais, quel hasard !) sous prétexte de deux absences maladies justifiées. ""Ce n'est pas du tout à cause de votre travail, vous travaillez même très bien"" ... Mais nous n'avons pas envie de payer davantage pour vous. Merci. Au revoir. "
bad,Love working here with the regular customers and the hourly staff. Once you hit the salary staff however they feel a sort of entitlement that shouldn’t exist. I love a fast paced always busy environment but as a shift surpervisor my baristas saw a lot of stress because of the amount of pressure put on them by the lack of coverage and lack of things being completed during the day. This when addressed with salary amangers was never resolved just told on multiple occasions that they won’t give us help until we show improvement.
bad,"it was a interesting place to work however, not enough hours and the pay wasn't too great. Worked under 20 hours a week and wasn't given opportunities to get more hours"
bad,"starbucks was a good job but not a career for me. their is no way I could ever live off starbucks, poor management not enough pay, hours were good every once in a while but not consistant. some days were better than others but the only thing I will miss is the customers and the benfits."
bad,"Being a Store Manager at Starbucks in the Orange County market is very different than headquarters would like to believe. It's challenging to staff stores with the pay offered, despite an incredibly competitive total pay package. Store Managers are constantly putting out fires and there is no flexibility to focus on what's really important."
bad,Starbucks is constantly busy and doesn't pay their employees enough for the work they do. The management made a terrible schedule and co- workers were rude at time. Many of the customers were rude and manager had favoritism towards certain employees and employees were highly underappreciated for the work they did. Overall a terrible place to work where I dreaded going to every single day.
bad,"I worked there for five and a half years, left so my wife and I could travel for a bit. Came back 6 months later and the company would only recognize me as a new hire (rehire). I was over looked for a bonus that was given to partners with 3 years of service to the company and was overlooked for a pay raise befitting of my accumulated years, as apposed to my rehire date. I would say it's not the company, but the store I was in, but I've worked in 5 different stores in 3 different districts, with a dozen different store managers and 4 different district managers; all of them with different styles and demeanors, but the same result. No accountability for the store managers or district managers. I was very grateful for the stock options and massively discounted health benefits, but you're literally a number to corporate."
bad,"At this position here I was working as a Barista at Starbucks where I was making and serving coffee to customers on a daily basis, I was also cooking and preparing different foods and desserts that customers were ordering along with their coffees and frappuccincos, working the cash register by handling money and taking orders from the customers, and stocking up new coffees, food, utensil, and drink products in the shop.  The hardest parts of this job was that it was very fast paced job, I was consistently on my feet for hours, alot of movement and keeping track of everything.  The most enjoyable parts of this job was that I interacted with different individuals everyday, it was in downtown so I had enjoyed the great view of the downtown area, and i loved the benefits that the company gave to its employees."
bad,"Was a good place to work, but there is a lot of deep cleaning involved, as with any restaurant, but I was working at the kiosk in the Mall of Louisiana. They had me on my hands and knees scrubbing the floors some days. It was also a tiny workspace. Very hard to move around and do your job. It was also tough on all of us because it was located under the big skylight, so we were always sweating and hot! I did love the people though. My manager wasn't the easiest to get along with, but she did her best. I had to leave because of unforeseen circumstances outside of work. I honestly only miss the people I worked with and the customers I came to know in the short time I worked there."
bad,"This is a great company to work for, unfortunately the upper level management in the greater Houston area is pretty bad. At the store level as well as at the district level, upper management repeatedly shows that they do not care if the 'partners' needs are being met financially or otherwise. They will continually give you more work/responsibilities not it is rare they will give you a raise or compensate you for going above and beyond./"
bad,Grato lugar para trabajo  y mucho compañerismo y amor al café
bad,"for someone who has a chronic illness like i do, it was very had to keep up with the physical and emotional demands of said job. The management at my store was completely unhelpful and disrespectful"
bad,"I love the atmosphere of Starbucks but the environment can be a little too much at times. I worked there when management was lacking, which that meant not enough products, staff, and supplies to handle the amount of business we were getting. At the end it was too stressful."
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job was rush period. You do drinks continuously and still happy at the end of the day that you survive the shift. I like the corrective actions they do when someone violates something. They don't bypass things. They are also strict with the time when going to class at the support center. Management are friendly and some baristas are not.
bad,"I liked working for Starbucks, there was lots of friendly outgoing people. At the beginning it was great. My co-workers were on time and actually showed up for their shifts. The management was very friendly to me when I was showing I was hard working. The hardest part of the job was when I was sick, no one would cover me.That rose up to me missing a day,and almost being terminated.The manger was not very nice to me.I was treated different by co-workers.I eventually quit after 2 months of torture."
bad,I learned how having to do things in a timely and proper manner under pressure and dealing with unhappy customers and their needs. but i also leanred how to make friends and be responsible with time and people skills. It easy to have an availabilty there but the hours are terrible because of you take a certain day off then the your hours get cut and it just doesnt work.
bad,"Typical corporate company expecting a constant increase in sales and productivity but never wants to hand out raises or even living wages. They claim they want to grow their employees but quite often choose outside hires instead of current employees when it comes to manager positions. Customers are grueling, hours are unpredictable and inconsistent, pay is low."
bad,"I have had the pleasure to work for this company which is such a great company. although this was a great company the management was horrible, we as barista were treated unfairly, management really didn't want to hear form barista they only believed their supervisors which is not fair."
bad,"Starbucks offers many jobs to people of all different ages and classes as long as you are friendly and nice to talk to. However, their pay of their employees is abysmal and should be shamed. Working here is very taxing yet employees are compensated on the scale of minimum wage."
bad,Lost my job because someone wanted to move up inthe compant and even though it was clear to see 8 people were let go. This should not have happened.
bad,"No habia muy buena paga, el grupo con el que trabajaba no era responsable y era muy desordenado y malhumorado. Lo que se reflejaba con los clientes."
bad,"Fasted paced high turnover job.  Management is OK, but they like to cut corners on costs at the expense of their employees.  Most customers are friendly and fun to talk to.  Good team based atmosphere."
bad,The best part about Starbucks is the free coffee in every kitchen and the recognition of Global Brand.
bad,"If you're fresh out of high school and looking to find your first job, Starbucks may very well be for you.  Flexible schedules, great benefits, and a free drink every shift all lend toward a fast-paced and exciting work environment that takes care of its people.  Starbucks offers an extensive and effective training program for all of its partners right when they walk in the door, creating a confident work force that stands out with its ""Starbucks is the best"" attitude."
bad,"Let me start off by saying, Starbucks is a fantastic place to work. Great benefits, ample opportunity to advance in the company, easy work (we call it monkey work because everyone can do it), and generally a fun place to work. However, the location I worked at (I later transferred to a different location and had the best work experience ever) was what ruined it for me. That location showed me what money hungry, corporate snobs, would do to make everyone miserable. Howard Schultz would be ashamed of how those people are disregarding his Starbucks vision."
bad,Great detected staff all round it was one of those learning classes in life that you have to take
bad,"Everyday is always a new learning.studying and learning never stops at Starbucks. I learned to be more engaging and customer oriented and focused. My co-workers are like family. Hardest part of job is to smile even you're not ok.Most enjoyable, was, being able to be a skilled barista, preparing quality beverages."
bad,"The environment is great for progression and advancement in the ranks. However, the management in NYC is full of dullards and dimwits. Hopefully the regional manager will see how their district managers are harassing those within their area. This company should rework its management system."
bad,"Defiantly the perks of the position were worth it free drinks ,employee discount on products and one free product a week plus benefits and pay all wonderful if you can manage to deal with everything else!"
bad,"It's a cool job. Main issue is there aren't any consequences for anything ever done. Show up late, don't show up at all, etc... nothing happens. So we're often short handed but that's just for my store. It's typically fun aside from all of that. Great benefits, I work with some great people."
bad,"Management not the best. Outstanding co-workers."
bad,I start my day off by checking our sales numbers from the previous day. I set up goals and tasks that need to be accomplished by each of our workers for the day. I Identify our sale goals needed for that day and set up my deployment of the floor according to what will best help us that day. I create counts of our sold or markout product from the previous day so I am able to order the proper amount of product for the rest of the week.
bad,This I mean they say they that the customer is number one but thus fells as if this is not true.
bad,"A typical day at Starbucks consists of brewing coffee, stocking products, cleaning constantly, dealing with customers and making drinks. When there's nothing to do you are expected to find something to do, even if its something you've already done and doesn't really need to be done again."
bad,"While working at Starbucks I feel like I am part of something positive. I believe the company is doing good for the world. However, I have found it incredibly hard to grow within this company. There is no path for developing talent and a lot of the open positions are filled by outside hires."
bad,I just relit like I don’t belong and school didn’t matter to them. It seemed like my work life Han do consideration for my education and personal needs
bad,"Did not enjoy my time at SBUX, I find the culture fake and they are really greedy in terms of sales....it is never enough for them...all they want is more and more sales...."
bad,I found this position to be stressful lots of bending to clean and lots of demanding work that is very hard to accomplish in the time and very anxiety inducing work environment.
bad,"Besides the lack of diversity among the employees I also found unfair treatment, & favorites amongst team leaders. A fast paced environment that could be fun under the right management"
bad,"Poor management, no communication, lazy coworkers, no enough payment wage, short breaks."
bad,Environment wasn't very good and the company doesn't seem to hold certain people accountable for unjust actions. The manager can behave unfairly and be  practically untouchable because of the district managers incompetence.
bad,"It has its ups and downs like most jobs, but merit based raises do not exist. Occasional inflation / minimum wage matching raises, to a slight degree. Equal pay for new hires of same position as veterans, but job security and benefits are helpful."
bad,If youre lucky enough to get a good manager it can be a good job for a while. But the company doesnt care about you. They lure you in with benifets to blind you from the fact that unless you become a manager you are stuck making slightly more than minimum wage. After 5 years as a supervisor i made $1 dollar more than min and same as those who just started supervising
bad,"I still work for Starbucks because the pay is alright compared to other jobs in the area, and I enjoy working with my coworkers. Benefits are good, could be better though. "
bad,In the beginning I loved working for Starbucks. I have worked at two stores and 2/4 of my managers have been wonderful. Management needs work in order for Starbucks employees to have their third place.
bad,"The store that I work at has become exceptionally busier in the last year and at first, I thought that the incredibly draining and demanding shifts were just a part of adapting to the newness of it all. I no longer believe that's true. You will be expected to do the work of two people for a wage that doesn't even begin to cover your living expenses. There is no room to negotiate save for roughly a $0.20 cent raise every year. Customers are gaining confidence in treating the staff at my store poorly as my manager has become desperate to place customer connection scores over everything else and will give customers whatever they want for the sake of a good survey review. Of course, once you get hired there's very little you can do to get fired. For the sake of the people already working at this position, don't apply here unless you're ready to work and work hard. This is a position where teamwork is vital. You have to love your coworkers, you have to love making coffee and you have to all be in this together because that's the only way you won't be miserable."
bad,"Working at Starbucks opened up my eyes to what it was like to be in a hectic working environment. However, not all days were hectic, some were pretty slow. A typical Starbucks barista's day included mostly of making beverages, heating up snacks and sandwiches, and stocking."
bad,"this place offer good work life balance, and management encourages promotions and personal development. I have been here for about 4 months and learned a lot."
bad,"Can get hectic at times but its always satisfying to see a customer happy, starbucks teaches you patience, cleanliness and taking initiave when needed. Good life lessons that will follow you even when you're no longer with the team."
bad,"It can be a nice place to work, but every location is consistently understaffed.  Managers make a great salary but the baristas are so poorly paid it's impossible to keep them around long enough to build a good team."
bad,"Genelleme yapmamak gerekirse nerede vasıfsız karaktersiz kişiliği oturmamış hayattan tek beklentisi boş gezip gereksiz ortamlarda takılmak çevre yapmak isteyen insanların toplandığı firma."
bad,Dépends beaucoup de l'équipe avec qui l'on travaille.
bad,"Empresa inclusiva, desarrollo de habilidades, capacitaciones y orientación al cliente."
bad,"C'est vraiment un emploi à la chaîne comme Amazon mais pour les boissons. On doit apprendre beaucoup d'un coup genre un caramel machiato on doit mettre cm sur le gobelet et savoir toute la recette et ils ont ce qu'il appel le beuvrage routine ( lait shot sirop ) pour une rémunération de barista de 1000€ et d'un shift environ 1200€. Très bien pour ceux qui ont entre 18 et 20ans . "
bad,"Baristas and shifts are underpaid. There are a lot of bad store managers who get away with horrible behavior for too long before things get really bad. The company keeps adding more to the job with the same pay as before, makes no sense."
bad,Starbucks requires constant learning of new drinks and the ability to adapt to a customers need. The pay is not fair considering how many diffeerent tasks one must accomplish compared to a single position job.
bad,"The work is extremely stressful, always have a line to the belt, no down time, people call in all the time and you have to make up for it. No work life balance. The pay isn’t worth the amount of stress and hard work required. Much harder work than you can imagine."
bad,"I work at a licensed Starbucks, so the information I provide isn't about the company it's self. Its about being weary about apply to a licensed vs corporate store. The store I worked at was terrible and I had an terrible experience. I stayed there for two years because I needed the money for college but I had had enough when the management decided to hire supervisors that had never worked in any coffee related jobs and told me, a shift lead, to train my new boss on how everything works. It was a terrible situation and it left the store in complete chaos, as we had 11 new hires at once with only about 10 experienced workers to train them on the job at an extremely busy location. These new supervisors with new experience undermined me and other shift leads, as well as provide incorrect information to new baristas. I got so fed up that I put in my two weeks notice last night. If you are looking into to working at a Starbucks location, make sure it's a corporate store so you get treated better and have a healthier work environment."
bad,i had a good time at first and then a bad one cuz work relationships but it was also a real stressful job that took a toll on everyone. It was really fast paced at times and a lot of pressure was put on me over very small things that didn't really matter.
bad,"its not that good of a company , I feel like its overrated and the business can sometimes be a hassle. if its ran correctly can be a secure and great job"
bad,"Starbucks preaches 'time worked is time paid' - which is great for a barista or shift supervisor - however as a manager you're working 50 hours to get YOUR work done and put in your time on the floor. Additionally you're on call 24/7. So if a shift supervisor calls in sick, you're going in. The result is a 60/70 hour work week some weeks. It's not worth it in the long run. Use Starbucks as a stepping stone job to your next CAREER."
bad,"I absolutely loved my time at Starbucks thanks to the staff I worked with, it was fun and rewarding. The only reason I left the job was because of management, the manager here was driving staff away weekly with their bullying and horrible attitude! Always humiliating staff in front of other staff and customers."
bad,"Been employed for a couple of years, budgets are tight so labour is scarce, expected to do a lot more than being paid for, loss of penalty rates, overall training not the best"
bad,"Job is really easy and fun. Great benefits, great opportunity to engage and network with different kinds of people. Only thing that makes this kind of job go sour is poor management, they make the job tougher than it has to be. Hours are bad in certain times of the year. Ideal for a second job."
bad,"Basically im joining because im a coffee person , a coffee drinker . Working there is"
bad,"Pay is basic and job is basic, did not want to work there over my summer. my manager was over bearing. This was a good job if you are a student wanting to earn extra cash"
bad,"We do a lot of customer interaction and drink making, which is creative and interesting, but our pay is very low, and schedules are not consistent. Additionally, there is not enough accountability for management, so it takes a long time to correct harmful behavior in management."
bad,"It’s great to work for the company, inner management not so great.  They’re very shady and will try to get you fired at whatever the cost.   At least where I worked my sm was the devil incarnate and she wAs friends with the dm ( super shady).   She made the store look like a joke and we lost about 80 Percent of our regular customers cause of her"
bad,"Fast paced, stressful work environment every store differs. Starbucks once highly valued there parents but have been lacking in recent years.  I do appreciate the focus in customer service but all the added drinks can be ridiculous."
bad,"I was hired on during an obvious difficult time for this location. Very poor management."
bad,"It really depends on who is your manager. I has a few accidents at work ranging from an asthma attack to now chronic back pain and I never received support it was basically walk it off and come back. Management shorted pay to make up their own hours. I quit because a higher up filmed me while on the job without my consent. As a shift Supervisor, the pay did not match up to io was doing a store manager job for shift paythe expectations."
bad,"Lack of management and fair pay made me quit. Working for 1 and a half, I had a 20 cent raise and my tips were usually 50 cents or less every hour I worked. However they automatically take out like 55 cents an hour for tips so at times they were just taking away my money? I didn’t find this out til my last check. If you need a job that actually pays your bills, I would suggest finding something else."
bad,Starts off great but goes down after the barista experience wears off. It becomes less about drinks and coffee craft and more about standards and rules. You could also have a great team but awful shift supervisors who go on power trips and critique minor details that are irrelevant. Simply put baristas don't get paid enough for all the work that is put in.
bad,"It is a very stressful, quick paced job and the pay is minimum wage. If you run into any problems with your store manager and try to take it to corporate they will just tell you there's nothing they can do."
bad,I don't like working there because of the management and how they get away with things we would be in massive trouble for. Also we aren't allowed to take tips which is ridiculous.
bad,"I quit the location (no I did not put in my two weeks). The supervisor was always degrading at the location I worked at. Other then that amazing co-workers, experience in social skills and lots of others, and decent benefits, the morning rushes are stressful and you need to multitask. If I'm honest your underpaid and overworked."
bad,"District manager & store managers got away with a lot that corporate overlooked because our location was inconvenient to travel to."
bad,"The company offers a lot of benefits. However, the pay is pretty bad. Also, Starbucks only allows so many hours for floor coverage and it is not enough. Most of the time it is a struggle trying to fulfill customer needs with only two people on the floor. Also, managers are pretty much allowed to do whatever they want and everyone else has to pick up the slack. They can leave half way through their shift or sit in the back room doing ""paperwork"" and taking ""important calls"" with their friends. I had three managers while working here and two of them did the same things."
bad,"Your happiness with this job will be greatly determined by what store and what manager combo you get. Cafe stores are great, drive-thru stores were so stressful I cried a few times. "
bad,"I have been working at Starbucks part-time, good atmosphere and fun people and the store managers cared about baristas and really tried to work with our schedule."
bad,"A typical work day is customer and tasked focused. There is a lot of pressure placed on employees to ensure customer satisfaction. Also, there are a lot of small tasks that need constant attention that most people don't consider before accepting the job. Overall, the company has a lot of great benefits and perks, but there are a lot of behind the scenes things that don't make it worth it in my experience."
bad,Although the company offers A lot of different benefits they are actually just tricking you to pay you no where near what you deserve. Especially since you are not even asked would you rather get paid more or get to have a pastry when ya work??!!  I bent over backwards for that company and never got the pay or recognition I deserved.
bad,"In the 3 years I was with the company I received 2 raises, and as a supervisor made 9.50, which that alone is not enough to live on even with a roommate. The management chain was very corrupt at the time I was employed there and lacked basic professionalism."
bad,"This was an awful place to work as a supervisor. Everyone power trips and searches for drama. If you do one thing wrong you are crucified and witch hunted out of that location unless of course you are one of the managers favorite people. That's all this job is - a political and social game. I've never seen so much blatant bullying in a job before and if you are a supervisor it's even worse. You don't have any say in anything even if your title says you do. Instead you get paid a extra $2 to be crapped on and expected to do the managers job for them. Somehow I managed to keep this job for 4 years, but that wasn't without its fair share of horror stories. I worked at 5 stores over that time, always hoping for the best and getting extremely disappointed each time. My last shift at this job was a 5-10 am shift and my manager got it covered for me without telling me because she was worried i wouldn't show up which I had never no-showed in all 4 years of that job. My box of things was also mysteriously thrown away and I never received an apology for any of this. Starbucks also likes to break the law about breaks and tries to search for any loop hole to cover their butts. If you're break means a loss in $10 sales, you can bet you won't be getting your legally entitled break and if you are the supervisor that sent that break you'll be written up (in which I was). You can't make this up. I'm generally a liked person and a strong worker with strong references to back this all up. DO NOT WORK HERE."
bad,"Hardly any training from management, and was warned about the high turnover from assistant managers. Work hours were either too high, or too low. Would not recommend."
bad,"Just not good. The formal training is a slideshow that I didn't take until 2 months into the job. Very stressful, bad management, low pay would not allow me to live in my area without another job."
bad,"I am not interested in writing this review but my computer has been taken hostage. I did not enjoy my time at Starbucks because the focus was always on pushing sales when those come about on their own. You don't get paid $8.50 an hour to make coffee, no you must fill displays, be harassed by caffeine fiends, clean toilets, and comply with whatever silly whim corporate comes up with to make your job more difficult."
bad,Management is horrible. Managers never show up. Employees are rude and very messy around the store. Always have rude customers because we run out of everything.
bad,"We were always busy, no matter what time of day. I learned so much about customer service and retail. Management fluctuated depending on who the manager was at that point in time."
bad,"ganz ok. herachie flach."
bad,"Get ready to work hard, work fast, work well, always smile and make chump change you can't live off. Also, forget the insurance and college fund...that only kicks in if you work full time, but you'll never get full time hours. Next...."
bad,The customers make or break the job.  It was the best of times and it was the worst of times. The management is not uniform through the company. Management styles vary significantly.
bad,"Most coworkers were great, but the others were unbearably rude. Customers were mostly kind, some were awesome, others were disgustingly rude. Dirty in the back and bad sanitation."
bad,"Working at Starbucks is more than people think, a lot of different skills are needed, including teamwork and ability to manage time effectively. I always need to know who is working that day in order to plan the cleaning and tasking so that it can get done at a reasonable time. Making latte's is easy, but connecting with customers and with the other people working there is hard. Not many people realize that there is more to a latte than coffee, and we work really hard to make sure that everyone who enters the store has a great day."
bad,"I didn’t love this job but it wasn’t the absolute worst. Customers are very pushy and particular. Sometimes they would be mean to the employees almost for fun, it seemed. But the girls I worked with were great!"
bad,"Depending on your role, this job can be a wonderful place, but as upper management, there is a poor work life balance, and you are in a high stress environment most of the time."
bad,"This job is definitely for a certain type of person. You have to be really on top of things, a quick learner, and an even better multitasked. You also have to be able to let things people say to you go. There are some mean, rude people but there are a lot more customers that are nice and you will end up connecting with. My overall experience with Starbucks has been great and I have been with them for almost three years."
bad,to be complete honest Starbucks was used by me as a filler job until I found a job that seemed interesting to me at the time.... both times I worked here I was young and stupid..... I haven't worked fro Starbucks for a long time so it may be a different place to work now
bad,"The store where I used to work at was located in a mall. It would get bit overwhelming but it'd get easier. Most of the partners got along great and was a fun environment to work in. With the exception of the manager, He was very nice and had lots of positive energy. His management a was bit disorganized with scheduling. Almost all the partners had issues with the schedule and it was a bit frustrating with him not accommodating with my class scheduling."
bad,"While coworkers and upper management is quite fun to work with, there is tremendous pressure on baristas to make the moment right, which basically means that we have be doormats for people who demand things for free. People tend to be rude, crass, call you names, and demand things for free and try to cheat the system. The job itself isn't easy, you're expected to work in a fast paced environment to keep drive thru times very low (under 1min) all while making customer connections."
bad,"Travailler chez Starbucks Coffee france a été a la fois la pire et la meilleure expérience de ma vie personnelle ET professionnelle, il est vrai qu'il demande un investissement personnelle et il faut etre passionné du metier et du mobnde du café pour pouvoir etre épanouie dans ce milieu. sinon bonjourle burn out et la depression"
bad,"The benefits are cool, but the amount of work is not worth the minimal pay that you will get, and the horrible way you will be treated by the clientele and probably even management. I was forced to quit because of a disability that my manager did not want to deal with. You will not be paid fairly either, and if you become a supervisor you will get paid a small amount more to basically do the job of a store manager."
bad,"Starbucks isn't anything fancy. Being a barista gets easier the more work you put into it. Sadly, you feel less incentive to work harder due to pay rate and the likeliness of being asked to do the more difficult jobs at Starbucks because you're competent."
bad,It was enjoyable at first until Starbucks started enforcing very tight rules that made me worried if I was going to be able to keep my job just from making simple mistakes.
bad,"I took this job thinking it would be a laid back environment where I could learn more about coffee and make some money while applying to grad school. I told them I wanted to be full-time during my interview. They didn't say that would be a problem, but I'm only working about 25 hours a week. This job requires you to constantly be working and cleaning something, always standing, even when we are slow. There are limitations set by the company about how much ""labor"" we are allowed to have for any given day, so it constantly felt understaffed. The pay is terrible. The ""customer experience"" is the only thing management seems to care about. Customer always comes first. The schedule is random, sometimes you work at 5 am and sometimes you work until 11 pm, so it's hard to have a routine. They have good benefits but don't pay enough so that I could actually afford them."
bad,My manager would always schedule me hours that i could not work because of school. The work culture almost punished you for being sick or hurt and asking for medical time off.
bad,I loved working here because of meeting new people and i loved taking care of my regulars it makes it more fun and personable.it was fast but nothing someone can't handle there is a lot of multi tasking so you gotta be quick.
bad,"Todo era muy cálido, pero no se supo respetar los horarios de trabajo."
bad,"bad management, no full time availability for majority of staff. Different stores run in a unique way that dont always cater to the staff and dont feel support."
bad,"I got into the job because I liked their mission and I liked their product. But over the course of my employment, the mission of inclusivity and of fostering community eroded, and it became a fast-food franchise that traded in high-calorie high-sugar slop."
bad,"too much work, very little pay. Lots of cleaning, must stay on top of your game because people are crazy about their coffee. Drive thru is the best part of work"
bad,not enough training and too many people to deal with i was put on the floor right away expected to know how to prepare drinks. co workers were always arguing. Lots of drama.
bad,"Good temporary job. Not long term. Management changes constantly, as well as upper management. Great place to interact with customers and get to know a wide variety of people."
bad,The workers are always stressed and take it out on their coworkers. It doesn't pay enough and there aren't enough benefits for the amount of work you are required to do.
bad,I wouldn't want to work there again. Upper level management does not care about the customers just the bottom line. There was a ridiculous amount of drama all the time. Management at Starbucks lets really terrible store managers thrive if they meet their numbers. The most enjoyable part of the day  was working with coworkers that were good people and not the ones causing drama constantly. The hardest part of the job was not killing myself at the end of the day.
bad,"I was an employee at a brand new licensed store location within a hotel. The maangement came from the hotel rather than from corporate Starbucks. Management clearly did not know what they were doing as in speaking to current employees recently, they are still mismanaged. Lots of shady activity like paying employees bonuses under the table when they could not put record on the books. Would not reccomend working at a licensed location such as this one, though I have heard much better about working at a corporate store."
bad,I honestly enjoyed working at Starbucks at first though when management changed it was difficult to have management compensate with some issues in personal life. Got into a bit of trouble for giving away a shift on a day i wasn't able to work on or wasn't on my availability and sometimes still being forced or convinced to come in when sick. I know all partner stores aren't like this but it's hard for me to actually rest and get better when sick if management is gonna make me work while ill.
bad,"Management is horrible. Nothing is consistent especially from store to store. Preventable and unnecessary stress on a daily basis. On a positive note, they pay for online courses, stocks, benefits, and give opportunity to pick up more hours at other stores."
bad,"Fast paced, never stops. Nothing is ever fully finished. Extremely small breaks for overwhelming work efforts. Hardly paid for the amount of effort you put out. On your feet all day. Very strict rules."
bad,"this company is not the best, i did not thoroughly enjoy my time here. this was in part to my managers and the times i worked. i am sure some starbucks are fantastic"
bad,I learned at this job how to be fast pace while also giving the best customer service. This job taught me how to also deal with customers in any environment.
bad,"Starbucks has been the worst place to work for me. I am writing this strictly because of the management. IT WAS AWFUL. My manager was well over 10 years older than me and constantly I felt like I was in charge more than her. She would whine, procrastinate, and leave whenever she wanted. I was basically doing her job for about 2 months before I up and left."
bad,"I enjoy making coffees and being busy, however management was more interested in money and profit than the quality I would prefer to dish out.  Glorified daycare as well, some people work hard and carry the others."
bad,"Very low pay, terrible hours (4 AM), and management has always been terrible. Its obvious that hire management does not enjoy the company which trickles down to everyone."
bad,"je ne souhaite pas répondre a cette requête , merci de votre compréhension"
bad,"Poor management, and unrealistic expectations for the employees. "
bad,"I had a wonderful team and manager however, corporate standards were ridiculous they put unrealistic goals on us that we could not achieve due to lack of scheduling and tools to get the job done. Our goals would have been achieved had they provided us with proper scheduling and tools. They were too worried about maximizing profits and didn't care about their partners."
bad,"Varies from store to store, that's just how chains are"
bad,my manager was horrible and cried a lot. schedule was never posted when it should have been. people called in a lot or showed up late. the company who owned us breathed down our back the whole time and yelled at us.
bad,"Starbucks dose provide great benefits to it's employees However there is very little work life balance. Corporate is very ridged and harsh. Advancement is promised but not given, employees are asked to jump threw many hoops for long periods of time and in many cases not given the promised promotions."
bad,Fast-paced field where you put in more than you get out of it. I learned sacrificial hard work. The people I worked with made the job easier to be in. The hardest part was poor management. The company would have random hires that filled upper roles and yet they had no experience.
bad,was hired while pregnant which surprised me. Mangement needed help setting up an affiliate program in which i had worked before. baristas are not tipped.
bad,"I was sweeping the floors and wiping down the tables. I was rotating the vending machines. The hardest part of the job was standing on my feet, and also walking to and from the workplace as I have a low stamina of walking distances."
bad,Most of the times it was waiting around until it was time to check quality and quantity of bags of coffee. Also fix any machine that would fault out during the packaging stage. LOTO certified for job.
bad,"Working at Starbucks was a great experience and it is a great start into the coffee industry. Becoming a barista teaches you the fundamentals of coffee and espresso based beverages while also learning to connect with others and anticipate their wants and needs. Management and opportunities for advancement can sometimes be difficult in this job because it is not very well balanced but besides that, Starbucks is a cool company to work for if you need a part-time job."
bad,"You need to be able to handle working in a fast-paced environment. Staff environment is very friendly. However, more staff need to be at the floor during a shift. There are not enough staff members working during peak hours to keep up with the number of customers. The stress these situations are not worth the salary that Starbucks provides"
bad,"When I started, I loved that place. Everyone held there own, morale was very high, and it didn't feel like work. Then it just got unbearable. Management was changing, morale dropped, and we sucked. I did all I could to turn it around. I went above and beyond, and even gained the title as ""Godfather"". I coached in the moment, and shared all knowledge with others, in hopes they'd come up the later with me. They Didn't, and I got tired of working for less than my worth, and little to no hours. Plus, I was no longer growing, and promotion talk dwindled down. hours are scarce, even shifts are asking for them. good benefits, but the pay and hours is terrible, and because of that morale sucks now."
bad,"the best thing about the job is during customer interactions. you get to meet and interact with people from varying cultures and countries."
bad,customers suck. found putting customers before myself was unfair to me. customers could do anything to you and you had to say NOTHING.  called racial slurs over coffee is ridicoulous.
bad,Well right now starbucks needs to pay their empolyees more we don't receive raises and are overworked and underpayed. For example I have been there almost 4 years and not even making 11.00 and haven't been promoted yet and its a lot of new people that just walked in the door and make more than me and became shift supervisors and not really qualified. If I could quit I would. Its not fair you talk to the dm and nothing was resolved not even a response back that's not even fair to me as an employee.This is the fourthstore mamger in 4 years and nothing has changed yet
bad,"Though it started off as a wonderful dream come true it quickly crushed my soul and drained me of energy and dreams. I always felt like nothing as a barista and taken advantage of because management had little to no understanding of what the baristas went through on a day to day basis. When I left, I felt the higher ups were taking advantage of their lower employees (baristas) and working them like slaves, requiring them to be understaffed."
bad,"no es malo,pero tampoco es el super trabajo,,lo que vale la pena es que aprendes a realizar cafe, de manera diferente,mas profesional."
bad,bad management here at starbucks. It was a fun place to work at the beginning. Had they worked on management i would say that Starbucks would be a great place to work.
bad,it was a mess most of the time and vary unprofessional for a work environment . but was a fun place to be  for most part . they pay good enough but not for what u go through .
bad,Had a great time at Starbucks. Left because I moved. Would love to work there again. Great benefits package and a CEO that seemed to really care about his employees.
bad,"Good place to work with friendly people."
bad,"A typical day at work was never fun, many arguments and managers treated you however they felt about you. You do make many friends and its the best way to network. There are health benefits and 401k."
bad,Good job for someone who just graduated high school and needs the experience. Wake up early to go to work. Starbuck is always open and some of the time the management does not realize you need a break from starbucks and running.
bad,"Working here was more often looked upon as a dead end job.  Only those in middle to upper management had a career, the rest of the work force just had jobs.  No job security and no performance incentives or reviews for that matter."
bad,"I can't speak about Starbucks as a corporation, but the franchise I worked for was awful.  The management pressured me to skip class and to quit college to support the store."
bad,"Good place to work, recommend. I learned a lot about the company and about coffee. If you like fast paced environment then you'll like working here. You're on your feet all day though"
bad,"One of the worst decisions I have ever made was to work at target. I enjoyed working with my floor mates and fellow barista's, but management was terrible. They lack the understanding of schedule making. Target managers should never be running a Starbucks, they have no idea how to run a Starbucks yet alone a Target."
bad,"Amazing place to work part time. Includes benefits and stock. After college not so much. Terrible pay and labor cuts meaning you are doing the work of two people while still getting paid for one. Management can only help so much, really depends who the SM or DM is. Company goes through a lot of people and training is laughable so be ready to ""train as you go"". Atmosphere is very fun and casual for a work place environment. Awesome job for a college student."
bad,"Cool coffee culture, lots of learning experiences. Highly demeaning. Very demanding customers. Lots of opportunities to participate in team and skill building classes and groups."
bad,"great place to relax and enjoy a cup of coffee, warm welcome to the store and a great calm and relaxing environment. in the middle of of  manhatten"
bad,Individuals are not valued at Starbucks and are required to endure high volume customer interaction with little staffing
bad,"Management is highly confused at times on what needs to be done in so many situations. Some people are managers that needed more training before they moved into the position. Great company, awesome idea of a business just poor management."
bad,I get to work and get ready to start my day. Then we will all gather in the lunch room and have our meeting. The hardest part was the standing up for 8 hours but i really wouldnt say the job was hard. The most enjoyable part of my job was making the boxes because i working as an assembler for a year.
bad,"A day will either start on a morning shift which starts at 6am or a Closing shift starts at 2 and finishes at 10pm. "
bad,"I had fun working here and I learned a lot and was able to utilise skills learned elsewhere prior to my employment. "
bad,"Co-workers were catty and unfriendly. My manager was blunt and biased. While working there I learned that you're not always going to like the people you work with, but you have to learn how to put up with it. The hardest part of the job was working the kiosk by yourself during rush hour. The most enjoyable part of the job was free drinks."
bad,"The job benefits and experiences make for a good time however, this job can quickly become old and not worth the pay. I started while in college and it was great. Once I graduated and needed more income, it is no longer worth it for me. The people you meet and the free coffee are the best part about the job."
bad,"Ive never had any issues with employee insubordination besides at this job. It was out of control and reinforced by management. "
bad,"Prepping and making beverages and food for customers."
bad,they treated employees good it was a fun fast paced job I guess i didn't work there for long enough to have a true statement
bad,"they don't treat pregnant women very well"
bad,"This Starbucks was located within a Safeway Grocery store. Across the parking lot was a stand alone Starbucks store. This resulted in low customer traffic in the Safeway Starbucks. I felt I was not being challenged enough. "
bad,"Bizarre Hierarchy which reiterates the fact that partners are really just mechanical robots. Every day is the same with little intellectual Stimulation. I did have the chance to participate in rewarding community service programs throughout working with this company which lead to future opportunities."
bad,The focus of a manager at Starbucks is building relationships with customers. This relationship helps managers to engage their customers into potential sales opportunities.
bad,"It was typically busy as it was in a grocery store, the hours were good. Some Times it was hard to work around my school schedule. It was a fun environment."
bad,Starbucks can be a really great place to work at depending on management. It's definitely a great part-time job with amazing benefits. i can honestly say its the best job ive had so far.
bad,"every day as the supervisor i interacted close with guest making connection on a day to day basis. trained new employees on excellent customer support, having fun with all my partners"
bad,A typical day can be busy and you have to be on point. My co-workers were friendly and management was okay. The hardest part of the job was learning how to make certain beverages.
bad,"I applied as Store Manager, had 3 phone interviews with HR. She than offered me the ASM (Assistant Store Manager) position and telling me id be better off starting this off. (even though my past experience as Banquet Manager and Restaurant Manager wasn't enough to her, she told me Starbucks was totally different management). I than met with District Manager in person. Everything i was informed seemed positive and was looking really forward to it all. The benefit, the Perks, it was all good, but it was a huge distraction to what the job really was. "
bad,I wasn't very happy with working here. The pace of the store was a steady decline from the fast paced in the early morning. The environment was not family friendly.
bad,in my particular district we are constantly trying to work hard for promotions. Unfortunately our district manager is to willing to hire store manager from within. She also is going through four different investigations at the moment but that still doesn't stop her from yelling at everyone on the floor and calling us stupid in front of customers. She relies on everyone fearing her than to help and make the baristas feel like we belong with the company. If you apply for a job don't apply for on in the south/North Carolina district (one that contains rock hill to midtown charlotte). You will regret even starting. This company is great but they need work on some management. I have never in my life felt like I have made a bad decision and I can't even transfer out to another district to make myself feel like I'm appreciated for all the hard work I have done for this company.
bad,"Just OK. Was not happy there. Benefits are terrible, low wages."
bad,"· Assisting and fulfilling customer needs"
bad,"served customers and process orders in a timely manner"
bad,It was in a Kroger. I loved the job but the manager was awful. I hear she no longer works there so that's good.
bad,The hardest part of this job was being alone and having a line up of 30 people waiting for you to take their orders and  I had very little training. My most enjoyable part was the people that I worked with and the drinks we got to make. Everyday I would clock in a prepare what was needed for the day and brew coffee every half hour so that it was fresh and ready.
bad,"Work hours are a little rough with opening some stores at 4am, and closing others at 1am, but it is a job that really makes you work hard at what you do and love it at the same time.  Customers make the job worthwhile.  They are fun and friendly and come in most days, sometimes twice a day! Managers are tough, however, and most have been less than desirable."
bad,"the job itself will ware you out, and the pay is not that great , on top of it being a lack of work at least two or three times a week and being sent home when you have bills and kids is not a good feeling"
bad,"too much drama"
bad,"En general bien, Habia bastante compañerismo y aprendi muchas cosas nuevas"
bad,"Starbucks is very conservative: don't allow employees to have tattoos or piercings visible, and cant wear nail polish. In addition, they are not accommodating to workers schedules when they are in school and are constantly understaffed "
bad,A tow company that struggles to stay afloat. Not a to bad place to work.
bad,"Behind the scene Starbucks are not team players."
bad,"as a manager mostly floor coverage, no time to train and develop your employees, an inability to properly staff the sales floor based on hours of operation vs. provided hours of coverage"
bad,"great job for students. extremely busy in the mornings, steady flow until noon"
bad,Management doesn’t care about employees at all over worked under payed not a recommended job to say the least. My experience taught me to just try to better myself so I loved on without a backup plan but it wasn’t good for my mental state so I left
bad,"Work load is a lot, must clean vigorously and serve customers at the same time. Hard to get all of your tasks done in a small amount of time. Standard procedure and protocol is intense. Very condescending customers since customers at Starbucks believe that they have the right right to disrespect you for paying a high price for their drink.  Management tends to be corrupt. However, the flexible hours and the dynamic team are nice,"
bad,"The job is a lot of fun and typically youre always doing something constantly for the shift, but the overall job felt stagnant and the growth was asking more than what they are willing to give in benefits or pay."
bad,Need more staff need management location manager to do some work they dont care about the staff that actually does the work the ones that do hardly any work gets the best pay location manager
bad,Would not recommend this job if you don’t excel in working at fastpased environments. You don’t get very much training and you have to learn everything fast which is pretty stressful. One of my supervisors would get really annoyed with me and would never want to help me when I would have a question about something even though I’ve only been here for 2 weeks.
bad,"Fast paced, getting the order right, dealing with the coffee heads, and heating food. Good job if you can multi-task well but not good if you're slow. I did not have reliable transportation at the time so I took the bus there which took like 45 minutes and another 50 minutes to walk."
bad,"As much as I like fun (and I'm still young so I get it), Starbucks staff is almost all college students so there's a lot of goofing off and lack of professionalism. You have workers coming in during their time off to just sit in the back, eat a bunch of food that's supposed to be sold to the customers, and leave huge messes in the back area for everyone else to clean. You have a lot of people calling out whenever they feel like it (Starbucks policy states you must call out at least 2 hours before you shift), you have workers acting too comfortable and abandoning their posts to go goof off and laugh, and almost no trainers at all to help the new hires learn and become better baristas."
bad,It was fun at first until I saw that some of us weren’t equal . I would like them to improve on handling certain situations and marking new employees more welcome .
bad,"People think it's only making coffee. They are so beyond wrong. There are so many things to remember, drink recipes, new drinks, standards, procedures, etc. There is also a lot expected of you. God forbid you make a mistake though, because they will make you feel like a failure. Some coworkers will think they are above you authoritatively just because they have been there longer. Also coworkers will inevitably talk behind your back all the time. Now don't get me wrong, my manager was very reasonable and a nice man. He was not the original manager at the store I worked at. The original manager was such a heartless, rude, conceited woman and everyone knew it. She would single people out and for stupid selfish reasons. But like I said, the manager after that was great. Don't get me wrong, I made a lot of friends working at Starbucks and sometimes the music helped save the day on those stressful days. But it is also the most stressful job I have ever had. Everyone that I worked with, including myself, will tell you that you will have at least 1, if not more than one, mental breakdown at least once while you're working there. I will never work at a Starbucks again."
bad,"It would start off fast and have flows of mini rushes after the first initial one. When it was slow you could take a breath and get your background work done. If it was a rush you had to plaster your most charasmatic energy to those who seldom deserved it however if you could turn that frown upside down it was as if someone handed you a gold star. I learned to be fast , patient, and creative. Not one barista or shift did things the same as the other. Everybody had their thing and it was okay as long as they were along the guidelines. Without sugar coating it, the job is not for the faint of heart. It may seem like just coffee but if you got something wrong you'd get an earful from either a customer, your shift, or the manager. The culture was fun and exciting though and you got to get to know people of all walks of life. Whilst doing so connecting through the coffee community."
bad,"Working as a Starbucks barista was very fast paced, involved a lot of multitasking, dealt with customers constantly, and experienced very poor management. "
bad,"When I was with Starbucks, I loved the people.  The people were honestly the only reason to stay.  Working in a coffee house like this is fun but it's not fun once you get into management.  In my advice, if you want to work here, stick to just being a barista."
bad,"Starbucks is an interesting and fast paced place to work, it fair share of good and bad customers. All Starbucks partners get a great Stock and benefits plan, that builds up over time."
bad,"Hardest part would be closing the whole restaurant with technically only one person while shift counted money."
bad,"Starbucks is a great place to work while going through school, but that is about it. Customer service is difficult and the employees are not paid enough for the number of issues they have to deal with on a day to day basis."
bad,My time with Starbucks taught me a lot about working with others and striving for amazing customer service. It set the tone for the type of customer service that I both give and expect in all areas in life.
bad,its a very fast paced job where you have to learn everything quick because they just throw you in there. at least where i work they don't seem to know what they doing because  i have people in high positions who don't have a clue to what they're doing. people get away with a lot of things that aren't right. it may be cool when you first work there but after awhile notice that its overbearing and mentally exhausting
bad,"Starbucks was a cool experience for me , but I feel as though it was a workplace for young teens . I spent a lot of time working and training high school students !"
bad,"I worked at two different locations over the course of four years. My first experience was wonderful, but the second location was not so. I would advise paying close attention to management, ensuring it is somewhere you will enjoy working."
bad,it was ok and is based on management if you have decent managers and district managers it can be good but the company needs to evolve and catch up with technology
bad,It was a Franchise Starbucks so I didn’t get all the benefits I would have gotten working at a real company. Supervisors were lazy and unfair to employees.
bad,"stressful, time managed to the second, lots of effort, never even made coffee really just handed out pastries. sucks but that's retail :[ Not much else to it"
bad,"Unfortunately i have been so dissapointed of how people are treated I mean new people in training I never felt so unhappy in my life at a job."
bad,"Great job depending on what you're looking for. There are be a lot of turbulence in this job, and it's greatly dependent on your ability to make each of your employees happy."
bad,"- I learned how to use a cash register while working these jobs"
bad,"Work full time and overtime at night through 5pm to 4 am in the morning"
bad,"While I loved the refreshing environment, the lack of training is what caused me to leave. The managers didn't seem to help nor did they care and I was constantly cleaning up the brewing equipment or mopping the floors. I didn't learn how to make drinks or using the cash register properly and one of the supervisors was criticizing everything I do and I couldn't take his snappy attitude. If I received the proper training, maybe I would have stayed."
bad,Love the culture and atmosphere along with having great benefits but is difficult to make a decent living even after being there for years. Company is loosing sights of being a coffee shop and customer based and is striving to become more of a fast food chain with no personality. Treatment of partners is getting worse.
bad,"Got to know how to multitask, fast paced and enjoyable. The people  are always nice. Starbucks hires great managers. You get your free mark out every week and the food is awesome.I love that we changed our dress code."
bad,"High Stress, High Workload, with low compensation. Great teams and pleasant people to meet and build relationships with. Store management is always willing to work with you to fit your work to life balance. Sadly management from up above does not do the same. Frequent labor cuts, not enough pay for the type of work, and not a lot of benefits lead to a bad work environment."
bad,"I have worked with this company for almost four years, it's been a nice company to work at although it can be very stressful. hardest part of this job is getting in touch with management, they're a bit absent from this entire district. My favorite part of this job is working with customers and making there day with yummy coffee"
bad,Muito boa de trabalhar um trabalho de equipe muito bom e muitas experiencias adquiridas
bad,"Working with the customers was the highlight of my time there. You meet a lot of different people coming and going to different states, with very interesting stories."
bad,"Best part about the job is so many amazing customers you meet and the regulars you build a bond with. I love the benefits of this company, a lot has changed over the years but it really helps you to grow as a person"
bad,"worked there, and still work there. Looking for something else to supplements income because they do not pay enough. Good as a part time job. Need to move on to full time."
bad,I   had a good experience and enjoyed my time at Starbucks it was organized and a good company unfortunately to me there was alot of high school drama caused by the manager. I   left due to a better position over the summer.
bad,"Like every place of work, it depends on management. My first boss was amazing, my second was god awful. Dont be afraid to transfer and dont be afraid to contact your district manager."
bad,"I loved who I worked with, the regular customers, and physically making the drinks. The pay is absolutely not where it needs to be, especially if it’s biweekly. It made the fun and overall work just not worth it at all."
bad,it was a fun customer based role the employees were mostly a joy to work with and i learnt alot of skills that have greatly helped me to progress in life. The work to life ratio was work i was contracted 40 hours generally had to work 60 the managment made work a life or death situation and the pay was not equal to the work
bad,Starbucks just cares about numbers. The reason they have such good benefits is to keep you from leaving. Dealing with rude customers all day. Both of the managers I ran into either didn’t know how to run a store or didn’t really care for their employees. It’s definitely fast paced so be ready for that. Be ready to be putsecond to customers
bad,"I can only really speak for Saskatoon, but Starbucks is awful to work for here. 90% of the managers are two-faced liars that don't care about you as a person. Most managers will guilt you into finding cover for your shift if you can't make it in - this is straight up false and is in the partner manual. It's not uncommon for supervisors to be scolded for things that the managers will do with a straight face - such as sending baristas for break during peak, even though they haven't had one in 4 hours and there are enough people. I was a supervisor for 2-3 years and not once got paid for it, and I trained somewhere around 15-25 baristas. Management is the main reason I left, needless to say."
bad,cool coworkers fast paced a lot to learn but overall it was a cool experience management was non existent was unable to get any real overtime i would have liked a larger pay for the type of work we do
bad,"Fun place, but high turn over rate made it impossible to stay fun."
bad,First started was ok until new people get hired & then they cut people hours that been working there way before these new people. So after that it’s time to go
bad,The work itself was really simple and task oriented. You knew what to do and when to do it whether it was slow or busy. The job itself wasn't hard but the job culture and management made it really difficult to suffer through.
bad,Super fast paced environment. You must know how to keep up and mulitask. Great benefits starting at part time. Not worth staying as company cares only for customers and not their barista.
bad,Management could be better. They need to focused more on customer less on ciaos. The most enjoyable part of my job is the customers they are the reason for us having jobs. Sometimes they tell us about their day and they seem to be a lot better after that. But its too much favoritism and not enough being far. Plus they talk down to you.
bad,"This company will take and take and take from you if you let them. If you have good management it can be more enjoyable, but at a corporate level it is never enough."
bad,"I've worked for Starbucks for a few years. I used to love my job, it was a great high school/ college job. Hours are flexible and breaks are always given. I have always loved customer service because I love to talk to people. Unfortunately, over the past year, corporate has been coming down on management to cut down on labor. This is extremely difficult for my store because it is very high volume. At some points of the day, we only have three people scheduled on the floor during an afternoon rush, while still needing to give breaks. You constantly leave exhausted, not wanting to do anything after work because you are just that tired. Also, we lost a great manager about 6 months ago as she transferred to a new location and we have been given two new managers since. The first new one was okay, but they ended up leaving as well. The next manager has only been working for the company for a short period of time, lacking basic knowledge of the company. Call in's happen frequently on the weekends and no write ups are done. It is literally terrible. HOWEVER, It all depends on your location. My best advice to anyone is to go to a cafe store. They are not nearly as stressful as a drive thru store, and you can actually make connections with customers and that is what Starbucks was all about when I first started. Not drive thru times, not labor cuts. I highly recommend going to a cafe store if you are interested in working for this company."
bad,Loved this job. The atmosphere was amazing! The people I worked with were amazing and so was my manager. I loved meeting new customers and some became like family.
bad,working in Starbucks is fun . you get to meet new people everyday and learn always from them . As an individual i always enjoy doing customer service job because the job is never boring . Starbucks is huge coffee company all over the world with more career opurtunities.
bad,Poor managmnet  but co workers where always fun and friendly. Got to interact with customers constantly and always kept on toes with new things. Would get good tips had friendly customers as long as you did your job correctly
bad,A demanding job with little pay. They work you to the bone and expect you to be happy with tips that customers might give you. Even though most customers don't deem it necessary to tip baristas.
bad,"Have fun working for a company that pays you pennies for everything you have to deal with on a daily basis. Or a company that creates rules, and, after following them, reprimands you because a customer complained about you following said rules. The customer may think they're right, but that doesn't mean they always are; allowing them to get away with whatever it is they are trying to get away with has bred some of the worst retail/customer service nightmares."
bad,"Starbucks is an excellent company to work for. They have amazing benefits and they pay slightly more than minimum wage. However this job is not for the faint hearted. You get approximately 20 hours of on the job training. In reality it requires anywhere from 2 to 3 months to really get the hang of it. Until then you're shark bait. If you do not uphold corporate standards then you will not make it. As a supervisor for Starbucks I have learned that it is very difficult to get help when you need it. They're illness and emergency situation policies are completely unrealistic at times. If you get into a car accident you have to find someone to cover your shift, mind you no one will help you. If you don't get the shift covered you get written up. These moments are extremely stressful especially if you have children. Overall Starbucks is a great company, but like any job there will always be some kind of issue or conflict."
bad,"Starbucks is a multi-national company, that allows for the employees to have incredible benefits. Any new employee is eligible for not only health benefits, but a 401k, college assistance program, and countless other company-wide opportunities."
bad,starbucks is a very challenging place to work you definitely have to multi task by taking orders and making drinks all at once. great learning experience.
bad,Starbucks sucked the management sucked big time my manager got fired so we got this new lady. The shift leads sucked also.
bad,"I've worked at numerous Starbucks locations and with that experience its easy to say that favoritism is the main fundamentals as far as promotion, hours, and overall experience. You need to brown nose to get anywhere in the company and management constantly shows how disposable you are given the amount of applications received. "
bad,"Working at Starbucks was quite the learning experience. It has taught me how to deal with all sorts of people, both good and bad, and learning how to recover high stress situations while keeping my composure. During our peak hours we can average as many as 45-50 transactions every half hour, during which I learned how to effectively multitask in order to get our numbers as high as possible."
bad,"Interact with customers and co workers , we work as a team , our goal is to make customer satisfied with our service. I learned  how to maintain my attitude in an fast pace environment. My manager was pretty much fair except for her personal ways. The hardest part of this job is really anything its really simple keep good personality and good posture the day will go by fast. I like Starbucks because your always meeting different people from around the world that loves the company resources just as much as us Americans do."
bad,"Love working as a team in a fast paced environment, a good place to work at in the customer service industry."
bad,Started at 5a.m. I was able to chose my hours as they really identified what worked for their employees
bad,hard work at a fast pace
bad,"Didn’t really have a good experience . Treated unfairly and management failed to train me properly , when I asked for more hours they ended up giving me three days a week . Took hours away from me because I wasn’t as fast and good due to lack of training ."
bad,"If you want to work for Starbucks, I recommend that you pick a location that you would have less busy traffic of customers. There are lots to learn during training, and it can get pretty overwhelming."
bad,"I personally would not work there again,  but I do urge people with limited work experience to apply their first, family and friends are included. Its a great place to acquire a good work ethic for yourself and a team setting."
bad,"Working hours are long, especially during shortage of manpower period or holiday season."
bad,"The job seemed fine to me at the start but the more I worked the more I realized everyone hated working there. The attitude of everyone hating their job made it difficult to stay positive and the people also loved drama. My store had a drive through which also caused rushes especially on Thursdays. A lot of people lacked the ability to stay calm so they just got mad at someone who hasn't been working for as long as they have which caused that person to just feel insecure about their performance. The management also isn't great because although you'll get smiles from the manger you can tell they don't care about the workers. They're just doing what they think is necessary. I don't think all Starbucks are bad because I have been told that it's only the Hypoluxo and Congress store I worked at though so if you do want to work at a Starbucks, work somewhere else."
bad,"This is a super fast paced job, that is very stressful.  They pay isn't enough to sustain a suitable lifestyle.  A Good job for a high school student."
bad,I have been working there a couple of weeks now.I have never wanted it quiet a job until NOW!! It’s like being in high school all I’ve again............
bad,"Στα starbucks τα κάνεις ολα. Από κει που καθαρίζεις την τουαλέτα μετά πας και φτιαχνεις καφέδες . επίσης ασχολεισαι και με απογραφες και παραγγελίες για εμπόρευμα την ώρα που έχεις και κόσμο να εξυπηρετήσεις ενώ τρέχεις μόνος σου.  Με 400 ευρώ για 5ημερο 8(9)ωρο πρέπει να είσαι πάντα σε τρελό κέφι και χαρά. Σε παραμυθιαζουν για προαγωγή και ενώ σου φορτώνουν τα καθήκοντα της ανώτερης θέσης παίρνεις ακόμα τον προηγούμενο μισθό γιατί ""δοκιμαζεσαι"" ακόμα. Πολύ καλή έκπτωση στα προϊόντα και πολύς δωρεάν καφές. Ενσημα 4ωρα μισά τα οποία προβαλλονται ως ""μισθός 4ωρο +υπερωρία"" αλλα τελικά δουλεύεις μονιμως 8ωρο με μισό ενσημο. Δεν υπάρχει περίπτωση να απολυθεις αν δεν κάνεις κάτι πολυ χοντρο πχ κλοπή επομενως σε πιέζουν για να φύγεις μόνος σου. Καμία ελπίδα δλδ για οαεδ.  Το ωράριο τηρείται με αποκλιση μισαωρου (μπορεί κ ώρας αν εισαι βραδινός) αρα συνήθως μιλαμε για 9ωρο η υπερωρία απλήρωτη. Αλλά πίνεις πολύ καφέ και έχεις ""ανθρώπους που σε νοιάζονται"" δίπλα σου. Ποτέ ξανά ούτε σε ανάγκη."
bad,"Great benefits, but employees are overworked. Stores are typically busy but not enough partners on duty to handle everything. Management expects a lot from their employees."
bad,The best part of the job was meeting new people! I worked at the Starbucks in downtown Columbia and the people I'd meet and stories I'd hear were amazing! Never a dull day!
bad,i think that starbucks is a great place to work at because of the people and enviroment that they represent and i will love them for that. it is a great place to work.
bad,"Overall great job, especially for beginners, but again the management is albuquerque is horrible. Great benefits. Flexible scheduling. Coworkers are usually super fun."
bad,"Une expérience plutôt dans l’ensemble correcte, une équipe très dynamique et compétents, des clients très sympathique, la majorité étaient des étrangers, des passages de beaucoup des célébrités."
bad,Co-workers are friendly and management was great but overall the work was too stressful for the pay received. Not the worst job but the hectic conditions can make it feel like it.
bad,It's fine. Starbucks is a huge company. Not a lot of room for growth. Hours are flexible and the work environment is fun. The pay could be way better but again it's a global company.
bad,"I worked for Starbucks last year at a drive thru location. I started out just doing cashier, and the manager told me they would eventually train me by sending me to a different location. They never had me finish computer training and never sent me to the training location. After almost 6 months of working the job, I still wasn't trained.  Working alongside with the other baristas was fun, but I always felt inferior because I was always stuck on drive thru or POC, never actually making drinks. I eventually had to leave because I felt like they never heard my voice. Great benefits, though."
bad,"While Starbucks offers so many amazing benefits your life will be miserable if you are stuck with a mean person as your manager.  While it's nice to know that it's very hard to get fired from Starbucks, at the same time if you are working with someone who makes your life miserable Starbucks isn't going to just fire that individual.  It takes many conversations and lots of documentation before anything is done about this individual.  It really ends up being more work than it's worth which is why I am trying to leave the company.  Because of this, Starbucks will keep one bad employee while losing a good one."
bad,"wake up. mop the floor, sell coffee. Sell more coffee, Make the coffee "
bad,this was a nice job learned a lot from the job on how to teach customer it's a fast productive place to work and we had fun doing our job
bad,"Pay is good, hours are great based off availability, and the customers might just be the best thing once you get to know them. I was full time when I worked there, I bounced from three different stores and had a blast, until management got shady. But once again it was a blessing."
bad,I would have really loved this job if it wasn’t for the manager there. I left because of that. It was a lot of fun. Very fast paced. Which is what I loved.
bad,"As the summary states, it was okay. It was super fast paced from open (4am) to close. Never a slow moment. Pay was very low but only because you received tips so your money came from tips. but unless you advance, i dont see the salary for a normal barista paying cost of living."
bad,"The company as a whole is bad. The customers are awful. It’s busy. The tips are absolutely garbage. The coffee is terrible. If you want to be a real barista, skip starbucks and head to a traditional shop. If you just need great benefits, sure. But the hourly wage is trash and there were issues with the manager at my location."
bad,I enjoyed working at my Starbucks location until poor management became an issue & I was treated not fairly as the other employers/ overly pressured when I did work along with lack of training nor did they keep the cafe clean enough.
bad,"Starbucks is a great company overall. The people you work with can be a bit difficult to manage. I do feel in a lot of ways baristas are expected to make up for lack of pressure being applied to upper management when things aren't going right. However, I also feel more training can be administered."
bad,"No one ever really trains you if you work at a drive-thru. more of a learn as you go since no one has time. Trainers are sometimes not available. as a supervisor, you have to work all the time. There is never enough coverage during the workday. customers are always rude and think they are entitled to everything just because it is Starbucks. coworkers can be hostile just because you're new. nothing is hard about working at Starbucks, but you get tired of working at customer service after a while. no one ever appreciates you even if its a job well done."
bad,Starbucks was not the place for me. It is too quick and you basically learn by your self. Training is not even worth it because they don't even train you. Good thing about it is that the co workers actually understand you. I learned that coffee is difficult to understand and make in that work place
bad,I was proud of my work there I learned a lot and met a lot of amazing people.  I learned everything about coffee and the art of making it.  I had amazing co-workers and management.  Some of my best friends this day I met working at Starbucks I would not be where I am today without ever working there.
bad,"On a typical day, 80% of the customers come every single day. Some are pleasant some are not. Most the time its very fast-paced and exciting. All types of people come into the store, i.e businessmen/woman, students, housewives,etc. Its the type of job that communication is key, most understand it and it makes the job easier. However, everyone isn't aware of the necessity. The hardest part is working with people who lack social skills and communication. The most enjoyable part is the crazy loving customers that come in and make my day."
bad,"Starbucks is a company that provides great benefits, and depending on the store in your area, great hours. With how big there name is, you’re likely gonna be dealing with a high volume influx of customers and orders. Whether or not you have people that follow the steps in food and drink prep, things should either swell or not so swell. Customer service is always key, so just always remember that."
bad,"I LOVED being a barista at starbucks. Yes, it was difficult, yes, the customers were GOD awful, and YES, it was stressful. However, I had so much fun and put so much care and love in crafting beverages. Then i got promoted to shift manager. I applied for the position because I was making 9.43 as a barista, and as much as I loved doing it, it’s just not enough pay to live and pay rent in my area. I got a raise up to 11.16, but the amount of work, stress, hours, and general description was NOT worth 11.16. I believe in the $15 minimum wage, but even 15 couldn’t cut a shift position. I still currently work here, but I have never hated a job, nor my life, as much as I do now. if you work here, STAY a barista. Get a second job to cover rent. The benefits are amazing and you only need 20 hours minimum. Free drinks. Free spotify. DO NOT become a shift. I promise....."
bad,Great job great hours but bad management. They are slow to deal with understaffing. Over working the night shift and understaffing the night shift. To much favoritism and horrible team work. But it can be a good job if they had management that cared.
bad,"Quick paced, fun for the most part. I didn't like the tip split each week, although benefits and advancements were worth it if one was willing to take advantage of them."
bad,Loved it until I needed to transfer across the country and my pay was cut even though the minimum wage was higher and the work load was heavier. NOT COOL. Can honestly say I would not have left if I were making the same amount that I was back home.
bad,What i got out of the job is working with different characters and making the best out of what i do with a smile. I work really and feel like i am not getting anywhere with this company.
bad,This was my favorite job it’s supet fun and exciting to be able to be a barista. All of the employees were very friendly and outgoing the culture there is amazing . The bad part is they start to cut hours really bad and did nothing about it .
bad,"Although I thoroughly enjoyed working for Starbucks, I have lost a lot of respect for the company since leaving it in 2011. When I was training, Starbucks was proud of the fact that they didn't advertise. That is no longer the truth. I also believe, like I did when I worked for the company, that the prices are just despicable. As an employee I witnessed the amount of waste we created. I remember a customer that would come in everyday and order a triple venti extra caramel caramel machiatto. She always had her very young daughter in tow. I heard her say one day, that she wouldn't be able to buy her daughter the book that she had promised her. My heart just broke. The coffee isn't that great. I can make it better at home. Sad sad society."
bad,"Starbucks was an extreamly fast pace, no break until 4 hours in, type of job. You really had to have a certain drive to maintain a friendly additude and being able to craft drinks just as the customer wanted. THroughout a hours of the day, work was available. Any down time that we were to have, it was spent cleaning or learning new materials and news about what the store had to offer next."
bad,"this was a franchise so did not receive the same benefit as corporate Starbucks. No bonus structure."
bad,"cleaning"
bad,Considero que se debe de dar mas valor a los empleados por parte de los gerentes.
bad,"Opening and closing store, making drinks and working the register."
good,"This is not to be said about all locations. This one in particular was inside a grocery store. The store manager wouldn't allow us to keep a top hat because it was ""soliciting."" We were allowed to take tips but only if a customer personally gave it to you. It sucked because everyone who worked that day split up the tips. The manager always had an attitude and barely ever came in unless a new product was launching, just to train is on how to make the drinks. The employees were great. No complaints there. It was a nice atmosphere to work in otherwise."
good,I believe that if you are a student is a job you can aim for yet depending on where you work your management etc... You may struggle since not all shops open at 8  AM and close at 8PM. The management can as well be problematic... You meet great people everyday as well as difficult one. You must be calm and strong minded. Is a great job for self improving if you think positively if not it’s a great place to become very negative
good,"While I love the company and its values, the location I worked at was awful. Many of the employees were bossy, snarky, and downright rude.amagent created a really negative environment and failed to train everyone the same but expected uniform methods of completing things."
good,This is a great job for students who want somewhere to work and balance studies between a part-time job. But if you are a student who lives alone and are looking for an opportunity this is not the place for you.
good,I loved working at Starbucks as a company not through Kroger. Management was bad and the schedules were never correct. One week you would have 40 hours and the next 5. You cannot live and pay your bills when you have no consistency. Employees were rude and back stabbing and management allowed it to happen.
good,Starbucks is a high paced volume store depending on the seasons of the year and also where the store is located. I have learned to have great communication and time management skills and to become a quick learner. The hardest part of the job is learning how to react with out thinking and learning how to take control of situations with out being nervous or confused when management is not around.  The most enjoyable part of the job is making the drinks on the bar. If one can keep up the pace and not fall under pressure this is a good job for the mean time.
good,"•	Greet customers with a smile, provide exceptional customer service."
good,this job was not one for someone looking to move up in a company. there were very limited advancements and the pay was not great. management played a lot of favoritism
good,"I did like working here but in the end I was happy to be let go, even though i was let go for unfair reason. Management is very unprofessional. Customers are rude. pay is not very good for all the hard work you have to do. Hours I had where horrible, I had no time to spend with kids. I did like my co-workers without having good co-workers my shift would have been even more horrible."
good,okay
good,It’s difficult to move forward in the company when your manager is holding you back. I had an amazing manager when I first started. He supported me and my goals in and out of the company. Now I don’t have that luxury.
good,"Depending on the store, more often than not there's a lot of drama between coworkers. Fast paced and NOT flexible with home/work balance. If you work here, be prepared to live, eat, and breathe the company."
good,The store manager is constantly talking badly about her employees behind their backs. The work environment has become toxic. Baristas and shift supervisors are not paid enough for the amount of work that’s being done. Baristas who are not fit to be a shift supervisor are being promoted anyway. There is a whole bunch of favoritism from the store manager. There is hardly any change in positions throughout the day. You’re either in bar for 8 hours or customer support for 8 hours. A few of the shift supervisors keep me on the customer support cycle for my entire shift and it gets exhausting. You’re forced to take a 30 minute break when working only 6 hours so you’re getting jipped from your money.
good,"Starbucks has gotten so big, the little people are getting overlooked. They want customers to feel cared for, but I didn’t feel cared for as an employee. Practice what you preach Starbucks."
good,"I left due to the terrible management at this location. It wasn't a corporate store, so I feel management didn't care as much as they should have. The general manager was kind, but the assistant general manager was rude to nearly all of the employees. My fellow employees are the only reason I stayed as long as I did."
good,"Management doesn't care to help baristas with orders. I was never allowed to leave at the time I was scheduled too because the next person would arrive late and management didn't want to get on the floor and help the team, so I had to leave later than my scheduled time."
good,"Starbucks operates as a network within itself, it doesn't pay well for the tasks demanded from the employee's of both statuses. Managers here are mean"
good,"I don't think a day went by where we were adequately staffed. If one person had to call off it was bad for everyone. Towards the end they cut our hours so they only had to give us one break, which was absolutely ridiculous. My Manager was overtly sexist telling some of the girls to wear makeup at work and blaming what the men messed up on on the girls. I wouldn't recommend working at my store to anyone but Starbucks doesn't  seem like a bad company."
good,I absolutely loved the job and working for the company itself. Local management drove me to dread going to work. I was made to feel like a bad guy and no one else involved in issues that were happening was addressed.
good,"Overall starbucks could have been a much better work environment if they had made it a priority to keep their stores staffed. However that wasn’t really the case, as I learned multiple times throughout my time at Starbucks. They are more obsessed with making sure labor is under their target metrics than they are ensuring a healthy and fair work life balance in their employees. They have an expected turnover rate of 75-80% and as a result their training program can barely prepare a person to function a minimal accepatable capacity in an atmosphere where if one cog in the shift is underperforming, everyone feels it, especially the customers. And yet there is no seeming accountability for these glaring management areas and they just seem to do nothing that will risk their metrics. A lackluster and irresponsible approach to management."
good,team work is valued but not your time and manners not balance
good,This may not pertain to all Starbucks inside of Frys Marketplace but the location I was at was awful. The manager was terrible. She would make a mess and then go on break leaving it for the rest of us to clean. There was a plumbing leak that had not been reported for months before I had started there. I was spoken to for reporting the leak. I was pregnant at the time and I have a disability but I was the only one cleaning. The place should have been reported because it was disgusting. The manager purposely took delivery day off and scheduled me to open and take care of inventory. Then she denied all of it.
good,"It was incredibly cliquey and difficult to get to know anyone, and there was clear preferential treatment among the manager and the supervisors. The company's superficial and hollow corporate culture was soul-crushing at the best of times."
good,Literally as soon as the store manager left everyone started to fight to see who was in charge leading to a lot of people quitting and or getting fired.
good,"Very stressful. A lot to do and high expectations are expected. Not the best employees.  high turnover rate and not the best training, they just throw the new people  into the thick of everything and expect them to pick it up instantly."
good,"Starbucks was one if the worst jobs as far as management. They were very unprofessional and rude to the employees. Leads, management and associates are paid almost the same."
good,"I love my job being a barista and meeting new people but I work full time and go to school full time and management is very inconsiderate of that. And I in no way shape or form get paid for the amount of work I do, also at my Starbucks you get no free drinks or food and really no benefits at all and also cannot accept tips."
good,"A typical day at work is 8 hours on your feet racing back and forth with only a 10 minute break and a 30 minute lunch. Management rarely helps and the pay isn't worth the stress and work you go through everyday. Some eployees work harder than others, at first I loved working at Starbucks but over time I began to get drained. I worked mornings so peak was always competitive."
good,Not willing to share. People are rude. You are left alone. Manager is horrible. Starbucks sucks to work at. You never stop moving. People say you don't do anything right.  Customers are ungrateful.
good,I was a shift supervisor at Starbucks and it was a typical part time job. You are over worked and underpaid. I did learn a lot on my own at this location however would not work here again.
good,I don't respect most of the store managers because they don't care about their workers most of the time. They are only looking to cover their own butts.
good,My boss was an alcoholic who was belligerent and created a terrible atmosphere. In my time nearly everyone had transferred or left. The pay was horrible and the work is fairly hard at times.
good,Working for Starbucks was interesting since I only have drinked very little coffee. Working at Starbucks taught me the different ways to make coffee and the different cultures. Starbucks always promoted from within the company but unfortunately this store did not do that. My co workers was friendly and easy to work with we was a good team. The hardest part was making certain beverages that required steam milk and foam on top. I enjoyed working at Starbucks because there was weekly pay and employees were able to sample any new beverage that was made as well as walking around for customers to sample as well.
good,Company sucks! I do not recommend anyone staying in the company for over a year. A good job to start off but management and company doesn’t care about the employees. They only care about themselves.
good,Starbucks was a really fun job to work for if you can get past the fact the costumers were racist towards me. I constantly asked for help with my mental health and was “let go” they claim to care about their employees but they don’t if you can get past all that then it’s actually fun
good,The only thing I liked about my job was interacting with the people and my colleagues. Making customers happy was what always puts a smile in  my face.
good,"I worked at a Starbucks franchise so my experience may be a bit different from other corporate stores. A typical day at work was stressful from the moment you'd walk in. There was always something broken or not working. I learned to work in a fast-paced environment. Upper management was great but when it came to our store manager, there was needed improvement. The employees were great to have as company. Created great friendships from working there. Hardest part of the job was working with lack of supplies. The most enjoyable part was the free cup of coffee at the end of a shift."
good,"With my experience at Starbucks, I worked at one on a military base. It was kind of fun but for the most part, it was awful. The management was unprofessional, and they played favorites. They had the baristas do all the work including some management jobs as well. I was only seasonal so I had only worked for a couple of months,  but I wish I had a better experience because I had heard that Starbucks is an amazing company to work for."
good,"Terrible lazy management, most of the managerial work was done by employees. Making schedules, inventory, walkthroughs. Always understaffed. Many occasions where Ii worked the register and made drinks myself."
good,"I know it seems like it's the perfect place to work if you're trying to get other areas of your life moving and need some extra cash, but it's way too demanding and doesn't pay well enough. And, if you're a good worker or a supervisor, you will be severely punished for pursuing things outside of the company. Don't work here."
good,"Working at Starbucks helped me with my people skills, customer service skills, and gain knowledge about the various drinks. I also enjoyed interacting with and helping the various customers."
good,"I worked there for over eight years on and off, and after each management I realized there was either no management or very poor management, or even someone brought in from another store who had no realization on how a Starbucks should be run. There have been times that the management realized my experience put me in charge without any advancement or acknowledgement. I have always loved working for starbucks but they work the workers way to hard. And they make employees think that not only can they work but want to work to death. I love starbucks but the management they choose I have never agreed with."
good,Worked here for the insurance overall good company not good pay. A lot of back stabbing I changed stores free coffee and great discounts tips are ok as well
good,"There were several shifts that were never on time and would leave me to be the sole opener or closer for the day/night. "
good,"Love the job. Started as a temp and they always encourage you to learn. But they dangle the carrot of getting hired, but they don't hire. They use their temps until their time runs out then wave goodbye. It doesn't matter how good you are, or how much you follow all their guidelines. At the end of your time, your gone. They give you more and more responsibility, making  you think your going to get hired, then don't hire."
good,"It was not a bad place to work. Very stressful due to the fast pace. I gotta admit, I did love the free drinks and food while I worked. Unfortunately, at the Starbucks where I worked, we were not allowed to accept tips. And they didn't pay us very well. Especially considering some of the extremely rude/entitled customers we had to deal with.But it was not bad for extra money while I went back to school."
good,"Training is non existent, everyone has a different idea of what you need to do, and what you need to know. The other Baristas will sabotage you and get you into trouble. The Health code violations are legion and the direct manager doesn't care. They do not do things to the Starbucks Standards at all, and they take the tips of trainees all the time."
good,"E uma empresa para ter tudo de bom , porem deixa muita a desejar , pois não cumpri a risca tudo o que e dito e oferecido, mas foi um lugar que aprendi muito , e conheci pessoas incríveis,"
good,I found this job to have impossible expectations and that no matter how hard you worked it was never enough. They pay terribly right at minimum wage so it is impossible to work there and keep up with the cost of living.
good,"It was okay, I guess. Not really the best place to be, but certainly not the worst. They say everyone is treated equal, but that is not the case at all."
good,"I liked learning something new ie. making coffee. However the management was poor and I wasn't even trained properly. The hours were bad, merchandise and supplies were unorganized, and there were no benefits or discounts for workers-you had to PAY for WATER."
good,Not the best place to work for a long time but if you need to keep on you’re feet this is the place to work at if you could handle a lot of rude customers
good,"Sometimes it felt as if working there was a war zone. The manager was snotty and picked favorites, they used long term positions as threats. After leaving it felt like i had a Monitor and maintain food safety PTSD"
good,"Starbucks could be a good place to work, provided that you either have another source of income or are a student looking for a little extra cash.  to compound this issue they have exceptionally high expectations and just aren't willing to pay for meeting and maintaining said expectations."
good,I have worked at both a licensed and corporate starbucks and neither are a place that I would recommend someone to work. The licensed story outright threatened their employees and the corporate had a boss that would rather sit on her behind than help her employees. They were both very manipulative and did not care about others. The benefits at a corporate were the only reason to stay.
good,"A typical day at work was fairly simple, I knew most of my customers personally so getting them was like greeting family and friends. I learned plenty of recipes and new ways to interact with serval different people and personalities. The management could have been much better and more employee focused. The hardest part of the job was just learning how to make the different types of coffee. My most enjoyable part of my job was making life-long friendships with my coworkers and customers."
good,"From day one, fast-paced and fly-by-night. Less than ideal structure, supervision and accountability. The hardest part of the job was open hostility when someone advanced or was promoted, and the relationships built with customers was the highlight."
good,"Working at Starbucks leaves you feeling undervalued and stressed. Many days you work alone, and it makes the pay not worth it. The benefits cost more than they are worth."
good,"I entered into my job at starbucks knowing it would be fast-paced and stressful at times, but little did I know my manager would literally scream at everyone behind the scenes, throw me into the drive-thru with no prior experience and get mad when I messed up, and refuse to train me using the starbucks protocol training videos and handbook because she thought she knew better.  Some of my coworkers were pleasant, but there were cliques and so much gossip, especially over the headsets which always ended up causing drama.  10/10 wouldn't recommend, especially if its a drive thru location."
good,"There were many days that I did not enjoy being employed at Starbucks yet I had many days that I felt great to help my guests with their orders, to life stories."
good,"i went through multiple different managers, from experienced to hired outside of the company, which was one of the worst periods I've ever had to endure. they transfer in and out willy nilly and without consent from supervisors, like we're toys. "
good,"I am thankful that this was my first job opportunity because this job taught me how to be more responsible with my work, how to work fast paced, and how to maintain a positive attitude while working in a stressful environment. I enjoyed learning from some of my coworkers and my managers."
good,"Had a very negative experience when it came to management and other staff. I was given the chance to give my availability, however continuously got booked on days I said I could not work. Was then told I was responsible for those shifts even though I had other commitments. As well, when I gave my two weeks notice, I was given a very hard time by other staff members. I was verbally insulted and spoken down to. Did not enjoy the experience of my last month there."
good,"this was a very long time ago, and is a fine job for a kid just picking up extra hours, if they're still living at home and have no expenses. However if you have any sort of expenses, i would look elsewhere."
good,"I was glad to work with a good team of people. We worked well together to offer fast and possitive  costumer service. However the hours were short and no medical coverage was offered. The management often failed to order the supplies we needed to make the drinks which would upset our customers.  Working hours were never constant, often obligations were forgotten about even when you informed management in advanced and then it was left up to you to find someone to cover for you. I would not recommend this employer to someone who needs to provide for themselves or others, it would be a good summer job for a student."
good,I love the idea of starbucks.  However the employees and management at the store level is very hit or miss.  They don't seem to care about the job or the customers at all.
good,"For me the best part of the job was the time slot, and location. Close to home and I wasn't there all day, but still manage to get the hours I needed. The worst part of the job is there are way too many regulations and tasks to do for the lack of pay. Very back breaking when it didn't need to be, so complex and over complicated. Also workers tend to be too social and failed to act as a team leaving work for others to do. It was interesting learning how to make there beverages, and use an espresso machine."
good,A typical day could go from having one to two customers to a long line. Knowing most of the customers and what their drinks are makes it easier to get the line down. The hardest part was remembering how to  make all the drinks. The best part would be getting to know the customers
good,"The job tasks were very enjoyable for me, however the management gossiped about employees, and were very unprofessional. This made the place of employment within target very uncomfortable and difficult. They did not help the employees when needing assistance nor give effort into seeking information when introduced to a problem where they were unsure of."
good,"I never liked working for this company. For the year that I was there I had to go to the emergency room 3 times. One for anxiety and the others for bladder infections due to the fact that it was always busy and no one could relieve me to use the restroom. The manager was the worst, he was more into working with men than women. I had bad anxiety that I thought was because of the coffee but when I left the anxiety did too."
good,"The job itself is quite fun and not hard at all, but the management makes it miserable. Upper management and their decisions are horrible as well as who they choose for advancement. Customers are regulars for the most part, and that's the only thing that's actually worth it. The network you get just by your customers is amazing. All in all, i won't be returning once i quit."
good,"I have worked at Starbucks for 12 years. I have meet great people, while working at Starbucks. Some of my best friends are my previous co-workers. The job itself is fun, but the corporate culture and upper management is horrible. Over the years, I watched the bigger company gets the more it becomes like any other corporation; maximize the profit and do not really care who does the work. Constant pressure from upper management unrealistic goals, and no courage from upper management to tell their executives that some of the goals are unrealistic. It is centrally controlled, constantly cutting labor hours, long hours under paid for the amount of work. The management position  is very stressful, It defiantly does not worth for amount the of money they are paying. I do not miss the company at all. I am mad at myself for working for Starbucks for that long."
good,"It was ok for the time being but its not for everyone. You have to make sure everything is clean, clean toilets, and the floor. Which I didn't mind, it's just a job. But for all the work we did as far as that and making coffee, heating up food, and also pouring drinks for people.. It wasn't worth 8.25"
good,"i love meeting new people at work, but i need a more challenging job to better myself."
good,"Starbucks is a great company to be employed by. There are great health care benefits and stock options as well as education assistance that Starbucks offers to their employees. The scheduling can be a bit demanding due to the extensive hours some stores are operative for, but as long as you are part of a store that is well staffed and management is supportive of employee needs, Starbucks offers a great work place to be a part of."
good,horrible!! treated like the step children of Macys. No Benefits unless you are full-time!!
good,"Really enjoyed working there the first six months, after that it was not the best. Work and school life was hard to balance, management expects too much. Depends on management how much you will like your job.  If you work in a drive thru store, it can be stressful. Best part is definitely the partners, the regulars and the benefits and perks."
good,Management at Target was not helpful with helping the Starbucks department. I learned to work by myself as we were always short on baristas. I had some wonderful coworkers who helped make work easier through all of this.
good,Management makes it quiet clear who is at the top of the list and who is at the bottom. Management hardly does any work while it employees do most of it.
good,Starbucks is a great company for its customers. Management is terrible and the workers are severely underpaid and under appreciated. There’s no room for advancement as a student.
good,It really depends on the team your working with. Most supervisors suck and the manager really don't get that hands on unless its dire. Overall its awesome to work their while your young and have no real responsibilities.
good,"The liberty lake atmosphere is toxic. The people are cruel, the staff doesn't train you and it's all very unfair. Managers talk inappropriately to customers."
good,"Not Starbucks' fault but that's the lasting impression I have now."
good,"Honestly this is a job I would have loved to have had when I was younger. I feel that working as a barista could be really great. As a store manager I adored my partners and they were why the job was worth doing."
good,"The benefits are good if you can afford them. Always confused on the criteria used when deciding to promote managers. Of the 6 managers I've worked under, only 1 was completely competent; and they were smart enough to leave before getting screwed."
good,"At first I was super excited about learning all the tips and tricks of the famous coffee chain. The people at my store were the best people that you could have ever worked with. Then I moved to Reno. Every store seemed like the people hated being there and the customers were all overly demanding and purposely would use key words in order to get their items for free. There was even a story that a woman complained so many times that she got $1000 gift card to stop complaining. The advancement in the company was based on Pure favoritism. Telling one barista that ""Mangers cannot promote in-store."" (which I learned was true) only to promote someone else in-store and make some excuse why they were an exception. If you want to be constantly tired, yelled at, overworked, and have little work/life balance than this is the place for you. As for me I lost all hope and want of helping people because of this company. In fact, I have yet to buy anything from the company after leaving."
good,"Starbucks was not bad at all I think its one of those jobs where it depends which one you work at, the one that I worked at was inside of a target and the management was not good at all"
good,"The job can be pretty tough, especially dealing with angry customers about their coffee early in the morning. Pay is minimal for effort put in. The manager is hardly ever on the floor and has terrible communication with the staff. It's a very corporate environment even though it's made to seem as if it isn't."
good,Management is by far the worst you tell your manger the problems and turn the cheek the other way. It’s flexible hours and good pay but management is very bad !
good,"bad management, pretend environment of safety but a slave ship like work force. its not a place of joy like the commercials at all. and their waste management is disrespectful to the economy"
good,"Employees are wonderful, management is horrible. My manager was consistently scheduling me out of my availability. But I met some of the best friends I've ever had at starbucks."
good,"Stores go through one terrible manger to another like the weather .Upper management will sooner blame lower level employees before fixing management issues . Every manger ,even different stores are all very cliquey, which means friends will be hired and favorited as far as schedule , amount of work they have to put in etc . Same goes for other employees that are friends with  supervisors or employees.anyone else expect to work like you're getting paid a million dollars and are saving lifes doing this job . New to the company ,Don’t expect to even be trained until you get in with your store’s “group “. you will be treated with extreme disrespect, while being the “new kid” . If you can put up with that for a year (less if you make friends quickly )for a job that’s a step above fast food. it’s not terrible just don’t make a career out of it . Once you’re  in with the clique, you really won’t be doing much work during a shift more hanging out while the less liked or new employees do most of it . It’s really not hard work, some days could even be enjoyable depending on who you work with that shift ."
good,The company has faded away over the years. Focusing less on customer service and more on drive thru times and profits. The staff is not paid enough for the tasks required.
good,"There may be some Starbucks stores that are good to work at, but not the store that I worked at."
good,"Honestly, most of the items are overpriced and drinks get new toppings with a 2 dollar price raise. Starbucks likes to seem as if they care about customers but only cares about money."
good,"I expected to be overwhelmed with opportunity but sadly was not."
good,Fun atmosphere. Customers were always great. Management differed  from store to store. No consistency. Upper management never promoted from within. Great college job. Great flexibility but extremely high pressure and I don’t know that each position is compensated fairly in my opinion
good,"I enjoyed being a barista. However, my coworkers and I were all yelled at a lot and I found it incredibly unnecessary. The yelling was quite aggressive and it made me anxious to go work. Additionally, on a more than two occasions I was scheduled on days I was noted as unavailable."
good,"Horrible management and benefits. Good schedules. Fun coworkers. Learning drinks and how to prepare them. Learning how to do inventory. Poor teaching skills, had to learn on my own."
good,It was very difficult working at Starbucks i did not receive proper training.There was poor management. However there was great teamwork. Store manager normally unavailable.
good,"This was a fun fast paced place to work, management wasn't the best. If you fast paced work with little downtime this is the best job for you. Teaches good customer service"
good,I work at a licensed store and everything is backwards. We don’t get tips or any of the perks of working for Starbucks but are required to do twice the work. Had I known this coming in I would not have taken the job.
good,During the colder months Starbucks will give you little to know hours. Only supervisors receive over 30 hours. There's also no room to grow it takes years to be promoted to a supervisors. This job is best for students.
good,"I'm sure not all Starbucks are the same. However, in this particular location, the manager was horrible and did not teach and manage well. It is very quick paced and takes a lot of memorization and multitasking. Should you do well with that, by all means, go for it!"
good,"I am now working in the floral department of Dillions. But at one time I was working in the Starbucks kiosk of Dillons. "
good,"working for starbucks was not my ideal place to work, it was crowded and messy, the staff did not work together and constantly had people not turning up for their shift."
good,"I worked at the white Bear location and it was the biggest mistake of my life. The store manager is a nightmare to deal with, and the distract managers just let the store managers do whatever with no corrective action. I watch her belittle partners, her shifts, and regulars. They also have no respect for your life outside or Starbucks or your time off. I was constantly bombarded with texts, calls, and pressured to come in on my days off. If you’re looking for a fun part-time job or this is your first job: keep looking. The turn over rate is extremely high for a reason."
good,"was a busy environment, under staffed so always had to work overtime. was no overtime pay. learned how to do daily cash outs, stocking, working cash register, customer service."
good,"They are not what they claim to be . I was overworked , and promised compensation.  Never was respected as an employee.  They became very corporate,  they promised a lot,  but never delivered."
good,if you work inside a grocery store Starbucks you get little to no benefits. people are not work friendly everyone cares for them selves. they refuse to help one another.
good,Opportunities for advancement in this company were limited. Turn over was ridiculous and workers would often be overworked as a result. Serving people as a team in the mornings can be difficult but when achieved the feeling was amazing.
good,"Always understaffed, under appreciated, and over worked. Manager played favorites and would treat employees extremely differently and would often talk about other employees to other employees. "
good,"I'm sure there are great Starbucks stores to work for, but my store manager was one of the worst people I've ever worked for. He made empty promises about advancement, consistently undermined me to my baristas, and lied to all of us on a daily basis. He created one of the most toxic environments I've worked in. I only stayed as long as I did because I thought I was going to be able to move up and transfer."
good,"You get paid 9 dollars an hour and not only do you make drinks. You scrub toilets, get on your hands and knees to scrub drains, wash dishes, restock things in the back. Wash windows. There are many strict rules that must be adhered to. There is alot of flexibility and fun as far as dress code goes. Most piercings and tattoos are accepted. Even colored hair, jeans and plaid can now be worn. But only in certain colors. Management was absolutely horrendous. Frappucino Happy Hour: a complete nightmare."
good,"for me was walking in to the most amazing group of co-workers, who were already stressed. I often struggled at the location I work at because the lack of parking validation to it's employee's. Recent National News of the corporation discrimination has brought light to what most co-workers hold in secret, they have a huge problem with management. Starbucks needs to come up with unique ways to get to know those rendering services and being serviced. I do not think the corporation is racist but I know they could use help on communications and the proper way to go about communicating to not only say they have a diverse atmosphere but live by it. The corporation actually had one of the most heart felt efforts towards giving back world wide and seems to be supportive with helping to continue your education."
good,"Overworked and underpaid. If you have a good manager by your side you can advance in the company. Most managers just want to do what they can and then leave. Staff is horrible, no one in this company wants to do more then they have to"
good,"Great place to work for college kids looking to get extra money or job experience. Management is terrible, benefits are not that great. But hey, you get free coffee....."
good,"There is nothing nice I can say about my situation. After 10+ years of repetitive movement, I ended up with severe carpal tunnel syndrome in my right hand and minor in my left. I had the surgeries to repair and came back to work 6 months later. Unfortunately, I didn't realize I wasn't at 100% until after getting back into the routine. I ended up just being a cashier when I had given a customer a discount. I was written up for the incident and 4 days later, terminated for it. I believe the manager was unhappy that I wasn't able to start where I left off. She, and the supervisors under her, made several comments about me not being at 100%. Will I go back to work for Starbucks? Not a chance. I was not treated fairly when I first went on leave, I had to obtain an attorney; and, returning to work was a nightmare. I am now permanently disabled in my left hand and got nothing for what I've given to the company."
good,"Starbucks is amazing if you have a good manager. Unfortunately, my second manager was very passive, and didn't manage the people as well as he did the logistics. There was a lot of harassment going unaddressed, even after telling my manager what was going on-- not to mention, multiple women came to my manager to report some of the inappropriate behaviour of our male coworkers and nothing changed."
good,Quick paced job. Not meant for everyone.  The management here is not great and the store manager has all of her friends working there now so it is mor of a groupie store than a business. If you dont stay on task or she sees that you cant cut it anymore she will find a reason to get rid of you.  Not a good place to work at.  Last time i was in the store was dirty and the workers are very rude.
good,"beautiful location with so much potential, except cross department communication is non-existent as well as any sort of leadership within the property."
good,the people you work with are very fake they all talk about each other behind there backs and they will do anything to pass the blame on to someone else
good,"Overall Starbucks isn't a company that treats its worker horribly. I have learned many details about coffee and teas. However, perhaps it is because the manager that I have worked under was new with the addition that the store was low on staff. No one bothers teaching me how to make coffee for about 2-3 months.   It is very difficult to take days off even when you are sick. In addition, I prefer to have my working hours as stated on the schedule. There are times when it was slow I was let go earlier."
good,A shift supervisor at  Starbucks works harder than anyone. they are expected to do everything a barista does plus added duties and be in charge or a team while being the scapegoat for your manager who can throw a SS under the proverbial bus to a district manager whenever they don't get their job done.
good,This job was very fast paced. The management was also very political and they had favorites. Any body above a store manager was usually hired in and knew little to nothing about working there. The coworkers were sometimes supportive but it was really hit or miss. really a glorified coffee mcdonalds.
good,Loved the job and all the training it came with. The problem this location had was the MANAGEMENT!! You go to the Manager for issues you have and they never get solved.
good,"I worked here while I was going to school, and it was perfect. The flexibility of hours meant I could work full time while going to university full time. The Starbucks corporate culture is a bit much though, if you haven't drunk the koolaid. Management has a high turnover rate, which causes chaos at the store level."
good,"Aramark is a large and continuously growing company. There are a ton of options to grow if you give it your all. Unfortunately the amount of work that it takes to get the job done (in a management position) is insane. Its a lot of work, but the pay is decent."
good,"A good job if you enjoy fast paced environments and coffee. You pretty much have to love coffee to work there (or tea, at least). "
good,They fired me while I was pregnant instead of the girl stealing from the job because I was still on probation after they hired too many employees after another Starbucks closed down.
good,"Starbucks is famous for touting its employee benefits -- from a generous 401k matching scheme to its healthcare plans -- but for a vast majority of its employees, these are meaningless. When your take-home pay is so low that you qualify for Medicaid, it doesn't make sense to enroll in the company's health insurance plan, and company matches to 401k contributions don't amount to much when your gross biweekly pay is often less than $600."
good,"does not appreciate their employees"
good,"A typical day at work would be opening at 8am, and managing a quick 30 min setup.  Morning rushes hit and are easily managed if you have the experience.  I learned a lot of skills such as measurements, how details matter, drizzle, and customer service."
good,"Hours can be long, the company discourages managers working overtime, however, the amount of ""off the floor"" time is insufficient to meet all job requirements (eg, coaching, scheduling, payroll, inventory management, etc). You get free coffee, though."
good,Overall a solid company but the dm and different mangers i worked for made it very easy to hate and hard to stay in love with my first years was amazing i loved every minute of it and met some outstanding human beings including my first dm but once the new dm came every thing start getting bad im not a saint i make mistakes and take up for my part in my departure from the company but overall as i stated earlier a solid company
good,"Çalışanın özel hayatını , sosyalleşmesini tamamen engelleyen bir çalışma şekli vardır."
good,The hardest part of my job was dealing with co-workers who had a bad attitude as well as lacked initiative in helping others. Certain management were hard workers. The most enjoyable part of the job were those customers who made the day a little bit better.
good,"When I got hired I told myself, "" Best job any teen-age kid can get."" To be very honest, is somewhere I would double think to go back. Back at the store I worked for it had one of the worst management and supervisors. It was fun at sometimes, but I would not go back to work there."
good,"You do get cool benefits but overall you don't get paid enough working full time.  The most hours i ever got was 35 making minimum wage, unfortunately its a fun job just cant feed your family on the pay or hours.  Some of the managers are also very harsh to the employees and push you around a lot."
good,"* A typical day at work pending if I am opening or closing store. Assign associates to positions, daily required documentations, daily cleaning, assist associates in providing the best customer experience we could provide. "
good,"Not the best job to have when you don't drink majority of the selections, but it's defiantly a eye opener with calories as well as the behind the scene coffee making."
good,"Working at Starbucks was by far the worst job experience I have ever encountered. The over sized company merely thinks of you as a number in their system as opposed to the actual human being that you are, creating an unsettling and unwelcoming environment in the workplace. Supervisors were trained to put down their co-workers instead of help them succeed and move forward in the workplace."
good,"The Starbucks I worked at had poor management and led me to a couple of the worst panic attacks I'd  ever had. The stress over trying to get coffee drinks out of the drive-thru window at breakneck speeds was getting to me. Though, the stress was not caused by the impossibly high-speed work environment. The stress mostly came from unrealistic expectations on the night shifts (the shifts I worked most consistently), along with a failure of communication between the store manager and the baristas. I often felt like the day-to-day problems I came up against were pushed aside or regarded as unimportant. When I attempted to move up to a shift manager position, my interest was all but completely ignored. There was no follow up, despite my semi-frequent reminders of my interest."
good,Bad hours and bad management. The communication is horrible. Leaves you alone even when its busy to deal with a line of people who arent too happy about the wait and feel bad for you. Only thing I enjoyed was making the drinks.
good,If this is a temp job for you then go for it. You meet nice people and some VERY annoying people. Overall would only work here temp.
good,Really bad hours.  Not enough people scheduled which messed us all up. Never had everything we needed.  Management was terrible. Always drama.
good,"A typical day at work is starting at 5am-1:30pm"
good,"This job is perfect for college students or people needing a flexible schedule to supplement their incomes. Tons of customer service in a fast-paced environment. However, in my experience, there were terrible managers, low pay for amount of work and a typical corporate environment looking out for that bottom dollar."
good,"A typical day in the work life at starbucks is very busy and fast paced. I've learned to use the micros system, to make drinks fast and effectively and to multi-task; this is a must! Management here at starbucks really lacks and is poor. My coworkers are alright, they just lack the focus. The hardest part of the job is that we have so much to do but are given very little time to do so. The most enjoyable part of working at starbucks is interacting with a diverse group of people."
good,"Starbucks was an interesting job, i enjoy working with the public"
good,"When I started, Starbucks had a great atmosphere, great employees and the store ran like a well oiled machine. By the time I left, we had gotten new management that decided to break what had worked fine for a year+ and ran the store into the ground. Didn't get paid enough for what was asked of me on a daily basis."
good,Handled transactions and kept store clean.  Excellent to gain experience working with public
good,"As this was a franchise shop Starbucks did not have great influence her. The Starbucks was owned and run by Eurogarages who were more interested in profit margins than the people who worked for them or the guests."
good,"A little background of this particular Starbucks, it is on a school campus, therefore all employees are managed by the school.  Student workers earn no vacation, benefits, etc."
good,"work as a barista was messy, loud, and hectic. I enjoyed every bit of it, from the different aromas of the coffe and baking cookies to the splashing milk while being steamed and the sound of coffee beans being ground up. "
good,"The manager was VERY unprofessional, and the cause of alot of drama and gossip"
good,"Despite the lack of hours I recieved it was an enjoyable workplace. I would have liked to have been trained in the making of the drinks, but unfortunately I was used strictly as a cashier."
good,You learn new things every day
good,"Put three years of my life into this corporation. The work is absolutely exhausting. Constant cleaning of drains, uptight customers, and lousy pay. Worse than all of that, ones hard work isn't recognized. Climbing up the corporate ladder within the company is a slow and demeaning incremental process."
good,I worked several Starbucks locations all over the US. When transferring from one Starbucks location to the next due to family issues. My seniority and job placement did not transfer with me. Put myself at the bottom of the list again and 2 or more years to work myself back up. I did not have the time to do that there for many reasons and was told my rank would transfer with me. This caused issues within management and with my work attitude. I had been told that my position would be transferred from previous location due to the fact that the new location I would have to travel over an hour each day to get to work. Management at the new location was extremely difficult to deal with and not understanding of my family situation at the time which then lead to me quitting the job.
good,"Starbucks coffee company has gone down hill the last few years, we are over worked and taken advantage of. Management is not trustworthy or supportive, and job advancement doesn't happen unless you show you can handle the stress and constant under-staffing. The benefits compensate for some of the cons working here, but only for a short amount of time."
good,"I enjoyed the fast pace environment and being on my feet."
good,The company would fare better if it would address advancement issues. I worked hard for three years and was passed up for advancement opportunities because the regional manager would only promote young women willing to sleep with him. He was fired but it left a very poor taste in what I had thought was a company that values advancement from within the company.
good,Always guaranteed  more hours than contract. Very hard to make plan or even doctors appointments while working here. Expect to stay longer or do covering shifts more than you’d want. Always feel scared to get asked to come in on rare days off
good,"I enjoyed many of the social and educational aspects of working at Starbucks. It has a lot of the same qualities that breed workplace aggression and toxicity between employees, such as missed shifts with no one available to cover, and poor management. Wouldn't suggest it to someone who has to provide beyond themselves."
good,"I previously worked for Starbucks, but I had to leave to relocate. The location u worked for before u came back was fast paced but realized and family oriented. Once I reapplied, I was sent to an extremely fast paced location, with terrible management and even worse customer experience. I believe Starbucks needs to place certain restrictions on customers to keep the retention rate of their employees at a minimum."
good,"The manager wasn't very open minded when it came to me having depression. He was a bit judgmental, when I resigned, he didn't have anything positive to say. The hours were flexible and It was a fairly small environment, it wasn't difficult to complete my tasks."
good,"I worked for HMS host under  the Starbucks  brand. While having a good team the company has a horrible habit of not promotion from within, instead having their already train personal, train new people to fill open positions. There are no benefits at all offer for free in the company you have to pay for them all and management cares more about what the hire ups want that their actual staff to the point their turn over is stupid high cause people quite so much."
good,Good people to work with.  Customers were the best part.  I was not a fan of some of the drinks and i feel they were getting to far away from their roots.
good,"My manager was terrible. She took my tips (which is illegal). The environment was very unprofessional, drama at every turn, and customers were insanely rude there. Especially regulars. Also, I worked at a licensed store, so we didn’t get discounts on Starbucks or even a free drink or meal like corporate/stand alone Starbucks do."
good,It was fun at times but mostly high paced and stressful. People I worked with are great. Management wasn't great at times. Scheduled shifts never the same. Most of the customers are great but some are not so much. Company has some good benefits but the are hard to assess.
good,Although it was a good company  the management wasn’t very great. If you get sick at work they won’t let you leave  working with food that is very dangerous
good,Lack of team work at the location I worked at. Kids came and went pretty quick... some days were really good and some other days where I would go to the bathroom and end up crying... it’s stressful. But they will tell you it’s only coffee... it was fun but never properly got trained and made my experience not very great...
good,"Starbucks is known for being a good place to work, but unfortunately that was not my experience there. It was difficult to move up and hard-workers are often overlooked. Management was terrible and I went through 5 different store managers in 3 years. There is a very high turnover rate and a lot of expectation for a low hourly rate. The other benefits are fantastic, especially for college students."
good,Relaxed environment at a Starbucks kiosk inside a grocery store. Slow-paced since there was not a lot of traffic and the people were great to work with.
good,"Training is sink or swim, and there is a general lack of communication among managers and upper management. Prioritize cutting labor with unobtainable expectations of store quality and dismal team morale."
good,It’s not worth the pay . They can do better. You have to know what’s right or wrong because they will not break it down to you . When you first start. Starbucks is a big company that can pay more money
good,"My biggest issue with Starbucks was the ridiculous load of work laid on a person, but such little compensation. The people were generally nice, but the managers didn't care about anything but numbers. It can be a fun environment and you may make a few friends, but it's definitely not a job to keep you afloat."
good,The job was ok the people weren't. Management was a joke actually for a company of this magnitude i was shocked at the way it operated. Everyone has a opinion this just happens to be mine.
good,Management at the moment is HORRIBLE!!!! Never enough help! They leave you working alone all the time! Managers in the store will see you struggle with a line out the door and not care. People will call out and they won’t call anyone in because they are “saving” hours for their monthly bonus! Very stressful job!
good,Overall it wasn't that bad of an experience. Really forces you to adapt to fast paced enviornments. People can be real pretentious sh*theads about their coffee though so prepare for that
good,High work load/ high stress environment. Lots of cleaning tasks. Work is not distributed evenly across all workers. Some noticeable favoritism and seniority present.
good,"While the job itself was fun, the target management was a let down and the advancements promised never happened. The trainers were absent at best. Seriously understaffed."
good,"this job is extremely demanding and stressful. you're trained to act like a robot and let customers walk all over you. the pay and tips aren't very good, and every day you go home stinky and sweaty and gross. this place is ALWAYS understaffed and the management is poor."
good,"The job itself is a great one but the Starbucks culture and management take a lot away from that.  Customers are wonderful, especially the regulars! Huge difference in local management."
good,"If you want the starbucks employee experience consider this a fast track. Survival of the fittest barista, not all succeed and very many fail. However if you fail, feel the need to leave as you may be prompted to stay with a raise. Coming in you will instantly feel overwhelmed as partners beg you to clock in early and when working a long shift you may not receive any breaks but you'll be asked to stay longer."
good,A typical work day at starbucks always involved the higher ups breathing down our necks while making drinks. When they do that i spend the whole day on a bad mood
good,"Overall working for this company was alright as far as pay goes. It is fast paced and you might enjoy the people you work with, but the people you serve tend to be snotty and difficult."
good,"Costumers were unnecessarily difficult, management was nonexistent (I did it myself), coworkers were incompetent. I ended up being scheduled full-time hours and doing managerial duties, while only making part-time pay."
good,Manager let employees run all over her with scheduling and this created a vacuum of certain shifts that were only covered by a select few good employees. This created a bad work/life balance by creating an inconsistent schedule.
good,"over all my experience working for starbucks was fair, although I believe that my store in particular was poorly managed and there was a lot of unprofessionalism when it comes to management and back of the houseleading to intenal issues and discrepancies"
good,"Great for College job or the job to make some extra money. There are several empty promises, so make sure you stay on higher ups to get you what they are saying they will give."
good,"They never were able to effectively work with school schedules, I was lucky to be online for most of my time there, but when I started taking on campus classes I was often scheduled during class. I was over worked and told that I didn't have a choice how many hours I worked a week. And I constantly felt judged and threatened by my main manager. The people were mostly kind and ok to work with, but the manager often pit us against one another. Overall I would not recommend working at this particular Starbucks location."
good,Cool job just didn't offer enough benefits and pay for my living. I need room for more growth and promotion. My manager was     a gip and always stank
good,Big Starbuck doesn't care about the baristas and shift supervisors that do that actually do all the work in Rural stores.  Just make money. Short staffed all the time. Managers that should not be managing leave awake of chaos.
good,"Hopes crushed by management, she was so frigid that she made every minute spent with her extremely uncomfortable. she did not understand the word empathy nor did she grasp the concept of employee praise. the manager's constant disapproval of employee decisions/actions her constant negative remarks or show of disappointment did the opposite of encourage to succeed. the manager pushed everyone down and intended for them to stay there losing confidence and spirit for the job itself."
good,Challenging environment with increased focus on mergers and acquisitions. Culture is very difficult but may be better over time. Highly hierarchical in decision making. .
good,"Working is very interesting and fun, you enjoy most of the time, doing the labor with casual environments which cause you not to feel exhausted at times."
good,"Starbucks became the love of my life when I started working there. I loved it and to this day have recommended it to everyone I know in search of a job. The only downsides I had was the terrible minimum wage of $7.25 when it was a very difficult job to do. All day I was on  my feet, always moving, rarely got a whole minute to myself let alone to relax. I would never work for Starbucks again simply because of how hard the job is for such little pay. If I were to be paid more, I would have that job in a heartbeat."
good,Overall had an okay experience. My coworkers were kind but there was a lot of drama. I was located at a Starbucks inside a Carrs Safeway so I didn’t receive tips. Management was rather poor and there was very little communication. On more than one occasion I had been called into work on my day off as early as 3am to stock and count shipments (which wasn’t in my job description).
good,"Starbucks was my first job when I moved to Vancouver. Because we were fully staffed, it was easy to get shifts covered when I needed to do other things in pursuit of my career. The hours were flexible, but the wages were pretty hard to live on. I was there for 3.5 years, so clearly it was right for me at the time."
good,"The work environment was enjoyable due the the coworkers and fast pace, but my management made everyone uncomfortable and I would not recommend my location to anyone."
good,"I worked for this company for over 10 years.  I watched as they slowly shifted the priorities of the company from the employees & consumers, to profits and image."
good,"Usually my location is fairly busy and I worked very fast paced, but had many run in with homeless people, and several issues with understaffing, and being scheduled outside of my availability"
good,"Working at a few different locations in the past year, there is definitely a huge change in the employees from my hire date. Most stores i've been in have a huge toxicity issue within their employees. They need to pay more and get rid of tenured partners who think they're above standards and rules."
good,"It's a great first job, pretty good benefits but not my choice as a career, very fast paced and customer based satisfaction, can be great if the right management is running the store!"
good,Starbucks offers wonderful benefits for partners working 20 hours or more. Unfortunately it is very hard to get promoted and they leave you out of the loop making it impossible to grow within the company
good,A typical day was decided by the supervisor. They would place the baristas where the deemed them the most successful for a smooth work day. I was usually at cashier or on bar making drinks.
good,"I have worked at two Starbucks within the Milwaukee area in Wisconsin and at both work places the managers were very inconsiderate, rude, & did not comply with my scheduling needs"
good,I love the job but I feel as if the partners are taken advantage of a lot. You are also underpaid for the long hours and hard work expected of you. Above all the benefits are not bad.
good,"I was employed through Aramark and wasn't familiar with them until sometime after I had gotten the job. I wasn't properly trained by my manager, they had changed my schedule numerous times during my employment with little to no notice (they were required to tell us 2 weeks prior as stated in our union contract), all issues I had stemmed from my manager. When I decided to present the issue to HR they were conveniently laid off without any reason."
good,"They will watch you break your back and then ask if you can stay an extra thirty minutes. The management is usually horrible. Varies from store, to district, to regional, but management won’t be great. Free Spotify is good tho."
good,"Starbucks was at one time a company that many sought employment with. Over the years, Starbucks has moved away from the partner/customer connection and more toward selling, upselling, drive-thru times, and cutting hours when possible to save money. As a barista, over the time that I worked there, I felt less and less like a ""partner"" of the company, and more like a cog in the ever-inefficient machine that is now Starbucks. Working in a high-volume store made matters even worse. I wish I could say better things about the company, but I left feeling overwhelmed and depressed. Working a four hour shift killed me. I became spiteful and resentful, as well as quite abrasive and mean. From what I saw, Starbucks absolutely cares infinitely more about cutting corners to save money than invest in their apparent ""partners"". The benefits are great, but only if you can afford them."
good,"I had good days at work, I would arrive on time and if it was a morning shift I'd make sure my morning tasks were done correctly, we would get slammed in drive-thru and i would be put on head set and handling money but very often would have to help other baristas finish drinks. Management was often on support and brewing coffee. The most enjoyable part of my job was making customer connection with people, I loved making their drinks and seeing there reaction every time was really a moment for me as a barista and i hope to have more of those. I was rarely put on bar but i knew how to make every drink because i would have to jump in and help out, i also was put on warming the food and preparing it properly. On the nights i closed i did all closing activity's including, deep clean play,making sure everything was dated and was ready for the morning, dishes, and making all customers drinks by myself in the last hour before close."
good,just didn't get enough pay and time. A lot of gossiping and some are just not really good to work with as well as the management it doesn't give you enough time
good,"Manager of the Starbucks kiosk was verbally abusive at times, high turn over of employees and NO support fro upper Vons management manager not supportive, would put team down. Always called in sick"
good,"Manager wouldn't work with schedule, but the job itself isn't too bad. VERY fast-paced and a lot to remember, but it gets easier. Would recommend if you enjoy food service, but otherwise, not great."
good,Really fast peaced and not well paid at all .......
good,I would not recommend working for a Starbuck located inside another business. You are treated poorly and because of too many workers you have less hours. No one ever listened to any important things i thought were necessary to discuss. I was made out to be a bad person even though they mistook me for someone else.
good,"Starbucks has always been somewhere I wanted to work. I really want to move to a role within corporate dealing with the community. As we have gone through some turn over within these past few months I now see that my advancement is low concern for everyone. I work about 50 hours a week. Come in on my days off and no one seems to see the extra effort I put in. The benefits are amazing. You get tips, but at a certain point it isn't enough."
good,Ok palce to work as far as environment went. Great benefits. Always lacked team work and management was always terrible. Most enjoyable part was the customers that you build relationships with.
good,Orders are prepared promptly and drinks are always made right. Especially when I have a Crazy order. I very Highly recommended this Starbucks Location
good,I wish Target treated their baristas in the same way Starbucks does. There aren't a ton of benefits. Too much work for too few staff and we are not allowed to take tips. We don't count as real partners.
good,Worked at a previous starbucks that was much busier and this was very slow paced. They wanted everything done at once yet one thing at a time. Poor dictatorship. Lack of fun. Management had favorites.
good,Baristas are paid minimally for doing 2x the work as the manager. Always short staffed but expected to maintain output. Most customers are not understanding or reasonable.
good,"This job was enjoyable when I worked part time, but much less so when I was full time. You are stuck as a barista or shift manager with little/no opportunity to grow. They force you to sell credit cards and other retail items. Getting time off around the holidays is hard or even impossible to come by. I don't miss it."
good,Gave them years of my life and never was my pay raised over 9.29 an hour. Worked to the bone with no recognition and worst management you have EVER experienced.
good,"Terrible culture, rude customers and partners. Would not recommend working here if you care about people treating you like a person. Expect gossip from coworkers and power trips from higher ups."
good,My last manager was terrible. He didnt get along with people or customers. Cannot offer better pay or hours. Not enough staff on floor to keep the stress down.
good,"I think Starbucks is a great company with great benefits for its partners. I think it would be even better if they could find some leaders for the company. For example, they need district and store managers that can take care of partners and be there when employees need them to be. I think if they could find  a way to keep their people happy - beyond the benefits it would be a fantastic place to work!"
good,"N/A, I have no comments to make. I enjoyed working for the company. Like any other company there is always opportunity for improvement. They just don't give their employees much of a voice. they need to actually get into the stores and here from the employees instead of always taking what the managers say. Employees that sre not manager also play an important role in the business. Make the part time employee feel important. I was not always in management and I always take that into consideration."
good,Starbucks is ever changing in its policies and standards at the moment and it's been hard for them to maintain those standards as a management team. Recommend waiting until new policies are set in stone
good,"Of the three managers I was employed under, two utilized intimidation and anger in order to attempt  to pressure workers to complete job. This created an unbalanced work environment non-conducive for proper mental health."
good,"I was stationed at a Starbucks within a Safeway for over a year, and it would have been excellent if management wasn't so harsh. I was regularly forced to complete tasks that were obviously upper management jobs, and did not get compensation. I was in a union job and was not given vacation days after asking for it off months in advance. Holidays are a must, seniority is heavy, and if there is only one person working in the kiosk, get out! You are required to work the entire kiosk alone for hours on end with no breaks (common shift was, 2 people in one day: 4:30 am-1 pm and 10:30 am- 7:30 pm) and if you do not have seniority you will have to work 6+ hours by yourself. Without intensive self discipline, you will not make it far. I'm sure cooperate Starbucks are better, but smaller ones inside stores should be avoided, as they are overlooked by the upper company and not seen as important. If you enjoy making awesome coffee and growing your craft and delving into your community, work here, but know that it takes a LOT out of you."
good,"Working environment is poor, and the staff there have a poor attitude, some people there have a lack of respect for other workers and the pay is unjustified compared to the amount of work that is done"
good,"Its a good job but the partners can be ridiculous to work with, just dont take any of it home with you, the store managers dont know how to do their jobs half the time"
good,"I had what to be a potentially amazing starbucks, sadly it was not part of the starbucks corporation. Meaning this store well self sufficient in its work ethics. Or so they thought. Not training employees properly, firing a barista for not being trained... leaving a shift supervisor unattended with their training, than given the duty to run, opperate,  and close the store. Worst experience with this but wish to change that if say a corporate opportunity came up."
good,"The company was great to work for if you weren't a store manager. As a store manager though, you became expected to work anytime even on days off or already having working a full shift that day if someone decided not to show up. "
good,"Very fast-paced and stressful, had to deal with many rude customers along with staff who wasn't very helpful or friendly either. The pay was not worth the stress, but tips were always a plus."
good,At first working there was cool but then management became very poor and the pace of customers declined drastically. They try to make you lose site of yourself and your  uniqueness.
good,"My coworkers were very awesome and I loved them also my manager tried her best to accommodate scheduling. We just didn't have enough help that we needed, and sometimes it really effected our inventory. Also the customers were a joy they had a clear cool, and collected understanding of any problems that we may have had. The environment was really laid back but, we got majority of business in the morning or mid day and would slow down towards the evening. Its friendly and encouraging place, like any job depending on your team and things to that effect it really makes a difference on the place. It wasn't really to much that I learned there since I've pervious coffee experience before working there but, I will say their large variety of drinks plays a big part in their success."
good,My manager refused to give  any days off no matter how many days in advance were given. Everyone else i worked with however was very kind and helpful.
good,"Management can be pretty condescending, and while they seem friendly at first it quickly becomes apparent that they don't care about properly staffing their departments (I would often see one person working the lunch rush by themselves in the fresh food section, and I often heard complaints about no breaks). Complaints by staff about poor cleanliness standards or gross violations of licensing policies went unheard until it was time for an inspection. It's an okay job if you need a paycheck, but expect a little less misery than working at a store like Kroger or WalMart, although at least they don't even pretend to care."
good,Work at your own pace but also get the job done Smiles speak to everyone always be happy that's the Starbucks way love coffee if you don't love coffee you will
good,Management is a mess. Generally doesn't understand how fast paced our store in particular here. Fellow workers and baristas are like a family. I stay to help them out until I can find a more suitable job.
good,When I first started working there it was amazing I had the best manager but it all went down hill after that manager quit. No one was doing there tasks in the morning it was all left for me to do at night or should I say attempt to do because they would yell at me if I didn't get it all done and clock off by 730.
good,"it was an ok place to work, management expected more without the title. people i work with were lazy and management seemed to neveer get the job done correctly"
good,It was an amazing experience at first until I further delved into the company. Management never was considerate of my family issues and coworkers made me feel unwanted and would tell lies.
good,"The difference between enjoying your job at Starbucks vs hating your job at Starbucks is entirely dependent on if your manager is a decent person or not. I've had cool managers that were easy to work with and didn't cause any problems, and I've had managers who were completely dismissive of their employees and walked all over us to appear valuable to corporate. Starbucks customers are also a massive pain, be prepared for lectures and disciplinary actions for things that are completely out of your control at the drop of a hat."
good,"Not a fan, worked there for 4 years and it just kept getting worse and less employee friendly. Early morning with grumpy people is also not amazing. Managers can be good or bad and it's hard to tell until you're stuck. The drinks are fun, but get super annoying to make."
good,Fun interactive job. It is fun to make drinks and get to really know your customers. Hardest part of the job is being on your feet all day. However the pros outweigh the cons.
good,"If you get a good manager then you will likely have a wonderful experience. If not or if management changes it can quickly turn very sour. Benefits change frequently, they were in the past wonderful but have taken a hit lately."
good,"Bad management"
good,"I had both great and terrible experiences at Starbucks. While the company itself has good values, it seems they seldom hire management that upholds them."
good,"I had worked in a cafe prior, and was incredibly excited when I received this position. I was disappointed when I ran into immediate conflict with management, and an extreme lack of ability to accommodate a medical need that was entirely out of my control. I will always love the cafe life, but I will never go back to this company."
good,some customers are extremely rude and management takes their side and don't protect its employees like it should. And some shifts let their positions go to their head.
good,"Starbucks is an incredibly fast paced work environment, however the Human Resources department is lacking. There is little opportunity for advancement and people are oftentimes taken advantage of in lieu of self preservation for management. The pay is not fair, and the hours are not consistent enough to rely on."
good,Besides the most recent manager who was not very positive to be around and favored other employees I enjoyed my time at Starbucks. However they need to modify their policy due to sick employees. I had to jump through hoops when sick and I had to call several other employees and scramble just to find someone to replace me. When you are very sick you lack energy to even pick up a phone. It's wrong and I hope they fix this policy.
good,Managers made it difficult to maintain a job there because of changing my schedule all the time and scheduling me on days I had to be in school. They only cared about making money.
good,"Overall I enjoyed my time at Starbucks. It was fun and fast paced,  but the stress level could easily go from 0-100--- real quick. The management at the store I worked for was horrible,  which is very unfortunate because we had very loyal customers who deserved the best service. The shift managers were rarely -if ever- willing  willing to train newcomers. So if you actually had a desire to learn how to work well on bar or hold your own in drive through,  you basically had to fend for yourself and learn--- otherwise you're stuck in the back doing dishes or at the front register."
good,"A lot more difficult than people realise, they hire you based on personality so the people you work with really do make the job. The particular shop I worked in was the busiest in Ireland, and so staff were treated very unfairly as you were expected to do everything to an impeccably high standard all while basically doing the same amount of work as two people, Due to this there is very little patience when it comes to training"
good,training isn't the best at all levels. Building relationship wasn't a goal. under paid and under staffed most the time. I worked in the city probably different experience for others.
good,"very busy"
good,"A very fast-paced work environment, however slightly unorganized. I was able to work on my customer service skills and I believe that was what made me a well-liked employee."
good,Pretty busy environment. I had learned how to be more polite to customers and how to correctly make drinks. The hardest part of the job would have to be the rushes of people we get. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing a satisfied customer.
good,The work environment is not pleasant and its  the same company that I first started working in the company.the pay is not competitive and partners don't get paid like we should.
good,Great experience but rough management. I need more structure and more positivity. Managers didn’t manage correctly or enforce he Starbucks rules. Too much favoritism.
good,"Very nice company but the management needs more structure and improvement. "
good,Deliver high quality customer service and exceptional beverages to customers and ensuring their happiness upon leaving the establishment. ensuring accurate and fast delivery of their drinks or food
good,"I would open mostly, but it was a great work environment was good there were some issues with the upper management. But every work place has something that needs work. I like to bring new ideas to the work place to allow changes."
good,"Geodis is based on percentage, they don't care about much as long as you're at 90% or above. They complain about safety hazards, but do not do much to fix them or correct actions unless told other wise by higher up. Very contradictory place to work, great place to work if you love running around like a chicken with your head cut off, especially on very unorganized days."
good,"Starbucks was fun to work for, the only problem was the manager she showed a lot of favoritism. The ones she favor have gotten more hours, she wouldn't make schedule on time, so i would come in days. I would usually have work but the next morning seen she took me off, and I couldn't stay."
good,"Its a great place to work customers and coworkers are awesome and make the low pay tolerable, management is subpar its a great start for someone who is new to the work force and wants a part time job its great for developing people skills and learning how to mulitask"
good,"A tipical day will include Keeping stations clean and ready, preparing drinks to order and having a good positive environment."
good,"The job was very repetitive as a Barista, but on some days you will make very good tips, especially if you find a customer, remember their name, and prepare their drink exactly the way they like it. they will remember you too and are a joy to talk to."
good,"The typical work day consisted of making drinks, heating food, and feeling slightly nervous because everyone in our kiosk was being watched by the Kroger management."
good,"A very stressful and hectic atmosphere. Management is usually employees still in their late teens or mid-20's who favorite some employees over others, which will affect hours given. Brewing coffee and taking orders from equally stressed customers just isn't worth the minimum wage Starbucks pays."
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work if you plan on dedicating all of your time and energy to it. Forget school (ASU isn't free you have to pay half of the tuition up front and the cost of all of your books) doing family things, or a pay check that you can live off of. I do not know one person that isn't working two jobs, or on some sort of state funded welfare assistance. Unless your a shift lead or store manager."
good,"My pay wasn't very good, and I had a bad manager who pressured us into accepting far too many hours. However, not a bad first job, with room to grow and good benefits for full-time employees."
good,"I don't like it there anymore. Management is terrible and so are the hours. Why give everyone lots of hours just to hire 4 new people and then take every ones hours away again and then some. Can't afford to live off the hours they give. Seems when you work your butt off you get treated terribly, but when you do nothing and you're terrible at your job you get promoted and appreciated. Seems i need to work less and not as hard."
good,good job for people who can multi-task and like to stay busy because there is always something to do at starbucks. I have been doing this job for 3 years now as a shift supervisor and I am honestly sick of it and how hard I work but yet do not get enough support from my team as a whole; it is tiring overwhelming and not worth what they pay me.
good,"fun job, but management was terrible. always understaffed, and stressed out. not having enough staff put everyone in a bad mood and we couldnt make connections with customers. also tons of micromanaging."
good,"I've worked with the company for nearly four years and have just about worked myself to death. If you're just starting out you'll be fine, but after a while it starts draining you and I'm at a point where I would gladly walk out and never return if only I didn't have bills to pay."
good,"Poor management - manager was condescending and rude"
good,"I loved this job. Unfortunately, there was really no opportunity for vertical movement in my district. It seems to me that Starbucks is so busy being their version of ""politically correct"" that they often don't see the outstanding gems already in their midst."
good,Was saddened to find out working for Starbucks isn't all it is made out to be. The high demand and work pace weren't an issue for me but the management didn't seem to be able to handle it thus making it much more stressful then it needed to be. Many people only had their own well being in mind and didn't think of fellow coworkers. Management was unfair because some people used public transportation which was stated at time of hiring and then those who used public transportation were constantly in trouble with attendance because management would not work with their schedules.
good,"This job has a high level of stress for something that is relatively simple. There is poor management, and almost no room for advancement. Customers also tend to be rude."
good,"Coordenador de Plantão (Último cargo na empresa): Entre algumas das funções lançava notas fiscais, era responsável pela loja quando o gerente se ausentava, recebia entregas, cuidava da qualidade da loja como um todo."
good,"I greatly enjoyed my coworkers, working with and making coffee for customers is something I find very enjoyable, I hope to work for another Starbucks in future."
good,"Had alot of fun working with my coworkers, joyed our times together."
good,"It was nice at first, partners were nice and shifts were helpful. But as time went on and told my manager about my conditions because it effected my comprehension(autism and hard of hearing) and immediately my coworkers treated me like an idiot and the shifts would be upset for me not having better training when they would refuse to give me opportunities to learn. It started to come down to what felt like blatant discrimination and I was made to feel like I had to leave."
good,"Very stressful when rushes would hit and I was running the store by myself. Lazy management, didn't do much of their own work and left it for me after closing. Really rude customers, seldom happy or polite. Nice co-workers, fun environment. Fun making drinks and giving out samples."
good,"We had dress codes and rules for behavior on the floor. I'd come to work everyday and see people out of dress code and having horrible behavior towards other co-workers and customers. The manager just let it all slide for the most part, but acted as if he was forceful."
good,"Starbucks was a fun company to work for in the beginning , but due to lack of proper training and favoritism my skills at the job were only used to clean and mop the floors .  It was dreadful , I found myself only going to work for the money , a situation I never wanted to be in.  One the brightside I met amazing customers and baristas  that I made nice connects with. Starbucks employment benefits make up for the  injustice with my  baristas experience there . Overall I didn't give  Starbucks five stars because how they treated other baristas and I.  I decided to give  three stars because its a nice company  but they need a better system for baristas to voice their experiences so the company can run smother."
good,"not the ideal work place, the homeless that hangout there make the store less inviting."
good,"The people there made it worth while. Starbucks has a very good company goal and focus. The management was terrible, the new manager was a external hire and was very poorly trained. Ruined the atmosphere for the supervisors."
good,Es un buen lugar de trabajo para alguien que estudia o no es jefe de familia
good,"Don't work for Starbucks as a Customer Service Representative if you still believe that not all humans are horrible. A typical day for me involves handling call after call and dealing with the most insane customer's. Customer's will complain over the simplest things, because our management is HORRIBLE and spoils customers with a free drink here, or a free $25.00 there....but after you work for them for 3 or 4 months they change the game up and tell you that you are no longer able to provide them with free things. That leads customers to become escalated, and our days are filled with the wonderful joys of hearing how horrible we are as humans and we deserve to lose our job because their mobile application isn't working. And on another note the system we use is HORRIBLE. Customers expect speedy service but we are on the other side struggling to get their accounts pulled up because our system has froze for the 20th time that morning."
good,"learned the ropes of customer service from the best. "
good,Loved working for Starbucks. Great benefits and good company to work for. Upset that they got rid of yearly raises for their employees.
good,"Fun to work for such a huge company. Always being on the go from the minute you start your shift to the minute you end. I was shy when I first started working at Starbucks, after a while I came out of my shell."
good,"典型的一天:"
good,"A typical day working at Starbucks was always busy with multi characteristics coming through daily. Very enjoyable if you like to meet and get to know new people as well as preparing hot or cold tasty beverages along with a delicious treat. My co-workers were great, loved the vibe in the environment when working with them, always know how to be professional while enjoying work. Unfortunately the management wasn't great, working as a supervisor my main daily worry was when the General Manager came in. When she arrived she would yell across the store in front of customers, very unprofessional and customers would pull us supervisors aside and state ""where is your manager? you should report her to them"" and when the customers would come to find out that she was our GM they were shocked and disappointed. I would have to say that was the hardest part of the job, to have her yelling at us in front of our guest. The most enjoyable part of the job would be to work with a great crew."
good,starbucks has a great atmosphere and the employees are fun to work with. a little busy for the pay but its a great job for college or high school students trying to make some money.
good,was a fun and friendly place to work at. great culture of people and where the drive for the company comes from. would recommend it to  others
good,"fast pace work environment, can be fun as long as there is communication with partners and management. i enjoy my regular customers that come in daily who can make or break the shift. my co-workers are great as individuals but do not work together as a team  there is a lot of favoritism and lack of communication. the hardest part of the job is staying positive in a negative environment working here is quite easy a lot of repeated tasks. if you want empathy you have come to the wrong place. lots of room to grow and to move up in the company just not at this store if you do not bend the knee to your store manager or assistant manager. if you are not buddy buddy with the manager or her favorites expect to get transfered."
good,"The work of Starbucks I like but the employees I work with I would ask a question and they would have attitude about it . They talk about you, they get mad if your not going fast enough they don't motivate you when I go to work I'm not even happy because I have to deal with them. They think there your boss since they've been there longer."
good,"The management is childish, there is a lot of inappropriate drama that makes working near unbearable. Benefits are only allotted to a certain number of individuals no matter how much you work."
good,Started at 4am since it was at the airport we had to rush to get everything ready because we already had lines forming. I learned how to work in a fast pace environment. I was not there for to long unfortunately was not able to keep up with the pace. Was a very tiring job and straining as to the times we where not given breaks due to how busy it was.
good,"Shoppers would come into Target and want a drink from Starbucks. I had to make an assortment of espresso drinks or smoothies, and also make sure there were pastries out for the customers to choose from. I learned good people skills and how to work the cash register."
good,I learned how to deal with management and difficult customers as well as getting to interact with others.
good,"Long and hard, normally those favored by management wouldn't do much work. Unfortunately, all of my professional skills were learned through college and not from this job."
good,"I love the Starbucks brand, however, there was too much drama at this particular location."
good,"Its fun but not the best place to work, hours get cut and barely any benefits unless you work 40 hours."
good,"Une journée se déroule la plupart du temps de la même façon. Un travail monotone qui n'évolue pas, il n'y a pas de changement et quand on a appris les bases il n'y a plus rien a apprendre. Mais l'équipe est néanmoins agréable."
good,"Respecto a mis colegas, siempre fueron muy compañeros y así generamos un muy buen clima laboral. "
good,Wouldn't tell anyone to get a job here. Very demanding and not well managed. All they care about is profit and nothing about the partners that work for the company.
good,"A normal morning working in a college coffee shop starts out busy. All the students waking up after studying all night they need their coffee. I learned that teamwork is very important and it helps to have easy going, but responsible, managers. My co-workers were very nice and easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was working by yourself during a rush but the most enjoyable was hearing what the students all said about their classes and learning something new everyday."
good,"Busy Busy Busy, constantly on the go, and it is great to meet new people. I like the customers and the people I work with, the hardest part of the job is being on my feet all day."
good,I learn how to interact with people more i loved working at Starbucks! the job was never hard busy but not hard at all.
good,The job is Starbucks may be stressful at times but it pays off it teaches you things about this world and and how one can operate under immense pressure
good,I would say the hardest part of the job is working with the supervisors and the Baristas. A lot of the supervisors lack experience and positive attitudes. The Baristas also lack positive attitudes.
good,Chez starbuck  ce n'es pas  les conflits  ou l'ambiance  de travail  qui  dégrade  les employés  mais  bien  la nouvelle  gérante  qui  premièrement  ne ses pas lire n'I  compter  mes en plus  elle  chial  toujours  que  rien  n'es fait  à sa manière  tu n'as plus  de vie tu dois  toujours  être  là  à tous  surveiller  et remplacé  tout le  monde  et tu nettoie sans cesse des truck sans importance  nous ne sommes  pas  des esclaves  !
good,It was a lot of fun if you like your coworkers. The customers always come and go. Starbucks cares more about the customers than the staff. Spotify premium was a nice addition.
good,"I always felt understaffed, and they don't guarantee full time hours which is super stressful. Be prepared for lots of coffee knowledge, although the free drinks were nice ! The first manager I had there was named joe and he was amazing, every manager after that was a nut case."
good,"The work is tedious and there's little room for advancement. If you're looking for a job while going to school, this would be perfect as the schedule is very flexible. Don't expect a living wage or great benefits. You get to know the regular customers pretty well and the other employees are usually great to work with. You get free drinks and free food on days you work. There's no drug test and they hire felons."
good,"Good place to work if you like being a number. Hostile work environment and the young people only get advancement. They do no try to keep good people, and the turnover rate is crazy."
good,"I met lots of great people but the management is unsupportive and difficult to work with. It is a stressful job, and we don't even earn a living wage."
good,"Not all management is bad, but some specific locations have bad management from store manager, to district manager, all the way up to regional manager. Starbucks makes a big deal about mental health awareness and takes measures on the therapy and coverage side but does not take any measures to make the working envioronment more tolerable."
good,"I loved making coffee but the job itself was not worth the atmosphere. Hours were constantly cut even though being guarenteed a certain amount, was promised things that could not have been given, the cliques that formed were ridiculous and the pay wasn't enough."
good,The Starbucks I worked at was a mess it became under new management not even a month of me being there. One of the girls thought she was better than all the newbies even though she was only there 3 months longer. Baristas kept leaving left and right and it was so stressful.
good,"O.k company to work but better if you work for a license store, They pay better and are not as demanding of you to strickly fowling Starbucks company rules."
good,"I believe because Starbucks doesn't pay they're employees enough they dont work well and often call out causing hard worker to overwork them selves with little to no reward. It's very difficult to promote in this company; I've known partners who have been with the company 5+ years ,myself included, that have tried hard to rise through the ranks and offen times Satbucks hires managers from outside the company."
good,It is flexible for part-time work if needed as additional income. Do not expect much pay. The culture is hit or miss. Some stores are great some are bad. I'd recommend sitting in cafe of the store you want to work at to observe to see if employees are happy.
good,"this company has went downhill since the old CEO stepped down. Now they only care about making the customers happy even when it costs the company money, even if the customers are degrading employees. The vibe is a total high school drama vibe. There's pretty much no way to move up in the company."
good,"Working at Starbucks was fast- paced, and stressful. Often working long hours, and despite working 30+ hours a week it was still difficult to sustain myself due to only making minimum wage."
good,"Management is horrible they don’t value employees the benefits are ok but not great "
good,The company is very fun to work for if you are in High School or just graduating. But there isn't much room for advancement. There is not much work life balance and managers are not very willing to work with your schedule.
good,"Every store has a different atmosphere and vibe. It really depends on where you’re working. The pay is not enough as a barista, working full time, to manage bills and still be able to maintain saving. They do offer stocks and insurance options but that aren’t the easiest to apply for."
good,they will try to over work you at the one i was employed and employees were dropping from the ranks daily in my experience. I tried to stay as professional as possible in the face of all of it but management made that very hard with how the schedule fluctuated and interactions between employees. Overall it's a job and it isn't all bad since you get a free meal and free drinks and get half off of food after that. And if you go full time the benefits are legit good.
good,"Hard job,Good environment but low salary. being a barista at starbucks is always good for a part time job specially for students but serving people 8 hours per day is so tiring."
good,The management was not very good and neither was they pay. We were super understaffed which made for a very stressful environment. And the line was constantly long since we are located in the Shippensburg University library.
good,"Very busy, fast paced, and a good surrounding community. Turn over rate is high and there isn't any coverage for most of the day. Usually will see 3 people running the store at its busiest times."
good,"The job is not what you think it is, its way more stressful and you don't get paid enough to deal with what you have to go through. The managment is usually garbage and you're not guaranteed time off  at any point in time. The pay is trash where i live."
good,I enjoyed the environment but I was told for years I would be promoted just for me to get passed over even though they knew the other person was not right for the job. The highering rate was unfair and unethical as well as the way we were treated by the store manager. People were stealing and nothing was being done.
good,It was a great job for the short period of time I worked there the manager at the location wasnt the best but great co workers. I loved the atmosphere of working there.
good,It was an okay job to work. My manager was sweetheart but I felt like the work  environment was very hostile at times. The customers were mostly nice!
good,"Overworked, not enough staff, equipment constantly malfunctioned and we were expected to work even when the dish washer broke and we could no longer clean anything."
good,Very busy for several hours each day and then would slow down. Pay is not the greatest and work place culture is different at each location not the culture that you would expect from Starbucks.
good,"I worked for Starbucks 10 years or so before my second round working with them a few years ago and they definitely changed from focusing on their partners well being and job satisfaction first to focusing on their profits first.  "
good,I started this job at 19 which allowed me to learn and grow as a partner throughout the years. It helped with maturity and feeling more comfortable in my skin. Also helped me to learn how to talk to all different types of people
good,i enjoyed working there just not management. The hardest part of the job is not being able to correct rude customers even when youve done nothing wronf still haing to apologize
good,"If you are looking for a part-time flexible job, then this is the place for you. However, if you are trying to support yourself on this pay, then I dont recommend it at all. The raises are literally so small and only once a year, and if you get a minimum wage increase, you don’t get a raise on top of that. So if minimum wage is increasing throughout a period of a few years, then you will stay at minimum wage."
good,I was very excited to start at Starbucks unfortunately the time I was there is had a horrible manager who was very racist and homophobic. She made our work environment uncomfortable. I wish I had a different experience I would've stayed employed there.
good,"As a supervisor, I’ve experienced my managers and coworkers not taking criticism, lashing out due to criticism, skipping over me when it comes to learning more and progressing my own career within the company, among many many more injustices."
good,"Great to keep from being bored, for spending money, and for single people with low living expenses. Benefits ensure the bare minimum necessary for everyday life (healthcare, dental, vision) and a few nice extras (parental care, bereavement pay, etc) but actual wages do not match the expected level of work and tips do not always adequately make up the difference."
good,I worked at Starbucks for almost two years. I loved it and loved all my co-workers there. The last couple months we were there we got a new assistant manager who emotionally abused all of the staff and it was very difficult to leave but I had to.
good,"Im sure not all starbucks suck however mine did, people never showed up the manager wouldn't show up bc he didn't have a ride and the store manager was a complete mess."
good,Over all it's all about connecting with customers from beginning to end. It's starts off with the parents of the store meaning cleanliness. And making the customers feeling welcomed
good,"My store is a bit toxic, a lot of talking behind others' backs. But I know that other locations are superb, just takes a good crew."
good,"This job gave me a great experience in the field of customer service and it helped me with my communication and multitasking skills impeccably. However I worked very labor intensive shifts at sometime unreasonable times, for example 6pm - 2am three days a week and even sometimes 4am - 12pm. While this job did have some unbearable aspects to it, it gave me motivation to work hard at a full-time job and to always bring your best self into work."
good,"Great work friends, no life, manager is hard to work with, teach yourself how to do the job, rough customers. Not enough pay, Starbucks could use more help with treating their employees the way they should be treated."
good,"the environment of working there was not enjoyable. I ended up hating going to work. how clean the store was, it was always messy and disgusting. nobody wants to see a store they go to constantly a mess"
good,"Great benefits, not so great work environment. Starbucks partners are friendly and great to be around. It's hard to develop or grow from the inside, making it a better stepping stone to a career than an actual one. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers and pressure to be fast and perfect in every aspect. Constantly changing CEO's create a confusion of what exactly the culture of the company is supposed to be, and has resulted in oxymoronic standards."
good,If the customers weren’t so entitled to anything they want and free stuff if they bat an eyelash it would be a good job. I have never been treated so poorly by customers. The understaffing has gotten so bad our customers hate us but we aren’t allowed to call anyone in for help
good,"I had to quit because I was pregnant and sick, unable to work 8 hours at a time and they refused to schedule me anything less. Although, I worked through a Safeway so I do not believe the decision making came from Starbucks themselves."
good,"Super busy workplace, the amount of work you do does not add up to a reasonable salary, management will play favorites and cut your hours for no reason, not a reliable source of income."
good,"Se aprende a tener una buena relación con los clientes."
good,"The majority of the time I was there, the hours never complied with my school life and my managers refused to compensate and work with me to fix them."
good,"I'm someone constantly needing to be occupied with something to do. In this job, staying in the store 7 hours a day 5 days a week was torture... when the store isn't even busy!"
good,"No movement in role, no employee incentives and no benefits as it was a franchise, also low pay compared to company owned cafes and unsociable hours.."
good,"My manager was rude and he only cared about money. If I had to call in sick, instead of helping me find someone to cover, he would tell me I would get a write up if I didn't show up. This happened even when I had strep."
good,I have encountered several store managers who are surprised at being selected to become managers. You can tell that the company culture will die with them. How it was determined that they should be managers is a question that is just as easily answered by studying the leaders that promoted them. I hope for better for this company and its employees.
good,"Overall the staff was friendly, could be cliquy at times. Management often did not take personal needs into account, such as my maximum hours per week was 12-15 and I was regularly scheduled 30."
good,I like working for Starbucks but wish I got paid more hourly. My benefits are good but I don't get paid enough for what I deal with on a daily basis. I can work in all places of the store but get treated less then. My boss micromanages and can sometimes get feisty. People get angry and crazy over coffee and can be mean. It can be a stressful job but also can be rewarding.
good,"I left Starbucks due to poor management. The location did not make the employee a priority and often left feeling tired, stressed, and insignificant. The job itself was good, but the pay did not outweigh the difficulty. When I decided to resign, my manager refused to make time to talk about my last two weeks. I had to just not come to work because the manager would no longer schedule me and was fired instead of quitting. My previous location had better management but was still questionable. The managers are very knowledgable and good at their jobs, but prioritze rule-following to the letter and their personal (almost tyrannical) authority over the staff rather than making the environment an enjoyable workplace. They make exceptions only for themselves and partners are forced to compensate. This would have been a good job experience even with the difficulty of the work if management was better monitored."
good,"Very fast-paced environment, need good organization and people skills, must deal with stress well, early mornings. I did not enjoy working here, it was too stressful considering the lack of benefits and low pay since we cannot take tips."
good,It was a great job just didn’t really see recognition for going the extra mile. Higher level management don’t really see the hard work stores put in. But awesome place
good,There are a lot of changes throughout working at Starbucks so if you're not a fan of change I would not recommend working there. Management is not backed up by corporate so things can get out of hand when dealing with larger scale problems. One plus is the family you gain when working there.
good,"When i worked at starbucks no one taught me anything i would always be on the registers never knew the making of the bar. My most enjoyable part of the job was the costumers and how well you get to know them, their family's, and as well as their drink they order everyday. But always at the end of my shift someone always had to say something rude to everyone nothing ever positive."
good,"I liked Starbucks well enough when I first started a year & a half ago but now it seems like the management is making up expectations that are far & above a minimum wage job and they don't ever explain what they actually want from you as a partner. I asked about transferring out of state so I could see me family this summer after I graduate and I was under the impression that everything was fine until I came in 3 days later and started having regular meetings with my manager about my performance & was essentially told that I'm replaceable & that I'm not performing to the Starbucks Standards. I have yet to receive any sort of specific feedback on what I am not doing and it seems like every week there is something new that I'm somehow not doing. So if you can be a happy go lucky cheerful robot then Starbucks is the place for you. If you're human and sometimes you have off days, I don't recommend it. You aren't valued as a person despite what a lot of people will tell you"
good,I like making drinks this is the first time I've been on time to work very much enjoyed the environment. I like fast passed environments where time moves fast and customers are always happy Starbucks definitely provides that atmosphere.
good,Starbucks is a good place for a high school student to work or for just a part time job if you are not looking for much pay. You do get tips but they usually do not add up to much because they are usually over staffed.
good,I can't say I enjoyed being the only person who cared about the store or the customers. It was difficult to work somewhere where you would open and close inconsistently.
good,The harry and Rock location is like high school all over again. It's a social nightmare. It's morning crew versus night crew and no matter the issue it's nobody's fault because they were busy. There is no accountability or ownership over mistakes and management is passive aggressive instead of direct. Any other location in the city has the potential to honor the mission statement of Starbucks but Harry and Rock is not currently doing so.
good,"I loved the first two stores I worked at. Medical and dental plans where very expensive, and they messed up my pay for 2.5 months. My third store I loved the employees, but a new manager came in who had never worked at Starbucks before. She cut all our hours and  if we got a second job she would put a lot of pressure on us to quit. Even the shift supervisors she halved their hours and when they got second jobs she told them they had to step down. We all quit within 3 months of her becoming manager. She was terrible and I have never seen an employee last at that store more than 6 months, and it has been 6 years."
good,"The environment at Starbucks can be enjoyable. However, it can be a very face paced job, as many people come in throughout the day expecting fast and quality service."
good,"The managers tend to be too strict about standards. Supervisors gossip behind your back to cover their a**es. The job is ok, but I guess it was the staff in my store that contributed to the attitude I've got towards this company. However, there are pros as well:"
good,My days there were personally very tough because I felt that the majority of the staff didn't like me. That weighed on me heavily during my time there but I was committed to not allowing that to ruin my spirits while there. The hardest part of the job was definitely the work culture. My favorite part of the job was interacting with customers and showing off my interpersonal skills.
good,"Great for part time workers."
good,Starbucks is very beneficial to young people that’s in school . They work around your schedule. Keeps you on your feet and constantly moving. You’ll learn something new everyday
good,"Starbucks is a good part time job. Once you extend to full time, you just do not get paid enough for the amount of work and time that you put in. The perks are pretty nice- free beverages and a food item, as well as the 401k plan and ASU (if you take advantage of that). Working on weekends is definitely a downfall of the job for me."
good,"I worked at Starbucks for a little over 2 years and it was a very stressful and fast paced environment. While working at Starbucks I have experienced the worst customers in my entire 6 years of experience. I am often very friendly and happy yet many of the people I was helping were rude and very demanding. The management only cares about making more money instead of treating its employees right, as I said, very corporate. Everything is about speed now, instead of creating a welcoming and pleasant atmosphere as it used to be. Also, my store manager would constantly make excuses to stay in the back office instead of helping on the front line, even on very busy days."
good,"I worked at Starbucks after working at a Target Starbucks for a few months, and was honestly burnt out within the first three months. Personally, my schedule was never consistent and was frequently asked to work/ help out at other stores. Overall, it was a good in-between job, but not a career. I was offered a promotion and after waiting three months for the promotion to actually take effect, I left the company for another job."
good,Managers were disorganized and your personal needs were last priority. Customers were extremely rude and work environment was continuously hasty. Was fun only sometimes.
good,"After working for the company for five years, I had spoken with store managers about development and there were very little results. Several times I had been up for promotion, yet instead of investing in those who already work for the company, they continually hired store managers with absolutely zero experience."
good,"Most stressful job I have ever had,no team work and poor management.  They expect a lot for little pay and unless you kiss butt you will be treated the same as bad employees."
good,"Let’s keep it short and sweet shall we? You are worth more than Starbucks is willing to pay. "
good,"Working at starbucks was an experience. Yes, it was very stressful at times especially if you don't move as quickly as some customers may like. The workers were relaxed and welcoming for the most part. I learned that a lot of customers are rude when it comes to ordering their drinks and with that you just need to remain calm and collected."
good,always needed a new manager due to poor management skills. we were also given an expectation on how we needed to work chores throughout the day that did not accommodate with how busy our store would get.
good,"What used to be a company of partners working together towards a common goal evolved into a corporate money machine.  They do not care about you, they will not work with you, they will not promote you."
good,In a typical day of work I brew coffee. I learned how to brew coffee. The management didn't put in much of a helping hand but sit in the office all day. Workplace culture is great. Hardest part of the job would be nothing. Most enjoyable part of the job was brewing the coffee.
good,"I've been a partner at Starbucks for over 6 years and the one take away is that if you are with a great manager that believes in the company, you'll love the job. And if your manager is a boss, you'll hate it. Sadly, Starbucks hires a lot of bosses as their store managers (at least my district does) and I really miss having a supporting and understanding SM."
good,"I actually loved working here, and it was my first job, but I needed to focus more on school and I was so stressed and the manager was not giving me any benefits or wouldn't even listen to me when I begged her for less hours."
good,"Terrible management, poor scheduling decisions, no benefits and poor salary for how they work you. The customers are nice and understanding when there's only 2 staff on the floor and in the store for 3 hours and a line way out the door... everyday... never getting last break or taking a late lunch because how busy the morning rush is. Never enough staff but some how can afford to keep hiring managers and higher ups that do nothing."
good,"Typically assisting customers most of whom don't seem to like you, management sees you as a droid. Lots of drama. Learned what to expect from a fast food job. Good first job offers dental, medical and vision benefits plus discounts on merchandise and weekly coffee or tea mark outs."
good,"I have worked at multiple Starbucks locations and the biggest problem that I saw was the huge gap between managers. If you had a good manager who was willing to challenge the team, coach properly, and not be overbearing then the store typically would run smoothly."
good,"Being assigned a role by shift lead."
good,Good job. The day goes pass fast when it's busy . I learned how to make different drinks .the customers are very lovable .you will enjoy the job as long as you have a good management .
good,Management was terrible.  Cut hours.  Had to do the job of three people.  Pay was awful.  No time off.  Had to work holidays.  I would come into work after manager and place wasn't clean or check to make sure supplies were filled.  Many of the other employees didn't care either if they cleaned or not.
good,"If you love constant interactions and are friendly, enjoy a continuous multi-tasking day. Starbucks is a great fit for you. Generally given full time hours if you have open availability, but it depends on how many people work there and your willingness. The best way to make sure you can make a living at Starbucks is to move up. The shift supervisor pay is hardly a reflection of the work you'll be expected of. Lots of lackadaisical management in recent years. Days with not enough coverage. Untrained people who are thrown into work with the expectation that uncertified employees are to train them. Big lack of oversight from management on daily activities due to constant updates that are released yet nobody reads. If you do actually get proper training and can hustle this is a great place, if you want to move up to management then even better. This is a corporation and the entire rhetoric of their business ideas reflect this. They like to portray customer connection as a focus but they are a corporation after all."
good,I was a manager but the dm came in every month or 2 and then my manager ahead of me was in the food service part of meijer where Starbucks was located. They under pay you here. Don't help you with college. Don't give you free drinks and don't care if you have a kid to take care of
good,"I love the fact that we get Spotify Premium. We get benefits if we work 20+ hours a week. I don't know a single person who doesn't live with mommy and daddy who can afford to just work Starbuck and survive on what they pay you. Even their shifts get paid horribly. we get treated like the scum of the earth by 96% of the customers and we try very very hard to be nice and kind to all of you but you hate us for no reason. WHY? "
good,"I was hired at far below the market average for a shift supervisor and was expected to do more manual labor than any of my peers for a dollar more an hour. The region clearly is not sure how to enact the company's vision. Employees are just bodies to fill labor. You will wake up at 3am to open shop around 4am and then work until 1-2pm each shift--your salary will not compensate you enough for the labor and stress you deal with from the fact that the inventory space is so small, to save money on rent, you are constantly unable to meet demand."
good,The workplace culture is great. Coworkers are encouraging and welcoming. A typical work day is very fast paced. I've learned how to kindly handle stressful situations with upset customers.
good,"Working at Starbucks is pretty mediocre. It's typical shift work, serving the general public, and usually at minimum wage. If you have a decent team of baristas and manager there's a chance you will enjoy it."
good,The management at Fry’s in Sun City West does not provide a positive work environment.  Turnover is very high and scheduling and hiring needs significant improvement.
good,"Hours of work are determined by the manager.  You do not have as much flexibility as presented.  They do try to work to follow the customer first and customer engagement principles.  You do not get a true lunch hour.  Your lunch hour is 30 minutes.  If you are full time, you get two 15 minute brakes, which are determined by the shift managers.  You are not able to string you break and lunch together.  The most enjoyable component of the job is the ability to meet and interact with the store customers and provide them a service which enhances their day."
good,"A empresa em si e boa, porem o gestores nao valorizam os funcionários quem tem, muitas das vezes, diziam que, quem nao estivesse satisfeito que a porta da rua é serventia da casa. "
good,"While I like working at Starbucks, it is a licensed store at Macy's, which means things are a little different than corporate. It's a fun place to work even though there are some cons, but no place is perfect. The best part is I can joke and have fun with the people I work with. The hardest part is having a good outlook when your having a bad day."
good,"Starbucks gives amazing benefits, however, the culture is not the best. If you're in high school or college who truly does not participate in company culture, this is an amazing job with skills you can transfer to practically any other career (multitasking, cash management, fast environment, etc.). However, it is very clear that corporate does not value baristas nor does it feel like they stick up for them. We are made to put customers first, which is valid. However, we are basically servants to them, and the customer base is honestly toxic. If you truly want to work here, try to stay for a year then move on to better things. Even in California, we are not paid enough (and that's coming from someone who used to be cynical about that phrase). Night v.s. morning crew is a constant battle no matter how much you get along with your team, and labor is slashed frequently leaving stressed baristas and management. Starbucks needs to do better and make their baristas/shifts feel more supported because quite honestly, we deserve better."
good,nice bunch of people to work with. hours were long. some people working were higher than others so never wanted to clean only make coffee. overall expericne ok for general work
good,"Days started early in the morning and were often very fast paced.  "
good,"High turnover rate, most co workers are cold and unapproachable-they should not have been hired for a position that requires excellent customer service. Double Standards from supervisors and management, unprofessional management and lack of communication. Low morale most days and barley scheduled 10 per week."
good,"As a manager, I get paid $23/hr to work my butt off. They have a lot of expectations for brand new “partners” and inadequate training. Pay should be MUCH higher for the demands placed on us by head office, district managers and store managers."
good,"Never had enough workers, and criticized for trying to handle demand with team given. Workers were not properly trained so re-training was always needed. Lack of communication form higher ups."
good,Lots of hours available to Shift Supervisors. Mangers can create a stressful environment by constantly trying to cut staff. Free coffee is a bonus. Not too much room for growth.
good,"Not a great customer base. Too small a space and not enough resources to do work efficiently at times. The store management did try to accommodate their workers when they could, but middle management never seemed happy. They rarely had the staff available to give them the time they needed to complete management tasks. Training time was also not allocated very well, and things are often rushed and mistakes are made."
good,"I loved my coworkers & customers but the pay & the way the new manager treated us was very poor. It was also very fast paced in the mornings so you had no time to get anything done until the peak had passed. Around 3/4-close, it gets very boring & quiet"
good,"I never had a manager for longer than a month at most. The location I worked at had a manager for the first month I was there and he suddenly left the company. We were left, without management, for at least 4 months. The staff internally promoted the senior shift lead to manager. We had enough staff to work the store without issues but the lack of direct company control via manager caused a decrease in the following of certain rules, no aprons, not following dress code, music playing from our phones. I enjoyed the lack of supervision most days as it forced me to take a larger role in the operation of the store when working with newer employees."
good,"Fast paced, always changing work environment. Have to adapt quickly in order to maintain your position. Constant barrage of information that you'll have to process."
good,"Starbucks is good if you have someone helping you pay for your life, working there does not cover bills or rent. If the manager gives you enough hours then you can get the good benefits, thats only if your manager likes you total favoritism.  If you get promoted, favoritism.  Not worth it for how little they pay and how people.   Every summer they take away more and more hours to save money so even if you wanted full time you cant. The only person that gets 40 is the store manager who doesnt even work the full 40 they always leave early with some excuse, they blame everyone for them ""about to get fired"" when starbucks just promotes people who are horrible managers."
good,"It was fun to work there at first, then the Store Managers changed and that's when it started to go down hill. It feels like there is no  place for advancement here."
good,but the ones inside tom thumbs are horrible. we are constantly under staffed scheduled 9 hours because of no lunch . There no double coverage. no raises. screamed at my store management belittled you name it hes done it.
good,"If you are looking for an hourly job with average pay and decent benefits look no further, however if you are looking for a career look the other way. Most advancements I have seen have little to do with work ethic/ability and are instead weighed on popularity alone. The deciding factor is how liked you are within the store and nothing further."
good,"I was hired by Gorepas in order to improve their operations efficiency and product effectiveness. At first, I was promised that I would be paid a salary that matches my qualifications ""after a new product line"" arrives; but it never did. I was working on excel sheet in the office, coordinating/controlling production, operating forklifts and supervising the operators. It was a real challenge, but I could not continue due to the shifts and work conditions; I was expected to work from 6pm to 6am; with a least 60% of time in the production area which was (-5 degrees Celsius). Operators are underpaid despite their long-term dedication and efforts."
good,Job is okay. Be ready to deal with grumpy customers but also the ones you make a connection with. Overall job isn’t too bad. I would prefer working at a regular Starbucks. The ones in Target and Safeway etc.. are a little bit harder to deal with.
good,I worked at Starbucks while I was in high school so I had to work around my school schedule which could be difficult because of the hours of operation versus the hours I was in school.
good,"A typical day at Starbucks is very busy and stressful. The management is not good and they do not care about their employees, the managers never help one another and are always out trying to make the next shift managers shift harder. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers and the best part of the jobs."
good,"Daily Routines, regular customers."
good,"Safeway is one of the more hostiles work environments one can encounter, management turnover at the top is constant, employees never have clear guidelines, very unfortunate as this was once a great place to work!"
good,"Manageent is a huge problem with Starbucks as well as turn over rate, there is no loyalty. Some of the cutomers who come through are down giht awful and the management only strokes their ego and blames the barista no matter what the situation may have been."
good,"trop de déchets dans cette entreprise, le management est 0 ."
good,"I can't compare one bad store to an entire company.. The management was fine, but she was young and obtuse and had difficulty taking any advice from anyone."
good,"I was very excited to work for Starbucks and thoroughly enjoyed the work and tasks that were given to me! However, I was placed solely on cash register for 6 out of the 8 or so months there for the entirety of the day. I was provided no training whatsoever and then later reprimanded for my lack of training. I believe in the company and I wish that I had a better experience."
good,My experience at Starbucks was a good one. Although management is not always easy to talk or connect with my co-workers were extremely helpful in teaching me proper policies and procedures.
good,The company is great to work for if you are a college student looking for a flexible part time job to help off set bills or a retired individual looking to do something to take up some of your down time and supplement your medicare health insurance. Not the best place for store managers. Too much hugging and red tape for terminating poor performing employees and there is little to no assistance in the process that is favorable to the Store Manager from Human resources. Its high stress and no work-life balance. District management and above could care less about circumstances surrounding the manager and the store's ability to operate given it's current conditions. All they care about are results. They tout the idea of caring for their employees but it is just a typical PR move to win the hearts and minds of their shareholders.
good,"A typical day at work for my (very busy) location would be 6 or 6 and a half hours because the management would never allow me to have a break (even when they were supposed to). I loved the people I worked with and most of the customers, however I worked extremely hard for minimum wage and no benefits, not to mention being mistreated by my management, many customers, and some coworkers. My store was under Aramark, so we were not allowed to accept tips."
good,"Company can be good if you work with the right people. favoritism is an issue. management is 50/50  depending on location. this isn't a job for someone who is slow. They want speed. This is an okay first job but if you have ambition, and a desire to do more, just find something else. Pay is not great for all the work you must do."
good,"Starbucks is a great company for young people fresh out of high school looking for a free college degree. Do not expect to be able to work your way up in the company past shift supervisor unless you already have store manager experience. This company loves to hire store managers from the outside rather than promote from within. The pay is somewhat competitive, but only with the minimum wage in your respective state. In my case, minimum wage is $7.25/hr and baristas start at approx $9/hr. Shift supervisors only make $1-$2 more than baristas, while store managers make approx $50,000 plus very generous bonuses based on store performance and how much money he/she saved the company that year (ex: kept labor down, didn’t call in many problems with facilities etc). The benefits are very good in theory, but the health insurance is not affordable on a barista or supervisor level. If you just need a second job or are trying to get free education, Starbucks is a great choice. It is not a good career choice unless you can get hired on as a store manager. Also, if you call corporate with any problems you are facing, which they strongly encourage, it is not anonymous (they won’t even talk to you unless you provide your partner numbers) and your DM and SM will be made aware of everything you say."
good,"Tienen una padrísima cultura laboral, pero hay gerentes que no respetan que tengas que estudiar y trabajar y que eso provoca eventuales cambios de horario, aún a pesar de que es lo que se ofrece como ventaja laboral por encima de otras empresas."
good,you cannot really get the when you really need it. your manager does not know how to talk to people........................................................
good,The hire ups do not support the managers managers work more the 40 hours a week and do not get compensated for it. They perfer to pay an external more money then an internal
good,Loved working at Starbucks until bad management ruined it. Clear roles and responsibilities not clearly defined as under one district manager you are excelling and then under a new one you're not. Transition between district managers needs to be smoother.
good,L'équipe est à la fois sérieuse pour le travail mais également sait rigoler de temps en temps et détendre l'atmosphère
good,"Starbucks claims to be about the customer but is really a bottom line, profit driven workplace. If you cant make the company money as an employee you will either be fired or cut to such a low number of hours a week you are forced to quit."
good,They want you to follow policies that they don’t really want you to follow at all. I have been in trouble with following the same policies that I have gotten in trouble for ignoring. A VERY inconsistent company.
good,"its cool and stressful, i needed a job where my hours are not shuffled every week. I see no growth in the company and no place to evolve. There ae other positions that are oppertunities for growth."
good,Starbucks was a great company to work for while going to college. They pay for college and you get discounts on coffee. The work environment at Starbucks is difficult due to the tight shifts ran (limited number of people) and the management I had in place at several of my stores. Starbucks also did not support me when I was looking to further my career within Starbucks. After I completed college Starbucks did not believe I was ready to promote while my manager was almost nonexistent and I ran the store. Management in Starbucks does not know the first thing about being a leader and therefore this company needs works.
good,"a typical day at work was employees including the manager not showing up on time,then compensating for the work , serving the customers,cleaning,restocking,the workplace culture was ok but definitely needed improvement"
good,"My only complaint is: towards the last year of my job at Starbucks, there was very little support and leadership from managers. The shift supervisors were left to run the store while the hire ups went to ""meetings"" and generally ignored many of the problems we had in our store. It led to a toxic store culture, an indifference to customers and low morale. For my first two years, the machine was working as intended, unfortunately the system Starbucks has in place also fails with bad leadership, which likely went far up the corporate ladder, as well as with policy."
good,"Emotionally draining, very uncertain of hours and people, customers very untitled and rude, in general Starbucks is a very fast paced low tolerance fast food joint."
good,Began with successful management and training. Enjoyed working for the company at the time. Schedules were hectic and I barley had any sleep. I would be scheduled to close and open almost everyday. No matter what I was dedicated to this company.New management was sent in and fired everything in site.
good,A very fast paced day of repetition. Filling customers order maintaining stock and sales. Setting up new floor sets once a month as well as learning new drinks
good,"Management at Starbucks is one of the worst. "
good,"A typical day at work is providing and setting up services needed for customers as well as providing a sanitary space for work.  I learned about customer service, collaborating with co-workers, and working hard to maintain a sustainable work environment."
good,Good benefits but extremely fast paced with little room for error. No work life balance and the hours are very yough on your body and family. Need more of a balance.
good,"Working at Starbucks is stressful because of how the corporate people expect the barista's to run a store. The expectations are ridiculous! These people need to go work in a store for a week, they would change so much."
good,"Heaven forbid you were in the hospital with pneumonia. If you're sick, doctors note or not, you're still expected to show up. If you're in the hospital its your responsibility to get your shift covered. If you and your manager don't quite meet eye to eye, your hours will be held against you until you bed the way they want you to. They say there's room for advancement, but its never on skill or experience but more on who you know or who you drink with on the weekends."
good,No work life balance at all.be prepared to belong to the company 24/7.if you have no life and no kids its perfect but other than that be prepared to work endlessly.
good,Working for Starbucks is overall fun and productive you will enjoy working withe your parthners and will enjoy assisting customers yet you would have to keep a positive energy wile moving at an extremely fast past but also making sure customers are please and assured with their product and customer service.
good,"Clock-in and ask what your position will be. No matter if you are told your position will only be register that day, you will need to also make drinks, food and restock supplies as needed. It fluctuates from busy to dead in an instant, but there are more busy times than dead times. You will get a 10 minute paid break every 2 hours after you've worked 4 hours of any shift. After working 6 hours of any shift you will get to take a 30 meal break. These are the companies policies. I worked for 4 years as a Supervisor and had a TON of fun. I recommend this job for high schoolers who wish to work their way into a management role. If you are a college student, this job is likely to burn you out from exhaustion, while not paying very well."
good,Your experience depends on your manager.  Communication is sometimes difficult.  Most of the time you build a good team and focus on standards. QASA is the worst.
good,"My manager never had a previous job in a management position which meant that this was his first one. I'm okay with that, but it was the fact that he blatantly ignored me and my co-worker's request to hire another person to help us close on Sunday nights. He just wasn't willing to learn with the new position."
good,typical workday during the week was pretty easy going until about 1-6pm. also weekends would be very busy as with any other retail/food job. usually 1-3 baristas on the clock at once.
good,It is very fast pace from the time you get there to the time you leave you do get to 30 minute breaks or you can take a whole hour break depending on how many hours you work if you work a 8 hour shifts you get an hour break if you work a six or seven and a half hour shift you get to take a  15 minute break o er all good job nice staff
good,"Long days, cranky people, social therapist not paid like one, deal with over entitled mothers pushing 3 rats around. Coworkers were here and there, decent and meh."
good,I worked at several different starbucks locations and I loved working at a my second to last store. It was incredible management and it made working there even more fun
good,So fast pace is hard to connect with customers as accurately as you would like to.Management unstable constant confusion between staff and shift managers.
good,"I did the manager in training program, they tossed me into a high volume store, the training manager didn't help me at all, eventually the manager I learned beneath was fired and then they came for me.  I was put on suspension with no reason why and then eventually told them I didn't want to work there."
good,"great benefits and pay, poor management and lack of hours. The benefits were great, but the admission process was troubling, and there was a deadline that was a disadvantage. there was poor management. the staff was unprofessional and there was favoritism in the workplace. also, lack of hours."
good,"Starbucks is great for a first job or a temporary ""filler"" job. The company does not pay as well as they should, based on the hours employees are asked to work and the tasks employees are asked to do. Most stores have a poor management system, and the corporate system is just as bad."
good,When I first started working at starbucks i enjoyed it but it turned bad very quickly. My manager was sexist and not only did I think so but everyone at my job. He was rude and short and he would cut your hours even if you were his best employee if you made a mistake. Starbucks could be a very fun place to work but you have to have good hardworking co workers and some decent management.
good,"Working at Starbucks gives you plenty of important skills but it is very stressful and overwhelming. Coworkers think they know it all especially the ones who been there longer. But overall too stressful, you're expected to be a perfectionist here. Horrible pay, tips, and customers."
good,"Management was very poor, often things would be broken or missing. I learned how to keep customers happy and wanting to return. my favorite part of this job was getting to meet all the new people and working to convince them to join and workout at the gym that the café was located in."
good,"Starbucks is generally an okay place to work, especially if you're just getting your feet wet in the working world. I started in college and worked there for a year. It was busy (worked near the city center) and the hours were often long. Since it's minimum wage at best, many of your coworkers won't be very reliable. Starbucks did teach me a lot though - the importance of always being on-point, having a great sense of humor, and being nice even if you don't want to."
good,"A typical day at the Starbucks I worked at started with finding out if you were on register, bar, or support. "
good,The benefits will bring you in but the environment can be very harsh most days.  V hance for promotion are very hard unless willing to so a lot of extras with no support.
good,Starbucks is a great place to work if you have a good manager to work with. In my experience I was treated poorly and not like I mattered only the speed of the coffee not the quality.
good,The workers arent very nice. Managment is terrible. Constantly being called while at school and no matter how many times i tell them not to call they continue to call 5 times a day
good,if you do not get along with your co workers it will be a pain. I did not even get to know my co workers because they automatically assumed Im a person that is very rich and high managed but I was able to prove some wrong.
good,"Working at Starbucks was a stressful work place and lot of it had to do with the customer clientele.  However, I learned a lot about management and how to stay organized.  The hardest part was the verbal abuse that I encounter from customers but the most enjoyable part was when I actually got to interact with customers about our coffee and how it came to be in our stores."
good,"I worked there for a short time; but felt it was an inconsistent environment. Our manager was emotional and would change things constantly and compulsively. The customers were great, the food is awesome definitely quality worth the buck. I'm not surprised to see the secondary location I worked for did not keep afloat and eventually closed."
good,The job does not pay well at all. You work extremely hard and get nothing in return. Not a lot of hours are given especially with the low pay amount. Manager was not friendly.
good,"fun place to work for a short time, crazy days on happy hours and customers who don't know what they really want :)) co-workers are the best and nice."
good,"Starbucks was a place that was near and dear to my heart. However, with new Management and their inability and blatantly refusal to learn and understand the company culture, it left a very sour taste in my mouth. I would gladly work elsewhere but I wouldn't advise anyone to work under such conditions. I LOVED working there, but when they came, it was a daily dread. I would literally cry about having to go into work."
good,Great career development opportunities. Ability to move around organizations. Decision making relatively slow as everything needs to be blessed by multiple organizations. Management is pretty poor and cannot make decisions
good,I learned a lot from Starbucks Rustan Coffee Corporation. Especially to my mentors and co-partners. A typical day at work is somewhat very fulfilling due to everyday we are very productive even with many or less transactions for the day. due to we are not only taking care of our customers but also training baristas to step up and get to the next level. The workplace culture is very special. That you just have to be yourself for you to strive. But the hardest part of the job is that the company expects a lot from us with the salary not being enough for their set expectation. But I enjoyed my 5 year stay in this company and meet extra ordinary people from customers to baristas.
good,"The culture has changed since I first started in 2004. The focus has been about Drive thru times, labor cuts and reduced training for everybody across the board. There is a lack of support from the field leadership team. The expectation of having 40 second window times is challenging especially when we make everything to order and drinks are 100% custom. Pre-Packaged Breakfast sandwiches that take on average 50 seconds to warm does not support the expected target. The layout of the stores have changed over time but some stores are left untouched. Ovens are on the other side of the store, other drink stations are out of reach of other stations. Starbucks focuses on a quick positive result quarter over quarter. This company has lost its culture and unique identity. They have been the fast food for coffee."
good,"Starbucks has so much going for it as a company, but the overwhelming differences between stores is exhausting. I have been employed by 4 different stores. Every single store had a different way of doing things, and even worse, every different store knew the ""right"" way to do it. It is a very catty environment from store to store. I am highly qualified to do more than be a Shift Supervisor, but was never given the opportunity. I pursued it, and was told I had to jump through multiple hoops. I jumped through said hoops, and was told there was one more. This happened multiple times until it made me so displeased with the company that I gave my notice."
good,"A typical day at work presents many doable tasks, however, the company culture promotes an entitlement complex to its customers which shows within each store. The employees are constantly being asked to conform to new demands and reach sometimes unattainable goals. Higher management listens but does little to correct the issues at hand. Would recommend for a job while in college."
good,Training was bad. Once on the floor the information provided in training was not helpful. When I asked for help I was treated as if I was the problem and never was given a solution. Upper management was hardly around and when they did come around they were not help.
good,"I believe it is a nice place to work, but it would be more satisfying if the people surrounding you were friendly and understanding. The break times were also a bit unfair."
good,"It was a fast-paced place to work, and sometimes fun, but a lot of people cut a lot of corners. Starbucks weird need to insert themselves into all areas of food consumption was a problem for me as well. As someone who doesn't like to be around alcohol I found it alienating that several store served alcohol. Tips were okay. Management was not always well trained."
good,Compromising. Today its more like I'm sharing a job or position with 5 other people. Barely able to make ends meet providing for myself and Children. Its a constant struggle to stay at a job where its hostile environment for job security.
good,Maybe my store manager was just plain awful at scheduling and managing- pretty much her whole job- but I started out loving my job. Within months she had me dreading every day I had to walk into those doors.
good,Una empresa que te familiariza con la historia del café y que te hace ver de manera diferente una taza de este.
good,"Fast paced environment. I learned how to make espresso based drinks. I used my retail experience which was a plus. The hardest part of the job was that you were exhausted at the end of your shift."
good,"drinks were difficult to learn to make, after 3 weeks of training became easy to remember. can be very fast pace, on feet all day. must memorize abbreviations."
good,"Manager was not responsible enough to keep the store organized, and advised me not to make changes even if co-workers agreed to my opinion to make changes"
good,"Starbucks is a welcoming place and the training is consistent to make sure that new partners really get hands on with the tasks. There are some benefits included, however, depending on the manager, sometimes these benefits will not be made aware to you unless you ask about them. Starbucks does help you and provide you with education as well through Arizona State University."
good,"Not a terrible job, just very stressful. It's nice getting customers that know you and you know them. Problems stemmed from the bad management of Target and Starbucks."
good,They're very flexible with different schedules. I got along with all other Baristas. But the management was sort of irresponsible because there were a lot of times people worked alone. And I work on the Toll Toad at a Travel plaza
good,"Working at Starbucks was fun because of specific fun coworkers. It was constant fast pace, a lot of movement, a lot of smiling and making sure the customer is happy. Hours seemed long and sticky but in the end it’s truly flexible for college students or younger age groups. It’s good to start off with a small company like Starbucks because you get to learn communication skills and as well as working as a team, which was very important. Without team work or communication in this coffee business, things will go haywire."
good,The customers that regularly come in are fantastic it's a great place to start if this is just your first job. I would use this as a stepping stone for better endeavors
good,"maybe the worst place I've worked at.. this place isn't for everyone . Management shouldn't have favorites !! No recognition, and you are expected to do 5 things at once.. about 4 nice people work there. would not recommend"
good,"Working at Starbucks can be fun . It's real simple , making samples every two hours or so, or creating something just for fun and sampling it out as well . You learn a lot of new drinks from customers ,  and you'll always have your daily costumers who come everyday and you'll know to make there drink right when you see them walk in. I liked the fact that I made tips ."
good,"My company join starbucks facility in 2012 out of six only one remains. The people who have worked IN this facility for 20 years will sit on the job, disrespect, and won't share there knowledge to anyone unless you kiss IT. Management is a revolving door, if you hold them accountable you will lose your job."
good,"As you climb the ladder with this company, the level of compensation begins to underwhelm. As a hourly partner (i.e. Barista or Shift Supervisor) you are absolutely in great hands. You are well cared for in terms of benefits, pay, opportunities for growth. Once you get into higher, management level positions, their expectations are completely unreasonable. Work- life balance barely exists, and there is not adequate support from upper level management."
good,As a current  Starbucks employee i have learn the in and outs of the company. The room for growth is always a great aspect of this company. Although the company has take a slippery slope i have learn to adapt and maintain focus to get the job done. I ensure that my team comes to great working environment where they have the independency to go above and beyond to take care of the customer.
good,Making customers a priority is your daily focus.  Results matter is your overall success.  Teams Win is a major focus and principal.  Associate engagement is a focus to ensuring high morale.
good,"I worked here when I was young, it was fun. Fast past and enjoyable. You learn how to interact with customers and give good customer service. Making the drinks is fun as well."
good,Needs to review management and compensation for staff. Staff only work at minimum wage and it is had to recieve even 25 hours. Overall great place to work to make long lasting friends.
good,Won't give full time hours. It was an okay job but definately low pay. Can't live on the money they pay and hours are never the same.
good,"Its great for flexibility, but when managers turn over it can really change the dynamic at the location. but great for students"
good,I learned you have to serve each customer under 3 minutes or else its not even worth it. You should at least be able to take time to make sure its steamed to perfection.
good,"Starbucks taught me a lot about customer service, problem solving, Barista skills and cleaning skills."
good,"Terrible hours and not willing to work with scheduling at all. No room for advancement, no willingness to work with hours or compensation for vacation time or sick days."
good,"Love the company would work for them again."
good,"The environment is great. The management is great as well."
good,Starbucks is a fun place to work whens a weekday night when you can stand there and have conversations with people. Bi=ut on the weekend its complete and utter anarchy because no one knows how to clean o move fast. The management isn't the best every week we are out of something important we need to make drinks which are fun to tell 100 people a day.
good,"Its a great company to work for if it is your first job, or you like retail. I know some people who have been with the company for 10+ years and they are indifferent with the company. Hardest part of the job is customers who are obnoxious, but I guess that is everywhere."
good,"No respetaban mis días por examen, te explotan a más no poder, si sos nuevo te la pasas limpiando hasta que alguien se digne a capacitarte, el sueldo es una miseria, pero al menos tus compañeros de trabajo son buena onda"
good,Typical work day is working at a fast pace to serve customers during rush hour and then cleaning the rest of the day. Relaxed work environment.
good,"The benefits are great but we are understaffed, over worked and many managers are quitting. I love working with the public and co-workers are great."
good,"Working at GAP is something i will never do again. It's a good job for someone looking for part-time work, however, i was poorly trained and felt like a second thought throughout my employment."
good,the ceos making millions while youre slaving and collecting food stamps. god bless you if you cant find a job making living wage
good,"I've worked for Starbucks for a total of 4 years. Since day one I was in talks and promised promotion to a supervisor position. It has been a struggle to even get the process started. The management I've encountered in more than one location gives you just enough hope to keep you there, but ask you to give up things--""open up your availability and we can promote you""-- and never follow through with their promises. Just like any work place there are those who do not work and there are those who have to work harder to make up for it; I am the latter and it really gets old. You'd be surprised how stressful it can be serving people their coffees-you'd also be surprised how impatient customers can be while waiting for their coffee. Starbucks is a company that boasts involvement in local communities and in each other; however, a lot of changes have been made in the last few years that make it feel like we the baristas are just the stepping stones for other people stand on. This place has potential, it really does, but when you get stuck in a store and a district with poor management it's really disheartening. Be careful also when considering this job: you can go from 35+ hours a week to 16 in a second flat. It has happened to me so many times I can't count, and its hard to support yourself if you're trying to be independent. I've worked 1 and even 2 other jobs in addition to working at Starbucks just to make ends meet, and with minimum wage increases mandated by the state, I haven't seen a raise in 2 years."
good,"Once was a really fun enjoyable place to work and i love the job i do however due to management change over of the whole Welcome Break site, the place as a whole is not enjoyable and many things have changed and not for the good. Co-workers are great and management has improved a lot on my particular unit. i have learned a lot from working here for just a year, however i feel that i need to move on and improve on my own skills elswhere."
good,"Fast paced "
good,"a great deal of top-down management, very political in order to advance (regardless of skills and/or qualifications)"
good,"No opportunity to move up once you are a manager"
good,"I was looking to find a job a little more my speed. I walked into the interview excited, not knowing that it was a slower day, I looked around and saw all of the workers standing around and chatting. They greeted me and I told them I was there for my interview. They all smiled and introduced themselves and asked if I wanted anything to drink on the house. Seemed really nice. The store manager conducted my interview and it went well. I didn't see more than 10 customers the entire time I was there and I thought that was exactly what I needed. Of course I understand that you go to work to do just that, WORK, but I just need something more chill than the last two jobs I've previously had. I thought this was it. I also wanted to take advantage of the tuition that the company offers. Everything changed on my first day and I would just like to leave it at that. It also would not be a very good first job. Some prior restaurant or fast-food experience would definitely be a plus."
good,A very toxic work environment. All partners are constantly in each others business to gain as much information as they can for gossiping and backstabbing. Upper management is just as immature if not worse. They all expect you to be ready and waiting to pick up a shift on a command and if you cannot management will retaliate by decreasing your hours along with bad mouthing you to your co workers.
good,"a lot of lifting not very ergonomic, Management and Hr not very people friendly supervision sweep important issue under the rug and don't take care of it, lack of respect for familylife  your  forced to work on one day notice"
good,"•	Provide excellent customer service to hundreds of people daily (busiest location in Ohio), handle cash drawer, train new employees, maintain cleanliness of work station"
good,"the day an time of the week depends on the business day, you do learn about about the products they offer an more aboout coffee, my manager was great! but ive also had other managers that were really bad! employees were alright, the hardest part is prolly working with other employees that didnt want to do there part or you had to pick up the slack"
good,"I do enjoy working for this company. But the work load is to much for an SM to run a 2,000,000 store with no Assistant to support. All emails, coaching, payroll, staffing, interviewing, scheduling, ordering, is on the SM to do. We are given 13 hrs per week of non floor coverage hrs to complete this work, otherwise we are floor coverage. This means a lot of work is taken home. It is a high stress environment. We are pushed at 100% daily with little to no recognition."
good,"It doesn't matter what time of day it was, it was always busy here. The pay was decent and the hours went by really fast because there was always a large list of items that had to be done in a day. Understaffing was an issue sometimes. It was difficult to manage rushes when there wasn't enough staff. But all in all, it is a good job with shifts that cover everyone's needs."
good,"As any retail job Starbucks is base on volume. As a manager you have to learn all positions in order to run a store like a Swiss watch. "
good,"A typical day at work is not one you would expect, you are constantly stuck doing the same thing over and over again. New people are put in jobs that brings the store down. Constantly getting in trouble for no reason."
good,"Co workers were great to work with however, district manager puts souch pressure on the managers the coworkers quit. They were great coworkers with families to feed. The district of Syracuse didn't like the employees who were there last year and she harassed them toll they quit. Overall great benefits and free drinks."
good,"Starbucks was one of the best/worst experiences I've had because serving customers so early in the morning and we are they're first experience for the day was what determined how the day would go. Some days we had amazing flow of making every ones drinks right and taking transitions between breaks, and the service was as fast as possible. But we also had our worst days like when my coworker had a blue berry scone thrown at his face because he didn't ask the customer if he had wanted it warmed. Experiences like that make you look at customer service in a different way, and how to respect everyone you meet in the same manner as you would if you were in their shoes."
good,"supervisor, customer service, money counting and fixing everything."
good,"Although I loved making coffee and working with customers, management was questionable. The manager often spoke ill of other baristas and previous workers making the work place full of tension and uncomfortable feelings. During training I was often thrown in to high volume situations with little knowledge of drinks, items, and the order in which Starbucks requires baristas to learn to make custom beverages. I was often yelled at, talked to sternly, and given the cold shoulder. I would not recommend working at Starbucks if you have a thin skin or buckle easily under pressure."
good,"a typical day at work would normally involve me coming in and cleaning and stocking for at least the first 3 hours of my shift. And then for the rest of the shift cleaning and picking up after other people."
good,A typical day at work is always being alone and having the fear of being written up all the time. The manager talks badly about her employees and also threatens them. The hardest part about the job is dealing with the unhealthy work environment. I definitely learned a lot about the drinks and coffee in general.
good,"Starbucks is a good company. They do not have a good training program for managers, actual none that is structured."
good,Desenvolver os funcionários a cada dia e ter o melhor atendimento para obter resultados.
good,Fast turn over with employees and management. Fast paced work environment that makes you have to stay clean and organized though out ones shift.
good,"Starbucks was an amazing company in the late 90's when I started learning about coffee and working for coffee shops.  The work and customer environment and experience was so open, fun and creative.  That changed in the early 2000's as they grew astronomically.  The product cheapened and the work environment became very strict, tedious, and physically draining.  As more responsibilities were added to the job of Barista, like ridiculous cleaning tasks and overall stress, the job wasn't nearly as fun as it had and could be.  "
good,starbucks is a great company to work for builds your stamina to learn and work well with other and for others.
good,over all my experience with the work is not good. the management is not being fair and they just dont care with their employee what matters for them is that theirselves only.
good,"What they expect you to do - from cleaning toilets to learning 70 plus drinks to serving food, making drinks while doing drivethru is overwhelming for such little pay."
good,"Shifts are 6.30 to 12.00 or 14.00 to 20.30/21.30. Duties include serving customers, using coffee and frappuccino machines, general housekeeping, stock replenishment and deep cleaning. I also cover shifts and breaks at other units in the station."
good,"Busy job. I've learned to multitask, my coworkers are helpful and fun. The hardest part is making sure all the orders get out fast enough. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting people."
good,"The best part of the job is interacting with the regular customers. You get to know their names, their drinks and have them ready before they enter the store. Your co-workers are fun and get their work done with the same dedication with you while having fun."
good,"Em um dia típico de trabalho era bem cansativo, pois passávamos as 8 horas em pé, fazendo serviço de limpeza muitas vezes, em certos dias a loja tinha um número grande de clientes o q ocasionava em filas, se faz atendimento de caixa, preparo e reposição de alimentos e ingredientes para a confecção de bebidas. Aprendi a função de barista, me especializei em cafés da empresa. A gerência sempre fez o seu trabalho, buscando o melhor para os seus funcionários por se tratar de ser uma multinacional, mas após a troca da gerência as coisas começar a não saírem muito bem, a nova gerência não soube separar o lado pessoal do profissional. O ambiente de trabalho com os colegas era normal, é claro que acontecem desentendimentos por serem pessoas diferentes, pensamentos diferentes, mas na maior parte do tempo todos se davam bem."
good,"The Starbucks I worked at was usually very busy. On my first day of work I was set up for an eight hour shift and the supervisors were unaware that I had yet to be trained. Though I was never formally trained, I learned how to move quickly and operate in a fast-paced environment while providing great customer service."
good,"I found the company values and mission statement were not in evidence in the day to day running of the store. In fact, completely opposite. Area manager had no working knowledge of what's required to be effective as a Barista and consistently came up with impractical ideas. Hence, we were the bottom performance in our region."
good,"As a barista, shift supervisor and Assistant Store Manager, I loved this job. Once I became a Store Manager, I stopped enjoying it completely. There was no typical day at work. The hours could be anywhere from 4am to 10pm, Sunday through Saturday. This is ok for a limited time (and variety can be nice), but in no way supports the work-life balance in the long run. I learned a lot about inventory control, customer service, how to (and not to) grow business/sales. I learned valuable lessons in interpersonal savvy, how to talk to employees and to one's own bosses. Most of all, I learned to trust almost no one in the work place. This is unfortunate but true. In my district, upper management was difficult at best. The free drinks, the discount, the friends I made - all this was wonderful. But, as a manager, the game changes completely. That being said, now that I live in another state, I would try it again. Under different circumstances, the potential is still there to be a great job."
good,"Starbucks expects its employees to take criticism without complaint, customers are always rude, but my co-workers make the day bearable. The Store Manager is great, but the managers above her are terrible, in part because they never worked as a Barista. I have learned all I can from Starbucks about time management, cleanliness, customer service, team work and leadership skills, and working through sickness and injury. The hardest part sometimes is dealing with rude customers, who are unappreciative and demeaning, but the most enjoyable parts are the kind customers who make your day, or when you make theirs."
good,Mornings were the busiest hours. ive learned how to prepare well liked beverages and meeting new faces. management was mediocre. co workers were friendly and always were a helping hand. the hardest part of job was making sure ingrediants and measurements to beverages were on point. most enjoyable part of the job was receiving tips for great service and receiving good compliments on great beverages.
good,it was an okay company to work for. too busy and never enough staff to cover the place.
good,"The company itself may offer great benefits and many ways to help its partners; The medical benefits, earned vacation time, etc. But the level of consideration for baristas from the store managers and district managers is pathetic."
good,"A typical work week 45 hours to 60 depending on your district manager. The job states time work equals time paid. However, it doesn't apply to store managers; which doesn't create a positive work life balance."
good,"The days as mentioned vary from day to day, but depending on the time and weekday, you can expect different responsibilities and clientele. Throughout my 7 years, I've learnt to handle difficult situations, whether it be with my staff or customer(s), to work through high-stressed times with a calm and cheerful outlook, multi-task numerous tasks and completing them successfully and efficiently, but more importantly, I've learnt to be a positive role model to others. I enjoy interacting with my peers and loyal customers, sharing stories, laughing, suggesting a new and off-the-menu beverage, to name a few. I've built many great friendships throughout my time and Starbucks, and that is something I am quite thankful for. The most difficult aspect of the job would have to be knowing no matter how great an effort you put into your work, that your dedication goes unrecognized and undervalued."
good,"Helping others start and end there day. Patience it took alot of patience I had to lean that . Destroit most of time it was a controll factor with the managers not managing , the co-workers did a great jobs always The hardest part was keeping order for all the customers drinks making sure they remember there own drink was difficult for them. Saying thank you and have a great evening"
good,"The work is hard, especially if you don't have proper trained baristas. The pay is decent, because you get tips every week. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the pace of the work. If you work in a busy store, be sure to drink lots of caffeine. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be making customers happy as well as all the free coffee you get - as much as you like while you're working!"
good,The company understaffed our store. we were working at un safe paces lifting things that were over 80 pounds in very high speeds.
good,The job itself was fine. However the clientel was very bothersome. They would like to make messes particularly in the bathroom and cause many issues. Yet whenever us employees would try to solve the issue usually we would get one from management. Things did not feel fair and working with management on scheduling usually ended bad for your shifts later on. Would be fine if it weren't for these hick ups.
good,"I love the people that I work with at Starbucks, but I feel that we are not making enough money to survive. Our hours are constantly getting cut and there is no where to move up."
good,i was promised certain benefits and hours and did not receive those benefits even after my 3 month probation. some weeks I have no shifts at all and was promised full time hours.
good,"I enjoy the hands-on work in making drinks and cleaning. However, know the volume of the store you're working for. Brace yourself for these customers. In my personal experience, half of me absolutely adores the job. While the other half gets exhausted and degraded from the intensity that goes on in my store."
good,"Over worked, tiring. Don’t abide by child labor laws. Honestly customers are really rude and it’s not worth the pay at all. To be on your feet for 8 hours straight sometimes without a break."
good,"While they paid for my associates degree, the work was nonstop and it was the most laborious job that I have ever felt. I saw the 5 managers that I saw during my career there struggle."
good,"Really enjoyed my time at Starbucks, learning to be a barista is one of the most rewarding and exciting things I ever had the pleasure of going to do. However the pay isn’t great and management often have so much pressure on them, it’s often taken out on you. Despite this it’s a really fun job and no day is the same."
good,"Working at Starbucks is definitely a fun job. It's exciting, you meet people every day and, depending on what state you live in, you make decent money. The thing I would just advise to people though is to make sure that you are ok with a very fast pace environment to work in because you are constantly on your feet and running around all shift."
good,Do not recommend working in this environment if u are a slow person who cant multitask. If u dont have tough skin may not be the place for you. If u are not successful in a fast paced stressful environment it's not the place for you. It is harder than it looks.
good,"Was not a huge fan of Starbucks.  If you really need a job it is super easy to get in the door.  Like any other retail type job it is HUGELY reliant on who you work with.  If your fellow coworkers are hard to be around it can make the job a drag.  I did not get paid very much but I also worked part time, which definitely did not help.  I learned a lot about how to treat people with respect even if that respect isn't reciprocated."
good,"Starbucks depends on who is in charge. I have worked at stores withy great managers and bad ones. Bad ones will make your work life terrible as they are in control of every aspect of your money, while a good manager will have the opposite feeling."
good,"Fast paced, but enjoyable. Great for school/college leavers or anyone who needs specific hours. Management needs a bit of work as this was the reason why i left."
good,"Confortable place to work because of the flexibility on the schedules and friendly parters. It is not a difficult job, you just have to be willing to learn and memorized every rutine and step. Management varies between stores."
good,"If you are looking to do the college achievement program, it is more than worth your time. It is definitely a job that ware's on you after time, and isn't meant for everyone."
good,"Salary is minimum wage, and it doesn’t change drastically even if you were promoted for a shift lead; stays low overtime as well. Depending on which location you’re working at, job may feel anywhere from relaxed to super stressful. If you lucky enough to work with a good management you may have a good time working here. This job would best fit and will be a good experience for someone who’s just looking for their first job/good challenge."
good,"The turnover at my store was extremely high, all due to the inept management at the store and regional level. It was heartbreaking to see how hard some of the team worked, and treated so badly. "
good,A day at work can be great and busy or boring depending on the amount of customers. The hardest part of the job is staying up with the required speed. The culture at the store was fun and cool but the pay is a little low for how hard it can be sometimes.
good,The only reason why I have stayed so long is because of the people and the environment. Other than that its not worth it. Especially with how much I get paid.
good,"Loved my coworkers but I hated upper management. Great most of the time but when it was bad, it was really bad. Had a really hard time getting my other coworkers to do their jobs correctly."
good,"management was not very helpful and other co-workers did not work as a ""team."" I never wanted to be at work because i did not feel welcome and was not being trained properly."
good,Lo mejor de trabajar en esta empresa es el ambiente con los compañeros.
good,"Living under capitalism requires an unhealthy amount of energy to simply survive and take what you can get. Hence, working at Starbucks. Like at most jobs what will keep you are your coworkers, but recognize that one of the richest corporations will only pay you minimum wage."
good,"The job is very fast-paced and having to focus on several things at once is hard but with practice, it becomes easier but still very stressful and can be very challenging at times. I would not recommend this job for a person with anxiety."
good,"My personal experience working for Starbucks wasn’t very great, but I think most of the issues I experienced were specific to my store and not necessarily corporate-wide issues. I worked there for several years because I genuinely love coffee (I’m still a barista, just not for Starbucks), but I was so upset with how I had been treated there that after I quit, I didn’t step foot into another Starbucks location for over a year"
good,"It was a good company to work for as a n entry level accounting position, but I didn't see myself working there for more than 2-3 years due to the limited scope of advancement."
good,"It is normally a very healthy environment. A variety of people and cultures, it’s a great place to work if you are a people person! It does become stressful if you do not put in effort to work"
good,"It’s an okay job , management is lazy. There’s a lot of favoritism, and they’re hiring people that they don’t need. Baristas have been working they’re butts off and still don’t get promoted"
good,"Working at Starbucks taught me what I needed to be able to apply for my dream job so I am thankful for that. I know how to talk to people, but I know I speak for many when I say the management isn’t good, the turn over is high and it’s competitive"
good,It just normal work as Barista. Deliver a good service to the customer. We need to solve the problem when it happens. Strong teamwork makes a job go smoothly and will get a very good result.
good,"It’s a great place to work if you’re just starting out or you are a student. They don’t pay well for the amount of work you do, tips don’t ever compensate or add up to what they offer them to be. It’s a flexible job with a variety of different roles."
good,Working at Starbucks  was fun The Customers you meet and some of the employees are amazing. They have really good benefits.  It's a really  good job!!!
good,Starbucks is a good first job but it is not for the faint of heart. The job is very stressful and most times you are on your own to fix the problem. It all depends on the manager you have if the store is going to run smoothly or not. It does provide good benefits if you work long enough.
good,"Ho lavorato con gente di tutto il mondo, dove l'interazione in più lingue straniera permeteva crescita costante e quotidiana"
good,I haveworked for Starbucks for not very long and I will say that a terrible management will make or break a store experience for you. Be careful and be sure the management of the store you pick will actually work with you and not against you or place you in positions where you feel unsupported. Despite this a store that is high volume only will place more stress on you as a person if your management isnt helpful to you a partner. I came into Starbucks excited and now I leaving with a bad experience of what it means to work here. I recommend that for anyone who wants to work for Starbucks be sure to look into your management and talk to partners to see what they feel about who leads them because you will be in their shoes when you begin. Goodluck.
good,The best part of my job was the customers. And my least favorite part was my coworkers. Everyone is too sensative to joke with. And they higher people who are against my religious beliefs. But great coffee and fun high paced environment. Just don't tell anyone your personal life and you'll be fine.
good,"The Starbucks I was employed at was privately owned, had no possibilities of advancement and so much employee drama it was like being in high school again. Reliable employees were hard to find and the few they had were either scared off by the people who were there or the amount of work they'd have to pick up because no one would do their job properly"
good,"A lot of work to do in such a tight space, uncomfortable scenario as pressure to perform  was high ; especially since lines were always long.  Overall not great experience for such high regarded service in my opinion."
good,"Wouldn't recommend if you want a slow paced, consistent schedule. Working for the company was not a good experience. No discounts, no benefits, no insurance."
good,"It’s a good job if you like just bring around people but it is very fast paced. People get hired then quit automatically. Some of the customers are rude, but some of them are a joy to have around you"
good,"Part time work at Starbucks to balance with studies  works well as hours are flexible but the workers that work there full time and rely on their pay checks from Starbucks, I would not say Starbucks is a good company to work for. They become exhausted and over 24 will be on minimum wage which is not enough."
good,"Working for Starbucks was an interesting experience. I originally applied there for their college education program, which promised to help employees attend college. They made it seem as though they would pay for your classes up front, however you were responsible for the full tuition amount up front, which I could not afford. On top of that, they over work you, schedule you just under the hour limit to qualify for full time benefits. Starbucks is basically Walmart; they do not pay their employees what they are worth and in the end, their employees make so little they qualify for government assistance even while working full time. Shame on Starbucks."
good,Fue una experiencia corta que tuvo sus altas y bajas.
good,"Typically be a lovely staff you'd be working with however, the recruitment was often not very wise and lead to the shifts being more disorganised then needed as some staff where not sufficiently trained to there needs. Very frequent changes of management and unhappy supervisors lead to a foul atmosphere."
good,"Very hard to work with school schedule, and the management was poor at making schedules, whoever complained the most usually got what they wanted, while select people did most of the work. "
good,i enjoyed the customer base! the culture of the company was something you can get behind. you got to know your customer base by drink then by name. it was fairly pleasant working for them
good,"Starbucks is known for having decent benefits and that’s great and all that but the pay in my opinion is trash and it makes no sense that I got started at $9.15/ hr when I have experience in the fields. The manager is a bit rude ( I always felt like she didn’t like me) i was there at a horrid time. Managers were being switched around and our new manager came in and turned the place upside down. Employees left with the old manager and some left Starbucks all together. They had me working both deep clean nights and it was exhausting. They don’t pay enough for me to clean those bathrooms and their drains extensively, they need to hire a late night cleaning company to come deep clean. Along with all that^ they need to make it easier when hired to get all the employee info you need and not hand you a full welcome package of 1000+ pages of info. Compact all that into a company employee website and just give them the website info and log in info in a cute little pamphlet. Y’all corporate and still unorganized. I’ve also seen some employees that try and transfer stores and can’t because the manager doesn’t like them and can mark them as a undesirable employee. So if you do go there and decide to leave with possibility of wanting to return, leave on good terms of course."
good,Working at Starbucks is different for everyone. If you have the right manager then it will be amazing but most I've found aren't the best sadly.......
good,"Loved my co-workers and regulars that came in. Great for somebody not supporting a family or single income. Last I heard my old boss got fired for  lying on hours. They cut hours, but wanted the few people who got them to pick up the pace for the person who should have been there. Benefits were pretty good for fast food."
good,"I left starbucks after my entire store dealt with a tyrant of a manager, who was harrassing and abusive. We reported her several times to the district, to the region, to hr and the company did nothing but a slap on the wrist to help us improve our working environment or relationship."
good,"It was fine, I needed a job and it paid. Not great pay and pretty flexible schedule. Stressful work environment. It's ok to work there temporarily. Would recommend to a high school student"
good,"When the first CEO created Starbucks, one of his missions was to make sure that College students would have time to work AND study."
good,"Good first time job, or working while in school. Not a job to move up in the company, bad training, all pay depepends what store you work at. Would not recommend"
good,"Enjoyed working there overall, but would not recommend if you need flexibility in your life. This is a great job for those who are in high school!!!!!"
good,the company cuts hours to the point that store managers are working overtime off the clock. DM is okay with that and HR doesn't hold DM accountable. Reported harassment and HR still did not about it.
good,It can be a fun place to work but normally really busy and short staffed. My store had a drive thru and its right off the freeway so... super busy all the time.
good,"An okay place to work. If you are a student, make sure to emphasize your school schedule and make them work around you. Hardest part of the job ha to be difficult guests."
good,"All the positive parts of working at starbucks are taken away when you work in a sobeys location. No free drinks, tips are not allowed under any circumstance, you work alone alot more often than any other starbucks, you have no extra time after close to help with the actual closing duties, you dont have all equipment (coffee equipment and customer service equipment) that other starbucks have access too, you have to follow starbucks rules and Sobeys rules at the same time which adds to workload. Go work at an actual starbucks, they are much better"
good,"The store manager isn't understanding and takes things too personally, which transfers to the employees and sours the experience. However, I love making coffee for anyone that comes through the doors and getting to know each customer."
good,"For a rising company like Starbucks, they provide average benefits. The scheduling is pretty insignificant and often times, not reliable at all. Their one free meal and free drinks are great to add to an employees day. I feel every company should provide free meals, especially when there are pregnant women out there working their butts off. I was disappointed with the amount of negativity in the workplace, but I can say not all Starbucks are the same. Often times I  find that patience is key in a workplace like this one. The online schooling is both a setback and an advancement, depending on who is receiving the tuition reimbursements. Definitely does not offer enough majors to choose from for online classes to a college across country. Better luck next time! This company is best for young teens or college students with minimal responsibilities."
good,manager didn't train correctly. Hired me for security but made me be a cashier. Left me alone while training. lied about everything they was so mean didn't let me take a break.
good,"The management was a tad unorganized because my job area never had one solid manager. Since the position for manger had not been filled, all the other managers from different departments decided to step in. This was difficult since none of them were trained in my department and didn't fully understand how to run it. It was also difficult because multiple mangers telling me different things always ended up with me getting in trouble. But aside from that I had a terrific time being a barista! I love the core of that job so much, being able to talk to people and then being trusted to create a delicious drink for them always made me happy."
good,"Starbucks has lots of branches and customers so they’d hire people without experience. It’s a great first or second job because you’d feel less awkward talking to strangers, you’d learn to work and move fast, and because you’d get lots of angry customers waiting too long for their drinks that you’d just get used to people with attitudes. Working here trained me to be a better worker for my next job. It was a struggle to learn recipes and menu at first so you should like working here to make it work on the first few weeks otherwise, working here at first would be a nightmare. Coworkers who’d be there longer usually get frustrated to new people as they have no room for mistakes and slow movements."
good,management lies and does not fulfill promises. terrible work hours terrible management. too much work and responsibility for not enough pay or appreciation
good,"Starbucks is not a bad job, nor is it a hard one."
good,I was able to gain experience and master new and helpful skills while working at Starbucks. a typical day at work was very busy but it helped teach me how to work under pressure.
good,"Lots of work in the morning, less at night. Plenty of fun interactions with customers. Getting to know them was the best part of the job. I made life long friends across the counter and met people to look up to. I learned that large companies don't think about employees as people with lives and problems outside of work."
good,the job itself was a good job but the people i worked with weren't at all nice or kind or fair. Every time i asked for help coworkers would get annoyed and angry when i asked one question.
good,"I think my experience at Starbucks was a bit chaotic. At my location, they started new hires off at $8.50/hr and luckily I was hired at 9.25 since i had experience in other cafes. Even then they have you working nonstop and if you fall behind on the checklist, expect to stay a good hour past close. To me, it just wasn't worth it to be making so little for how much work i was actually doing."
good,"Starbucks is a great company. They bought a lot of light to my life, I learned what my passion was just working at starbucks and I am thankful for the opportunities I had working there."
good,workplace its an environment tow work. Good culture. Work life balance sucks. I would recommend to work for corporate. It is a lot of work but you can move up.
good,"Pretty much exactly what you'd expect. There is high pressure for consistency, speed, and quality customer service. The hardest part of the job is typically dealing with customers and other coworkers. Conflicts and complaints are an all day occurrence."
good,You would be left alone for long periods with no help. Management wasn't the easiest to work for.  There would be call outs and you would be stuck working until they could find replacement.
good,so busy because of the students that always come in so there are really no breaks. everyone is really competitive and trying to impress the main supervisor so that theyre on their good side
good,"It was okay, didn’t really like working here, was super stressful all the time, worked over 40 hours and still was not considered a full time employee"
good,"Individual store management is difficult. The workforce is young and a different breed than most restaurant environments. The company lives by respecting work-life balance but inside a store, it can't exist with the reliability of the workforce. It's a great company to work for if you aren't at the store level. I believed in so much of what they taught me and promoted at the top. It's just hard to see the bigger picture when you're called in on your days off."
good,"When I first started Starbucks I was excited about the process of coffee making. It was awesome meeting new people and a great environment to hone in on your customer service skills. I actually enjoyed it, but my experience with the management at my store was an entire different story. We were always understaffed expected to do more than what we could handle. The only way to move up was to brown nose. I worked hard and gave it my all for 2 years. I let my management know my desire to move up, but she gave the position to someone who she was friends with. I finally gave up and realized the pay and stress was not worth it all. So I left. During my last 2 weeks I was treated different. My manager seemed upset with me. On my last day she didn't even offer me a recommendation letter."
good,"I have worked for 3 different starbucks stores and 2 have been excellent experiences. It all comes down to management. The company works hard to instill in their new employees the company goal of creating the ""third space"", and teaches new employees efficiency and how to handle disgruntled, (early morning/pre-caffeinated) customers with a smile. The company teaches a lot of useful tools to the new employees, who can apply those skills outside of Starbucks for future career growth."
good,Has great benefits but you are over worked and there is  little to no job advancement. If you do decide to work there I would ask employees how they feel about their district.
good,"I enjoyed being a partner at Starbucks, but it is not a place to call a career. I was forever grateful the day I finally left Starbucks for an actual career where I can make a salary and a difference in people's lives."
good,The people you work with here can make or break your time here. I love most of my partners the only thing I hated was my SM. Absolutely hated him. He practically destroyed everything in three months . As far as I know he still works thereand I feel bad for my old  partners.
good,It’s fast paced and tough work. Learned about customer service. Management is tough. Customers can be nice but also extremely rude. Free coffee and part-time benefits
good,"Although the management was poor between all three Starbucks stores I worked at, the benefits of free drinks and food item, relationships with coworkers and customers, and the food preparation skills I was able to acquire were all worth it."
good,It was a good job when I was a student. Often overwhelming because I worked at the highest volume store in my region. Made friends. Manager was rude and inconsiderate.
good,"The company was wonderful when I started. Over the years, it has gone a different direction entirely. We are no longer making meaningful connections, but expect to find time to both know every customer and have drive through times in the minute. Advancement is only to those favorites with little to know skills. Job pay becomes less and less worth the while as floods of customers enter the store during multiple ""happy hours"" with extremely little labor."
good,Overall Starbucks is a great place to work for those just starting out in the workforce. They offer flexible work schedules and opportunities to learn a wide variety of skills.
good,"For most parts, it's a good starter job to gain some experience, but not great if you are looking for a semi-permanent position to help with bills, schooling, and other expenses. The first two months were great, then it started to go downhill since then. We are constantly shortstaffed because the new person would quit within two days! Also, the hours are incredibly inconsistent, and I would usually only have one day off in the entire week, and if I have time off, I'm almost always called in to work. My manager needs to learn how to do a better job of how to schedule employees and find employees that won't quit within a week! They expect a lot from you, but you can only do so much as a solitary employee. I always end up alone at the kiosk, and handling a long line of customers solo can be overwhelming, and that can potentially worsen and become more stressful if the customers become impatient waiting. The coworkers for the most part are okay but could do more to help each other out because working at Starbucks is an absolute team effort, not an individual can pull by all themselves. Don't expect any appreciation or promotions because you won't get any! The pay alone is not worth all the hard work that goes along with it. So I do not recommend it at all unless you are looking for something to pass the time."
good,"The manger was so rude and had little care about his employees. He would come in some days with a temper causing him to lash out on the baristas, making the day last longer. When being trained I got shouted at for a very minor mistake. Other baristas were a little rude but overall there were some really nice coworkers. The supervisors were always supportive and friendly and made the day better. Although I have never been treated in the way that manger treated me."
good,Really enjoyed the overall atmosphere of being a barista and making the drinks and dealing with the customers but the management was lacking and they could not figure out proper communication skills besides yelling and shouting.
good,"A typical day can be stressful but only during rush hours which usually occurred in the morning between 6-9 a. am.  "
good,I had a difficult time with the management at this location. Other than that I typically enjoyed the job. Typically a very busy location. Coworkers made the busy day go by.
good,Management sucks because they will not move you up unless you kiss butt and not because you are a great worker. Has good benefits and meet alot of people. will get you out of your confort zone if you are shy.
good,The company's core values are great. The main concern was the management. They were very unclear and were not the best leaders. The workers were great but the management has to be improved though!
good,Management makes such a difference. First 2 years were fine then it went down hill when manager went on maternity leave. I heard it got better a few years later though.
good,"Far too much is expected from you with very little pay. I have been with the company for two years, and lived in BC and SK working for the company, and there are many perks to working here, like free coffee, and stock benefits, etc. but many stores can be very busy and if you are someone that easily becomes stressed, then this may not be the position for you."
good,"Starbucks can be a very fun place to work for if you work with the right employees. But, starbucks makes it clear from day one that they only care about their company first. The partner care comes dead last. If it came between you and a customer no matter the situation Starbucks will always pick the customer."
good,"My time at Starbucks started really well. Each day I would come in in the proper dress code and clock in before asking the shift manager which position I was getting assigned to. The customers were generally pleasant. Some of the coworkers were very two-faced which management did not attempt to fix. Once there was a change in the store manager, however, things were not as good. The environment was uncomfortable and unbalanced. Additionally, the manager would make inappropriate comments that his higher up did not address nor punish."
good,"Great flexibility and benefits while you are a student. Learned many different management styles and they do invest in training. The culture changes over the years towards just the bottom line and veered away from its main value, people."
good,"Hired me just as the store became a 24 hour location.  She did not tell me that I would be doing overnight shifts, and overall my shifts were all over the place.  11pm-4am, then 2 days later I was 7am - 2pm, etc.  Definitely ruined my sleeping pattern for life."
good,"I find Starbucks to be exceedingly different from one store to another, with some stores implementing more, less, or just different policies than one another, mostly dependent on managerial direction."
good,I Loved this job  when I started but  after a change of staff and management it became a mess. I would go back but to a different location if I could.
good,"I love working at Starbucks because of the team I had backing me and because sometimes work goes by quickly. The issues that I have with it is that the pay does NOT match the struggle especially with Happy Hour days and the higher-ups refuse to give the individual stores more labor allowance and that affects all of the partners. I enjoyed my job when I was just a barista, but now that I moved up to shift supervisor all of the job benefits are overshadowed by the reliance on me showing up to work and never getting sick or needing a day off. I am a college student and I will say it was a big mistake to become a shift supervisor. If you're a shift supervisor at Starbucks you better not have school, kids, or anything else major going on in your life because that will be affected. The actual job isn't bad and I enjoyed it but being in college and being a shift supervisor is not a good mix."
good,I wish I could have better training. Everything was rushed. its a fun job but  hectic. I felt like things that needed to get done where not getting the right attention. It can be a gossipy environment. I wish I would have worked for a different store or management group.
good,"It’s a great place to learn the basics of teamwork and collaboration. It’s often fast paced work, though they offer breaks frequently more so than most retail or other service type jobs. The benefits are great. If you can afford healthcare. However the pay is not enough for most positions. The priorities of the corporate office do not match the mission statements. "
good,Customers and management are against you here.  My co-worker was called a racial slur by a customer and management ended up firing the victim. This was before the national Starbucks racism prevention movement.
good,my review on working with the company Starbucks is i would not work there again because the manager that was at my location was very rude an unhelpful.
good,"Corporation standards aren't applicable to day to day operations. Unfair time dead lines. No real loyalty from upper management to front line workers. Too many outside hires, not enough inside promotions. Always want low labor costs, yet menu cost to customers grows. Not enough hands on training for new hires."
good,"While the management was poor and employees were constantly placed in short-staffed situations, making the drinks and interacting with customers definitely made up for some of it."
good,"A typical day at work is being friendly and accommodating to customers, positive vibes and good energy. Learned a lot. Great company, but bad management practices (i.e micromanaging, poor treatment to employees) leading to unnecessary stress, pressure and expectation to perform more from the employee. On the other hand, overall nice atmosphere with other partners. Opening hours are too early and closing hours are too late. I always get excited about promotional new drinks!"
good,"Though I learned a lot about the customer service industry here, It was at times chaotic and felt like I had no support from my leaders or district managers."
good,"like most entry-level jobs, there are a lot of teenagers and retired people working here. It is a very hectic and stressful environment based on out-the-window numbers"
good,"Quiet clean store"
good,"You learn how to appreciate coffee at this store as it is a reserve store. But that goes out the window as most of the drinks are sugary, fat-filled garbage with a shot of espresso in it. Have fun serving old ladies who think they know more about your job than you do and treat you like garbage.  All you need to know what to type in is ""Non-fat, no foam and decaf"""
good,"If your a hard worker that can multi-task and can separate yourself from work place drama and don't mind putting your job first, than this is your ideal job."
good,"I wasn't given the hours I'd asked for and was always confronted by, ""I'm sorry, but it's the slow season."" I had no room to grow as outsiders were hired to fill in higher positions. I chose to leave without hesitation."
good,"operasyonda müsafirlerin istekleri yönünde ,içecek ve yiyeceklerin hazırlanması, genel iletişim ve geri dönüşler anlamında mutluluk verici bir deneyimdi. şu an yine aynı işi yapmak isterim. Fakat şirket politikaları, performans değerlendirmelerindeki tarafsız olunamama, kariyer aşamalarındaki eşitsizlikler ve  belli bir noktadan sonra dayanılmaz hale gelen aşırı düşük maaş sistemi markadan uzaklaştırıyor."
good,"employees won’t do their jobs, they come to work stoned out of their minds, wont clean up after them self’s, left alone for 4+hours with no help or care if you need help."
good,"Honestly it all depends on the manager, for my store you have to be a favorite of the manager to get hours, if not you may have to ask people for their shift. And even when you want advancement they would rather hire other managers than just train the employees. You also have to be on the managers good side other wise you will have your hours cut , if you speak up, your hours will get cut, if you ask for more hours you won’t get any. Some people have to beg for the minimum hours just to get their benefits. Overall not a good place to work at if your tryna to pay rent. They also have The general manager of the store who is still in their early 20’s so that will sum it up."
good,"Terrible hours, terrible pay, no benefits, no discount. They trained me for barista certification but never certified me because they were focused on making me do things other baristas didn't want to do. It takes them forever to certify anyone."
good,Starbuck offer a lot incentive but the pay and hour shift start are real hard to keep a social life. The money make off their customer they should be able to pay a living wage $10.55 hr and 20-30 hr week don't give you effort to live off. They expect you be the janitor and the maintenance crew all well you try other task make the place unsafe because mopping floor around you co-workers.
good,"A typical day at work was crazy, the store did not run very smoothly and the baristas did not have pride in the job. "
good,I have loved my time at Starbucks because of the environment my coworkers strive to create. It has been a very maturing experience in my life and I will always be thankful. I feel it is best for me to look for employment else where simply because when the boss doesn't care it shows. When there is no room for grace and humanity in the workplace it causes people to become unhappy which effects the whole store.
good,"I've been with sbux for 6 full years. Been going for career as a store manager. I've been talking about it since day 1. Became a supervisor within a year, but have been stuck here for a number of reasons. First, placement. If there is no opening for you, don't expect a promotion to that position. I was promoted to supervisor because we needed one, not because I was qualified or spoke to customers well or outperformed the current supervisor, a place opened up. So same thing continues to happen, only this time positions open up, they get filled with outside hires. Unless you can make drinks while bending over backwards, and deal with the ""let's all be nice and wear kid gloves"" mentality, while most people get by doing little to no work, then aim for barista. Good money and benefits for little responsibility."
good,i dont want to continue talking about starbucks...starting to feel as though you guys might be under an umbrella together...and its bs to make this a mandatory part of an application...i just want a new part time job
good,"I enjoyed the experience of working there, I have grown and want to move forward with my finding another job. A typical day at work is just like any job that has to do with customers and food. You prep the morning for the day. Everyone is usually really nice."
good,"Good place to work for teenagers. Management is almost non-existent. They frown upon people that are conservative, even in the least bit. Feels more like high school drama and gossip than work."
good,"I was a store manager for many years and was held back by my DM to advance in the company so I could stay in a store.  Being the the business for 25 years I have more to offer than the opportunities I was given,"
good,I wasn't happy with the company due to pay. Was giving other employees that were Hindu and not me. Work was intense and owner didn't care how sick you were
good,This team is spread think and often partners take on more than one job to get results. Leadership is thin also. Opening a new market requires you to embed in the country and emirs in the culture. This is a great experience.
good,ok. not the best upward mobility/corporate support. I did enjoy the culture of the company. It does seem as if the company is more concerned with the Baristas and not Management. Should be concerned about the development of both. Benefits are only good from a Barista perspective. Does not really apply to a manager with a degree and experience.
good,"The store I applied for was awesome at first. It seemed very comfortable. But as time went on this store had 4 managers in the 2 years i was there. And with every new manager, things change, employees leave.. The store went down hill quick.. and so did my love for the job."
good,"Good management was hard to come by, a lot of turnover.  The job can be fun if you work with good people.  Constantly under staffed and cared more about numbers on paper than needs."
good,"If your basic you'll love working here. Sure its fun and easy when the right people are working. Its a very cliquey place to work. Management has its favourites, coworkers act really fake and robotic. Easiest place to work if you can handle the annoyance of preppy coworkers."
good,"Het is altijd druk,heel zware fysiek werk en werk/privè balans 0"
good,"I think the review title sums it up very nicely. The management team besides the the head boss is comprised of students at the campus and therefore, some of them lack the tools and the know-how on how to keep pettiness and the cliquishness down. If anything, most of them fuel the fire and put their favorite coworkers in preferable positions, while making the job for their least favorite employers harder and push them down. As well as talking the usual petty drama within the job environment. I would frequently walk over an hour sometimes bc of the hours given and the lack of car to the job to just be given the worst position and be talked down to. While, being told from a student supervisor I didn't care about the job or I was not putting in as much effort as other coworkers all the while running around and stocking and cleaning the store."
good,The hours are not guaranteed. The place can be very stressful at time. The space is very crowded and the management doesn’t care much for their employees.
good,"I am completely overworked, while also being underappreciated. I have people in management above me that do a small portion of my work, yet reap the rewards. Starbucks is a great corporate establishment, however, the lower you are on the totem pole, the less they care about you."
good,I interviewed for full time hours. I never received full time hours. It was a fun job. I would go back if I could work full time. I enjoyed the customers.
good,"The pace of business would fluctuate throughout the day depending on the time. This particular Starbucks was located in a Target store so it was fairly busy everyday; especially busy on weekends. I learned the proper way to make the different drinks and learned how to use the specific functions of the cash register. I would say the general manager was not really the best, neither was the executive manager of the target store; not very respectful to employees. The workplace culture is respectively represented in media but not always applied to other employees. The hardest part of the job would be times when customers are having a bad day and are not very polite to the barista. The most enjoyable part of the job would be having fun making the drinks and becoming close friends with the other co-workers and managers. Also seeing the contentment of customers who enjoy their beverages and thank you for the good job that we do."
good,"Fun fast paced environment, super great team, good benefits."
good,Fine place to work. The manager was very hard to work with. The rest of the staff were wonderful and a great team to work with. The furniture needed replacing.
good,"Bad boss ... great atomsphuere tho , enjoyed my co workers. Much more laid back when the boss wasn’t there. Boss it way to up tight doesn’t like having fun."
good,I learned to do a latte art and I am one those barista who could do it always on coffee. The management is good but there will always one people will ruin yoyr day. Ther hardest part of the job is understanding each customer to give a good customer service.The most enjoyable part is when I got to meet new friends and good customers.
good,The managers played favorites and everyone was very cliquey. I wasn't properly trained to make drinks or do anything aside from putting sandwiches in a microwave oven.
good,"Loved the customers and amount of hours worked. "
good,"Normal day at work with strict customers, doing the usual how to make coffees, deep clean, run the floor, run cashier, multi task and stock. Starting out as a regular worker to turning into a Barista over time was what I did."
good,"Great job if you need benefits with flexible hours. Good work environment depending on where you are. Upper management is pretty terrible across the board, the majority of them are uneducated and insecure and you can imagine what happens when you mix those."
good,"Unrealistic expectation (speed and quality) while working with difficult customers and staff. Unreliable hours, wages, and tips. Good job for students or temporary employment ONLY."
good,The management at my specific location was unbearable. She was a brand new store manager at Starbucks after spending years at Apple Bees. She showed clear favoritism and made those who weren't her favorite do the grunt work. I learned to quicken my pace and interact better with customers as to make relationships with them to make their visit more enjoyable.
good,They don’t really work with your hours if you’re in school. Demanded to stay after your shift even if you have to go or have an appointment or school.
good,Going into work at Starbucks every day I could rest assured knowing I would be part of a team that was collaborative and worked together for the better of the business and the company.
good,"wouldnt do it again, manger was a nightmare. i really dont have a lot to say but it was probably thanks to my manager that i constantly wanted to quit."
good,"It ha been one of the worst jobs I've ever had in my life. Management is totally inconsistent, and though the culture is supposed to be that everyone is accepted and welcomed, due to my experience I have to say that that is a false and hypocritical statement. I get dogged out and judged and treated like a nuisance for simply going to pick up my paycheck on payday because I don't have direct deposit. If you can't treat your employees with the same respect that you afford your customers then something is wrong. The new store manager is awesome, though."
good,"Learned a lot about coffee and coffee products, learned to really enjoy the art of being a barista. Coworkers became like family. Management was terrible."
good,the new manger was a very bad manger she did not know how to mange the store and i believe that Starbucks should start training people in the startbucks up
good,"The Starbucks store that I currently work at is very disorganized despite advancements to alter that. It is highly stressful, understaffed, and very  little room for emergency situations, whatever that could entail; whether store related or personal. Customers tend to treat you extremely poorly and the staff and the staff is divided. Not a great environment for any sort of true development."
good,"I have been with Starbucks  for about 4 years and counting. I truly wanna go somewhere else to be the best I can be. I feel that i have achieved everything I could possibly do."
good,"Hard to advance and extremely hard work for not enough pay, especially if you work in the morning during the rush! You are not given enough people to get through peak but are still expected to make drive-thru times and sales"
good,"Incredible workload. Exceptional expectations with performance and customer interaction. Constant shifting infrastructure, constant changing of different offered promotions, product, and processes."
good,"Overall, a good place to work. I enjoyed interacting with patrons on a daily basis and forming relationships. I had a good team and we accomplished our goals daily."
good,I am surprised the store I worked at still functions. There were many regular customers that refuse to go to that store because the neglect and terrible service.
good,Not my favorite job because i had terrible manager and an even worse district manager. the district manager hired all of her old friends from lyon real estate and they tanked the district
good,The specific location i worked for was very catty and dramatic and it kind've ruined my entire outlook on starbucks. The management was awful and they didnt do training.
good,"It just sucks when you have to drive an hour to  get to work and then get cut after only working an hour or two.  I was always the first for the manager to cut, even though I was the one that drove the farthest to work there."
good,They need more improvement in this Starbucks need to be more organized with employees and shipment. I've tried giving them some opinions but they didn't agree with my opinion.
good,Working at Starbucks can be enjoyable but only when you aren’t alone. It’s a teamwork kind of job. With how busy it gets there should always be at the very least 3 baristas working at a time. In my experience it was only ever me during my shift but I imagine if I had more help it would’ve been a much more fun and enjoyable job.
good,"Starbucks was a fast-paced, sometimes high pressure work environment, with rather low pay, and difficult hours.  The staff in some locations was fun to work with, but in others, were catty and competitive."
good,"If you are looking to get paid well this is the right place to work, but be prepared to work 5+ 12hr days per week. The benefits are great, but the night shift which pays better than other shift is highly overworked."
good,Enjoyed working there for a few years. Once promoted things turned for the worst pay is average and stress and pressure is at 300 percent. If you plan to make it a career. good luck!
good,"It's fun workplace, focused on customers and with great work ethic people. "
good,İşe başlamış olduğum ilk günden son güne kadar merkez ofiste kariyer basamaklarını tırmanabileceğim pozisyonlar için vaadlerde bulunuldu fakat düzenli ve disiplinli çalışma hayatıma rağmen staj fırsatı dahi tanınmadı.
good,"Good company to work for if you are in school. Management took advantage of me, and the training lacked. I developed great friendships though.. and I loved all the free coffee."
good,"Really great skills and experiences to take from this job. You meet great people and there are seemingly endless learning opportunities. Management is the most difficult aspect of this job, definitely need to work on advancement process, often an unfair, harsh, judgemental or juvenile workplace, although other times can be great and super fun, especially when there are other good hires."
good,"While this isn't a complaint about the company, management doesn't quite have its act together. If you've got a good crew, it's the easiest job in the world. If you've got a bunch of high school kids who stand around and do nothing, good luck!"
good,"horrible. management is horrible, its almost like its their job to schedule you out of your availability constantly and to just completely mess up your day"
good,Typical day at work was great with the people and management at the store. Middle level & upper management were bogus. We landed top sales for the Verismo machine launch and received 5 dollar gift cards to STARBUCKS... hardest part of any customer service job are the customers. Our store culture was amazing with filled many memories.
good,"Starbucks is definitely the most stressful job I've ever worked. There was absolutely no time for down time or any relaxation from the time i walked in the door to the time I left, and I often was given more responsibilities during my shift than I was able to perform in the given time."
good,It was a terrible environment.  It was her second chance and second store and that ended up not great for us.It was a terrible environment.  My store before that was fine but passive aggressive.  Neither were great.
good,It was a ok place to work. The hours were early and the pay wasn’t that great. It was easy to become a manager but you would be stuck in that same spot!
good,"The work conditions were intense. The temperature would be almost 90 degrees, and the head supervisor never actually fixed that, but the issue was told to him. The page wage was below other starbucks restaurants. Their was not proper security, when needed. Also management was poor, i didn't not have proper training, it was kind of a just throw you out their and you learn by watching, and got scream at fro making a mistake. When you weren't even trained on anything. It was a watch and learn as you go type of process, which i thought was very unprofessional."
good,"People don’t quit the job, they quit the management. Loved all of my coworkers except for my manager and assistant manager. They never scheduled enough people, promised promotions that never came to be, and didn’t respect part-time/full-time status or availablility."
good,"The job was over all a good job, just at the time had poor management and did not have any kind of structure to it."
good,"It's hard to work under management when it's clear you are not liked. "
good,"It was fun in the beginning but then they stresses you out with sales and making sure customers are always right. But customers are NOT always right, THEY ARE TREATED RIGHT. Not always have to listen and follow what customers are blindly complaining."
good,"Working at Starbucks can be fun, as it's easy to make new friends in such a close working environment. However, the customers can often get extremely rude, and it can be difficult to handle, especially for somebody new to customer service. The pay is often not high enough for the amount of emotional abuse that the barista will endure from demanding and demeaning customers. However, a positive attitude and assistance from coworkers makes it much easier and much more fun."
good,The regional management is in the hand of unexperienced and new managers. I was not followed up in my development. There is no meritocracy. The it system is obsolete
good,Typically works with your school schedule. Is nice when you get the hours you need. Only need 20 hrs a week to qualify for health insurance. Easy to learn and complete the required day to day tasks.
good,"Inadequent job allowance"
good,Fast paced high energy and communication is key. Hours are varied and there aren't many benefits or room for advancement. good summer job for sure. I wouldn't go back.
good,"cool place to work at, people were really nice and they made you feel welcome. training was right to the point and you learn everything quickly. very fast paces"
good,"I must say that Starbucks tries to make their ""partners"" happy."
good,Managemet is poor. Overall Starbucks is a fun place to work besides that . Hard to move up in the company because of favoritism and other reasons. Look
good,My overall starbucks experience has been good. But my manager made it terrible. Starbucks is great place to work as either a starting job or an in between job.
good,"My manager fired me because I couldn't come in since I had bruises on my face, neck, and body. He knew I fell down the stairs and talked to higher-ups and said he would give me a call back after he found out what he needed to do but I never received a call and instead was just taken off the schedule."
good,Poor management. My old manager made me work the register and the bar at the same time when I was 1 week old in the job during moring rush hours. She would hide in the back while we are busy struggling the front.
good,"Starbucks is fast paced, and easy to do, but the pay is not enough to live by. Starbucks is fast paced. Starbucks is fast paced. Starbucks is fast pac"
good,It's a wonderful place to work if you get the right manager. But if you get the wrong one things are stressful all the time and it's just a really bad place to be.
good,"I was often scheduled nightly which would keep me up until at least 2 am when I finally got home and was often scheduled in the morning after a night shift which really messed with my sleep schedule. Management was always different, we switched between managers at least 3 times. The breaks were very short and when you're on the floor there was zero downtime, it was very fast-paced and busy every minute of the shift."
good,"ok management but there was a serious lack of hours, and the pay wasn't enough for me to maintain a household. the location wasn't great the homeless were constantly harassing customers so i became more of a security guard than barista."
good,"I am great full to my manager for giving me and teaching me how to be a shift supervisor, at the time i learned how to talk more to co-workers and how manage the till and make orders, how to deal with difficult customers. It was a amazing experience but unfortunately in a couple of years a couple of things change in the companies and management change.  Rules change and hours change  so I had to look for a better Job opportunity."
good,"Customers suck, pay sucks, job sucks, frapps suck, food sucks, environment almost always sucks. Bathrooms are always disgusting and guess who cleans them?! Yeah, you will if you work here."
good,I only stayed in my cafe for three months because the the inner circle of girls working there refused to let me learn on bar and kept me on cash and despite forcing myself on bar and learning the drinks the GM only saw my screw ups because she was never in the cafe so I ended up leaving. Could be because it was partnered and not corporate though. Over all it was a fun job and I made some pretty great friends through the customer scene.
good,I enjoyed the fast paced work and the customers and staff. There was a lot of problems with the way upper management took care of lower level problems and didn't show much interest in keeping lower level employees. I did work at a licensed store.
good,"Despite working part time, I struggled to have a good work-life balance. I was contracted to work overtime without being asked, and the rota was only released a week in advance. The manager was demanding, had ridiculous expectations, but was also lazy and when they weren't bossing the staff around on bar, they were sitting in the office doing nothing. The breaks were bad, where you have to work a ten hour shift and only get a half hour and then a ten minute break. It's a minimum wage role, and all the staff were exhausted from working ridiculous shifts."
good,"It's a fun job, but you live pay check to tips to paycheck. Don't recommend past high school or college or as a main career. Great as a second income. Great for the benefits alone. But seriously not as an only income."
good,"busy all the time, sometimes short staffed."
good,"It was a good  experience  "
good,"Starbucks is a wonderful company, but when you truly fall in love with the job- it steals a little piece of you that you can never get back. This job really just prepared me for the cutthroat game of life."
good,You are able to move fast in the company but without proper training and support from peers. You seem to run everything and are left high and dry. Easy work overall but not great management.
good,Starbucks at Safeway was an experience however it had various negatives. There were many instances where they were not cooperative with our schedule and expected us to come in even when they had just notified us about working.
good,"Poor Management, after only being 4 months into the job my entire staff quit and I had to train my entire new staff. A lot of pressure and stress, not worth the pay. Also on Saturdays our most busy day there would only be one barista for like 5 hours."
good,Great because of the employees and customers that we get to meet. I've learned new things and advanced my supervision/management skills for the future.
good,"I worked there for 2.5 years. I enjoyed the job for the most part, but due to excessive turn over in management, and lacking support from the district, it was easier to leave than try and move up. Management is told to encourage a culture of upward mobility, but they do not always promote based on ability, availability, or dependability. From my experience it's a good place to work until something better comes along."
good,"Very draining. Culture kind of doesn't exist there. At the same time can be benevolent and alright but not if you work anywhere busy."
good,Working at Starbucks has taught me a lot of things ranging from customer service to working with different personality types. The work environment was healthy. Pay was okay.
good,"Mi experiencia en particular fue buena.si hay crecimiento, solo que esta experiencia no fue agradable ya que los compañeros no te apoyaban para que se diera el crecimiento.eran muy celosos con sus conocimientos."
good,I would have a million things to do with no support from my manager and it seemed the better you were at your job the less help would be given to you.
good,"The Starbucks I work for is a franchise."
good,it was a job but a typical day would be me running the store and not getting paid to do so. I would open and sometimes close the store with just me and one other person.
good,"Not the culture i expected. Early Mornings, If no shift managers, you are expected to work as many hours as needed. This could mean 7 days a week ans 17 hour days if needed"
good,Good place to get your feet wet in the work force. Would not recommend if you plan to advance in to a manager position. Workload is unfair and lay does not justify what you're required to do.
good,Worked for 5 years and made the same amount as someone who has been there a year. Understaffed workplace with poor pay and little appreciation for the work you do.
good,The manager I had at Starbucks created a hostile work environment for all employees. Retaliation against employees ranged from decreased hours to unapproved time off.
good,"They cut back on hours, and don't pay well. At least this is my experience with working at a Starbucks that is operated within a Kroger establishment."
good,"The Day can begin with you waking up very early and having to clock in with staff that can or could be always in bad mood.Your first job to start the Day of is to greet your fellow employee who might as well hate the job or love it, might not enjoy been on the clock but u can make it happen for them with a simple smile and hello.Then you are assigned to a role you play ""part of your shift"" and it could include been at cashier,The bar,Customer support,Order support, or even be next to an oven making some sandwich for very hungry people who cannot wait a min for there food.Majority of the time you will act or pretend to be having a good day when really everything is terrible and you just want to go home but instead you put everything u have on the line.Me personally I work very very hard dedicated like no one can ever be and put whatever is on the line to make a person day satisfied."
good,The only plus about this job was the diversity of the people working there. Terrible labor practices. It's physically demanding and I'd often find myself on my feet the entire shift.
good,"There are many correctable issues with working at Starbucks."
good,"everyones experience here is different, I worked at the one in safeway on harpers farm road in Columbia Maryland. the management was poor and unprofessional there is no benefits, and if you like being yelled at for literally nothing than I recommend it for you. honestly I left because I had obligations for school. now luckily one of the actual store managers (safeway) was kind enough to assure me they would still give me an alright reference because he understood that I'm not leaving because of work but the management was something that heavily influenced my decision"
good,A typical day at Starbucks was fun depending on what members of staff were on the shop floor. The store would get very busy at times which would be stressful if the wrong people were working together. I learned how to multi-task and my customer service skills also became a lot better. I did not find any part of the job hard. I enjoyed interacting with customers and hearing stories from different people that came into the store.
good,Fast pace which was great. Learned a lot about corporate politics as I advanced into upper management. Work/life balance does not exist for SM/ASM's. It is a great college job!
good,"I loved working in a grocery store because a lot of the time when people would come in to shop after work they would come see me for their coffee; I really enjoyed having regulars who I would see all week and I would know their order already. "
good,They expect you to be able to work extra hours even if you cannot do them. Had to work on boxing day starting at 4am with no extra pay given. Therefore was getting £5:30 an hour to deal with a long que of customers at 4 in the morning on boxing day!!!!!!!!!. If the store is a franchise then you will not see any real benefits and almost always is minimum wage given to workers.
good,"union pay was low, including only $1 for overtime on holidays. Communication was poor and the respect was little. "
good,Working at Starbucks was a learning experience. A typical work day started at 4am. The hardest part about the job would be that almost every day it seemed as if we were understaffed.
good,"Each position on a Starbucks team required multitasking and a positive attitude.  "
good,"A typical day at work can be fun, unless you are in the middle of a rush and all they want you to do is produce sells and make window times in the drive thru low. It begins to feel like it is more of a fast food industry. In my store it is said to make connections with customers and make them feel welcomed but then we are almost shamed for talking or moving too slow for the drive thru times. I have learned how to multi task and develop great customer service skills from this job. The bonds that form with your coworkers are very strong. When you work with a certain crew all the time things begin to flow smoothly. I have formed life long friends from this employment. It depends on the manager you have but you can have a manager who is heavily involved with growth of the team or one who sits in the back and is more interested in numbers. Clean and safety standards are easy to adhere if you allow for the routine to form. Making drinks is easy once you learn the routines as well."
good,"I devoted 4 years to Starbucks Coffee company, in that time there were many highs and lows. In the begining everyone was kind and friendly, but usually overworked. Eventually the employees get burnt out and leave and new baristas and shift managers  are brought in. The biggest issue is with turnover and hiring. People quit and poor leadership is brought in making this part of my experience a very sour memory."
good,"Working the tasks was fun but the management and upper level management was not supportive nor was there room to improve or step up. the environment was awesome but the attitudes of co workers were not good. so sad, for the opportunity given."
good,"Good for a part-time position while going to school, however if you don't leave time for yourself you will get taken advantage of.  Can be fun and make good friends, don't lose sight of your goals though."
good,"I like the company's mission and values, although it's chairman is disconnected from the corporate workers.  The word process is considered counter-cultural, but if you truly put people first, process is necessary to protect employees.  "
good,"As a shift supervisor, a typical day at work is anything but typical. I was lucky enough to have a great store manager and awesome Assistant Managers. One thing I learned from working here is that the Regional Managers know nothing about actually working behind the counter. The hardest part of the job is that upper management likes you better if you dedicate your life to the company and give up your social life to work. The most enjoyable parts of the job are the coworkers and regulars. "
good,You do a lot of work and get paid minimum wage. Good if you need the benefits but not good for salary unless you want to manage your own store. Environment changes with stores however managers can be a little laggy sometimes.
good,Good first job with decent pay but be mindful that it's hard to advance forward and poor management is very common for the Starbucks corporation. Meet amazing people though.
good,"A typical day at work is very stressful. You are coming onto the floor assessing the current situation of the store, where you are on the sales goal along with the prep and clean up work for the next day. Typically there is always some form of catch up work you're juggling between what your actual role is for your shift. This is in part due to the poor management at some of the stores. Work place culture between baristas is a general comradery and and dislike towards poor shift leads and managers. The hardest part of the job is always remaining in panic mode internally while expressing a serene face to the customer in the midst of the chaos behind the bar. The most enjoyable part of the job though is also the constant chaos because it makes for a very fast paced environment where anything can and will happen. Which allows for an interesting day and also interesting stories to share with customers that become regulars. What I learned from working in this environment is great time management skills and how to prioritize tasks due to importance along with great customer service skills and how to deescalate a situation that has gotten out of hand due to miscommunication and make it right."
good,My responsibilities consist of providing customers with a welcoming smile and encouraging their desires. Starbucks can be very stressful especially if your location typically is a tourists attraction. The pace is almost always high speed and demands fast thinking and problem solving skills.
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work if you are looking for a flexible part-time job and will not be completely reliant on your paycheck for living expenses. Those who wish to advance into store management by way of becoming an assistant store manager are often given the runaround and told they will advance much sooner than they actually will, if it even happens. As a result, partners who have been there for years remain in a stagnant role, and the performance reviews that once led to pay raises no longer exist. The benefits are great if you are working there just to obtain them, but your typical paycheck as an hourly retail worker will seem dismal every two weeks and you could get a much easier job somewhere else for similar pay."
good,"They have great amenities like standing desks, laptops and not desktops, fair cooling and the views are great.  The food offered is good but pricey however food trucks are always an option being that they park outside the building.  However if you are the type of person that likes to be known you will probably not like to work here.  The culture is all about LGBT rights and if you are other than that you are not welcome to express your beliefs for fear of getting fired.  Parking is also a HUGE problem!"
good,"I can speak harshly of the company having worked through its two most recent transitional periods, and graduating with ASU. Now the benefits at Starbucks are amazing absolutely, However, your pay is so atrociously low, that you'll never be able to afford them.The Management is not good as a rule, there are good ones(Store Managers) but they are the exception, and I have yet to meet a District manager any likes."
good,Good place to work if you never get upset or have a bad day. Definitely not as much drama here like I've seen at past work places but still very stressful.
good,Okay to work at. They try and take good care of their employees. getting payed minimum wage would be okay in less coastal and urban places. but in california it is not enough to live on.
good,Preparing all the essential materials for the daily operations. Making quality standard drinks in a timely fashion. Working as a team to ensure customer satisfaction. Maintaining a cleanly environment. Training the new partner's in daily routines and Starbucks standards while keeping a friendly demeanor.
good,it was a good first real job but i wouldn't do it for the long run. you don't get paid enough for always being shirt staffed and over worked and my manager was not someone i would EVERRRR work under again.
good,Joined as an assistant with the promise of promotion within 6 months but have yet to see any movement. Asked for a transfer to a store closer to home and was moved further away.
good,"C+ place to work"
good,"When the shop was owned by the Starbucks company the job was very enjoyable. Sadly our store was bought out and became a franchise store, the new ownership cared more about small profit increases than it did about delivering a high standard of customer service"
good,the job was a lot of work. too much work at times. my manager at the time wasn't on top of making sure the place was actually clean. so often time the employees would get stuck with extra work to do.
good,Working for Starbucks is like living in an alternate universe where the rest of the galaxy and your life revolves around the Company. It can be beneficial and fun or alternately hellish depending on your store manager.
good,"No matter how hard you work for them, you're probably not getting promoted unless several people quit or die. No praise or positivity form management, only nitpicking and lies."
good,"It was a decent enough part-time job. I loved the job itself and the customers, it's the management that really ruined the overall experience for me. Hours were fairly flexible, and the wage was fine for what it was."
good,Press buttons on the machine. Follow the drink algorithm and smile. Crazy cult-like culture among employees and customers. Front line workers kiss management butts hoping to one day join management. I was employee of the quarter and was laid off before my T-Shirt was printed.
good,"Some of the shifts are bias bully's and mean, coworkers are some of the best people I'll ever meet maybe two shifts that are amazing perfect regulars, also shifts try to implement rules but are hypocritical toward"
good,"This Starbucks was contracted out through Aramark; I would never work for them again. Thy do not really care about their employees, the only reason I stayed as long as I did was being of the actual staff I worked with."
good,"I have had a few complaints during my time with the company. A lot has changed in recent years and I am not sure it is for the best. We are required to do so much and often without proper training or pay compensation. It becomes stressful and when moving up seems impossible partners get discouraged and leave. Currently, I am having trouble getting managers to call me back regarding a transfer due to moving out of state. My future with Starbucks may end due to stores not wanting to take me on as a transfer. Things just seem more difficult than they should and than what you would expect for a company like Starbucks."
good,The customers that I would see everyday were such nice people. I got to know them very well and enjoyed our interactions. Learning to make Lattes and Cappuccinos was fun.
good,"As far as minimum wage jobs go, this is one of the better ones. I would definitely consider this a fast food job however. There is a lot of stress that comes with working at Starbucks."
good,This was actually a Licensed SBUX inside a Randalls. Randalls Management were not very professional. Starbucks side of the house was great. Randalls thinks about  only their side of the house and interfered with Starbucks operations.
good,"I enjoyed working at Starbucks, I think if the store manager were better with his employees the experience would have been much better.  I do think that baristas are underpaid and deserve better compensation. But the other team members were awesome and great to work with. I love Starbucks as a company and think they are a wonderful company to work for."
good,"I worked at two starbucks locations. Both were fun to work at, my co-workers for the most part were great but management was not. Were not flexible with scheduling as I am a student. Very unpleasant to talk to as well when you had an issue that needed resolving. But overall I loved working with everyone and enjoyed serving customers the best product that I could provide for them."
good,"This was a fun work place and I enjoyed the customers and the associates.How to use the machines correctly and efficiently was a challenge at first and my manager had very creative way of teaching. I was challenged, I met & surpassed every challenge. One of the practices this company does that is giving back to the community."
good,"Even with doing what you're told and what is expected I found myself getting yelled at a lot, management needed some more structured leadership. Nighttime staff very supportive and understanding, learned to work in a fast paced, pressure filled environment and handle it."
good,"Rotating schedule."
good,"Working at this job was wishy washy. One day things would go so smooth, and then the next day it would go really bad. management was the worst i ever experienced."
good,"I have enjoyed working for Starbucks, but it can be hard to move forward in this company if you do not have a manager that wants to help you. The people you work with are great, it is a team environment and the company does many good things for their employees. The days can be extremely busy or insanely slow, but there is always something to do. Coffee tastings in our store are frequent, but that's not the case in all stores. The hard part is that if you want to move up in the company your manager has to help you, which can be difficult when your manager does not want you to leave their store.  In my experience in working for Starbucks for over seven years now, it seems to really depend on your manager's motivation to move you forward on top of what they are already doing. I had been very motivated to move forward in the beginning, but the longer it took the less interest I had. I will say the most enjoyable part of working for Starbucks is the friendships you form with coworkers and customers. The downside is moving up and the pay isn't a living wage."
good,"You need to come up through the stores to be successful at Starbucks, period.  Processes are non-existent, and instead of giving, the company takes away - i.e. because Vancouver does not recognize Boxing Day, and Toronto does, and Vancouver recognizes Civic Holiday and in toronto it's not a stat, they have taken Boxing Day away from Vancouver as a holiday and August civic holiday for Ontario.  Benefits are great if you are a barista, but as a manager in the office, not competitive.  you must be passionate about coffee and the values, otherwise you will get called out.  You cannot be authentic unless Starbucks values are your default values.  Not an easy organization to maneuver, and the organization has no interest in fixing it, but now they admit it.  Not an easy place to come in externally and unless you assimilate, you will not be successful - the organization admits they have high turnover in external hires.  Start in stores, work up, and you will be successful at Starbucks."
good,"Empresa com oportunidades de aprendizado, visão de qualidade somente ao cliente."
good,"The most enjoyable part of working for this company was being able to interact with people and actually make there day with just a cup of coffee! Teaches you a lot of patience and to have great costumer service! The hardest part for working with this company was the poor management, there were all always on different pages and not knowing what was going on."
good,"A typical day starts at 4am prepping machines, sorting food, brewing coffee, and cleaning. The rest of the day is spent cooking, cleaning, and crafting drinks. It is highly labor intensive, as all workers most dedicate strict attention to duties while maintaining a pleasant demeanour. Typically the exhaustion, and constant demand of customers, can effect the work atmosphere causing misunderstandings between co workers.  The difficulty of maintaining a charming persona, with high paced work, and meeting the employers expectations is the hardest part of the job. Most employees will tell you the only reason they work for Starbucks is for benefits."
good,"A great first job for high school and college students, not a great job for advancement. Fun perks, while focusing on the customers needs and wants and catering to those needs on an individual to individual basis"
good,A job built for teenagers and young adults trying to make extra spare money. Not a job secured for a good wage. Enjoyed working here until the work load was no longer fair and the money was not even close to enough. You will need two jobs. You WILL live pay check to pay check. Look elsewhere.
good,"This job did not work well with everyone, the management frequently calls in and gets upset when others can't cover their shift. Favorites were chosen and people weren't treated very equally. Besides that the job was very easy."
good,This job is hard and you are underpaid. The CEO believes in great things for his workers. The problems and pace of work is not worth the compensation that starbucks provides.
good,Poor management personal when it come down to getting the training needed to be successful at doing your job and very much out dated equipment's broke
good,"ireland . there is no beneficius , low rate salary for managers . "
good,"I absolutely loved working for this company. However, we received a new manager this past summer and everything started out okay, but turned sour the last month or so. Hours were cut, staffing was terrible, morale was at new low and when working one specific day, we were unable to even get our allotted 10 minute break because there were not enough employees to cover the floor. When it becomes too stressful to even enjoy one moment of your job, you have to walk away. I even had spoken to the manager on a couple of occasions about how we need extra help during certain hours and he pretty much went by what corporate was making him do and completely disregard what his employees needed. I love and adore my former fellow coworkers and it hurt me more to let them down by walking away."
good,Great place to work if it's not in a Safeway or frys cause then it's horrible. Love seeing the regulars and making everyone there drinks. If it was its own standing Starbucks it would be great
good,"Typical Day - Preparing stock for the store, restocking, cleaning, bar work, cafe and learning new recipes. "
good,"This is a typical retail job. As a Store Manager the hours are very long, typically 70+ hours a week with a lot of pressure to do more with less. The local DMs want you to hire part time only and schedule 4 hour shifts. "
good,"Staff is overworked and under compensated. "
good,"Very tiring job, you have to give ample availability to get hours of work. Lots of standing on your feet, moving around and fast-paced environment. Great customer service experience but very physical and demanding job."
good,"You shouldn't even be able to put a review for management. Management is ran by a person who is still a child himself. The store doesn't seem to care about how he manages the store, let alone how the management doesn't seem to care about health codes. "
good,Have been working for the company for almost 3 years and I have been passed up for promotion at least 4 times and receiving a raise of $.20 per year for a cost of living raise each year.
good,"Best part and worst part can be the same thing: Customers. "
good,very competitive pace and you have to be ready to give it 110% every shift. Depending on the store your skill set will be developed accordingly
good,"being assigned as cashier and barista in this kind of location is quite hard because of always busy all the time but still i manage to handle, enjoying what i am doing and still making sure that all of our customer was satisfied with the service we are rendering for them and with a smile on there faces before leaving our place.co workers are good, helpful and friendly. management is not giving opportunities for advancement for their employees. not listening for what the employees wants..they don't have this stability of tenure techniques that's why mostly of the employees their are not staying and working for long time and that's what i don't like also."
good,"High volume stores will leave you shell-shocked during breaks and after shifts; lower volume stores see you doing a lot of unskilled labor (a lot of cleaning) - if you actually care about the work."
good,"loved this job was great working here, when busy it was still a great environment. the staff were lovely and easy to get along with."
good,"I work under contract, however Starbucks is very stingy about granting full ""partnership"", and even more stingy regarding advancement. The system access is prohibitively partitioned, and it's hard to exhibit personal skills. Employees are cold and cliquey, managers are distant and difficult to interact with."
good,"Great place to work, love the environment of a coffee shop and my role as a barista/shift leader, however at the licensed store I worked at, management was terrible. Always short staffed,ran out of product regularly, unprofessional,  lack of functional equipment etc."
good,"Average day of work consisted of tons of prep work, cleaning and a lot of cleaning and behind the scenes type of work. Only after all that can you help customers. store manager was great. other managers had different ways of completing daily tasks, which is very confusing."
good,"Starbucks offers amazing benefits and development tracks. However, the daily routines and poor choices of leadership do not allow for the intended culture or routines to prevail. Because of the corporate structure and requirements there is little to no accountability and problem partners grow in power and numbers.  In the end, its a game of seniority and politics and the money does not equal the stress.  The best way to view working at Starbucks is as a pivot point for career progress.  They offer benefits at 20 hours a week and will cater to most schedules.  If looking for advancement within, get ready to wait and remember to ""not take anything personally."""
good,"Totally underpaid for the amount of work you truly do.  I wish more people understood how difficult these jobs can be.  Also for me the management was not great especially when I tried to work multiple jobs.  They did not work with me on my schedule, which my other job did."
good,Starbucks is overall a good company to work for. If you are a barista and looking to just make a paycheck and build relationships with other baristas and customers this is a great job. If you are looking to move up in the company Minnesota is not the market to do this in. Every store is different. Each store is not comparable each other.
good,"The company is amazing to for, I worked in a Target owned one so the benefits weren't there and we couldn't accept tips. There was not many of us working which became stressful."
good,"Working at Starbucks was fun and super productive. You were busy at all times. The constant traffic made the days easier and go by  mush faster. "
good,Can be a great company to work for if you find a well run store. The environment has it's moments. Things are always changing so if you like change this is a good company to work for.
good,Very structured and professional dealership environment.  The management was like family but still corporate owned so very controlled.
good,"Popping up on every corner, Starbucks is an iconic part of our culture. There are fairly decent benefits included when you work 20hr/week+, and good stocks available. Depending on the location, the employee turnover rate seems consistent, so we're always hiring new partners."
good,"In my ten years with this company I have learned about working within different regions of the country for the same company, to multitask in a face paced environment, conflict resolution, and how a company runs from a field perspective"
good,The job itself was not that bad but the supervisors and manager were unprofessional in many ways. One way is that they would at times show up really late for their shifts especially at important times like opening the store. The attitudes of some were very immature and childish. Inappropriate comments were made in a joking kind of manner made by the shift supervisors. Another thing I noticed more at Starbucks then at any other place I've worked at is there was a lot of gossiping going around continuously about different people on the team. The manager was way too young considering she didn't handle  various situations very well and also ignored some complaints made by other employees about some employees or just a single one.
good,"Starbucks is bright and shiny on the outside, serving fraps and iced lattes to all the people who can drink them. but for the barista it's different. the demand for drinks is often higher than one barista can cover efficiently, especially during deal days. And being that Starbucks amazingly manages to consistently charge their customers more than a gallon of milk would cost alone for something even as simple as a vanilla steamer.(12 ounces of steamed milk and 3 pumps of vanilla flavored syrup). they still cant pay the baristas enough to survive on their own. they hide behind their benefits and free college but the benefits are too expensive for it to be beneficial as a barista to pay into. And college only helps those who can attend ASU for their major. bottom line is they would be a great company if they just paid us enough to survive."
good,"Being a Barista for a short amount of time, I grew to love the atmosphere, but due to the lack of flexibility in schedule and the irresponsibility of my coworkers to show up on time, I ended up working more than 35+ hours per week as a part time employee, while being a full time college student. The management was poor and we were often in trouble with the health department for cleanliness problems."
good,"Great part time job, nothing to start a career in. Starbucks is a great place to learn more about working with a team and of course the coffee culture. Hardest part of the job is multi-tasking."
good,"There was no typical day at work. "
good,"I decided to give Starbucks another chance because at the previous location I've worked, the management wasn't quite up to par. I found myself being promised many things at this new location, but hardly any of these promises came to fruition. I did like most of my co-workers, but the supervisors, store manager and even district managers were very unprofessional."
good,Good company for young people with fair pay and benefits for the work you do. Management is strict and the company standards can be unreasonable at times though. The hours can be demanding too.
good,"The job swings like a pendulum and lacks any real consistency with hours or workload. Unless you are a manager or assistant manager, there is very little a supervisor can do to hold someone accountable for any behavioral problems."
good,very busy. alone for a long period of time so things can get crazy
good,"Loved the work each day. "
good,You work hard but may not be acknowledged. The raises aren't much (20% of your wage). I as a single mother need more.
good,"Operate cash handling procedures and knowledge of computerized cash register systems."
good,Taking orders and making drinks for customers. Easy fun job
good,Used to be a place you would love to work for. No job security and lack of communication
good,"A typical day: making drinks, food and cleaning the store."
good,"If it wasn't for the manager, I would have liked this job much more. The perks to working for Starbucks was great and they do appreciate their employees."
good,"Starbucks is usually very busy. People are always in line to buy their coffee. I got along with my co-workers very well. The hardest part of my job was trying to calm the crowd. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to talk with all the customers. It is amazing what serving coffee can do to help them out, and make them talk."
good,"beau concept, j'ai appris beaucoup de choses et découvert d'autres univers du café."
good,"I did enjoy my time at Starbucks. They helped me gain skills and allowed me to meet new people everyday of the week."
good,it was always busy. management was like never there and people were always getting let go and brought in.
good,"Come in a 6 complete opening tasks"
good,"Most of the nation has the misinterpretation that Starbucks has great benefits, and pay. I have not experienced that. I work in one of the best environments I have ever been exposed to, and receive support and development from peers and superiors. I did have to transfer stores for this to happen. I do believe upper management (corporate) has a different view of what is going on in stores that what actually happens, and dysfunction happens at a district and store manager level. Over the past four years the company has brought in many outside highers for store manager positions, and this has greatly affected the environments that partners are working under, leading to almost 100% turnover in the past 12 months."
good,"A typical day at work for me would be to arrive a 4am and set all of the brewers, make sure espresso bar is all set to go and filled with beans. Set up the pastry case, make sure everything is wiped down and all set for the day when I was there they were having a hard time with managers and trying to force one out and she wasn't very pleasant to say the least. I loved my co workers, some of them are still my best friends till this day! The hardest part of the job was honestly dealing with the management decisions"
good,"Starbucks was a good company to work for and they offered great benefits but their pay wasn't very good. A typical day at Starbucks consist of helping customers by taking their orders, making their drinks, heating their food and serving them all in a timely manner . There are also a number of cleaning tasks to complete, making sure the store is nice and tidy. While working at Starbucks I learned all the drink recipes, how to perform all the cleaning tasks, how to properly run the store, time management, proper cash handling procedures (counting registers, doing the deposit, and managing the safe) and how to lead my crew. Management was okay, they all have a different style they bring to the table, some better than others. I had a lot of fun working with my co-workers, we had great chemistry. The hardest part at Starbucks was running a store short handed while in the middle of a rush during peak hours. The part I enjoyed most was the connection I developed with my customers."
good,There were a lot of disagreements and people who did not follow what they were supposed to do which bothered me. Otherwise I really enjoyed the customer service aspects and a lot of the people I met were great. It was a fast paced job that required organization. I love coffee and I love customer service so it was a pretty good job for the most part.
good,regular customer service job. typical work day. company  provides good healthcare benefits.
good,"Very busy"
good,Bad management but the other people there were great. It is a high stress and fast pace work environment. 
good,My review of starbuck as an overall company is well rounded. I believe that the job within itself can help a person grow as far as retail and customer service but I wouldnt be a job that you would base your career on unless you were looking to become a store manager
good,"Fast paced, multi tasking and customer involvement."
good,"Speak with customer , offering a high standard of customer service,"
good,"A typical day would involve opening the store, do a opening balance of cash in the safe, ordering products, prepare deposit. Take customers' orders, custom make drinks."
good,"I learned that no matter how fast you work to acheive the pick metric, management will always want to beat yesterdays numbers, with the same amount of people working and a greater workload."
good,A typical day at work is to stand on till for 8 hours and take customer orders. Occasionally making coffee as I am a new starter.
good,"Good job for students, but promises of advancement go unfulfilled."
good,It’s ok but not really a path for growth. Little development happens here. It’s a cool place to work mainly due to friendships that are made. Tuition reimbursement is nice too
good,"Lavoro molto semplice per chi ha idee ben chiare e definite lo consiglio a chi studia come inizio carriera"
good,"You will be put under pressure constantly"
good,"I honestly LOVE working at Starbucks. The drinks are fun for me to make, and recipes are easy for me to memorize! The workflow of an average day allows me to get into a working rhythm, where I feel comfortable and productive. The hardest part of this job is, honestly, messing up. There have been days where it feels like I'm not allowed to be human. I was spoken to regarding my lack of consistent cheer and upkeep at work, and rather than ask how I've been (as has been done with past employees), I was sat down and told that my performance has been disappointing. There are few things more HURTFUL than being told you're doing a poor job when you're already not in a mentally sound place. Starbucks prides itself on taking care of employees; making them feel welcome and able to give their 100% best. I just haven't been feeling that way lately..."
good,"-Organization has failed to support store managers by allocating enough administrative time to conduct their work - a budget of less than 20 hours is allotted.  Terrible."
good,"A lot is expected of you. We are constantly understaffed which means if everyone isn’t working hard, or someone is new, it gets rough. Customers can be really rude over things out of your control. We are told to make everyone feel included, yet most people still judge the homeless and the addicts that come in. We are expected to be security guards while also providing perfect service. I love the people I work with, but the expectations can be unrealistic"
good,"Benefits are amazing if you’re able to stick around long enough to qualify for them."
good,"Very low pay for high stress environment, with corporate constantly pushing higher numbers while providing little in terms of team support. Hours are irregular and can be cut depending on the season."
good,"Being familiar with this company for decades I expected more out of this job. From plastic waste to food quality I am disappointed. I am struggling with workload, low pay, and regularly being left low staffed while making sure customers are blissful."
good,"Dependiendo de la tienda, los días puedes ser muy ocupados, hay muchos clientes muy groseros que se sienten en el derecho de tratarte mal por pagar un café de 4mil pesos. Lo que más rescato, es el equipo en el que trabajé, muy amables y cariñosos. La gerencia, muy inestable, los cambian cada cierto tiempo. No sé si la paga sea correspondiente con el trabajo realizado."
good,"I was hired, it took them a month to bring me in after being hired for training. Then once I got there, the training was spotty and disorganized. "
good,A good environment to work in and always things to do and learn. I loved working at Starbucks! The team was great and the pay was good. Customers were also great!
good,"Every store location is unique. From the diversity of the baristas to the diversity of the customers. Also, each Store Manager creates the environment for each store and the level of experience of a Store Manager varies significantly. Some stores have very inexperienced managers who are learning the retail store experience and some have very tenured managers with background in restaurant management or retail management."
good,"It’s a very attainable job, no real requirements other than being good with people. New employees are constantly being hired making it so everyone has to fight for hours, and I’ve never felt like i was getting paid fairly for the amount of work being done, especially if your in a shift or managerial position"
good,"The company as a whole is not bad. The health benefits were amazing and not very expressive. As for work life balance, unless you are a supervisor or higher, there was zero work life balance. They cared more about meet goals then health of employees. Very often making employees work 6 days a week 12 hours a day."
good,"Always under staffed, for such a busy store. "
good,"entry level job, it's okay if you're just starting out. managers didn't really understand how to manage. i didn't enjoy working there but i know tons of people that have."
good,The store was going through a lot. No set manager at the time so really just a lot of confusion and all over the place. The manager had a 100% turnover rate at the time. Everyone either transferred to other stores or quit.
good,It’s a really busy working environment which sometimes can e too much for me but overall working in a place where I can communicate with customers and do everything for them to guarantee the Starbucks experience is one I will never forget
good,I was hired while pregnant but my manager was unaware. Once she found out she gave me 16 hrs a week. When I would ask for more hours or to pick up shifts I was denied.
good,"Workplace culture is positive. If your looking for a workplace where you can grow and move up within the company, Starbucks is perfect. Job security and plenty of benefits."
good,"Being a barista is not a difficult job but, it is emotionally draining and bad for your wrists. Sbux talks big about employee benefits and does offer a good range of health benefits, but pay raises and job advancement are almost non existent. I was a partner for a little over 2 years and my pay was raised a total of 62 cents."
good,The job was okay a first. My manager would rarely ever encourage me that I was doing a good job. My co workers would act as if I was lesser every day.
good,"Management need training in how to deal with employees who are deaf and try to force skills on them when they are actively better and more suited to other aspect of running the store. Instead of trying to get employees to work on weaknesses, maybe play to their strengths and create an improved culture with the team, which obviously the customers can pick up by their reaction to customer service and mood set in the store. No customer wants to go to Starbucks (for their third place) to see disarray within the team serving the drinks, as it is awkward and negative."
good,"Not many hours or great compensation for the level of work that is asked of the employee. Working your way up is slow, team morale is somewhat low and leadership is not strong."
good,The way the store manager at the time handled the store was horrific and triggered a lot of mental stress for myself and other workers so much so that i had to quit for my own health. Workers and the training provided by other staff was amazing. NO rushing or forceful behaviours. Everything was completed at the comfortability of my pace.
good,"I have worked at two locations with Starbucks, the first far better than the second.  There are good company benefits as well as lots of opportunity for advancement. However, management is sub par, especially in Utah."
good,"I would have enjoyed this job (and stayed) if the manager at the time wasn't so mean to all of us. The environment was toxic, and she encouraged gossiping about coworkers."
good,"The only thing that kept me from wanting to continue to work with the company was the early mornings and customers that I served on the daily. Easy job to learn, but the people being served were not preferable."
good,"Management was the worst had family emergency and was told that Since I wasn’t able to cover my shift that I had to go in regardless of my family emergency. Not only that I had just put on the group message that I needed coverage for my shift due to something coming up, Then I got what seemed like an angry message from management asking specifically why I was calling off. I ended up showing up to my shift because I was afraid of my hours getting cut."
good,"Your experience at Starbucks depends almost entirely on your managers; they will singlehandedly make or break your time at work. Personally, the managers at my location were incompetent and lazy, and did a fantastic job of making me hate my work. The job itself is enjoyable assuming you enjoy interacting with people, but not worth the hassle if your manager expects you to clean up their mistakes."
good,My store in particular could never train employees on new drinks in time so our workplace was usually a disaster. Disappointed with wage considering the wealth of the company.
good,"The company was great at first,  has gone downhill over the years. They originally were very partner based but it's more about sales now and no concern for the partners"
good,Great company to work for.  They have great benefits for employees and know how to keep them engaged!  The lines can be long but you will always get through them!
good,"I loved the job but the management was terrible. They treated staff terribly. When I tried to address how staff was treated, the district manager as well as head office could care less. As well, it is next to impossible to advance from within."
good,"Good entry level Job for someone looking for a flexible work environment. Hours are good, pay is decent for a student looking for a part time job as they complete education."
good,"A typical work day would be making sure the store is clean and stocked properly, that the customers are happy with their experience. You have to be able to work under pressure"
good,"Flexible work schedule, 8 out 10 they'll give you the schedule that you asked for, just make sure you request in advance. Great for people looking for a part time job like students and whatnots."
good,"Awful treatment of employees. Only train you if they like you, drama all day in and out, toxic work environment. Worst work experience ever. There were always issues between workers and favoritism in the management department. Conflict of interest left and right. SO much trouble for such a small store."
good,"When the old manager was there the place was great, Old manager looked out for me and helped me advance into a great employee, gave me 5 days a week on the schedule. store was organized and I knew where everything was.  After he left, we got new management and she brought in one of the WORST shift supervisors and the place went downhill"
good,"The company provides amazing benefits and has a competitive salary, but the district managers and regional directors are biased and show favoritism towards people they like on a personal level or are similar to them. They are belittling, rude, unprofessional, and only care about their own advancement."
good,"Not a career job; mainly high schoolers and college students. Great discounts and good benefits for PT and FT. Many workers are poor workers, lazy, unfriendly and simply can follow directions. Consistently get yelled at for a drink taking too long (even though people see how busy we are). Training is BS, managers are not always manager quality, although I loved one of my bosses"
good,the amount of work and stress is not properly compensated for. While i was lucky to have a manager who tried her best to keep things afloat. the stress it put on her was spread to the other employees.
good,"I really did enjoy working at Starbucks, I enjoyed my coworkers I even like my manager however I was promised advancement, I was promised more hours, and as a single mother who soul he supports my son I needed those guaranteed hours and it never came past 20 hours a week and I couldn’t survive"
good,"I really never got hours. I was hired but never given any days to work, so did training, but never got placed to do work.I cannot give much information other than I never got hours."
good,"Job is quite annoying and won't allow much freedom to even talk to coworkers.  Also, no benefits or tips, at least at the location I worked.  Wouldn't recommend if looking for a higher position or better pay."
good,It was an ok job. But  the customers were all really rude and the management did a poor job of managing.  We got the hours we wanted but we were also under staffed.
good,"Not great but not terrible either. low salary for cost of living. How well the job goes depends on the luck of the manager you have, and the team you’re working with."
good,Good job for a collage student. Good coworkers. Flexible hours. The payments for insurance could be a lot lower. The coffee mark-out was nice. Discounts were not bad.
good,The company used to be much better to work for and had more room for growth. Lots of broken promises and issues with favoritism. It was very difficult for me.
good,"I wouldn't recommend Starbucks retail for anyone trying to make a living and not willing to work 50hrs/week. The benefits are good, the team works well together."
good,My location was far understaffed to the point of breaking several partners and causing quits.  Starbucks themselves does a good job offering benefits but our location struggled constantly with understaffing (on purpose to save the manager money) and overwhelming traffic.
good,"The only complaint I would say is, if you don't fit into your store, it won't be a good place to work for you. If you disagree with the company on anything, you will not be treated well."
good,"fun and friendly place to work, with ample training provided. Senior management were poor leaving stores to struggle at times. The hardest part of the job was the early starts with the store having to be ready to open at 05:30. Most enjoyable was being part of a friendly, close and happy team. Skills that were provided included health and safety training and correct methods of drink making along with background management skills such as orders and banking."
good,I worked a full time job and work this position as a secondary income.  They were not really willing to teach you step by step the processes of each drink. Often they were not understanding of my career job and its schedule.  It was enjoyable to see each customer pleased with their drink of choice.
good,"I worked there for about 6 months and it was a fast and up-beat environment which I like, it’s also a preppy environment. I’m more laid back and country themed (don’t really put on a whole lot of makeup and don’t mind getting a bit dirty) I didn’t really feel like I fit in there, and the co-workers didn’t really help me feel as if I fit in. It’s easy work, and it’s fun once you understand the drinks more, it’s just the certain people I worked with didn’t make it a pleasant experience."
good,"Starbucks was a very poor establishment. I had went in expecting a good work place, but I had poor managers and horrible working conditions. I would not recommend working there."
good,"The management in the store I worked at lacked the organizational skills to keep the employees informed. The schedule was irregular and inconsistently given. Employees were not trained properly and suffered because of it. "
good,"This is a great ""first"" job, given you are willing to work hard and create a strong work ethic that multi-tasks and holds a stellar customer service attitude."
good,"It was a great place to learn how to train and coach staff, build your business acumen, and fine tune organizational skills. Outside of that you will be working physically and mentally all of the time. Over the years I saw too many managers go on stress leaves for 3+ months at a time. "
good,Some of the employees here at Starbucks are very rude and disrespectful  and I would approach the Manager or Supervisor about the issue nothing wasn't being done.
good,"A typical day at work was understaffed and it frequently felt like I was rushing to be in a sorority. It felt like you were being hazed everyday until people accepted you and felt like you could do your job well. I learned a lot of life skills like how to deal with difficult people and work in a group setting, but it wasn't worth it. The management at my specific branch remained terrible and was generally a huge gossip pool. The workplace culture felt like a million different cliques and it didn't feel good being a part of any of them, but if you weren't, you were outcasted. Much like high school, but maybe that's because the majority of the people I worked with were IN high school and some acted as if they never left high school. It was hard keeping up with the pace, and dealing with the constant drama that should have been left outside of work made the job even harder mentally and physically. The best part was likely the benefits and the friends I made."
good,"I was on the morning shift, so the floor was the most hectic place on the face of the planet for 3-4 hours every morning.  This being after you woke up at 3 am.   More often than not how the day went almost entirely depended upon who was working with you.  If you got along well with the other partners, then even if the customers were being a nightmare, it would still be a relatively good day.  It's not a job I would recommend to anyone who does not play nicely with others.  You are up close and personal with several people throughout the course of your shift, and most days you do not get to step off the floor for more than a 10 minute break until your shift ends."
good,"Like with most jobs it completely depends who you're working with. I mainly worked with a great team however above my store manager were some not so great people. My manager was treated very poorly despite the clear improvement of the store since their arrival-even customers commented when they left how much of a difference they made and how sad they are to see them go. "
good,I very much loved the culture and the people I worked with on a daily basis. Compensation lags in comparison with peer companies and position growth from within seemed inconsistent.
good,"Workplace culture: The public sees a happy go lucky persona, a team who is always smiling, etc."
good,"The people I worked with were great, but the store manager was the worst I have had in 16 years in the industry. I loved the fast paced environment, and the free coffee each week.Did not pay a living wage."
good,I have a good manager and good working partners. Flexsible working time and get a lot of experiance in food and beverage work. Making new friends and team.
good,"Overall the store/district I got hired into was amazing.  Clean, quick, training and my team members were wonderful.The location was super busy and located in a Ski resort town. I would go back in a heartbeat.  My last store/district with the company was a complete joke. Also super busy but dirty, petty and not a good working environment. Constant calling in, the manager was never around, ran by wolves."
good,"Had previous experience as a lifeguard instructor so people struggling to make drinks and privileged people demanding very specific complex drinks in a timely fashion, wasn’t worth it for ME. But someone in High school, sure"
good,"Pros:"
good,"Starbucks is a great palce to work at for students. Flexability works well and partners can cover from differenct locations. On the managment team it gets a bit differennt. This is just my experince. "
good,"A typical day at starbucks was quite simple. I would get there and made sure the kiosk was clean, empty the trash out, make sure the coffee was fresh every 30 minutes, and learned how to make new drinks on a daily basis. The hardest part of the job was when the customers would order a new or extremely difficult drink and I would have to make their drink to their liking while also not trying to hold up the line."
good,Çok az maaşla cok is yapmaya hazır olun. Kurumsal firma sartlari iyidir diye dusunmeyin. Barista olarak asgari ücret ve yemek parasi aliyorsunuz. Bu maaş asgari ucret artarsa artar. Siz orda 1 yil calissaniz da yeni girenle ayni parayı alıyorsunuz. Ekip iyiyse eğlenceli bir iş tavi yoğunluktan konusabilirseniz.
good,"The coworkers with the  (exception of some) were great but management needed work. The manager I had, made the whole store uncomfortable and some of the female customers too. But I hear he’s gone now."
good,Use this place as a stepping stone and run like the wind. They don't care about you. they pretend they promote from within but within this district at least they do not.
good,"I enjoyed working at Starbucks as I liked the people I worked with and the hours weren't particularly late. It was a fun place to work but could sometimes be overwhelming with new managers every few months or being turned into a franchise without the staff knowing, losing certain benefits that we had."
good,"Although this was a fun job, working graveyard was tough. Most people don't want coffee in the middle of the night. So there was a lot of down time, which was bittersweet. Making the drinks was fun. No manager or supervisor was there for graveyard, so you're out of luck if you run into a problem. However, there weren't really any major problems happening in the middle of the night. It was a fine job, but you'd probably have more fun working in the day."
good,"After being with the company for nearly 2 years, it was a great company in theory to work for, sadly the Louisiana portion is left unattended or supported by major corporate."
good,Easy money and nice environment if you like coffee. Not all to exciting or hard work. So if your into that it’s the job for you. The Starbucks in Safeway lacks hours where I work
good,"The job started out on a high note, then it got worse for me. Never really felt safe in two of the three locations i worked at, EXTREMELY WASTEFUL practices, etc."
good,"As a barista it’s fun, It’s little hectic and anxiety causing if you’re at a busy store, but practice makes perfect!  As a shift supervisor, it wasn’t worth it, but that was my experience with a manager that wasn’t fond of promoting from within. I will say it provided excellent customer service experience, and a great range of health benefits!"
good,"SCC (corporate) is out of touch of how a store actually operates, with decisions made without common sense and without regards to store and it’s partners. Never enough hours given for stores to run smoothly, time for appropriate training while continually expecting more from partners without adequate compensation. Just another corporate retail culture that is more focused on profit and stock performance than the partners on the front lines in the stores."
good,"Extreme Hours and terrible location...no more to tell....Why do these surveys always need you to elaborate furthur, in most cases less is more...blah,blah,blah,blah,blah,blah,blah"
good,"Inspire and nurture the human spirit. That's the Starbucks mission. My DM didn't do that for me or the peers I was connected to. He would ask me to do things that he didn't practice himself. Example: ""Make sure you know how your partners are doing"", that was a company focus that he made sure to repeat but never asked me how I was doing. Literally never asked. My last two months I had the highest customer service ratings in our district, he didn't mention them to me until I said something to him. In that time frame he did mention that one of my signs was not quite level. He was so concerned about ""doing the check marks as a DM"" that he didn't inspire me to be better, he lead with the stick rather than a carrot."
good,"Working at Starbucks, I felt like the coffee was more important than me as an employee. During my training, the company emphasized how important its partners were. However, I didn't feel that at my location."
good,"I started working at Starbucks and within a week I was offered an assistant manager position to which I accepted. The raise offered wasnt very great but I just wanted the experience under my belt. I personally didnt like the job very much, learned a lot about coffee which is knowledge I could share with my peers at parties(no real world application). Felt very mundane to me and I worked horribly long hours due to being assistant manager. Everyone(including myself) who worked there were all still in high school(lots of drama and shift skippers). No discounts or perks. Although I am quite mature for my age it was hard for me to be the only one taking the job seriously. Customers are quite aggressive in this industry the tiniest mistake and they start losing it barely give you a chance to rectify any issues. I did work at one of those kiosks inside of a Safeway mind you. So actual stores may run differently. left the job due to moving to a different province."
good,I like working for the company and hopefully I can progress into a management position. I also want to take advantage of the school program that is available.
good,"Management compensation sucks, though. Pay is not enough for any position, especially with the amount of work expected to do. Upper levels really have no clue about what the store-level employees deal with."
good,"My manager was erratic, moody and promoted cattiness, so my experience was more like high school all over again. The customers made it great, and I was and still am a huge fan of the products, so it made it bearable. But seriously, some people should not lead. Period."
good,"I worked for this company for about 4 years. Was strung along on promises for a promotion for 3 of those years. Worked myself to the bone, ended up creating health problems for myself trying to keep up with their demanding schedules and expectations, and was literally laughed at when I finally said it was either a promotion or I resign. Went back to the company a year later and the aforementioned injury acted up so badly I had to resign. My final paycheck was “lost” and nobody, not the store manager or the supervisors, were willing to help me find it. Had to call corporate myself and received it two weeks later then was scheduled. Their benefits are awesome, but I don’t know if it’s worth the personal sacrifice of your own mental and physical health."
good,"I used to truly enjoy this job, but like all jobs there is just too much drama and the management could have been better. It was very nice at first because I got a lot more benefits than I did with my other jobs, but it just wasn’t what I wanted to do anymore."
good,"Starbucks was chaotic and poorly managed. typical day at work consisted of making coffee, stocking, cleaning everything in sight. Hardest part of the job was working super late."
good,"Schwaches Gehalt für diesen Arbeitsaufwand "
good,"I worked for Starbucks for 2 years. I started at $8 and when I was moved up to a Supervisor I only made $9.25. My store was small but it was the busiest one in the district, I never saw my district manager, my store manager only worked in the morning. There were 5 Supervisors on the team and I was the only one who could close, everyone else was schedule in the morning shifts which left me with all the daily duties to report out as well as lead a team and ensure the store maintained its cleanliness, I loved the people that I worked with during the evening time, but there is a divide between the ""openers"" and ""closers"". I wanted to become an assistant manager but I never got to see my store manager or assistant manager, there was usually 4 members of management in the morning and then myself from 2pm-12am. My days off were usually Tuesday and Thursday, I never received any pay raises aside from the one I got when I was promoted, as well I never received any paid time off or sick days, even after 2 years I never received a vacation. I wish Starbucks treated is employees the way it expects us to treat customers."
good,"Starbucks was great, I left because poor management. The Starbucks company is tolerant to its employees which is nice. The management was going through changes during my time at Starbucks and this caused inefficiency"
good,"Terrible supervisors. Supervisors are way over their heads. They think they are the queens of the cafe. Underpaid and overworked here. You will only meet a few great people. This is only best for part-time due to flexibility of schedule. Depending on the branch, you won't even get a bit of free food from where you work. Terrible stinginess. Stay away from Bay St Starbucks"
good,"Great first job for a teenager,it's not good for someone who likes and wants stability.I loved the opportunity of learning so many drinks, I met some great girls."
good,"Working for Starbucks was both a good and a bad thing, it was good because it was my first job, which gave me much of the experience in regards to how jobs worked in general but was very bad in the way of management and coworker relations."
good,It is a Very good job but very expensive for the clothes to be dress code formal and bad management. The manager is horrible and is very fake. Will talk bad about you to orher supervisors
good,"often understaffed, can't take sick days without leaving the rest of the team at the store hanging. career advancement limited to supervisory and store management. would be nice to have advancement within the corporate field of the company. great benefits - stock, 401k, tuition reimbursement, health insurance - even for part time employees. this keeps many employees there, but the pay is not good enough to keep many others with the company. the customer seems to be put first and foremost, far before even the most tenured employee."
good,when i used to work at Starbucks it was very much up to scratch as it only just opened in loughborough but as time went by it started getting very difficult to actually work there with some of the staff etc Management
good,"Unlimited drinks while you're on the clock which is great. The job is stressful and moving all day takes its toll. I have a lot of back and knee problems now but can't do anything about it cuz it's not technically and on the job injury. Baristas honestly aren't paid enough. "
good,"The best thing I can say about working at Starbucks is that it is great for someone that needs a job with benefits. They do give good benefits (even if they are slowly removing them) and the pay is slightly better than minimum wage. But it's just not worth the stress or the dehumanizing feeling that the majority of customers sling your way when all you're trying to do is be helpful and nice. Demands from higher up the corporate ladder show a complete lack of understanding about what the day-to-day job is like and often include ridiculous rules or policy changes that do nothing but further complicate things. With how fast-paced and high-pressure the job is, the pay does not reflect that at all. I get that it is a low-skill job, but part of the reason I only worked part time was because I got benefits for part time work, and the pay would not have even made me enough to support myself if I had worked full time! It's a good place to work TEMPORARILY, but get out as soon as you can. They do not care about you no matter what they say."
good,"Great pay & benefits"
good,"Like many jobs, the quality of experience you have at Starbucks is entirely tied to the quality of the manager you have. Bad managers make for unmotivated employees and a bad work environment."
good,"Everything is a facade to showcase a false image to the public.  It is challenging to express yourself without it going under the radar.  This business is dishonest, deceitful, and if you have a different opinion it will be used against you.  Mob mentality is real.  Turn over is high and will continue to be if leadership does nothing to defend their managers."
good,its very fast paced at starbucks so time goes by fast working at starbucks.  you get free drinks while working your shift and one free meal. learning how to do drinks takes about 2 months to be able to fully be confident enough to drinks fast.
good,"Work life balance is near impossible in a store manager role with this company."
good,"Buen ambiente alboral"
good,Hace mucho se dejó de sentir la cultura y de vivir la misión y sus valores
good,It was a fun environment but it got busy a bit you would barely notice because everybody was so help full and they would pick up where you left off it was good team work
good,Its a good first job or a great last job. But the advancment is not based on how good you are at your job. I have very mixed feelings about this place.
good,My first store was rather miserable if I am being honest. Our SM was never around and would intentionally schedule you outside of your availability. He would also schedule you on the important days you'd request off months in advance.
good,"My managers would smoke in the back of the store, come drunk, and never help close even if we were behind. The only perk was the tips and the paycheck at the end of the 2 weeks."
good,All partners  are not held to the same standards as others. Do not get reprimanded for calling out and shortening shifts. Worked for 5 years and only a Barista Trainer. It is hard to move up and they do not look at well-rounded staff when lead positions are available.
good,Although days are rough working for Starbucks my favorite part was working with everyone. Getting to know each individual and become a part of a family was awesome. You meet so many people and they become your family because sometimes you work over 40 hours a week and you just enjoy coming to work when you're surrounded by amazing people.
good,"Not a bad place to work at, but gets pretty repetitive. Everyone is kind of like a family, but workplace is just boring. There are job advancement opportunities."
good,"Long hours, decent starting pay, good benefits, excellent work relationships. This company brought me life long relationships and helped me grow as a person and employee."
good,I enjoyed working here. Cool environment. Get to grow in knowledge of coffee. Just wished they paid higher than minimum wage. Opportunities to advance at some locations. Can become a coffee master. Can get more hours unwilling to work at other stores in the area.
good,"Working at starbuck was a very stressful experience, which would have been fine, had I been compensated fairly for the work I did. I often had to juggle multiple responsibilities because of lack of coverage."
good,"Very fast paced environment to work in, all the other team members were very nice. Its a good place to learn about customer service and sales as its a massive company"
good,"Maybe my best job, but also the most stressful. If you have anxiety or depression, I do not recommend this job to you. Customers and coworkers alike will have you burnt out before you know it."
good,"Starbucks used to be all about the partners.  its more focused based and has forgotten about US.  Customers treat us like trash and we are the ones that get in trouble from it.  We have patios that has to opened no matter the weather.  However, if we get sick from being out in the rain while locking the patio we are reprimanded.  When we had a polar vortex some were still forced to work and eventually got sick. Those whom took the day off were not allowed to use sick time even though the ones that went to work got sick.  Starbucks is no longer about the partners.  Its all about making money and greed.  I used to love this company but one can definitely see the change since Howard Schultz left the company.  I'm actually surprised by the actions.  They also do not promote within the company; Store Manager and up the way they used to.  I've seen terrible ASMs and SMs external hires who eventually don't last longer than 2 years.  That time wasted could have went to someone internally who was serious and passionate about the job.  Stores across Chicago are different in the way they are ran.  There's no consistency unless its drinks. They need a company wide discipline, time and attendance program because it varies depending on how the SM feels that day."
good,"Great benefits. If you have a family and want to see them, PASS. Time away from work politics are not conducive.  Long term, hard working employees, as well as, Partners there less than a year are walked out routinely due to absences. It's truly like a revolving door. Pretty obvious leaders have their favorites that get to stand around talking with them while the rest of the partners are working. Supervisors really have no authority. Slackers welcome. It's okay. Hard workers, work. Slackers, slack. Not much done to those with no work ethic.  I was saddened to see this on the daily."
good,I did like Starbucks but it was hard to learn  how to make the different drinks. There was one Manager that real mean and rude. I did like that most of the co-workers was helpful and didn't mind helping me to learn what the do. I did like that every work the workers was able to get a free bag of coffee. I enjoyed meeting new people.
good,"a typical work day would be  welcome customers into the building and assist with questions and orders , I worked the registers front of house or drive thru . I Learned how to properly manage a cash register. The hardest part of the job is to be a multitasker &  stay fast paced ;  Every 30 minutes I brewed fresh coffee , kept my role placement neat & Clean . I gathered or prepared food as ordered. The most enjoyable part of the job is the opportunity to next work within the public."
good,Starbucks is a wonderful place to work. But the management is very poor and the wage is a bit low. But the discount is very good and they provide lunch for you and food on breaks.
good,"Flexible hours and perks for college students. If you can work on campus, even better. They are always willing to work with your school schedule. Not too stressful of a job to balance while in school."
good,"Friendly environment, fun and kind co workers. Management was poor. Almost an entire staff was fired within 3 months. If a small problem rises, that person is immediately fired."
good,The atmosphere is very fast paced so it caused stress on employees which caused tension in employees and it makes for an unpleasant work environment. Managers would have terrible attitudes due to the stress.
good,"The company offer ryou an opportunity to learn the languange when you came on first time to the UK and know the british culture, get into supervisor possition is not a long procces but if you are looking for further opportunities is quite difficult and it became too long get in a better position."
good,"Starbucks is a fast-paced and challenging job, when you walk in the door, you hit the ground running and do not stop until you clock out for your lunch or to leave for the day. "
good,if the management was less focused on make the staff into soulless script readers it could actual be quite a nice place to work. the pay is the lowest it can legally be and you never finish on time.
good,"Lack or organization, lack of communication, lack of consistency from shift to shift, inability for management to hold people accountable, limited to no back up from management when trying to council partners not pulling their weight or following rules."
good,I think it is what I learn about what the Starbucks people don't want us to really grow because of the fact that with the wages and the raises are not fair to the employees.
good,Customers can be nice and you get to know them. Making coffee and learning all about different types of coffee is fun but unfortunately management is not very good
good,"Early morning shifts typically, with a fast paced work culture to meet the needs of the customer. The management is mediocre. The culture of stores change and I did not enjoy the culture at my particular location. "
good,"working for Starbucks provided a flexible schedule that allowed me to work the hours I wanted and take time off when needed. I had a good, stable job for almost 10 years."
good,Way underpaid for the people you deal with during extremely long rushes. Staff is overworked and you are always asked to stay later if you work at a busy store.
good,"You meet a lot of great people, and it's fun to connect with all the different customers. The company its self is just straying away from its core values. It all started with the partners, now its all about the customers and sales leaving the well being of the partners aside."
good,"Good pay and benefits, but managers are the worse, and they lie about advancements.12 hour shifts and if you are new then you will be stuck on straight nighshifts. 12.5 hours because lunch isn't paid. No air conditioning and the machines are very hot so the inside is like an oven."
good,It really depends on who you work for. There are opportunities for you if you're willing to deal with the management politics. The workforce skews younger at some stores and some of the high school kids are harder to work with.
good,"As a shift lead you get underpaid for the amount of work and stress that you receive per day. Nothing is ever enough and you only get to hear complaints and demands. Only thing that you get in return, is you gain a tremendous amounts of experience for future jobs and it teaches you important business tactics. Forget about career advancements and don't waste your time on impressing anybody, keep it as a temporary job and focus on studying for your degree or certifications for a real job, you will only get constantly lied to and disappointed by the management as it is their job to encourage you by empty promises and get the most out of you until it breaks you. At the end though makes you prepared for any challenges that come your way. Choose wisely."
good,Management and the higher-ups have a hard time empathizing with employees. Can sometimes be an extremely stressful work environment. This job has taught me that If you do not have a team that is willing to work and cooperate with one another you will struggle.
good,Starbucks pays a little below average to employees but offers above average benefits.  The mission of Starbucks has been gradually shifting and changing over the last 5 years.  Starbucks began as a full-bodied cafe’ experience with the sole-intention of putting the customer first and allowing the Starbucks experience to make customers feel welcome and at home.  Starbucks has now adopted a super fast-food chain mentality which puts heavy focus on drive-thru times while still trying to maintain lofty customer service expectations.
good,"I wish that the company would focus more on the customer connection than raking in cash. Also, there is way too much waste. Do away with the live pastry cases."
good,"Revolving door, seen so many faces come and go. May be too busy to maintain good reviews /report. Too much drama for the long haul and everyone is trying to find something better. People quit before they even find something else cause it's so stressful. Mysterious skin outbreaks because of lack of cleanliness and possible ventilation."
good,"Everyday is different, some were more hectic than others but I always got along with my team. The most enjoyable part are the friendships with my coworkers. The hardest part of the job is when it is super busy and you you are understaffed."
good,"High turnover and being a flat organization made direction difficult. Everyone is required to help leading to lack of direction. Company is extremely bottom line focused vs developing a long term strategy. "
good,"Love the atmosphere and the crew, however, the part-time shift is difficult when being a student. Acquired great customer service and cash handling experience."
good,I was made to work lots of mid shifts and because of the my life and work balance were off. The job itself is also very stressful and quick paced. It takes a long time to get a hang of things there.
good,"was always asked to cover 20 mins before i was due to finish my shift, no notice at all, hardly any training was provided, always forgot to give me my break even though a break is deducted from your pay, felt bullied while i worked there too, glad i dont work there anymore"
good,You need to have a strong work ethic and accountability. It can be a challange to move up in the company depending on who your DM is. Benefits are good.
good,"Good as a first job, but is very hectic and busy. Never enough staff. Very high turn over. Had five different managers in one store over two years. I would only recommend Starbucks to someone that can handle fast-pace and stress."
good,"Job culture is great, all my regulars are awesome. But there is no room for advancement and upper management doesn't help to get you there. It's a great starter job especially for people that want to take advantage to the college tuition reimbursement."
good,"I loved coming in contact with meeting new people, the work staff was fun to work with but there was no more to grow in the company. sometimes customers were a problem when we didn't have a particular item but more the most part I loved it."
good,"The starbucks I worked at was too busy and paid too little to shift leaders. As a shift leader, I got paid nearly the same as starting pay baristas. It was not run well."
good,A fast paced environment where managers and supervisors can vary store to store on how they treat you. The pay is low for the responsibility and dedication they ask of you. Management varies store to store.
good,"tres bonnes esprits d'equipes  , malgres quelque petits sousis au debut de mon contrat .."
good,"This job is a good job for people getting on their feet, usually fresh out of college. Provides quality benefits and discounts, but management went downhill in recent months. This is not the same for all stores. Always be prepared to stand for long periods of time."
good,Directions were direct and concise. I learned how to better multitask and prioritize duties/ responsibilities. I was also able to utilize managing and critical thinking skills.
good,"miss managed, Kotic , miss managed, store was a mess with fire hazards not corrected(boxes stacked to the ceiling and storage was placed in the fire room that is supposed to be clear for the Fire Dept. incase of fire."
good,"Expectations on coffee preparation and quality of the product are understandable. Cleaning procedures that are consistent distraction from costumer needs are not understandable, and can be completed at more appropriate times."
good,"Long Hours, very hard work, not paid enough for what we do. Horrible Management. The Training is very hard, you have to know a lot of drinks, and there are a lot of roles on the job not just one."
good,"You may think just making drinks is easy, but not all the drinks sound like the name. In order to get through, you need to stay calm but at a fast pace."
good,Really needs new management. Short staffed and unfair work schedules. I have never worked in a more unprofessional environment. I do however respect Starbucks as a whole and believe that they are clean and well run in other locations.
good,"Hardest part of job is poor management, team unity and dealing with unsatisfied customers. Like I mentioned, having a good manager is super important for the store to function and for us employees to ensure customers are happy."
good,"Wonderful work environment when you have the right manager.  It is the manager and the supervisors that really control the vibe."
good,"Not for those who have a life...family/kids/spouses...hours are terrible. work life balance does not exist. Even though they say they have created a better environment for its leaders, I've watched store management swallow people whole. Becoming a store manager for this company ruined my outlook of the company as a whole."
good,Starbucks has been a good company to work for and I've learned a great deal as far as management is concerned.  There was definitely alot of trial and error as far as upper management is concerned and there in I found ways to improve upon the expected status quo.
good,multitasking and time managment are a must. staff was great to work with. environment if very stressfull but nice if you are someone who needs to be occupied.
good,I had an ok time working at Starbucks while in college. I wouldn't say I could support a family off of working there. They were flexible with my class schedule. No growth opportunity.
good,Cost cutting on labor can make the managers exhausted and the employees crabby. It is unfortunate that the first solution to any slow period is to cut hours.
good,It was a job it was fun meeting people but they sucked with the pat and they always had something against suggestions or maybe just my boss but loved the atmospheres
good,"Love the job, but theu like to hire outside before investing in who they already have. great company to build experience with, but wished they would invest in partners more, and have less of a turn-over."
good,Did not enjoy the management and the fast pace environment. On your feet all day and only get up to 40 minutes of breaks. It is a job based on rank and supervisors make that known.
good,"Twas fun until the company dumbed down the job. at one point the employees were forced to stay in their square, duct tape on the ground, for hours on end without being able to move."
good,"I am someone who would rather have fast-paced so I don’t get too bored standing around, but I would never recommend this job to someone who can’t work extremely fast under intense pressure. Coworkers will not help you at all, just yell at you when you make mistakes. Management does nothing but yell at you some more. There are a few nice people, but majority are not. I’ve seen them be nice to someone’s face and as soon as they leave start complaining. It’s ridiculous especially AT WORK. "
good,"Personal I came from office work and wanted to try something new. because I had experienced better treatment in my work life, I was surprise and disappointed how I was treated. Customers were rude and spoiled, no descent breaks, lest than 15min.  So I got out."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks for me was clocking in and going to bar and stocking the bar up with milk, syrups, and other things I may need for the day. I loved being able to learn new drinks on bar and felt when I was on bar I was able to connect with customers so much more than anywhere else because at the end of the day that is where the customer was either completely satisfied or highly dissatisfied. It was a great environment and I wish I didn't have to leave when I did."
good,"Was a high scho student and they really didn’t work with my schedule management was poor. But this was my only experience at this specific location, perhaps other locations could be different."
good,"Despite loving Starbucks, the environment has drastically changed over the past year. I am no longer happy and dread going to work. The work ethic has decreased dramatically."
good,"my advice, do your job and go home. Customers are rude over the DUMBEST things.  Never have enough staff. Never have up to date planners or equipment."
good,I enjoyed working for Starbucks. I worked for one that was on a military  base and it was always super busy for us. We had to be fast with everything  we did. The management  was poor there she kinda would pick favorites but over all I had but making drinks and talking to customers  it's a great environment.
good,"General Manager always took days off or called out sick."
good,I did not care to work at the place. It was poor pay and no advancement. Management was good but would not give opportunities to take on more responsibilities. Micromanagement environment.
good,"I worked at a Starbucks in the mall. None stop customers and manager was not the best. The pay was low and I worked long hours some days, just not worth the grind. My overall experience is poor. Although I feel this way I believe not all Starbucks are that harsh of an environment."
good,"This position is responsible for the overall success of a multi-million dollar a year store. Responsibilities include, but are not limited to the following, in no particular order: "
good,It’s an ok job. Keeps you busy. Hours suck tho. They expect so much from you on how we’re supposed to do things but they change things almost all the time.
good,"Easiest job i ever worked, Customers are the aboslute worst service experience i've ever had. Management is decent but our product suppliers for our local area fail to keep us stocked on what need."
good,"It's easy to blame my poor experience on working in high volume, but I received little to no support for my entire tenure. Management was spotty and unreliable and I often found myself in a position of acting as general manager when I certainly wasn't being paid as such. I felt I had nowhere to turn and that was inevitably why I left the company and have no plans to return."
good,Interesting work however you tend to get blamed for most things without getting much of a pay raise. Usually do jobs higher than pay grade for little appreciation. Benefits are good tho.
good,The environment was very corporate. I couldn’t display my tattoos or anything that made me an individual. I’ve visited Starbucks since I’ve worked there and thankfully it looks like they changed policy.
good,"I loved working for Starbucks in Connecticut. Management spent a lot of time and effort on developing partner's skills and positioning them for advancement. Problem was that opportunities opened up very rarely and the competition was fierce."
good,"all in all, its a doable job. not something i would refer a friend to . definitely needs a strong willed tough person to work for this company. someone with skills for problem solving in tense situations"
good,"The overall experience was horrible. I quit 2 months in. The staff was really rude to us new employees who were training. They never acknowledged that we were new employees who will take time to master such unique drinks. There was no patients from their ends. Manager was never really around, which is why employees did whatever and bossed whomever around"
good,"At the barista level the work is not difficult and the company offers decent benefits, but the demands made of those at higher levels are unfair. They expect you to be all Starbucks all the time and will drop you at any sign of wavering."
good,"Excellent benefits and training in exchange for Low pay and difficult hours. Coffee is good, but don't expect a cafe environment. Starbuck is a fast-paced corporate operation for sure"
good,I enjoyed the co-workers and formed friendships worth going hhrough my time there. I loved the work I had to do and the people I served coffee too. Building relationships with regulars was wonderful. The corporate has a great HR over the phone oto help with toxic management. Hours and pay are not great.
good,I have worked at Starbucks for about three and a half months and in my Starcbuck experiences I have been to about 4-5 stores and worked with stores I wasn’t satisfied with . In the time working in each store I noticed that a lot of them  have negative staff. The store that I had lasted worked in almost made me quit because of the way the staff was making me feel . I didn’t want to go to work and I only  worked three days the energy did match who I was and it was not a place I wanted to be AT ALL! .
good,Çok yoğun bir çalışma ortamı var vardiyalı çalışma hayatı oldugu için özel hayata pek zaman kalmıyor gecen gündüzün starbucks gibi olmaya başlıyor.Zevkli bir çalışma ortamı bulunduruyor.
good,"I had my stuff stolen from my store and nothing was done about it. I dont' have a whole lot to say other then that. I work at my school ran one, and laid back however the people who work there can be a bit groupish as well as mean at times."
good,"This job is what you make of it, and who's in charge of you. "
good,"Lots of ""fake"" people, never really was able to comfortably work with management, not a horrible job but not what I wanted. Moved locations and found it even less appealing"
good,"After coming back from maternity leave I was expected to work at least 60 hours per week, as well as change my daycare so I could come in to work at 4am."
good,Starbucks is a very faced paced work environment. It does get very hectic at times but it is also very exciting. One of my favorite things to do was being able to create new drinks.
good,"Typical day is making drinks, attending cash register, stocking and cleaning. What i learned is patience and treat customers with a smile. The work culture is ok as long as you fit into the Starbucks zombie mode. It is very team oriented and customer first driven. Ideally that is ok but coworkers sometimes make it a pain in the neck. There are tons of rules to follow and they change constantly. The most enjoyable part is getting into a work flow making drinks. The hardest part is that if your coworkers have poor work ethic, you're doomed. Lots of favoritism and butt kissing abound. I would say it is a decent first job but if you're a hard worker, get some experience and go elsewhere."
good,I worked there for almost exactly a year and I enjoyed my coworkers and the job up until my store manager was a jerk. He would make rude comments and promoted people who were able to work 40 hrs per week and that was the only requirement. The shift managers would ask me for instructions when it should have been the other way around. If the management was different I would of enjoyed it more.
good,"While it started out great, the experience quickly soured by the ruthlessness of coworkers during busy times.  Being new I couldn't keep up, and many co-workers were pretty ruthless with me, which bogged me down for the time I was there."
good,"This job was great for a busy college student that had classes to attend but as a regular job, I would not work here. It was located on campus which is why its a great starting job for college students but the management and the amount of customers you deal with and the pay suck completely here."
good,"Like any large company with 6,000+ employees at corporate HQ, your success depends greatly on your immediate manager. Starbucks corporate likes to re-org several time a year so you are constantly re-introducing skills and contribution to a new manager. If employee-centric leadership is lacking in your department, you need to find a new department because improving manager's people skills is not emphasized. If employee morale is bad, it won't change. You are best to find a new team under a different leader."
good,"I know my review varies on my experience but I was the victim of favoritism at my store. I was constantly overworked; sometimes pulling off 10 day straight work days without a single break on one of them (could have by choice but management isnt on top of it which is the point.) The pay is to low (9.75 at the time im writting this.) for the constant struggle i had to deal with. From customers constantly ringing your ear about messed up drinks at other stores to other employees not doing their job and having to do it for them only to get no credit for it and then get slandered for the effort that you tried to put in. Its a constant stressful environment that i thought would have been fun and easy to grow in going into it, i was wrong."
good,My typical day I opened the store in the morning for the 6 am rush. Then I restock all pastries and coffee needed item for the next shift that was coming in.
good,I would come in the place would be packed with rude customers the management was bad I felt I was getting paid enough and i was working part time witch is crazy but I’m on my feet 10 hours a day serving customers and sometimes Retailing.
good,Starbucks will forever be a starting job as there are many other jobs that pay better for the same amount of work. I have worked for Starbucks for at least two years and worked with all sorts of people. It is a great job for a young person or someone with nowhere else to work.
good,I did learn a lot about running a coffee shop and about supervising people but from my experience this company doesn't promote within.  They do have excellent benefits though like insurance and paid vacation.
good,A very creative non-traditional office environment.  Employees are generally keen to start their careers here.  Plenty of incentives to retain young talent.
good,"With good managment the job can be great, but with poor, the team suffers. unfortunatly my experience at starbucks was ruined do to bad managment, as well as the “your health and safety come first” but oh you actually are forced to come in regardless if you are sick/unwell etc or not. terrible system"
good,"Great job!! Good coffee benefits!!! Scheduling was hard. Alot of times I floated just to get 15hrs. "
good,"I really enjoyed working at Starbucks, I liked the environment, and the culture that Starbucks laid out. I decided to move on from Starbucks to further my career."
good,You are not paid enough for the work they have you do. You are expected to do the work of multiple people.  The insurance is good. It can be a fun work place depending on the crew.
good,"Leider wurden im Vorstellungsgespräch Versprechungen gemacht bzgl der Aufstiegschancen, die leider nie eingehalten wurden."
good,Enjoyed the atmosphere but the pay wasnt enough to live on. I enjoyed the staff and the skills I gained during my time with starbucks. I just wish they paid employees a little more considering the work load we would take on at certain times.
good,It really depends on the management and the workers that are present. There can be a lot of running around and using you to work in different areas. Raises are given but a joke.
good,They work okay with schedule with school and such but the pay is awful. Hey think they make up for it with the discount but they don't. Good for high school student or as a second job.
good,It was a fun place to work at however it is quite stressful due to being very fast paced. The pay is very little for the amount of work we do and for it being such a big company
good,"I am looking to working with you and helping your company expand world wide with my plumbing skills I will try to help you expand world wide."
good,Fellow baristas are great. I've met my best friends at work. Starting pay is minimum wage but benefits are great. Starbucks makes themselves seem like such an amazing company (and it is dont get me wrong) but there's the few managers out there that spoil it for everyone else.
good,"Starbucks was a very fast environment, there was definitely a learning curve. Customers usually weren't very nice, but coworkers become close fast because of the environment. The best part was the community that coffee offers, coworkers and boss were awesome. Worst part was the pay especially compared to other chain coffee places."
good,"The work environment isn’t good, small space/crowded. Horrible management as well as not great workers. The place is very unorganized and doesn’t have right supplies (doesn’t maintain a stock of items)."
good,"Store manager speaks to partners in a very condescending manner, can’t seem to decide which company policies this store should follow, and doesn’t stick to partners’ availability. I thought this was a great company until I met who they put in charge."
good,Customer is always first but the employees are on the back burner . No ac in the summer . Overly hot in the winter . Great atmosphere very welcoming . Customers live or work in the area so you get to form some pretty great bonds and everlasting friendships .
good,All in all Starbucks is a good place to work with decent benefits and is very suitable for those seeking a part-time job. Management does fluctuate and it can be hard to do your job at times if they too are learning all the Starbucks protocols and procedures.
good,I have worked for Starbucks altogether 8 years and  I was a very dedicated employee and loved working with the customers. I don't like the process of promotion when you have experience.
good,"Management lives in the gray area.  Political and relational ties are the only way to get where you want with this company, and work performance adds maybe 20% to the overall view of your work.  Investing in your partners is the only way to enjoy your work.  The regulars are very joyful if you invest in them also."
good,"Worked in a control room roasting coffee.  We listen to music and monitored computers.  It was long hours, shift work.  The cleanliness of this facility was questionable."
good,"The work day moved from a customer focused vision to a fast food productive vision in 2013. When I began the job, it was stressed to know your customers; once I left, I only had time to talk with customers when I was working the bar. "
good,Decent Job. I just didnt like the management at that store. Also when I got injured and needed stitches the manager was telling me to just put a bandaid over it and keep working when it was clearly bleeding badly
good,"It's a job that would be extremely enjoyable under the proper set of co-workers. Local stores have a lot of favoritism and cliques. Yearly ""raise"" was .18 cents . For the compensation you receive, your body is overworked. Great company culture, and if working with the right people an extremely enjoyable job. Just needs more filtering on the quality of staff, aswell as better pay, and better-rounded training. I didn't apply for a barista position to work on bar 2-3 times a month for 15 minutes at a time. If i wanted to be a cashier, I could've worked at the dollar tree for less hassle and grief."
good,"It seemed to me that favoritism was in place regarding promotions and how they interacted with co workers."
good,"Starbucks is a good starter job but there is little to no advancement. Hours are low and they over work and under pay. Management is fine, but very stressed."
good,"Customers can make this job amazing at some points, and such a pain at other times. Managment can be severely out of line and it can feel impossible to move up if you don't make buddy-buddy with upper management. Favoritism often played. Customers can be BRUTAL. People will forget parts of their order, fail to mention they want it iced for example, or were mistaken about what they had ordered. You ever want to be cussed out and screamed by a customer because THEY forgot to tell you something this is the place for you. I really do enjoy the work. Making lattes and handcrafting beverages can become a really enjoyable work. The free drinks and food items are great. However, issues with management get ignored. You're expected to smile and apologize when you've done nothing wrong. Managment expects you to write paragraphs about how you are a failure and you need to do a better job, no matter how much you try to explain that an issue was truly out of your control."
good,"Man wurde intern relativ gut weitergebildet, die Arbeit mit den Kollegen machte spaß."
good,some districts promote really quickly and some don't. Some starbucks are very fast paced and can give you an anxiety attack (like it gave my supervisor) some are very slow; like the neighborhood stores.
good,Starbucks is a nice place to work but when you work on a college campus and no tells you that at the start of summer semester they lay off all but 4 people.
good,Used to love it now I hate it. All because of corrupt internal Management. Everything looks good on the outside to the customer perspective. But there is so much drama that the manager's say they live to avoid. But it really seems like they live to live it.
good,Do better in all aspects. HMS HOST Starbucks function or operate differently then franchises. May stem from under qualified management which is a major function.
good,"This particular Starbucks was the only place to hire me once I got out of the military, because I didn't have any sales experience. It was a good learning experience on customer service and a good temporary job"
good,"I enjoyed my coworkers and i felt like we were a family, which contributed both to my work ethic and overall demeanor. However the management was poor (over 12 people quit or relocated within 4 months as soon as he started) and i was paid as much as 5 dollars less than other coworkers who were doing similar or less work."
good,"I spent nine years with the company and had six different managers during my time there. Every time a new manager started, there was always a turn over and frustration with employees. The expectation on their employees versus how much they actually get paid is shocking. All partners deserve to be paid more for what they deal with."
good,"I loved working here for my first year. I was promoted within the first year of working there, but then reached an end point where nobody was benefiting from working for the company anymore. New management was introduced and many problems were encountered after that."
good,"Starbucks makes enough money to be able to adequately compensate their employees, but choose not to. Maybe they have gotten better, but when I worked there in 2015 they offerred too-expensive health insurance and no paid time off until you worked there for over a year. $9/hr plus about $1/hr in tips is not a living wage."
good,This job was very stressful and tiring and it was not worth a lot of it's trouble. The only thing that got me through it were my coworkers and a few of the kind regulars.
good,"At first seems great. Great benefits and pay but hard work. Very physical. The culture they preach seems good but it's all words no action. And then they'll promise something but not met it. Managment is fine with overworking their workers with no sight of going back to a normal work week. Even when they promise we are going back to normal. Unless you really need a job and are fine with working overtime every week up to 72 hours, then I would not suggest this job to anyone."
good,not a whole lot i want to say. My manager at the time who was an old friend of mine didn't like that I worked at the same store and in thus I was let go. This type of enviorment is not the norm at Starbucks.
good,"a day at starbucks started off slow then it would hit a busy peak and dead after that, there is constant cleaning and restocking to be done. if all cleaning and restocking has been done, thats where new drinks are made. the staff is very witty and intelligent, but unfortunatly there is no room for growth in the company."
good,"It's been a few years now since I worked there but the pay wasn't too exciting. which is what to expect when you first start out at any job, at part time. you usually get paid $9-9.50 an hour. there's a lot you can do with that to better yourself and your career if you save up. starbucks teaches you time management. there was a drive thru at my starbucks, people are rushing to work stopping there to get a kick into their day. I do not suggest you be on the phone at work, managers will take note of that and make your experience ten times more difficult. they also teach you the importance of product placement and paying attention to when food gets bad from stock labeling. there is moving boxes in the back and there's a whole cycle starbucks will have for you to complete right away once you walk in. it's a good first job for anyone young to get their foot in the door. I recommend this job for anyone at any age. there are TIPS on tuesday. even better."
good,"Starbucks is a great company but for management its non stop. There was not very good work life balance. "
good,"The Starbucks I worked at was owned by Kroger.  It is a good place to work while looking for something more appropriate.  My manager wasn't always truthful with me stating I could move into a full time position, however, when I checked with other managers, I found out she never approached them about this opportunity.  I worked the mid day shift which required me to sweep and mop.  While I don't mind during this, I believe this should have been done closer to closing."
good,Ambiente cálido para aprender. Excepto cuando hay mucha gente por atender. Horarios muy flexibles en turnos de 4 5 y 6 horas
good,Hard to get more hours than what they choose for you. Good training and great benefits.The management can be great depending on the district manager. Overall decent experience.
good,"It was a basic min wage job, you cant really learn anything new or grow in the company. Unless you plan to run one one day. It was a easy job to be able to do schooling with if you do school."
good,"I have learnt how to be a better team player and further developed my customer service skills. "
good,My specific location was always very busy so everything was fast paced. No time to breathe and not a healthy environment for people suffering from anxiety disorders.
good,"Pay is $1 more than minimum wage and it is not worth it. Tips hardly ever make up for the lack of hourly wage. Customers are horrible most of the time and depending on the manager, the customer can be as awful as possible and you are to blame no matter if it wasn't your fault. Not a great job for intellectuals because customers will treat you like you never got a high school education. Do not recommend. Only redeemable quality is they provide heath insurance and dental."
good,"The work is fast paced and fun. Ive met some really cool people there that have made the work enviornment really fun to work with. However management on some days made the job more stressful with their micro-mangement and not caring enough for their associates. Some of the work that associates are doing, the shift supervisor are doing literally for a couple dollars more. And sometimes the customers can become really demanding and stressful if you make small mistakes."
good,"I really enjoyed how fast paced  this environment was.  However, when it came to advancement, the process was very difficult and I felt as though there was favoritism involved."
good,To pushy never a thank you they need to be careful way to much sugary drinks  young are having more dental problems to many have diabetes your creating unhealthy drinks
good,"I enjoyed for the most part my shifts working at Starbucks because of the people around me and the fast paced work environment. The area that really dampened my mood of this business is lack of consistency or transparency at the management level. I am not talking about the shift supervisors but once you reach store level and even district level management, their goals for the business really undermine employees attempts to carry out the mission and culture the business preaches to us early on."
good,"I enjoyed working with my coworkers. It was a very faced paced environment, but the job itself was easy and fun. Management was horrible and gave some employees paid time off when it was not allowed."
good,"This was supposed to just be my fun little part time mommy job- with free coffee. I loved my first manager, and the job was challenging but fun. Then she was let go in a very brutal fashion. Now I work 6 days a week 40 hours for $9 dollars an hour. While my new store manager who makes 5X as much does darn little. I like the people I work with and even the customers are pretty awesome - but everyone is stressed out and leaving due to poor management. They cannot get good people because their starting pay is 3-5 less than the other similar entry level jobs in town. Starbucks spends a lot of money and time telling you about what a great place it is to work- rather than making it a great place to work."
good,Job is way more stressful than you think. There's so much competition as there are only a few positions available to grow in the company. The pay is not very good and doesn't offer insurance unless you're full time.
good,"Overall the job itself is fast paced and a lot to deal with at the same time. The main issue is the management can at times be a bit poor, and other employees aren't trained to work as a team."
good,"Great job for teens with no real responsibilities.  If you’re an adult with a household to maintain this is not the place for your, benefits are ok. Job is ok, overall a decent company. Just not enough pay for an adult to stay employed as a Barista."
good,"Starbucks was overall a good job that I enjoyed and am saddened to not work there anymore. I had very great coworkers and even though I take leadership to get much done, they always stepped up and helped. But, after my first manager left, everyone enjoyed their job less and less including me and many actually left."
good,The location I had worked at was so busy right off the freeway so it was a constant flow of people. regulars were awesome. management was not very good we were always short staffed
good,"Starbucks, when I first started in 2009 was an amazing company with great management and training. Unfortunately like with all great things managers changed, new incoming managers were poorly trained and lacked basic knowledge. The company should look to promote fro within instead of seeking out external hires and thrusting them into high performing stores."
good,"Every day at starbucks was super busy and jammed packed. At the location I was at the management was the worst I have ever experienced, they don't really care about you. The most enjoyable part was seeing my coworkers."
good,I didn’t like working for Starbucks especially since I was never really trained. I can not tell you how to make the drinks even after working there for 4 months
good,"Culture changes from store to store, as does stress load. It is what you make of it, but the District Managers can make or break a store manager's time with the company. Mine was negative due to a DM with no imagination or flexibility. Restaurants thrive based on can do, flexible, and imaginative employees. If the district leader lacks this, it can be quite a negative experience all the way down to the customers. Starbucks retail employees do not have much room for advancement due to a high level of competition. If you mind your Ps and Qs, keep your attitude sparkling, and your work ethic unrelenting, you have a chance. A small chance, but a chance. As stressful as the job was, I miss it everyday."
good,This job is perfect for those attending school or looking for something on the side. It is not a lucrative or fairly paid job. Management can also be very poor and on the wrong path to developing their employees.
good,"It is constantly stressful having to work quickly, and at times alone, but the greatest part, in my opinion, is the connections built with customers. After working for Starbucks for over a year and a half, I have managed to create my own sense of style in which I believe, I work more effectively.However, when there is other people working in the kiosk we all communicate with each other so we can work smoothly as a team."
good,"Pour un emploi étudiant c'est assez bien...                                                     ,"
good,"At Starbucks I prepared coffee, tea, beverages, food and pastries. Cleaned and sanitized restaurant and restrooms. Handled debit and credit cards. Customer service."
good,"I loved working at Starbucks when I lived in a big city, but moving to a small town and working there was a complete 180. There were barely any hours, the manager was awful, and it just wasn’t a very well staffed store. Starbucks definitely functions better at a busier location."
good,"it's working at the airport--people are stressed and want coffee fast. Employee parking is not covered, and the employee shuttle to the airport fills up quickly"
good,Overall I did enjoy working for Starbucks. Although I was often being harassed by my peers and nothing was done about it by upper management  which was the ultimate reason for me leaving.
good,"- make drinks, stock, clean"
good,"great job for people in high school and college. It is a fast paced job with multiple benefits including free spotify premium, bean stock, weekly markouts and more. Management depends on the store. hardest part is getting up to open at 430 am. most enjoyable is the people you meet."
good,"starbucks can be a great place to work with the right management. i was a part time worker full time student working 40+ hours sometime because of scheduling issues, lack of staff etc. i was often stuck doing the work shift supervisors should do without the title or the pay."
good,This is a fast paced workplace . Pay is good benefits are great if you stay long enough. This is a good place to work if you have to choose a service industry job.
good,"Th emanagement keeps changing at lower level and the teams are not prepared to work with out the management."
good,"Starbucks is a decent company that has recently been suffering a crisis of identity. While Starbucks employees are called ""partners"", recent management has decided that employee needs are far less important than delivering quarterly gains to stockholders. Hours have been cut. Staffing has been reduced. Profits are up, I'm sure, but employee satisfaction is plummeting. Turnover is increasing. Because there are very few ""back-up"" employees, any absence is keenly felt on the floor."
good,"While I enjoyed the people I worked with, I really disliked the overall management of my store. In order to receive benefits, you had to work 40 hours a week which was my intention. Management made it very difficult to receive even 30 hours a week, but would only schedule 3 employees to work during our busiest times of the day. Poor strategy and team management."
good,Starbucks is ok. Not much money or many hours. Customers are rude and inconsiderate of anything. Management is ok depending on store. Stressful job for anyone who isn't ok with a fast paced environment.
good,"There’s never ever any stability to your schedule, they’ll put you all over the place. And if you refuse, they cut your hours, which are usually already too low. The worst thing about starbucks is that they purposefully understaff at all times so regardless if it’s busy or not, you’re busy and stressed out. You’ll never get everything you want to get done accomplished. The good thing is you’re not there all day like a typical office job. And you get free drinks all day! Plus the health benefits are great."
good,"I was hired under false pretense of Asst. Manager position."
good,I enjoyed my job. I loved being able to create drinks for people and suggest drinks for people. We did get many difficult customers. My manager was not the greatest. I did love the look on a customer's face when the drinks I made them were perfect.
good,"learned a lot improve experience on a day by day. even though a lot of timed management seems to be off in helping the stores , but its understandable because they are in the airport"
good,"Starbucks has great pay and benefits options, but the scheduling and hours leave something to be desired. Management is poor on most levels and there is almost no opportunity for advancement."
good,"Honestly working here isn't terrible. It depends on where you work at and the people that you are working with. There are advancement opportunities, again depending on where you work. The pay is not good for all the things that they have you do and for the way that the customers treat you. You just have to find the right starbucks to work at and you should be fine."
good,Starbucks in Harris Teeter located in Purcellville is a great place to get your coffee and tea but this kiosk is ran by many young teenagers that aren't that focused nor coherent to what or how to make items i had to wait 15 minutes for one drink because the employee had made it wrong 3 times. Other days there is an older woman who claims shes the manager but she too didn't know the correct way to make my drink and was very rude and unprofessional about the whole situation.
good,I would only work 10 hours a week but those were the longest 10 hours of my life. Employees couldn't get along  everyone talked about each other and the manager never did anything about it.
good,Benefits are amazing but majority of the Managers in the lower Fairfield area are selfish and like to play favoritism. Hard works tends to go unnoticed.
good,"Starbucks had many pros and cons. Often times the team that you worked with was wonderful, and I rarely had any extreme interpersonal problems with my fellow co-workers. However the clientele often did not fully engage with you, even when you worked very hard at it. "
good,"Virtually impossible to get a promotion, EXTREME favoritism from managers, sexually harassing environment, horrific hours, no flexibility...I could go on. "
good,"Starbucks as a company in a whole is a great company. They mean well and try to put employees and customers first. But in its individual stores that management needs to adhere more to the intention of what Starbucks is trying to do.This I feel will help them to retain their valuable employees. I feel that I have more than I got from the company to the detriment of my health. I love my job and if Starbuck. When you are sick in a hospital bed and on your day off you call your manager to let her know that you are very sick(they know you have a life-threating illness) and that manager tells you she would fire you if you don't get your shift covered, I knew it was time to move on."
good,Okay for a temp job.  Advancement not likely.  Wouldn't work there again.  Job environment was hectic and sometimes negative.  Coworkers are extremely young and inexperienced.
good,The best part about the job at starbucks was just support because it was all new for someone so new and I had most of the supports I needed to work there.
good,"At the end of the day, starbucks doesnt care about the employee or how long youve been with the company. Just company values and sales and apparently poor management."
good,Very poorly managed..  mostly understaffed for job requirements. Most days are very stressful.   Not enough training is given to new partners causing stress and poor customer service.
good,A typical day at work involves always being on your feet and being able and looking forward to meeting new people daily and making sure you give the best costumer experience possible- whether or not you have 20 other costumers in line after them.
good,"working at Starbucks was quite the experience. While at Starbucks id say I became somewhat of a coffee enthusiast. the work environment was very fast paced and I wasn't used to that work environment, I was taught to make drinks quickly not correctly. I did not have that good of a manager I believe that if I had a better manager I'd have a overall much more positive experience."
good,"Bonne culture d'entreprise, aucune évolution de carrière dans la succursale ou j'ai travailler."
good,"If you get overwhelmed easily, it is not for you. Frankly, the benefits in the long are ok but only if you last long enough. Good place to work if you are going to school and living at home, unless you are a higher than a Barista. You are usually working in a small space and favoritism happens a lot."
good,"A typical day would be going in talking to the manager to see where you will be for the day. Do the assign task for the day, take orders make drinks, stock. I learned to have speed and consistency. The work place is fast paced. Hardest part of the job is looking up and see a line of people and trying to not get overwhelmed. Management did not always communicate very well with one and other and would cause for each manager to tell you something different. The most enjoyable part of the job was my coworkers."
good,"I had so many problems working for this company. First they cut my pay when I transferred to a store in the neighboring county because ""the cost of living was less"". I later found out that if I quit and got rehired when I moved I would have not undergone a pay cut. When I finally got promoted to Supervisor they cut my hours and I was no longer able to pay my bills. When I was forced to get a second job just to survive I was asked to step down from my leadership position based on my new availability. The main reason I had an issue with this is because every other supervisor working there had the exact same availability as I did, yet they were allowed to keep their leadership roles and I was not. I kept getting transferred to different stores until I finally decided to start working for a company that appreciates and values my hard work."
good,When I worked at Starbucks I had poor management. I would leave work one day with two days off and then be called the next day required to work. I only intended to work part time 15-20 hours but worked closer to 35 hours a week. The mark out items once a week were nice and mark out food and drink while working was a plus. The environment is difficult for someone who does work hard when no one else wants to take initiative.
good,"it is really fun to work at Starbucks I learned a lot being disciplined and be my self. However, I experienced being discriminated at the location where do I work. But some people re nice."
good,"I know a lot of people currently employed at other Starbucks locations and love it. I however felt I was hired at the worst one. I completed the bare minimum training and the manager expected me to know it all and be as quick as everyone else. when I didn't, she would insinuate that I was stupid, and said I was too slow. it was to the point everyday where I went home crying. I worked there for only two months before it became too much. luckily for everyone else, I heard she no longer is with Starbucks, so hopefully that location is better."
good,"The atmosphere is a mixture of great friends and 20-year-olds who simply don't care."
good,"Starbucks is a very fast paced environment and you are expected to learn everything quickly. On a typical day, we would get 2 different rush hours in a day. The morning rush (which was typically the most busy) and The afternoon rush was still busy and requires more help on the floor."
good,"It is vastly different from working at a corporate store. Privately owned locations are not required to give you certain benefits, pay raises, etc. It is a very fast paced working environment but once you get the hang of the job, it is very straight forward and can be enjoyable."
good,I worked here as a last resort. Definitely loved my co workers. Management was always changing. No set schedules. Had a whole lot of fun closing one night 9pm and opening at 4am. Poor planning.
good,"Without going into details, this became one of the most interesting experiences in my life due to the lack of congruence between what it's said vs what is actually done the decisions made and the way upper management in the province follow."
good,"a typical day at work would be you clock in and usually cover someones ten minute break. most of your shift your moving around to different positions, which are front bar. someone who makes are the drinks coming from the lobby. Drive bar, someone only making drinks going out the drive thru. DTO, someone answering all the orders for drive thru. Window, someone that exchanges the money and drinks at the drive thru window. Front, someone taking lobby orders and sometimes depending on what time in the day it is there would be someone on customers support, they do all the stocking and keeps the cleanliness of the store and food, someone that handles all the food orders. I've learned how to work in high paced environments and how to handle customers in high stressed situations. I've worked at Starbucks for a little over a year and the management i was hired into was more organized and knew the job more and the new management the store now has i feel its not out of control but it isn't the same. the hardest part of the job i'd say was memory. being a barista at Starbucks you had to remember so many drinks for different season. the most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know my co-workers and customers."
good,"Aprendi muito sobre a cultura do café, os modos de processamento e de confecção."
good,"Became a Store Manager within 3 years, and thought it was going to be like the description in the company documents. This is not the case; "
good,"Starbucks is a great way to develop a good work ethic and to grow as a person. Baristas are not paid enough, and environment is stressful. The most enjoyable part of the job is the bonds you create with co-workers and customers."
good,Management is good but lacks in handing down punishment to people who refuse to follow directions. Seems like promotions are handed out based on favoritism and not by work performance.
good,"Job Security, Low Wages, great food benefit.  If your are looking to serve hundreds of people a day, this is the job for you.  The days go by fast, but you encounter all sorts of people.  I love my fellow partners."
good,"This Starbucks was a franchise for HMSHost, my experience there was not the best with the company, but my customers were the best.  Benefits were offered but for the pay of 7,25 an hour it was best not to take benefits or else you would have no pay check at the end of the week."
good,Starbucks is overall a good company to work for with so many different benefits. You also get a free pound of coffee a week and three free drinks per shift. My store's management is just terrible.
good,"Not great. Not great at all. Management was poor, revolving door conditions exist, and the environment is poorly run and mismanaged at all levels. That being said, the benefits and pay were a notch above average, just enough to make you forgive some shortcomings."
good,They have competitive pay but cut hours for management bonuses. They want you to be able to work as much as possible and when you go over 40 hours in a week you get in trouble for being asked to do so.
good,When to transitioned from a cafe to a drive thru location it felt like nobody had a clue on how to run a drive thru. If someone calls out there is almost always no replacement.
good,"I described and recommended products, and fulfilled customer needs to create returning clientele. As supervisor, I developed and improved daily work plans; increased communication between morning & night shifts by 50%."
good,The manager at Starbucks El Conquistador never care about her employee there's always competition with your role and no partnership Starbucks goals is to make every coffee perfect and to take good care of there employee but on El Conquistador that never happens
good,Bad management. Our team was amazing and we worked together like a well oiled machine. We had a great relationship with our customers too. I learned very valuable teamwork skills.
good,Starbucks would be a great company to work for if they wouldn't be so stingy with their labor hours. Being a full time college student i'm trying to do my best to barley make it by an only giving me ten hours a week inst going to do it.
good,I enjoyed making the guests day and trying new coffees. I learned how to be positive when dealing with customers face-to-face all day long. I also enjoyed keeping the store clean.
good,"As a barista or a shift, you'll be required to do the work of 3 partners. Recent hour cuts have killed the productivity. The rude customers and bad management are enough to top the cake that is your will to do anything to leave the company. If the benefits weren't so great, they would have no staff."
good,Starbucks as a company itself is an amazing job opportunity.  They genuinely care about their employees and it is just a fun place to work and get to interact with many of the same customers daily and build connections.  I would have stayed at the job for many years if my manager didn't make me hate my life on a daily basis.
good,This is a great start up job for anyone in college trying to pay bills while getting their education.  Unfortunately if you're not in that category it's not the place to work for a comfortable future. The benefits are great and they can be flexible but that flexibility comes at a price of lack of sleep and exhaustion.  The best part of the job is the people you work with.  Sometimes they hire a bad apple that can bring a shift down but for the most part they hire some of the most intelligent working people I've ever met and that will help your day go by smoothly.
good,"The customers can be rude, impatient and extremely demanding.  The pay for the work we do is 'competitive' but not very good.  There is a lack of hours."
good,"After being told that I cannot hire a certain demographic, I knew I needed to choose a new career path. I wanted to work in an equal diversity environment."
good,"Job is fun and super easy, very flexible hours. Management is not the greatest. Hard time trying to move up in career. Very helpful in training. Offers many benefits."
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work when you need a flexible schedule, also getting to know all your regular customer and creating a bond with them is also amazing."
good,"I was so excited to get a job at Starbucks because I always heard how great it was. However, I was very disappointed. I was constantly stressed, the learning curve was steep and I constantly had to deal with rude and demanding customers."
good,"Starbucks is enjoyable for a customer due to the ability that the company allows the workers to be subjected to constant bickering, slander, and indecency. Partners are expected to finish drinks on a prompt time with little to no help as well as under paid for the impaction stores receive. Customers may have a barista remake drinks until satisfaction which slows times down for other people in line which ends with a angry shift lead, frustrated customer, loss of money for the company, and all while being blamed on the barista."
good,We never had proper training or supervision the manager was always not on staff or working on unrelated things was not well maintained poor indication of hours you would be working
good,Working at the Starbucks stand at Target was enjoyable and relatively easy until the management became disorganized and put too many responsibilities on the small staff.
good,"Treat employees with a lot more care and respect. "
good,"Management cares only about numbers, corporate makes no effort to ensure their employees are treated fairly or at all like humans by customers, while continually creating new products to push with too little time to prepare and no consideration of space confinements."
good,Bad management. Time management sucks. Bias bosses. The customers and baristas are nice its just the bosses in the branch that i workee in. Never listens to our voices
good,"i had a great time at work everyday, the management was very very unorganized and harsh on employees for their own mistakes."
good,"Starbucks is a great company for hourly associates, they treat them like gold. However, Management is treated like dirt. District managers are far removed from the actual day-to-day and often times aren't able to jump in and help if they need to. A typical visit was a review of unrealistic expectations."
good,"Starbucks seems like a great job to work, I enjoyed it for a long time but eventually the pay wasn't worth the stress or the emotion I was giving it. In the end I felt taken advantage of and no appreciated by the management for the customer capital that I was bringing into the store. A server job a restaurant would be better for a person looking for a job in the service industry because you get to keep all the tips you make. At Starbucks they split the tips. But the job definitely taught me a lot about myself and I respect that. If you think you'd like it, try it out."
good,"While working at Starbucks, there was never a dull moment. There was always something to learn about and to get done. Working at Starbucks allowed me to obtain a good work ethic and gain skills in customer service and customer interactions."
good,"The work day went by quickly because everything was pretty fast paced. The management was a bit sloppy, our manager barely took the time to get to know what was happening during business hours and would not resolve any conflicts. The environment was friendly otherwise, all of my coworkers were smart and just trying to get to a better place in their lives. The job is hard because you are expected to do everything at lightning speed and people are unaware of the processes you must go through to satisfy everyone indoors and out. The job had upsides. Getting to know your team so you're all doing what you're best at and moving like a well oiled machine was always nice and efficient."
good,"If you are in lower positions than you can balance work and personal life. When you are young it`s ok to work there for a few years, than move on with your life."
good,"I worked at a high volume (about 7 - 10k customers a day) and it was extremely stressful. Didn't feel like we were appreciated enough and didn't have enough power as a supervisor to make a difference on the store. if a customer was extremely rude, and then called and complained, they would get a 25 gift card."
good,The only thing that makes employment worthwhile with this company is the excellent benefit program they offer. It is an exceedingly difficult job depending on the nature of the store that you are hired at.
good,"As a contract worker, you get paid less and receive no benefits. Contract workers rarely get hired full time at Starbucks; instead they are dragged along with the proverbial carrot dangles in their face"
good,"All together being a part of the experience is great but being a part of a team full of liars, scammers *trying to get your way to the top* is trifling."
good,"Starbucks is a wonderful transitional job pace. "
good,"During the busy period, they just urge you to do everything quick while they have only taught you once."
good,"The problem with this job was that you worked for the money they paid you & the only reason the pay was considered reasonable was because of it's location in VA. They had a very Terrible Manager for this particular location, lots of complaints about her from the workers & I'm almost sure that her leadership is the reason this location no longer has a Starbucks"
good,"You might not be trained on bar for a few months, but it will give you time to learn how to operate drive thru, customer support, and front. You will almost always be short staffed and finding someone to cover a shift is nigh on impossible. Partners are all easy to get along with and it's easy to establish a bond with customers, but there are some that make the day 10x worse than it should be. I love seeing regulars and being able to talk and bond with them, but I hate that the atmosphere is so intense and rushed that we don't get to do that with everyone."
good,Working at starbucks can be very stressful especially with only one person working at a time. It is not worth the pay to be constantly stressed. I wouldn't really recommend working here to a friend even though they do pay well thats really the only benefit.
good,"Excellent benefits and flexibility Too much secret work politics, no job security or assistance, lack of giving credit for work done, and you ever know what going on due to bad communication from leadership and secrets."
good,"This is a good job for full-time students. I would not recommend this job if you want to work during normal business hours given that most employees must work late nights, early mornings, and weekends."
good,"Starbucks is a really fun environment to work and very inspiring, bring a close relationship with customers and baristas.  Learn together grow together."
good,"Management tend to give backhanded compliments to me at least, and are not as supportive as they could be i.e. making repairs and having good supplies stocked."
good,"Extremely busy store."
good,Real good customer service experience. I learned a lot about making my day all about our customers and I got real close to them. I still go in there and see my old customers.
good,Empresa de  grande porte internacional possibilitando uma grande experiência.
good,"Frequently not set up to be able to succeed. Frequently  Over worked. Unstable hours; one week you could get 30 hours, the next week it could be 7.5. Yes 7.5 hours for the total week.  Not enough to live off of."
good,I worked here at a time when the focus shifted away from the customer experience to impressing investors with the stock price.  It was and is a sad decline of a once great company to work for.
good,Starbucks is an amazing place to work for part time. It has recently made some changes within the past three to four years which made it a little less than desirable for long term employment and advancement.
good,"Working at Starbucks is fun but challenging.  It requires dealing with different personalities, and maintaining a level head during high stress situations."
good,Para mim é um trabalho um pouco escravo mas que dá pra aprender muita coisa que a gente leva pra vida
good,I like working at starbucks inside king soopers. Its busy some of the time. But I normally work only 24 hours and make 10.50 an hour. it would be great if I was going to school. But its hard to make a living only working 24 hours a week. there is a lot of cleaning to do when you close. I also would like my job better if they offered sick time within the first 3 months not after you have been there for 3 years.
good,"typical day includes customer service. management is not the best - no room for growth, can stay stagnant in one position for years. its a very petty industry. coworkers are the only best part of the job."
good,"starbucks as a company is fun to work at and offers a lot of benefits, but will have some run ins with some pretty bad managers. Varies from store to store, and work environment."
good,Not a hard job but often a stressful one. Of the four stores I worked at all of the managers struggled to run things properly. Labor is poorly managed and slightly exploitive (they really stretch things thin.) People who are not ready for the responsibility are promoted.
good,"Working for them was a nightmare, complete farce as an employer! All these commercials you see online and on TV about what a great place it is to work, is completely untrue! Though some people may disagree with me and say they actually enjoy working there, and that is fine. But for me feeling different and treated a certain way because of these differences, falsely accused of doing so many things that I didn't do, and then ending it all with being fired, was just crazy! to top it all off the district manager or whoever it was above my manager was just a horrible vindictive person, and took out all her shortcomings on others. So no, I would never suggest working for Starbucks!"
good,"-Manager was relaxed and helpful in training. She would do everything within her power to help her employees."
good,"It's a fun job, once you learn the procedure and way things work. Although, since it's a Starbucks, you'll be working with mostly teenagers, and that's no fun."
good,"This is an alright place to work. Not somewhere you would want to have a career at. The employees during my time there were awful. Not all of them, but most of them."
good,"A typical day at this location included preparing specialty coffee beverages meeting customers requests. The main issue with the organization is lack of staffing during peak hours. While not an especially challenging position, dealing with rude customers over a cup of coffee can be tiring. However, there are also the customers who appreciate your care."
good,"A lot of tasks and if you don't do them well especially when you just start you get a lot of stick. It depends on the culture and who you work with, some people enjoy it"
good,My location had extreme highs and lows. You could be quite busy working on a college campus or quite bored during holidays. I loved the people I worked with. It was a good working-while-in-school-job.
good,"My store was inconsistent in multiple areas including management, hours, and the rules.hours would go from 30 to 40 hours a week, then drop down to 20 the next and it is practically impossible to get more. there are to many employees which also give way to the abysmal hours. the clientele is the worst part. the customers are ravenous and demanding, and care little about the well-being of the workers.overall the compensation and benefits, while amazing, are not worth the stress."
good,"I enjoyed working at Starbucks during University. It allowed me to connect with my local community while being a full time student."
good,"You can expect to work Monday though Saturday, 10 hours a day. Most days are 10 hour days. If you finish that days work, management will take the liberty of freeing up your schedule and making you work the 10 hours that day as you can use it to get ahead on tomorrow's workload. The people that work there are quite enjoyable and they have a diverse group of employees. the work is physical and breaks are prompt."
good,Fast paced workplace in season best part is season meeting new people management needed a lot of help after old management left learned to have alot of patience and work well with others
good,The company starts off confusing but is also quite intriguing to start. Extremely fast paced and can be extremely overwhelming. Management is inconsistent and labor cuts make it overwhelming for shifts and baristas. Baristas tend to be lazy for a lack of better words due to low wages. Shifts are left an absurd amount of work and are expected to pick up assistant manager slack and do management tasks without receiving compensation for it. Customers are generally easy going and understanding aside from the few idiots you will get on a day to day basis. Benefits are mediocre at best and the bar is set too high as far as expectations. Growth within the company is so difficult because managers will give you the run around but will reward the lazy idiots employed by them. If you are a shift or higher you can forget about having a life due to long hours and exhaustion.
good,"I didn't like it there, no one talked to me, I felt like the center of attention because I was the only 1 working two stores. The managers bately talked to me, it was. A horrible expreience but the cystomets wrre always polite."
good,People were fun just sucks that you wernt alowed to have color in your hair or tattoos showing or earing on but what ever it was fun and would go back making the drinks were fun
good,This is as corporate as they come. Work hard to get where you want to be and don't be afraid to push back on management at yimes
good,"Its everything you would expect from a job in the food service industry. Very fast paced and requires a high level of memorization and a fast reaction time. The learning curve can be a little hard on people who have not worked in that kind of multi-tasking environment before, but the job requirements are very straightforward."
good,"I loved the environment and i loved my coworkers. However, i felt there could be more people working along side of me. I also believe management could have been more supportive and hands on with the new employee's."
good,You will be working fast especially in morning time and it's fun but the manager at the time was blind and played favorites and fired someone for stealing when her own shift manager was the one stealing and never proved the innocent one that wasn't stealing that he did it
good,"Safeway is a decent employer to work for, the thing I liked best about working there was the weekly pay direct deposited. I found that a lot of the stores differ based on store management, leading in inconsistency and confusion sometimes."
good,"Very fast-paced environment. Can be fun at times. Sometimes things are taken way too seriously. Horrible hours, no one is full time."
good,"This place may seem great to go and get a nice cup of coffee on the receiving end. However, being on the other side of the counter is not so pleasant. I learned a lot from this job, i earned much experience however, it was not a setting for me."
good,"starbucks was an extreamly manic environment as it was at a very busy service station , it was my first time learning all the barista skils I enjoy this a lot , the hardest part of the jobs is keeping your fast paste for 8hrs a day."
good,"I worked for 8 years as a Barista. My overall experience with Starbucks in general for atleast my first 6 years were enjoyable. Its a great starting job and teaches you relevant skills that opens a variety of options in the customer service industry down the road. I have seen the best and worse of Starbucks. I have made some good friends and compromised with several obstacles in Starbucks. By obstacles I mean people."
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work at, plenty of benefits and opportunities for advancement. However, during my employment it severely interfered with my second job. My manager continuously scheduled me during my unavailable work times and ignored my continuous requests and paperwork stating my available work times until I had to choose my second job over Starbucks and unfortunately quit. I still recommend working here as this was specific incident with one manager."
good,I loved my job at Beaumont. Very productive and fun. I made alot of friends and met a lot of wonderful people. Nothing was better than being able to always be happy going into work.
good,"I enjoy the job and being around the people that I work with. Starbucks is a decent company, but they struggle with staffing and management at times ."
good,"Starbucks is a good company to work for . It's intended to be an open uplifting environment . But like any other place there are positive and not so positive people working at this location. If you stay positive focus on your work and don't let co-workers distract you, it's a lot of fun."
good,The work here is very demanding. The benefits almost make it worth it. They are very inconsistent with scheduling. The idea is to get one person to do three peoples jobs.
good,"MH alshaya is the riputed company in middle east.when i worked i feel good.partner are supportive.Management is good,company benifits.it has good name and fame.lots of brands in middle east."
good,"It s routing job opening and closing , When is busy stressing ,sometime funny,you learn how to make different drink,how to do in till,customer service"
good,"i just didn't  like unstable they were with their hours, you would get sent home early so they could cut labor, i liked working in a team. the hardest part was having to be on the floor on your own"
good,"It is very hard to balance any personal life outside of your job. Depending on your district it could be awesome or could be the worst thing you've ever experienced. Don't work in boulder county. "
good,"Starbucks was a very fun job, worked with hours somewhat well, and gave good benefits. I loved the co-workers i made good friends there with them. I didn't exactly like working alone within the time i was working because i enjoy talking to people. The work itself was very enjoyable nothing to much to handle. Hardest part had to be when people came in all at once and order completely different drinks."
good,I mostly enjoyed connecting with customers and co-workers. I also enjoyed being creative with combinations of coffee and tea recipes.
good,"I worked very hard for Starbucks for over 16 years. I was very dedicated and loyal, I believed in what the company stood for and what they were trying to achieve. I worked in a number of locations through out NYC where I was able to meet and get to know a variety of people and personalities. Sometimes it was great and other times not so much. I enjoyed the fast pace and learning new things. Getting to know co-workers, customers and vendors was for the most part an amazing experience. Learning what was supposed to be the culture of the company and being able to meet and learn from some of the companies leaders was something I will always love and remember. Over the past couple of years too many bad seeds have been planted and has turned what was once considered a second family culture into daily misery and mistreatment."
good,"The days were long and tedious. Although I did like my clientele and coworkers, I didn't like the wage nor did I like my store manager. The hardest part was living off the wage I was paid."
good,"There were way to many politics at this job."
good,"Starbucks is stressful, and understaffed, yet my store managers cuts more hours. Everyone is tired and overworked, and yet we are all underpaid. The good things are the health care benefits and discounts."
good,They have a horrible attendance policy. Very clicky like high school all over again. Very boring standing in one spot. Good benefits and if desperate can use money from your check for in-store purchases.
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work for your first job. Clean environment, plenty of free caffeine, and all around cool people overall. But here's the downside... the customers are very demanding, the management is either lazy or major micro-managers, and the pay just isn't that good. But hey, for a first job with no experience, its a good way to get started."
good,As a mother there is no life for me and my baby if i stay and work.So I 've attened diploma in accounting to change my carrer for family long term plan.
good,"There's been a lot of good moments but also a lot of bad. Communication is very often poor, as is the pay."
good,"its a productive and fun place to work at. they dont give you any discounts by working at the store and that sucks."
good,Everyday the same. I learned outstanding latte art and how to provide world class customer service. Amazing co-workers.
good,"I am a sole barista, I ran the entire place on my own, the hardest part of my day is definitely going to the loo, having to wait over 30min for somebody to cover for me for a few minutes, it's usually very busy and the day goes fast, the most enjoyable part is being able to make coffee and bounding with my regular customers."
good,"Everyday the same, all I learned is outstanding latte art and how to provide world class customer serive. Bad management, amazing co-workers. The hardest part of the job is dealing with annoying customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is when all my friends are on the same shift with me!"
good,"make drinks for customers. cleans the area, makes cash transactions, self made whip creams. i learned a lot about espresso and coffee"
good,"pay is low for the work you are required to do. Stores are usually run by inexperienced management staff with lack of maturity and life experience."
good,"For management not paid enough to have an excess amount of work and pressure dumped on them to maintain unrealistic standards set in place by corporate who doesn't even deal with the day to day responsibilities of the retail side of the business. As for supervisors and baristas, great high school / college job to help build experience in customer service roles and increased job responsibility for their resumes when they get real jobs."
good,"Terrible hours, not the best place to work. Some customers are great, some are completely rude. Hours are needed to be given that are initially promised,"
good,A typical Day at Starbucks can be extremely overwhelming if you can not handle a fast paced store. If the register isn't broken one minute then the Label worker isn't functioning properly and they take forever to repair whats damaged. I have learned to always make sure that my store is stocked and sometimes over stocked because you never know what obstacles may come your way. The Management need to communicate with each other in every way possible. If the managers do not know whats going on then how do they expect the baristas to know. The whole team has to work together like a well oiled machine
good,Though it no longer exists Starbucks is a good company. It just wasn't a very good fit for paris and I was getting little work hours which forced me to find another job.
good,I love working in Starbucks but my only concern is the job security. I'm working there as part time but as a family person I need to search for a job that I will be full time.
good,it was ok. nothing to write home about. however it did give me the skills needed for the bowling alley. the people are way nicer.
good,"Het is een hele leuke bijbaan, je leert veel mensen kennen en na een tijdje kan je van tevoren opnoemen wat iemand drinkt of lust. Je herkent veel van de vaste gasten en bouwt een band met ze. Ik heb geleerd om perfecte latte's en cappucino's te maken! En ook koffie leren drinken.... niet geheel onbelangrijk."
good,A major part of this job depended on a person's personality.  Starbucks has a brand that is surrounded on friendly conversations and that is what a barista is expected of.
good,Love the customers but the extreme turn around in employees and the lack of good management makes the place not an ideal one.
good,"Fun, fast paced place to work. Learning about making drinks and interacting with customers makes this job really fulfilling. A little difficult to manage work/life balance due to odd hours."
good,"its a fun job, but not long term and it won't pay the bills. The people are great that I work with. Great customer service skills."
good,Management was terrible at the time I was working there. Co-workers were great and friendly. The most important thing I took away from this experience was learning to be more patient with myself. The most difficult part was management not being reliable and kind of all over the place. Never stayed on task.
good,it was a good job because i was creative and happy with talking to clients but im looking for a better creer for me for better life
good,"great co workers, unfortunately district management was not supportive.  Last store manager was phenomenal. Created close bonds with my customers."
good,Requires long hours of manual labor. Mostly team based. Co-workers help each other. Hardest part of the job would be the low hourly wage. Most enjoyable would be interacting with pleasant customers.
good,Starbucks is a laid back environment and i have learned a lot of great customer service skills through this company. The management changes a lot and is not very consistent. My co workers are usually pleasant but it's time for something more substantial where I can make a better living for myself.
good,en general el ambiente se da con cada unos de los integrantes de la tienda divertido y horarios flexibles para poder estudiar
good,"This is a very fun and fast paced place to work. Lots of drinks to learn, but once you do the job will be easy as pie. Cool promotional drinks every couple of months!"
good,It is a difficult and fast-paced environment with high standards for both customer service and the products that we sell. I worked there for two years before leaving for college and now as a rehire it is strange to see how much has changed in the management as well as the overall atmosphere and vibes of my old job.
good,"When I had originally started working back in 2006, the company's focus was all about the customer. I loved that. They wanted us to make Starbucks feel like a 2nd home for customers. Warm and welcoming. Fast forward a couple of years, and that changed. For the worse, it did. Became about numbers and such. I had left the company in 2011 in search of a job that ""was my calling,"" and haven't succeeded yet. Those close to me would tell me that ""Starbucks was ME. Being around people and making people happy was ME."" So, I applied and was given a job there again. I was hoping that the mindset behind the company was like it was back in 2006, but it isn't."
good,"If the Schedule was better Id be more comfortable, Starbucks in my opinion is for students and young adults but since I was a student and getting scheduled between classes due to lack of staff and its very stressful to study, so Starbucks is great if you have the correct schedule"
good,"The job is great but our poor store has been through 5 store managers in 5 years and I can only handle so much. Very busy all the time, customers are usually friendly."
good,I didn't like the management i had where i worked but i did love the job and how fast you could move up but yet also get replaced if the manager wanted.
good,A wonderful job to excersize and learn core leadership competncies.  The people are wonderful. If you want to learn about effeciency and routines Starbucks is a great place to start.
good,I liked this job before we got the new manager. She didn't know what she was doing and she was not following my schedule and so it was very hard to get someone to get my son from daycare and hard to find someone to babysit on weekends. She wasn't understanding that i had a child unlike the old manager where he was.
good,"Help customers, make drinks, make schedule and clean.  Management needs to be better.  I love my regular customers.  I learned to multi-task a lot better, meaning doing taking orders while making drinks.  My co-workers are like family and easy to get along with. Hardest part f my job would be to go at a fast pace all the time to continue to  make the customers happy."
good,Fast paced and requires a lot of multitasking along with great customer service. However dont expect to move up as quickly as they say.
good,"High stress job, lots of micromanagement. Starbucks can be a fun job but you need a solid manager, a good staff, and a consistent, steady customers to recieve good tips. As a company, Starbucks is focusing more and more on numbers, and less on the personable qualities that made it once great."
good,You'll do fine here as long as you meet your QTD expectations.
good,"I am an opening Barista for the store I work at, and my morning regulars are one of the reasons why I get up in the morning and go to work, I have a lot of fun making their drinks and providing them with breakfast and a good conversation.  I think that one of the things that I have learned from here is to stand up for myself and let myself be heard.  It's really easy to get lost in the background working in a busy store like mine, and I have had to learn to let my ideas and my thoughts be known.  "
good,I loved the environment I worked in. Fast paced and exciting but frustrating at times. My fellow baristas were great and always happy but all the managers that work for the company lacked the people skills that are the foundation of what starbucks os built upon.
good,"I worked for starbucks in Syracuse back in 2014 and quit within months. The district manager is horrible to the manager so she harasses people till they quit. They only hire good looking and don't care about the hard workers who really want jobs. The district is awful to her employees. Ive seen her first hand scold two managers roght in front of the lobby.. Those poor things. Also she won't let college kids come back to work when they were awesome workers. No matter how many complaints you put in about her nothing gives. Someone needs to reevaluate how she is handling enforcing the code policy as well. Other than that good co workers, good customers and awesome benefits but you cant enjoy them long enough to work their because of the district."
good,"Every day was unpredictable. Fast pace with high stress work environment, especially during the peak hours. Company was very flexible with working around my class schedule, but the schedule was different from week to week. Hard to adjust to the hours because the schedule would change so often, early mornings to late nights. Meet amazing co-worker and customers, many of whom I am still very close with. Turn over rate was very high, new co-workers and new management on a frequent basis. No prospects for career opportunities or advancement."
good,"Very good work place to acquire new skills. Flexible on the shift, and very dynamic."
good,Starbucks is a good company to work for if you are not looking for a full time career.
good,"This job was such a learning experience, but I had to resign due to the lack of ability to pay wages and the company was going out of business."
good,"Starbucks, overall, is a wonderful company to work for.  There are many benefits available to everyone that is employed with them: free coffee, health benefits, 401k, stock options, etc. Recently it has become abundantly clear to me that the schedule required of me in order to move up within the company is putting too much strain on my family life and now it's time to move on. Despite loving the people I work with and around, I need a job that suits my life better.  I think the hardest part of the job is time management.  In order to be good at this job you really need to constantly assess and prioritize what needs to be done and delegate if need be.  "
good,"Não era legal porque era longe demais da minha casa e não tinha visibilidade para eu, continuar porém fiquei até o tempo de experiência. Aprendi umas bases de barista. A direção e a gerência nunca estava presente para ouvir os funcionários. Era cada um por si e nem sempre tinha alguém para ajudar e nisso perdi a vontade de prosseguir na empresa. Lidar com a gerência e alguns colegas de trabalho. Os momentos de lazer."
good,Did this too and I dont think I need to say more. It's a lot of work for not enough money.
good,"Dealing out coffees, cleaning, conversing with customers. I learned I can indeed make drinks quickly and efficiently. The management was good, although the language barrier was difficult between myself and the general manager. "
good,Starbucks has built  a reputation amongst their Barista's for notoriously disallowing the advancement from retail to corporate careers. At any point I worked with highly qualified individuals who in turn left because it is not an in-house friendly career. Basically other companies recruited almost every individual out of the more successful stores to leave them in ruin since it is not worth the effort to keep quality employees.
good,On a typical day at this starbucks I would be put on drive-thru for hours at a time. Management changed a lot. My coworkers were hard workers.
good,"brewing coffee and teas, working register, prepare hot/ cold beverages, prepare food and pastries and customer service"
good,"This is easily the hardest retail job I've ever held. It is stressful, demanding work, and the employees are underpaid. Let's face it: if you work here your customer base are addicts, and they behave like it too. The regulars are always nice though so it is an odd karmic balance. The health insurance is really good and the people I work with are great. Although this is not true in all stores. In other stores it is like working with a bunch of piranha. Waiting for you to mess up so they can take chunks out of you. It is a good interim job, but from now on I will always tip generously to the employees."
good,"ok job, not a career. Health insurance is great but pay scale is very low. It takes ""forever"" to earn any vacation days."
good,"A typical day at worked consists of checking all the inventory and making sure that everything is well stocked  and ready for customers, cleaning drive-thru and front cashier areas, taking and giving out orders, and preparing fresh and hot sandwhiches for the customers. I learned how to treat the actual like its my own home as more of an incentive to keep every area clean and everything stocked and orderly. I also learned by any means necessary to respect my manager and aid him/her in running successful and efficient shifts. It became significant to also become accountable and beiing a team player to insure consistency in business performance and accountability. The hardest part of the job is actually closing the food station at night because it requires alot of work throughout your shift that consists of constant cleaning and stocking, but the most enjoyable part in entertaining the customer with a positive attitude and a sense of urgency when preparing their order."
good,Went through five managers in the time I was there. No one knew what they were doing. Also would work from open to close just to be called back in first in the morning
good,The wages they pay are not commensurate with the amount of work they need you to get done with limited staffing.
good,"Great place to work, benefits are awesome. A typical consist of providing world class customer service."
good,over all working at starbuck was ok although i seek a career change and didnt really think the management was all that great
good,Working with customers to make sure they have the best coffee experience.
good,"Starbucks was a great opportunity for myself. I usually opened the store and made sure everything was in order for our morning rush. I was the ""go-to"" partner for unhappy customers because of my ability to deliver amazing customer service with a smile, even while being sworn at and threatened. Unfortunately, there was nothing I could do about unruly customers, except file a statement after the fact. The most enjoyable part of being a barista is building relationships with regular customers."
good,"It was a stable job to work for Starbucks Corporation. Most of my co-workers were nice. Management was different on the other hand. Not nice, pushy, mean and controlling. You never got a meal break or a 10 minute break on time."
good,"great place to work.  I enjoyed the 5yrs. with morrisons and starbacks great experience. In all i can say a lesson learned, became a real adult there."
good,"fast paced, good memory skills, overall learning to mulity task n communication with customers. great introduction with customer service industry."
good,"I enjoyed this job. My average day depended on the shift I had as I did openings, mid-shift, and closing shifts. I was responsible for setting up pastries, brewing coffee, cleaning washrooms, the frontage of the store, dishes, and the back end and espresso machines. I also cashiered, mixed drinks, prepared food and stocked products. When I started with the company the store I was initially hired for had a fire, and then the manager who hired me left, during the period I started working we received a new manager who then left within the month for another job, we then received a new manager who was promoted, and received another new manager. It isn't that any of the management was bad, but that I never really got to experience much long-term management, primarily random supervisors as stand-ins managed. The one issue I had with working at Starbucks was that I often had to swing shifts between opening and closing, this would mean at times that I left work at 11:30pm, and had to be back for 5:00am this caused a certain amount of stress on my life which is why I rated the balance low. I had no problem working either shift, I just did not enjoy swinging with a short period from one to the other. Aside from that the benefits were really good, however for a city like Vancouver the salary was very low, and it was a barely livable wage (in most other cities the wage would have been decent)."
good,"cashier, cook, clean, prep etc. "
good,"50% of my job is creating hand crafted beverages for our customers, the other 50% is cleaning and sanitizing. This is a great place to work, but the new manager does not do a good job keeping the employees focused and motivated."
good,"Paper work, computer work, scheduling appointments, filing papers. Management was good, easy to work with on scheduling and other issues that may arise. Co-workers were nice to work with. Hardest part: Learning new computer programs on a regular basis. Most enjoyable part: having things in order at the end of the day."
good,Starbucks was a great place for me to hone my customer sewrvice and training skills.
good,High stress job that was customer and fun oriented. High turnover rate which lead to burnout in partners and upper management stress.
good,I only stayed at Starbucks during the spring because I didn't want to spend the whole summer working there.
good,It depended on what location you worked in and in what district. I worked in 3 different districts under a handful of store managers and each experience was different.
good,"Each day is filled with focus on customer service execution and excellence. I have learned the importance of driving service over speed and creating that third place environment for each customer. The job is quite simple but can be made complicated due to the lack of updated computer systems for the managers, but the tenured managers get used to it."
good,Too longs hours and locations were not ideal.
good,It gave me the opportunity to meet and interact with people. I had good coworkers but the management was not the best.
good,"Learned how to manage multiple stores at a time, how to deep dive into P & L management. Opened numerious stores throughout the valley while being successful in running multiple stores. Taught new employees how to become successful managers, taught classes on coffee knowledge."
good,"make sure you are ready to stand up for yourself, because no one at that store will for you. Yes, they work as a team and the other partners are wonderful to work with, but the management is two faced and backstabbing. The whole store just quit, besides about 4 baristas. If the management would learn respect, maybe they could retain their best employees."
good,Early mornings and late nights . Co workers and management are all fun to be around but the hours are difficult to get adjusted to at first.
good,"If you do not want a career yet, for instance you are in school, this is a fine job. If you are an adult who would like to advance your life into a positive and healthy career Starbucks is not the place. Though it is a nice place to work if you need a part time job and benefits."
good,"Though their jobs and training all encompass great morals and viewpoints, they aren't as considerate as they make themselves out to be. The manager would make promises that would not be kept, and they would get as much as they could for as little as they could give. Great atmosphere, but too much work for too little pay that actually affected my health."
good,Most horrible experience. The Philadelphia market was awful. The leadership team only cared about them and could care less about your development. Hard pass!!
good,"It is everything you would expect from a typical foodservice job at a large chain. Nothing special, mostly just robotic and repetitive tasks. Maybe a conversation here and there with other coworkers, a few of which who strived to make the work culture a little more fun and exciting."
good,"La marca es excelente, los productos de calidad. A pesar de tener un sistema de reconocimiento no ven lo comprometidos con la compañía que estan los empleados en las cosas que no ven del día a día."
good,Very political. Management doesn't help with company advancement past a store manager role. Very limited options when wanting to move up unless willing to move to Seattle.
good,A typical day would start at 4:30am in the morning. The store is very fast pace and the customers are not the nicest. Some people who work also make it hard for you to work.
good,"many pros but many cons. the barista side of this job is exciting as there is new skills to learn. hwoever, management side is stressful due to the fast paced staff turnover."
good,"An excellent first job, Starbucks with the right team of people is highly social and upbeat. There's an infectious love for the 'Coffee Experience' that most team members share, and constantly new things to learn, which make it enjoyable. There are also Guaranteed raises, though they only tend to be a few cents."
good,"Upon starting the interview for the job, the store manager had promised me a management position. After being hired, she told me that the positions had all been filled. Just before the store had opened up, she confessed that the position had not been filled, that she just wanted to compare me to someone else she had seen as more suitable"
good,Unhealthy work environment. Starbucks management by store manager and district manager needs major improvement. Store manager should be the leader and more present when they are needed but chose not to be bothered and prioritize their personal life more than the store they should have had under control. The DM has many excuses up their sleeve to dissolve unwanted issues.
good,"Making drinks under a time limit, while keeping the work space clean. Partners tend to dump all their beliefs and thoughts on you no matter how many times they are told to stop. Always drama"
good,"Starbucks is okay, but I wouldn't recommend it for a full time job or your only job depending on your location. It's a good job if you're in school very flexible with your schedule. However, it's very hard to get promoted, especially if you don't fit in, and the pay isn't so much as expected. The pay raise is very small as well."
good,"While I worked at Starbucks, the manager of the store was very awful to work with. They would consistently make it their life's mission to make everyone miserable and feel incompetent about their work ethic. This led to high staff turnover and unnecessary stress at a job that is already high-paced and stressful as it is. I enjoyed this job when the manager went on leave for an extended period of time!"
good,"It is a nice company to work for but like every other company and, at their managers choosing, would a lot of the wrong people advance because of favoritism. It was an easy job with work that was thoughtless. Once you got it down, you had it."
good,"Work itself was very energetic and fun, but the people I worked with all really rude and aggressive. When I was first hired there everyone was nice and helpful, but as time went on there was a apparent disdain everyone had for each other."
good,It's a good job for part time work but if your overall aspiration isn't to be a store manager then pursue long term goals in spare time. Can easily work around a college schedule.
good,"I did not work at Starbucks for long, it was a decent job that sometimes became stressful when there was a large queue and a shortage of staff. They pay was minimum wage which is definitely not enough to live off in the area. Especially if, like me, you worked there when you were under 18. The main issue for me, personally, was that no one told me about having to clean the (always filthy) toilets until after I had accepted the job. It's a barista job, not a cleaner job, so I felt they should have told me beforehand as it wasn't made clear.  Apart from that, it's not a bad place to work. Management at the time was always very reasonable and easy to get on with."
good,"Great place to work, teaches you many effective skills in a fast paced environment that’s always growing. Great employee environment with lots of support for personal growth"
good,the work load was not bad and the way the drinks were presented made it easy to remember them. The company taught cleanliness and constant improvement.
good,"Retail partners are mostly friendly, supportive and passionate. However, management is generally clueless and seldom resolve problems efficiently. Keep in mind, there is a reason Starbucks offers such great benefits: incentive. There are certain policies that blatantly prioritize company image over partner wellbeing, in my opinion. Overall, the job is fulfilling but not for those who cannot handle a lot of pressure."
good,"Une journée type commence à environs 8H-8H30 par la mise en place des produits en vitrine et le lancement des machines à café ,  Nous somme entre 2 et 3 sur une mâtiné . Nous faisons en général des journées de 7 heures avec 45 min de pause ."
good,"Have met some amazing people working here. But unfortunately, management is everywhere and does not care about the workers and because it is a joint Starbucks with Barnes and noble little is managed in the cafe portion of the building."
good,"there's lots of close knit friendships made "
good,It was a good company to work with but the work life balance is terrible. Management can range from great to awful depending on the store. It is a very stressful job.
good,loved working for Starbucks and the coworkers but management wasn't very good. I was a university student. Management said that was full time and would work around my school schedule but they only had me casual or not at all.
good,"depending on the tie of day it can be fast paced and hetic in the mornings slower at night unless there was something going on downtown, the customers are one of a kinds and thensome with attitudes  and bring there issues to the store and yell and call the staff names"
good,"The staff are normally great, but we all get super underappreciated. The manager is typically picking favourites and the favourites are typically the ones who do the least work, which makes it sting more. What makes it worthwhile is the usuals - the customers that come in every day with the same orders that you get to know very deeply and personally. It's incredible how they let you into their lives. I left Starbucks and when I come in sometimes and I see them they still greet me like their own child. It's amazing. You build real relationships with the customers, if not your fellow co-workers too."
good,"The people are very nice, but the pay isn't equal to what you are required to do and learn.  It is stressful when speed is of the essence and you haven't been given the training to do it and do it well."
good,"People were pretty rude to me at the beginning of my first shifts, specifically a shift supervisor. There was a lot of gossip and people were speaking to eachother in their own language. Most of them were Filipinos and it seemed like they were talking about me most of the time. I felt bullied and insecure working there. It was obvious that they showed a gate towards me and some days I didn't want to work because of them. Drive thru was the worst one customers expectations were too high and some just we're impatient it gave me anxiety."
good,"The customers don't treat you like you are human and make mistakes too. They are rude and make your job a lot harder because you have to be nice to them, but they are not nice to you. The management is messed up, because they are afraid to fire people for doing their job wrong."
good,"It's a pretty good job to put you through school or as just a ""job."" Many people quit or get promoted then step down because of the pressure. Lots and lots to remember.. Sometimes management is really good, (as in, store manager). Other times it can ruin the whole atmosphere of your team. Customers can be very uptight and rude. District managers and anything above are usually just about numbers and don't actuay know how to do our job."
good,"Starbucks has been by far one of the best jobs I have had. Our goal is to make sure that our customers feel welcome.  I learned to keep control over my emotions in a stressful environment.  Starbucks was always busy from 7am to 9am, which we called our peak.   I loved that I got to make connections with these everyday customers who stop to get coffee before they go about their day. I have made most of my closest friends from working at Starbucks, and I am not talking about the employees either. The customers and I have connected in a way I have never imagined. I have outgrown my shell. I use to be shy, now I will talk to anyone about anything.  "
good,"When I filled in at other stores I was much happier and felt more appreciated than when I worked at my home store. My manager was a nice guy but a terrible manager. He only cared/s about looking good to his higher ups and advancing as fast as he can, not about supporting the people under him."
good,"I have worked at the same Starbucks location for over a year. My experience is slightly different as we are an incredibly busy store, busiest in our district actually. The culture of the job itself, fellow baristas and managers tend to be very cool people. However, the actual job has too many tasks and expectations for the pay. The company is too worried about ""customer connections"" then the happiness of their partners."
good,"with a store manager who knows what they're doing, this job is beyond fun. its very customer orientated and a fast pace environment. you are constantly moving and always doing something whether its cleaning or making drinks or taking orders. you are encouraged to connect with the customers and make your store a welcoming place. you need to be fast with most things you do and a good memory."
good,I loved my coworkers and the fast pace environment. My only complaint would be the management. They had nothing under control and blamed baristas for things we could not control.
good,"Some managers were fantastic, others made you really feel less than human. Starbucks is really quite awful to many of its employees. They have a few nice things going for them but overall...wouldn't be a job i would recommend."
good,The hardest part of the job is that over a course of a year and a half there's been multiple superiors that have overseen the store with different visions and ideas that contradict each other and are inconsistent to the company's overall standards and values. The current store manager is too passively aggressive to cooperate with to the point where it feels mentally draining.
good,"Coworkers sometimes become family and are always willing to help out. I have a great time interacting with customers and building new relationships. Great work place,"
good,"working at Starbucks you learn your basic skills such as multitasking, problem solving and customer service. It’s fast paced and you will be challenge."
good,"A typical day is usually understaffed and honestly hard work. It's difficult to meaningfully connect to customers especially when the majority of my customers have no desire to create meaningful connections and would rather have their drink and leave as soon as possible. The regulars I have are wonderful individuals that make the work experience better. I love my coworkers, but management needs help."
good,"I no longer work for Starbucks but when I did the only real perks were the friends I made and the free coffee. Everything else was stressful all the time. We never had enough staff, the staff we did have was overworked and underpaid, and customers could be a real pain on busy days. Management wasn’t really there for us I felt like as a barista. I wouldn’t recommended applying there until things can improve."
good,"I use to enjoy this company, but it only takes one bad seed in upper management to ruin an entire store, or district. There are surveys they send out weekly to partners, and management needs to look closer into their team if all the surveys are coming back with low scores."
good,"I found Starbucks does do a lot of things right like cleanliness, product standardization, having a structure, enjoyable partners (co-worker) and customers. But it comes with a lot of stress."
good,Usually flexible in terms of work life but management has and will probably remain exceedingly inferior. Usually the hardest part is remembering every drink but the job mostly requires repetition to excel. Management in store may vary by location; District Managers usually aren't great.
good,Have fun and make great connections with both baristas and customers. You’ll find it’s easier once you get the hang of all of those drinks on the menu. Everyone here is happy to help you out!
good,This job is stressful in big cities and coworkers can get passive-aggressive. The amount of work that a barista has to do is worth far more than minimum wage and 1 30 minute break after 6 hours.
good,"Schedules are all over the place. Each week is different so it's very hard to plan things in advance. Hard to promote. Even if higher management believes you are fit for a higher position, you have to go through a ridiculous and unfair assessment. Only plus is the benefits that you receive working here."
good,You must be able to multitask at Starbucks! You will serve hundreds of customers each day. Memorize their menu and learn coffee and espresso related drinks.
good,"The workplace itself was very nice my only issue is management, we have very poor management and very poor pay. Also the supervisor is not very professional and hard to communicate with."
good,"It is not a corporate store so you don't get any benefits that regular Starbuck's employees get, it is very relaxed and hours are flexible though. Gets busy in summer, but other then that the management is chill."
good,"This is a great company to work for while you are in school or just starting your adult life.  Being a barista or a shift is a wonderful journey.  However, management is hard to break into and they expect a lot out of you that other companies do not."
good,"As soon as you clock in you will be hustling. Shifts were fast paced, but fun and somewhat hectic. Management was often overbearing and not faithful in shift leads. Co-workers were all friendly and very hard working."
good,"Work experience depends on competency of DMs and store management, which both vary greatly across stores/districts. While there are good benefits for students; including health insurance, and online tuition reimbursement for their approved University, the pay is low, and raises are scarce."
good,The food and beverage are amazing ! Working there on another hand might differ depending on how fast you can work. Starbucks provides great benefits including paying for college! And 401k and more.
good,"Worked as a barista trainer, responsible for training and helping new baristas."
good,"Great stepping stone for career building and establishing a strong work ethic/skillset. High stress environment, with no work based incentives and unrealistic standards. Great benefits package and hierarchal structure for accountability, but little in the way of meaningful impact towards quality of life and balance."
good,"This was a great work experience and great for people with busy life styles. They have some benefits for after you've worked there for a year. "
good,"must be willing to clean, but the environment is fun. Making drinks is fun and the most wonderful time of year is Christmas of course. would recommend for high school/college job."
good,"Working for Starbucks was good at barista level, but upon moving into management, things get worse. Very high pressure job with lots of young,  inexperienced managers. i enjoyed working with the teams as the staff were all lovely but work life balance is not good working here. No day off, even when you are off work you are being pestered and asked to come to work."
good,"- Its a cool place to work if you are a college students since all your coworkers are college students. The hours are very flexible, it depends what time your store opens because each store has different hours."
good,"A typical day, depending on location, is fast-paced with heavy customer traffic. This position helps you to learn how to work in a fast paced environment and how to grow a thicker skin. Having worked at a few different locations, there will always be an issue with management. It just depends on how you handle it. Workplace culture is generally friendly, but it can depend on how the location is as well. As far as that just work hard, be friendly, and don't get sacked into drama. Hardest part was trying to do multiple positions later in the day when it was still busy but we were down to fewer people. Most enjoyable part was making people happy by serving them good coffee."
good,"La empresa puede mejorar bastante, sobre todo en el area de rrhh, la preocupación por sus trabajadores, y en mi caso, gerentes y contratistas externos."
good,"If you are looking to stay and actually get into the culture of it all you can do that with great success. On the other hand if staying part time is what you want to do I would say it tends to become a bit much, due to all of the things you need to know and what is expected of you."
good,"I learned a lot and enjoyed the people. Worked hard, helped my co workers and received good feedback on my work ethic. Customers were friendly and pay was good."
good,"It was fine. There were good moments and terrible ones, like any job. The benefits are good. (Long term activated, the longer you're with the more benefits you should have.) The pay is average, minimum wage plus minor tips. The best part is your coworkers, and worst part is management and corporate agendas."
good,This company was somewhat okay to work for.  The overall company mission is a strong one but the organization has changed a lot since Howard Schultz left the firm.  The focus is not more on profit than taking care of its people.
good,"interview was great, my first year was great learn a lot about the company culture, and the management team in general. my second year we had a new regional manager and thats when i started disliking the job, we went for the company culture and there was a lot of distrust on the management team."
good,"What I said in the review summary is all that needs to be said. There were times I didn't get any breaks when I was working a ten hour and when I had told them about a shift supervisor abusing their power, not doing their job, and making others do it, he did not get reprimanded."
good,"I was only Christmas staff but i enjoyed working in this environment. I only done dishes and restocked products, although it was necessary at this busy time. The staff were nice and helpful."
good,"i didn't have the best time with Starbucks but i do have a lot f good things to say about the company, some of my negative experience was just circumstance and timing and if i were to go back there now Im sure id enjoy it more"
good,"At my store,  it’s a hot mess. shift leads messing with baristas, high school drama, gm only cares about the numbers so she can have her bonus, hires and keeps lazy baristas, and gm shows blatant acts of favoritism. if i could transfer to another store i would but my gm blatantly told me that she wouldn’t recommend me to any of her peers so i’m stuck until i quit. "
good,"Starbucks was a good place to work, decent environment. But management had some issues with favoritism and the pay was awful for the work you did. Received zero benefits, and they weren't very willing to work with your schedule"
good,What I started out at the Starbucks warehouse I made $11.25hr 40 hours a week I would you paid weekly after taxes about $400 is cool pay 4 person still trying to be going to school in keeping a job skills a good 1st time job.
good,"non discriminatory environment but very high stress and not as fun to work as the training is to take. the management I had required me to do the things I was bad at to get ""practice"" but I was just unsuccessful because of the way I am and they don't give you much say on your responsibilities of the day. very bossy."
good,"Good place for a first job or entry level, very hard to get into management and make a career, depends on how well you network for management. Some of the best benefits for a part-time job, but is very hard to become an assistant store manager or store manager."
good,"I was Supervisor there for a short time."
good,"Loved working with everyone there.  Hourly rates are excellent.  Salaried folks do not get overtime pay.  High turnover in hourly and supervision. Lack of proper training. Management/company is hypocritical. Company preaches about work life balance but forces everyone to work overtime.  Preaches ""people first"" but would rarely work with your schedule if you need to take care of issues."
good,"I've enjoyed most of my time at Starbucks, but the pay really does not make up for everything you do. It is extremely fast-paced, so you must work fast and confidently. From managers asking you to do extra work, stay behind without being paid, to guilting you into working when you're really sick, it's just poorly run from higher ups - so much focus is put on cutting costs, it really takes away from actually enjoying the job. Experience will vary store to store, with some stores having a good culture to others being so poor people quit after the first shift. Additionally, do not work here if you care about the environment - there is literally SO much wastage, it's morally awful to work here. Everything from food, milk, water and plastic is wasted daily if not hourly, which takes a toll. However, even with poor management, bad hours and extreme wastage, if you have a good team at your store, you'll form lifelong bonds - the culture at Starbucks is great between baristas, I guess bonding over how bad things can get really strengthens friendship."
good,"At the beginning of my time at Starbucks, I was really enjoying it and started to bond more with my coworkers, as well as gaining fast pace readiness and multitasking. But through time, management was becoming more and more of a problem, and the amount of work hours I requested were not getting respected. This resulted in me prioritizing work over my education, which is what I came to the city to do. After two horrible managers, the work environment became extremely toxic, and our last manager was just the tipping point, which caused 6 of my coworkers to quit, including myself. The job in general was great, and I loved my coworkers, but management was the snowball effect that made it toxic."
good,They have great benefits but only to full time employees! The management could have been better. I left because I wasn’t getting the hours that I needed.
good,"I worked for starbucks for over 2.5 years. My first manager was fantastic but he ended up moving shortly after I started. I then jumped around to a few stores and got stuck with a few terrible managers for latter 2 years of my time at starbucks. Ultimately, the job itself is fantastic, fun, and a great time, but the manager will make or break your experience."
good,"I loved Starbucks until I moved to a store that doesn't adhere to any of corporate's standards. If the staff is bad, the experience is bad, which is disappointing and hard to see unless you start working there."
good,management only cares about themselves and bettering themselves not the employees. They dont really follow your availability and change whenever they want.
good,A lot of stress to handle for below minimum wage. Customers treat you like dirt and drink routine can become hectic when there are a lot of customers. On the up side coworkers work together and try their hardest to make the shift as easy as possible as long as you ask for help someone will be there. Its fun working there but I would never go back.
good,"I started as a barista at Starbucks, with about 2 years of coffee-experience (though experience is not necessary). For the first 1-2 years, it was generally a great place to work, but as I became a more experienced employee, and took on greater responsibilities, the amount of stress in a single shift became too much to tolerate. The company does not pay you nearly enough for the amount of bullsh*t you have to put up with. Management is unconcerned with lower-tier issues (workplace environment, customer interactions, general pay/raises). The company expects a MASSIVE amount of work for very moderate pay. Tips were okay sometimes, but still not worth the stress. Fellow employees were crying at work on a regular basis, 8+ year partners were quitting at a moments notice, and the general environment of the store became toxic. Even after multiple employees, including myself, voiced concerns to management, nothing was done to better the store. "
good,"When I started working for the company in 2004, it was much different.  Management seemed to care more about employees.  Now it seems like all they care about is having bodies on the floor. There's constantly more being added to the to-do list and less time to accomplish everything."
good,The Problem is that the opportunity in growth in Starbucks is slim. There's the some things that they force us to achieve thing that is on high demand.
good,Working for Starbucks can be really fun but as of lately it has become difficult to work there with employees leaving and no managers. It has become pure chaos on some days. normally its lovely when all staffed and stocked
good,"There are definitely favourites and they receive more hours and good treatment from the manager and shift leads. I love starbucks as a company, and the benefits are amazing, but the store I worked at drove me away from the company and really left a sour taste in my mouth. Talk with the store manager you would work for, and the shift leads to get a feel for their personalities before you choose to work there. It really varies from store to store."
good,"Opening in my region takes place at 5 a.m. so I hope you enjoy early mornings. In 30 minutes the bars have to cleaned and set up, teas and coffees need to be brewed fresh, the pastry case and warming station fridge as well as the refrigerated retail need to be filled and the tills/safe counted and set up. People will line up to wait for you to open. Starbucks is considered a symbol of status, not coffee, so I hope you also enjoy being treated poorly and talked down to on a regular basis. I rated 5 stars on job security because I had a manager for 8 months that literally yelled at customers and partners and nothing was done about them by management despite numerous employee and customer e-mails. So, you have to really, REALLY want to leave to lose your job. The hardest part of the job is maintaining an enthusiastic demeanor and upholding the ever growing list of company standards. I feel that I have a very out of the ordinary experience for the company. That being said, Starbucks does have an extensive list of excellent benefits, from the C.U.P. fund, which is an emergency fund made up of donations FROM partners FOR partners in case anything where to happen to you, to things as crazy as Paternity Leave. The only problem is that you have to enroll for these benefits in August and have to have worked for the company for at least 3 months prior. Which means that if you miss it, you have to wait until the next year for your chance to get that health insurance you were after."
good,If you don't have employees who do the same amount of work as you put in. It will be super hard to get through the day. But once you have regulars they really help and understand you a lot.
good,Way too much micromanaging. Corporate company with corporate rules. Lots of verbal abuse by customers that you have to endure or you'll get written up
good,"Rough hours for little pay. Tips vary wildly, when I started I was told that the tips would beef up my check to be comparable to $14 an hour at that location, which was a straight up lie. When I worked here they only started at $9.50 (I've heard they've since raised it so i'll give them that) but I opened at 3:30 am for less than $10 an hour so keep that in mind. :/"
good,Not really the company most think it is- not a lot of knowledge or processes in place. No real culture-Majority of  Leadership is young and have no actual knowledge of how to be a leader-
good,"i enjoyed my regulars and coworkers for the most part. The work can get overwhelming at times but if you stay focused and every one works as a team then its not so bad, and can actually be kinda fun."
good,"Starbucks has become so huge, it has become hard for them to escape the trappings of a regular fast food place. There used to be much more focus on creating a memorable and delightful experience for everyone. People just want their orders fast now. A lot of the magic is gone. "
good,I had a poor experience with the manager. She seemed overly biased to specific employees and constantly berated me about my work ethic despite my ability to operate efficiently and effectively.
good,"The Starbucks I work at is in the airport and my manager is barely in the store and is always over working her employees and unnecessarily always sending people home regardless of their need for hours and always changing up the schedule without telling anyone , everything is so confusing and chaotic"
good,"It was a part time job exiting highschool. I worked part time to full time variety, but pay then wasn’t that great.  But enjoyed the time being around customers building my customer service experience helping them with their needs and desires"
good,"Mostly they expect you to work pretty hard for incredibly low pay. I liked parts of my job but there was always pressure to work faster, and I often felt as though someone was looking over my shoulder."
good,I was always on my feet and required to be doing something so that productivity was always high. I often also taught art classes for younger kids and for the summer camp art program.
good,"My store in particular was just hostile all around, management didn't do anything about it. I felt bullied into quitting, both by management and my peers. Floors are understaffed and tense."
good,"The main reason for leaving is that most Starbucks managers, or at least the ones in my district are petty, lazy, rude and illogical. The pay doesn’t cover most of anything but with the exception that the benefits are good. Coworkers are the only lifeline to staying there happily."
good,"I loved my coworkers but I did not agree with management and how the CEO wanted the company to be run. The way we were treated by some customers also made the job rough, but our regulars were so amazing and sweet."
good,"working at Starbucks was stressful however it did teach me a lot of patience and many skills including communication. "
good,"The job is good , making drinks feels good . But working at the airport will destroy you. They overwork you. Besides, most of the time they are understaff."
good,"Wish the pay was better, could not live off $8.20/hr for my family. Great education benefit. Love that they try to hire as many military and their spouses as they can."
good,"Starbucks is a very stressful and very chaotic work place that isn't for everyone. It isn't the dream job most customer think it is. Some coworkers are very helpful and do there best, others call out most of the time. Training that was suppose to take two weeks is now reduced to four days, which makes the new baristas not nearly as prepared for the chaotic work environment. Great benefits is all it really how going for it."
good,"The management at Starbucks is extremely political, utilizing favoritism in day-to-day execution of both local and corporate policy. My coworkers and I experienced both positives and negatives as a result of said politics, which resulted in a very unprofessional work setting."
good,"I really learned how to communicate with people and really enjoyed getting to know our guests and seeing the community grow from year to year.  I had guests that would follow me from location to location (in Chattanooga, TN) and chose to continue to get their favorite beverages prepared by me because I knew exactly how to make them happy. For me, the customer interactions alone made it completely worth it. But, I cannot be positive in my experience from the store I left, due to lack of communication, the willingness to uphold standards, general laziness, and the inability to enforce disciplinary standards."
good,"It can be really bithering and stresfull when working with people that have not been trained properly. If you are lucky and your store is well managed, it is a great job."
good,Fast paced hard working environment people especially customers are not friendly when your in training. Not much training your expected to learn most yourself. Co workers are not always friendly and sometimes very rude. Work to many hours to have a family life.and NO TIPS which is ridiculous considering the effort you put in and the customers you deal with.
good,"Store was different as it was done on a government installation.  A lot of policies and procedures were different, although at this store there were suspicions of the management doctoring their hours to fatten their pay checks. The manager that was there when I left edited my hours so that I did not receive all of my Sunday pay hours."
good,working hours are flexible but management depends on who is in charge
good,"Busy work, fast pass, customer service environment. Management needs a little work. And the pay needs to be more than it is right now. Otherwise ok job."
good,"Starbucks is a great company. The company mission statement and values however are not always reflected in the decisions made by the regional leadership team ( directors and VP). I was disappointed to see discrimination, bias and a lack of integrity and accountability at this level."
good,"Though I learned a lot, the management there was hard to handle as you get talked down to a lot and rather than being helpful and supportive and understanding, it was never like that. You had to learn things fast and be expected to know how to do your job, and if you didn't, you got made to feel like you lacked intelligence."
good,"As long as the people you work with are agreeable, you will have a blast working here. Management was unstable, lack of communication, picking favorites. Good steady work."
good,"The farther you work from corporate the worse things are. That being said, its not a bad job. Just not much room to advance. I need more words so here are the more words that I need."
good,"Management was poor and needed help, under staffed almost all time. Busy and fast paced job, would work alone on a busy day for hours, fast to learn things, promptly easy"
good,"otherwise, well you can tell how it would be. "
good,"Starbucks came about at a time when the “third place” was a new concept, and they pioneered it. They showed that you can care about your employees even if they don’t work tons of hours, you can give them insurance, help them with education, and opportunity to advance. That was how Starbucks started."
good,"I worked for Starbucks for 2 years. For the first year it was a lot of fun. Then it went downhill fast.  The only reason I stayed with the company was for the health insurance. We were expected to make excellent customer connections but were only allowed 32 seconds per customer to do so. Morning shifts were allowed 7-8 partners on the floor at all times while afternoon and evening were only allowed 3 and were expected to make the same speedy connections. Store manager played favorites and would only train or advance partners in her age group and that she was friends with outside of work. You had to maintain 520 hours every 6 months for insurance. I went on leave of absence for surgery I needed and when I came back I was denied hours and lost my family’s health insurance. When I filed a complaint with corporate, nothing ever came of it even though they claimed they would investigate."
good,A very hard place to work I’d you don’t have a mind of steel as customers can really wreck morale for the crew. Short breaks and typically overworked days along with nagging to rude customers (have had garbage thrown and sworn at before) can be very belittling to the point of quitting.
good,"Good environment, Great work ethic, friendly partners"
good,"I used to work mornings a lot. Customers would come in a bit on edge and have different attitudes. typically as a barista I just adjusted and gave them the best customer service  I could. Giving out coffee or working the register, always with a smile."
good,"In this city, Starbucks is one of the lowest paying jobs. You cannot make a living wage, and in order to make that bare minimum as a normal employee, you would have to be a partner for a long time if the opportunity was offered at all. This company hires managers not only outside of the company, but out of state as well. The benefits are great, if you could ever afford them on this salary alone. The management is all over the place, and morale is low."
good,Corporate office: Not a lot of room for advancement in the tech areas. People don't move on from roles and new BU's aren't created. Doesn't seem to be a culture of developent.
good,"You are worked to the bone because there is not enough staff to help you. Starbucks is so quick to cut staff. Furthermore, you're only paid $9 / hour while working a max of 24 hours at my store. So I am unable to make money after paying my student loans. There is also no opportunity for advancement unless you live and breathe Starbucks. You can make it to be a shift and make $1 more / hour, but don't expect to make it any further. Working at this job every day feels like a nightmare, but working every only occasionally is much more manageable without killing your last nerve. "
good,It was a highly stressful workplace due to high tensions between employees. The drama was a huge factor in the daily workplace life. It wasn't something I entirely appreciated.
good,"Working at Starbucks was a great way to gain customer service skills and practice working under pressure. I made great friends there as well. My only complaint was that my training never felt complete, and there was things I still felt I never learned by the time I left."
good,a place to work on your social skills and learn how to multitask in a fast paced environment. Learn what exactly goes in each special drink as well as learn the culture about coffee
good,Upper management does not support store managers. Work life and home life does not balance out well. I was constantly working 45-60 hours a week. Upper management only supported if something went wrong.
good,The other employees are great and very relatable because we can all agree that we have terrible managers. We never even had an actual manager for our section over in Starbucks until about a month before I left after someone stole my wallet out of clerical.
good,The management was awful and unwilling to work with schedules. They scheduled you for shifts outside of your availability and refused to let you swap shifts.
good,"A typical day is fairly busy, strenuous, and fast paced. You learn how to talk quickly and listen closely. I learned how fast paced a drive thru store can really be as well as being able to conduct myself in a professional manner."
good,"Starbucks overall was a fun company to work for. Yes, it was very stressful and busy most of the time but by the end of the day everything was okay. Each employee is offered a free food item and unlimited drinks during each shift. We also receive a free coffee mark out every week which allows us to take home a free pound of coffee or tea. Working at Starbucks takes a lot of hard work and time to get used to the physically and mental stress that this job takes. It may seem like just a fast food coffee chain but the employees work extra hard to maintain drive times, quickly craft quality beverages, maintain the stores cleanliness, stock necessary items for baristas, and more. Personally, I feel that the baristas and shift supervisors should be paid more for what they have to deal with on a daily basis."
good,"I loved working as a barista and making people smile. It was the best part of my day seeing people that were excited to see me on the bar making their drinks. I loved connection with customers and most of my fellow baristas. I was disappointed in the lack of advancement opportunity, despite how many shifts I would take, how many times I would offer or ask to learn new skills or take new classes. This lead to work-life ratio being off for little to no growth within the company."
good,"I worked hard but For me, There was no career development for me in Starbucks. I'm not too sure on what to say. I liked it when I first started but when I realized there were no potential raises or career development for myself."
good,"The benefits are great at starbucks, depending on if you plan on utilizing them or not. The work atmosphere tends to be filled with young drama and angry customers."
good,"good job to have while in school"
good,"Managers and district managers have been on the decline there is high pressure to promote staff but they aren’t ready and are not qualified. The company says that they are all about the partners but they have been steadily reducing benefits and increasing payments and decreasing raises over the past few years.  "
good,"The sheer number of meetings is ridiculous! In some departments, few people are willing to make a firm decision and if they are it's often ill-informed. Then there's the ladder climbing, boot kissing, yes people who won't jeopardize the next promotion by taking a stand on ANYTHING. "
good,"Getting a pound of coffee each week was a delight and your regular customers can be amazing or the bane of your existence. Fast-paced so you need to be level headed, not stress easily and ask questions if you don't understand the customer's order. Believe me, they will let you know how they like it!"
good,This job was good to help get me through my college years. But when people want to move up there is not much of an incentive. You make barley 2 dollars more then a barista with alot more responsibility.
good,"I have been working for starbucks for 2 years. I loved it at first but I got a new manager and let’s just say I don’t really like my job anymore. They expect way to much of you, and the pay isn’t worth all the fuss."
good,"I came to Starbucks with high hopes - my cousin is a former shift supervisor at a high-volume city store. I started at a low-volume cafe store, and eventually we were all relocated to a mid-volume drive through."
good,"My manager sucked. she fired me without ever giving me a warning that my job performance was bad. I went to management, and because she's under investigation, I'm not allowed to work for the company. I only miss the benefits though."
good,"Opened the store, set up ovens, coffee carafes and started the brews for the day. Counted the registered and prepared them for the morning rush hour. Stocked supplies. Learned a lot of time management, customer service skills and teamwork"
good,Very chaotic and unstructured. Fun part was having different drinks to make. The not so fun part was making so many drinks at an unreasonable pace with complaints of not being as fast.
good,"The work environment is not suitable for advancement of any kind. I liked interacting with people daily, this was my favorite part of the job. I believe that Starbucks has helped me grow because it has made me realize that I need to have more meaning in my work life."
good,"I really enjoyed working for Starbucks for a very long time. Interacting with customers and leading a team is my bread and butter. Unfortunately after being transferred to another store to re-prove my ability to do a job I was already doing but not getting paid for, I decided it was time to make a change. If every store and manager lived up to the mission statement of the company, working for the siren wouldn't be nearly as aggravating and frustrating as it was for me. I was passed over for a promotion specifically because the other candidate threatened to quit if she was passed over again. Soured me to the whole company. It didn't help that I was then sent to fix a problem store with the same title and no pay raise."
good,"I've worked at Starbucks for the past 2 years. There is really no room for job advancement and the pay is definitely not worth everything you go through working there. I love my job and what I do but for a whopping 9.50 an hour, that is 100% not a livable wage for where I live. I also have had major problems with a Shift Supervisor because he would say very inappropriate things to me and my store manager had the audacity to blame it on me. I love what I do. I love people. But this job has taken my soul."
good,"great place to work if you have common sense and ability to follow health code standards "
good,on a normal day i would open and be working alone for most of the morning rush. co owrkers were hardly on time and managers were hard to keep at the location. dress code was supposed to be strict but there was never any management to enforce it. Did too much work for not enough pay.
good,"My experience at Starbucks was mostly positive. It was fun, fast paced, with good benefits and pay. The culture at Starbucks was the best I’ve ever experienced but Beware of the Western North Carolina area if you are a minority. The district manager there will not support you unless you are white, lgbt or female."
good,"My time at starbucks was in a transistion time for the company as a whole, people were slacking and the location was very understaffed. Sometimes I wouldn't get my tips under 3 or 4 days afters they were supposed to be given out. My time was very stressful, however it gave me a very good work ethic and skills, I am still a customer and do wish to see the company succceed."
good,Training was inadequate and daytime vs evening shift rivalries were not handled effectively. Often wrong behaviors were rewarded or punished. Weekly hours were often unpredictable.
good,Only stayed for my coworkers. Rude customers and poor management. The pay is way too low for how many things you had to do that day. Flexible hours though.
good,"Company began to have unreasonable expectations while cutting labor and resources. Stores are able to ""fall below radar"" and complaints to upper management have been ignored on multiple occasions."
good,"great company, I loved the customers, and getting to always meet new people.It was lots of fun I had quite a few really awful store managers throughout my 15 years there,  but I overall really enjoyed my time there!"
good,"Most shifts at Starbucks include cleaning, helping customers, and stock management. The work culture can vary from location to location. However, generally most co-workers are nice, yet there can be drama in work setting."
good,the people I work with everyday are great but the corporate managers are unengaged and unwilling to educate themselves about what happens in a store.  If I had a district manager who listened to partners I would most likely continue working there
good,"I worked inside a casino with little to no daylight, my manager once asked me to walk in a snowstorm after my truck hit an embankment and she herself had called in out the same day! Also I can understand how some people make management like head barista but honestly it’s supposed to take three weeks to train, my head barista didn’t want to watch me test so I ended up getting certified after two months. Catty females seem to pick and choose who to be nice too and if you’re off and come back to weird energy just know they talked bad about you those entire days off you had."
good,"I love starbucks always will and I definitely miss it. My first manager was awsome but the next not so great broken promises, favoritism, bullying, Starbucks is definitely not what it used to be especially now days they treat there employees not so good, work them to the ground and then expect more and lots of broken promises."
good,"The job advertises itself as a role that the individual can mold, but in reality you aren't given a lot of freedom to connect with customers or try new things. It's a good temporary job with great benefits for part-time employees."
good,"J’ai été formée paris pendant 2 semaines, puis 2 jours à Lyon et tout à commencer à dérailler, il faut se méfier des gens car on m’a planté des couteaux dans le dos et les supérieurs m’ont littéralement traité comme un chien, mon erreur a été de répondre, j'aurai du me laisser faire pour leur bon plaisir de se sentir supérieur. Arrivé à Nîmes, j’ai été écarté, personnels mal honnête, désagréable et supérieurs encore pire car ils me parlaient mal ce qui a été constaté par plusieurs clients. Le peu de temps que j’y ai passé j’ai quasiment fait que de la vaisselle."
good,I enjoyed working at starbucks and giving regular their customized drink every day. I just wish my manager was more genuine when it came to helping out or caring about personal experiences. She faked that and you could tell.
good,Great place to work for part-time work.  Good culture and work environment if you like fast paced customer facing careers.  Working directly with customers is a must at all levels.
good,Customer base of each store differs. Customer service in the coffee industry is relatively stressful. Company changes drinks and policies often. Management differs per store.
good,"-a typical day at Starbucks could be very busy most day and  and fun environment other days it could be rough "
good,"They have great benefits and are one of the best jobs in retail. However, it is not best for personal advancement. Starbucks tends to hire outside for upper management and it is nearly impossible to promote within past shift supervisor. They do work with your schedule and offer free schooling, but management will always choose the customer over you."
good,"A regular day at work was more about your speed and accuracy on customer orders.  A lot of people came just to see smiles and great attitudes.  I learned a lot about different types of beverages, Starbucks menus and customer situations.  Management was very relaxed and the workplace was fun.  The hardest thing about working at Starbucks was also not that hard but was just keeping the station clean 24/7 because of the fast pace moving environment.  In the end I love trying new things so the spontaneous array of beverages was the perfect place."
good,"The 5 years I was with starbucks there was a lot of growth but it was a struggle to get promotions, with delaying promised positions and a lot of he said/she said situations."
good,management often inattentive to never there shft leaders wil often gossip behind your back often unwilling to help people improve or try to find work arounds
good,"Working at Starbucks was a good experience and enjoyed my time here. Unfortunately didnt see eye to eye with all management of the business.  "
good,"It is a very productive working environment however, the closing time puts strain on workers who have to come in the next day.  Two/Three partners would close the shop but leave around 00:00. It is very straining"
good,"It's got some nice benefits, but not worth the stress. I miss the people I worked with, though."
good,"If you are looking for a part time job I think Starbucks is great. For example if you are a student worker, but if you are looking to move up ranks, it might be difficult."
good,"Cliff notes?"
good,this is simply a good college job. but even then many times management was outsourced which did not benefit the functionality of the stores. supervisors and workers were always well rounded and worked cohesively. it was a comfortable environment and i appreciate the people i worked with but they need to work on their upper management culture and selection
good,"Starbucks is an enjoyable job, it is not to be underestimated. Typically you will be placed in a position, there are about 6 positions each day. The positions are Drive Thru Order (place orders in computer, gather food and drink as necessary), Drive Thru Register (tender out and hand out order), Register (place order in computer and tender out, gather food and drink as necessary), Bar ('build' drink), Customer Support (resupply areas, clean lobby and dishes, help disperse bottlenecks in service), Order support (gather food and drink for Register/DT). This is typically ran by a store manager, assistant store manager or shift supervisor. The shift supervisors and baristas tend to be pleasant to work with. Management leaves a lot to be desired, depending on work experience, or morals I suppose. The culture is to be the best for our customers, basically. The hardest part of the job is to be happy for our customers while trying to advance, find hours and/or deal with incompetent management."
good,Les salons de café/thé sont nettement plus agréables pour les salariés que tout autre travail en fast-food.
good,"I liked the atmosphere and the people I worked with. I hated the pressure and stress that came with the job. However, it does depend on location. I would have stayed if it payed more, and at a less busy location. I do not think even the managers are paid enough for what they do, which is sad. Far from the worst place to work, but if you need something quick and would like the experience, I would recommend a Starbucks with no drive through."
good,"I have had times that I really enjoyed while working at Starbucks, but unfortunately the circumstances around me leaving were not enjoyable.The amount of drama created by coworkers created a toxic environment that made it impossible to continue working there. Also, the management was not supportive and allowed people to treat others badly."
good,"...it only works if the whole team is on board and the ship is not in autopilot!  By this I mean, there is too much passing of responsibility in a busier store."
good,"I liked the fast-paced environment, but there are not many opportunities for fast salary of position advancement. I also had 3 different managers during the 14 months I was there."
good,"It was always very stressful working environment. We were  sometimes under staffed, the line would be out of the door and our manager would just be sitting in the back doing nothing. We were always dealing with homeless people stealing things or people getting released from jail early in the am, because we were the only place open that early."
good,"The best parts of your day are spent with amazing coworkers and customers, but the job places a high level of stress upon the employees without enough pay for the expectations upon the workers. Work days were focused upon customer connection and cleaning the store. I learned lots about coffee and ways to develop my managing skills. Management can be very good or very bad depending upon the store."
good,Many of my coworkers were rude and training was not adequate. The work day was alright except for rushes while being alone. Very anxiety inducing for me.
good,Bad management at my location led to high employee turnover. Store being open until 2 am in a party neighborhood also lead to employee disatisfaction.
good,"Poor management and works aren't really considered very well, I would say you will get over working for the Target Starbucks pretty quickly. Great job for kids in school."
good,"Working in the fast food it is expected of you to be fast paced. However, to be fast paced and hardly get any compansation for that is unprofessional."
good,There are quite a few traits i will carry along my future journey and career learned from starbucks. I feel the culture need reinforcement on the day to day by the managers.
good,"Very flexible and understanding to your priorities. Great customer relationships. Always room for improvement. They change their ways every other week, if you are not a fast leaner might get lost in the bunch. Other then that drinks are all made the same, training is very easy with the right trainer."
good,Average part time job that pays minimum wage. They claim to be flexible with your schedule but you are often pressure to work well over the amount of hours you originally applied for and agreed to
good,I don't know how people work here for years on end. You never get to sit down and never get even a minute of rest when you work besides your lunch and the 10-minute break they have to give you. The training isn't nearly long enough and no one knows what they're doing for months after being hired. Management will also schedule you for 10-11 hour shifts. There also are never enough people working so you have to do 5 different things at a time. I dread going to work.
good,"I enjoy the act of making coffee beverages, however, there is much waste that does not entertain me. I'm mainly talking about the recyclable material that isn't recycled. I am the only one at my work who takes initiative by collecting the materials and taking them to my local recycle bins near my house."
good,"I believe that everyone should work in the food service industry once in their life, and this was my opportunity. Working fir Starbucks was a great learning experience for me. It's a wonderful stepping stone for young adults to begin getting work experience."
good,It was easy to get and I got the job quick but after a while it got tiring with not that much pay m. But you make friend and some customers are friendly but most of the customers are stuck up
good,It's a typical corporation. bottom line is the main focus. Staff is overworked underpaid. They want robots and it is a lot of performance. It is not some place i would recommend for anyone wanting a career. If you are a student and you need a pt job then absolutely but be prepared for the typical corporate culture
good,It is a great place to work. There is always something different to do there and there is never the same thing that happens there. You make a lot of interesting connections with customers.
good,It was a good experience.  As far as making money.  Didn't really see any benefits or opportunities to advance.  Got chances to work at other near by Starbucks.
good,The thing I hated the most was the lack of hours. I went to Guam for the military during the summer and I went from 35 hours a week to 15 hours. They claimed it was because it was the summer and it was slow and they had to be careful with hours. They would cut people our early if they needed to save money. So even if you have 35 hours you most likely won't get them because they are so critical with the hours everyone works they will make you leave if the morning was slow or the store didn't make enough money during your shift. As soon as they cut my hours I found a job that week and left. Almost everyone there works 2 or 3 jobs because you cannot afford to live off the pay unless you are a manager.
good,"Stressful environment where you take on several different roles throughout the day. Paid minimum wage. "
good,Bad management. Overstaffed and seemed to keep recruiting bad store managers. Training was focused more on how to write on cups than actually making coffees
good,"This company looks great to work for on the outside but as i've discovered it does not matter which location you go to, inside the store is always different. No matter the manager it always seems that on the surface they care about you; but the moment something happens that affects you coming to work that all changes even if you have been constantly on time and never call out."
good,you end up being just a partner number as leadership is clueless of what the people who are doing the real work really do and leaders end up making flawed decisions
good,"I loved working with the baristas and greeting customers. I got to learn a lot about the people I served, we’d exchange our experiences in the work place with each other. Our manager had a go-getter flex to him, which made the work environment very motivating and inspiring. I was able to grow close to some of the crew during my time there. I’d love to go back and work for Starbucks again someday."
good,"Working for Starbucks was a great experience. You get to interact with many different types of people. You learn from your mistakes. You learn how to be productive and efficient. With that being said, you are only as good as they want you to be. You are unable to move up or down the latter without the support of your manager. I did not have the support of this manger hence why I made the decision to leave."
good,"Starbucks does a great job in making people think it is great. The  company is lost in letting accountants and desk jockies make actual sales floor decisions. The store floor plans are made by people that clearly have never worked in a kitchen before. The company ""3rd place"" policies make it nearly impossible to effectively create a nice place for the common worker to do anything about dealing with problematic customers without being afraid of losing your job. It is extremely hard to get rid of lazy, corrupt, or simply bad workers and near impossible to get rid of bad managers. You better be careful and of conversation you have around your coworkers. They can report you to the corporate offices if they feel like your social or political opinions aren't ""creating culture."" Use this job to get a better job unless you enjoy a cultish atmosphere."
good,"Starbucks is a great place to get experience when entering the work force for the first time. Depending on the location, it is fast paced. You learn lots of customer service skills and multitasking. The fast food industry itself is exhausting, so you need to have thick skin and hopefully work with a great team, because that could make or break you. I started at 15 1/2. We are payed a little above minimum wage, which is fair. Tips can be pretty solid. However, I don't recommend staying here for too long unless you want to move up in the company."
good,"this job is great for people looking for work for the first time.  you receive great benefits, and flexible schedules. however, this job does not have great work/life balance."
good,"J'ai tellement appris sur le café !"
good,"I work at a Starbucks kiosk inside a Fred Meyers store, so this review is based on actual employment with Fred Meyer, not Starbucks.  As such, management by FM is **terrible**!!! The work environment was chaotic. Just to take a bathroom break meant having to wait for someone from the deli section (who managed the Starbucks when she could) to come and take over. That person did not necessarily have the proper training and would not be able to provide customer service as a result.  Because lunch breaks were mandatory, if there was no one to cover me, I was told to just turn off the lights and leave a ""be back soon"" sign.  The typical advancements touted by Starbucks for their employees is not available to me as a FM employee."
good,I've worked for the company for several years. Mostly as a shift. The benefits are awesome however you are asked to work hard for little pay. And some managers are unfair and inconsistent with treatment of staff.
good,Starbucks has flexible hours as to make life easier on students and/or part timers. Benefits were good but was unaware of how to obtain them as manager at the time was not forthcoming with information.
good,"The fellow coworkers make working at Starbucks. However, the management of Starbucks needs to listen to the baristas. The baristas are often overworked and it is about getting drinks out not about quality."
good,"If you're a team player, this job will work for you. You have to learn to work with others efficiently. It's face paced and methodical. I loved my coworkers, but the customers can wear you down- be prepared to be yelled or cursed at. My manager was quite horrible,so after I quick, I filed a complaint. Corporate was very quick to respond to my report and soon took action."
good,Fun job for a student... Also find job for someone who wants to make some extra cash on the weekend. Real cool benefits once you have been employed over 1yr.
good,"Starbucks is a fantastic first job, and many people view it as customer service boot camp: "
good,"A work day at Starbucks was very busy, we were very understaffed. However all the employees were hard working and create a great environment for working hard."
good,Starbucks is a fast paced job. Depending on your store it can be hard to move up some stores have a lot of turnover again most situations just depend on your individual store.
good,Crazy requests from customers can be emotional and unbearable if your team is not on your side. Coworkers can be unchecked and awful. Some glorious baristas do exist though!
good,This job can be stressful and hard. Newer hires are not trained properly and just thrown on the floor to figure things out. Management is usually poor. Most customers are rude and entitled and management does not usually back you up. Benefits are good for those with a family or living on your own but the pay should be increased. Not enough to live on.
good,The job gives great benefits to their employees and based on the crew you work with it can be very fun and easy. There's a lot of information to take in for this job so it might be a huge adjustment for some.
good,It is a pleasure to work here when it is staffed properly and you feel supported by the management. Can be stressful but the flexibility in the schedule and the benefits are worth it.
good,"barista great, shift manager awful, you barely make more and you do ALL of the same work as your higher ups especially if you had a drunk for one like mine worst part? I had to quit due to work harassment by a fellow employee as well as my DISTRICT MANAGER because I was a small girl with colored hair he constantly made me work harder and put me down for my hair and tattoos that are 100% allowed to work with"
good,Management was poor. Seemed more like a popularity contest then who did a good job. Loved the company just not where I worked. Would have liked the opportunity to relocate in the future.
good,Starbucks would have been a great job if I wasn't supporting myself working there. From poor management underutilizing their people to rampant tomfoolery my store was a mess. The manager really makes or breaks the store. Beware.
good,"Expect the unexpected."
good,"Fine place to work, sometimes. My favorite part of my day was seeing and talking to the regulars. Staffing issues led to poor training and very poor management."
good,"It is good for someone just starting in the work place, but I did not see a career there. Customer service, management was good, mostly young college students working there. Lots of cleaning all the time, meeting people was the best part of the job."
good,"I have only been working here for a little over 2 months, I try my hardest and I work really hard but people only seem to notice the things I couldn't get to or didn't have time to do. Or I get yelled at for things other people didn't do and they get upset with me and never confront the other people. It's very frustrating and tiring."
good,The job was great while I was in school as it provided flexibility to attend classes in the evenings or mornings.  My manager worked with me to help make sure my work and school schedules didn't conflict.
good,"I've had two different managers at Starbucks they have both been very lazy people who seem to not care for their jobs, they say they promote within but that is not true."
good,"Or let me say I love the company I work for. They have done so much for me. The job is fun and its something new to make handcrafted drinks.  I would recommend the job and company to others just not my store. It is a very stressful work environment and the management is not the best. There is no communication, the shift supervisors have no life, cant go to school have to have open availability, and cant have set days off. The company is amazing to work for. Starbucks is the only company I have worked for  that has stock and 401K, plus the benefits are great and very helpful to my family and I."
good,"Starbucks is less evil than most large corporations and does offer some decent benefits for anyone working over 20 hours a week but the base salary is pitiful and there were multiple times their ""benefits"" were announced to the public before being explained to the employees. When they switched from giving partial tuition reimbursement to fully paying for schooling through ASU online, they announced to the public ""we are paying for college!"" before they told employees. Those who were halfway through their programs (especially hands-on like health services) had to decide whether to struggle without assistance or switch to an online program."
good,"Adequate job, but lost interest and pay was too little. The atmosphere was less than enjoyable, and would be left on bar for my entire shift and through peak."
good,Starbucks has good hours and off weekends but only offers intermediate positions with little hours and little pay..the management is not reasonable or fair but sticking through until i find a better opportunity
good,"Wenn man nach Strich und Faden arbeiten kann ist es ein guter Platz. Die Work-Life Balance ist schwierig herzustellen, wenn man sich zusehr auf die Arbeit konzetriert. "
good,Die Arbeitsatmosphäre ist im großen und ganzen ganz ok. Für Menschen mit einem Schulabschluss würde ich das Unternehmen nicht empfehlen. Was mich absolut Überzeugt hat waren die Netten-Sympathischen Führungskräfte.
good,I learned about teamwork and effort among my team and following a tight schedule. I opened and closed daily and had to memorize all drinks on hand and keep everything tidy.
good,"Easy job to follow. However, whenever we don't follow unnecessary standards Starbucks has we have consequences and makes the job very unpleasant. Overall, can be a pleasant work environment."
good,Falta de planejamento estratégico e pouco investimento na marca.
good,"productive and fun, good for work.  lot of stress due to limited staff."
good,"one of the biggest take aways from starbucks was that it was extremely fast-paced and specific. customers want their drink a specific way and you as a barista don't make it a half a pump more or less than they want it. it is a collaborative job, if you do not speak with your co-workers something will get messed up."
good,"I think this job is great for people fresh out of high school or in college.  But as after promoting to Shift Supervisor and working for the company for 9 years, the best thing about my job was benefits.  But hours and pay were not that much better than when I had started the job years ago."
good,"I enjoyed the fast paced atmosphere during the morning and lunch rushes. I loved developing relationships with our customers, some who I still keep in contact with. One of the things I had an issue with was the lack of participation from the store manager when they were on duty. I find that it is difficult to work under someone who doesn't understand the tasks that they are expecting their employees to preform."
good,the management always conflicted with one another. Being on a college campouts made the co works constantly changing. They had constantan change in management. So many peopled seemed to get burnt out on the job so it made for unreliable workers and poor attitudes.
good,"It's Starbucks, they offer alright benefits, and the discounts are great. Working the drive thru, register and making drinks was fun and  even the worst customers don't take up more than 10 minutes of your life. trying to get hours was a mess though, I would be scheduled for one or two shifts a week, the manager ignored the one afternoon a week I asked not to work, a Thursday at that, and would consider you responsible for covering it two weeks in advance even after four weeks straight of bringing up the issue right when schedules were posted. if you asked for more hours they tell you to go pick up shifts at other locations, which is cool, but also means they keep a lot of employees on staff and only offer 12 hours or so a week unless you're supervising, which were 3 members of the 40 person team. The Manager was almost never there when i would come in, and would just leave notes for the Supervisor to tell staff. The culture was fine if you like the traditional American coffeehouse; and the foods pretty good, the coffee is subpar though, and if you are a coffee buff this is probably not a place you will shine."
good,"I enjoyed working for Starbucks. Unfortunately, poor management and work/life balance was difficult. Managers constantly schedule you outside of your availability which makes it your responsibility to find coverage. Pay was low especially compared to healthcare cost taken out of your check bi-weekly."
good,"You have to work even when you are not at work. You are expected to promote the brand whenever possible. You will need to always be on call for your peers and employees, never a dull moment especially when you are trying to have a day off. Can be very overwhelming and not a very healthy work environment. Expectations are unrealistic and are held accountable for everything that is not done based on your store manager approach."
good,"I was a rehire at Starbucks and came back because I loved the company, its mission and values. However the horrible management and favoritism that is allowed destroys all the hope I have for this company. Many turn a blind eye when issues are brought up and end up giving you the same textbook garbage that they've been taught to say when harsh criticism is given. Very little dedication is given to people that want to move up and they hire out a lot while telling their partners about limited spaces for advancement."
good,Fast paced environment. Customer connection drives the company. Flexible hours and great benefits. Tuition reimbursement and a great 401k package. Fun
good,"Good temp job overall. you do meet some incredible people however management is just abusive after awhile, especially when it comes to calling off. Schedules are always self serving and getting a day off is next to impossible even a few months out."
good,The job wasn't too hard as long as you could perform in a fast-paced environment and had decent training. The training I had in particular was very good and was some of the best work-training I've ever received.
good,"I took the job at Starbucks as a means of making money between other job opportunities.  As a result, I spent only a few months working there.  Every day was busy, and our store was notorious in the area for being hectic.  The other employees were easy to work with though, and you always had to be on your toes for the unexpected"
good,Starbucks did not start off bad but I think I just grew out of it. We went through some management issues and it's just been very stressful and made me fall out of love with the job.
good,"The shifts were long and strenuous. As a male, I felt that women overpopulated the work force and took advantage of male height and strength. It seemed like I was always given the cleaning responsibilities because it would seem unconventional for a female to be assigned more physically demanding objectives in the presence of men."
good,"Working at Starbucks can be extremely stressful."
good,"I was a temporary employee for one year with no benefits, I did not work long enough to write a review.."
good,"I worked for starbucks for roughly 7 years and when I first started I was promised a bunch of advancements and raises, but every time there was an opportunity, the store would hire someone outside of the company.  I started at $7.75 per hour back in 2011, when I left in 2018, I was only making about $9.75 per hour. Also, the store managers get away with just about everything and some will fire someone for no reason and or always pick their favorite employee and make every other employee uncomfortable.  Very poor work ethic if you ask me."
good,"The company has spent too much money to generate revenue, lost focus on what’s important in the stores and is scrambling to cut costs before they’re spending more than they make.  The mission and values has been put on hold while current leadership scrambles to make changes and cut corporate costs."
good,There is no work life balance. You are constantly called in on days off or forced to work extra hours when customers keep you past closing. Working during the fall is the worst when you never get to go home on time due to lines out the door of customers wanting their fall themed drinks. You are constantly cleaning up after people or even getting the occasional drink thrown at you. The benefits are terrible as well as the pay.
good,Working for Starbucks was very fulfilling. Enjoyed the work environment and interaction with staff and customers. The variety of deployments was a deterrent to burn out at any one position. Pay was dismal for what was required but benefits made up for deficient pay.
good,"I loved my co-workers and the team work I experienced there. Although the company demanded to much out of their workers and weren't willing to pay what they were worth or give proper raises. Example when they raised the new hire pay scale to $7.70, I was making $7.71 after being there for two years."
good,"starbucks is a decent job, it has it good and bad moments. Fairly you have shift that pic there favorites and put them in there perferred postion and they are very picky on what gets said and how things are done at certain times."
good,"Not a great place for someone looking to advance their career. No one was willing to work with me to promote or mentor me in my career. The higher ups are all very fake and pretend to have your best interests in mind, but it's all about the bottom line for them in the long run. But they keep you locked in with free food and healthcare."
good,"This job was so many things, a second home, a second family, free coffee, the most stressful situations, and the most meaningful connections. Until I had an allergic reaction and got terminated because I can't afford to move to Seattle."
good,"When I worked by myself or with one of the other younger people it was a relaxed but task oriented environment. Little mistakes were made and no one was stressed and that made everyone, including the customers comfortable. And when a mistake did occur, it was handled cool and collectively. Whenever I worked with my manager he acted as though every person wanted to see people flipping out behind the counter and working at the speed of light which stressed me out more and caused more issues. There is a certain quickness of a pace that you should work at, but he upped it by 100x which actually resulted in some stuff happening slower because of how many mistakes were made. Overall, management was definitely the worst part of this job because they're just trying to please corporate and ruining the experience of going to Starbucks that much worse."
good,"Starbucks is a fairly traditional large organization. It has all of the politics and inefficiencies you’d expect. Having worked for other large food/beverage companies, the main difference is that the company is more progressive in its views on its responsibility to the world - baristas have amazing benefits, farms are treated well, sustainability is important. But at the end of the day, it’s you and your manager trying to figure out how to sell more coffee so the C-suite can get big bonuses. The company is poor at managing problem employees, and has a history of bad managers who make entire teams miserable. You can make more money elsewhere. But it’s a decent name to have on your resume, and they won’t work you crazy hours, and if you wind up on a good team, you’ll enjoy it."
good,"terrible work place. If you are in a supervisor position, forget about breaks. You're work is never enough. Stock is going down. This company usually pays 1 dollar over minimum wage but it is not worth the hassle. managers say they work with school schedules but never really do. always have to keep up to pace but its never enough."
good,"decent first job, although management could be better. Sometimes you get good hours sometimes not. Good people to work with, and an easy environment to clear any issues."
good,"I worked for Starbucks for 3 years, 2 in Vernon and 1 in Kelowna. Training was very rushed in the beginning but done pretty decently. I was at a store where the majority of my co workers had been working there for 5 years or over which made many of them extremely entitled and rude for about 6 months until they warmed up to me. So the first 6 months were pretty much torture and made it EXTREMLY stressful and hard to get better in such a fast paced environment. After that grace period however, I met a lot of life long friends and great people while working there, and the work got a lot easier. I think working for Starbucks definitely helped shape my work attitude and ethic in a positive way, but there are definitely some things that really bother me about some of the systems put in place. I worked for them for 3 years and before I left, I was maybe 30 cents above minimum wage. Don’t ever expect your salary as a barista to get any higher because it won’t. They claim to give you 2% raises every 6-8 months roughly but when they do, they don’t transfer that raise when minimum wage is raised, so very time that happens you’re back to square one. Your wage increases as a shift supervisor, but don’t expect it to get any higher after that. Additionally, they actually lowered the raise rate to 1% before I left. The benifits help ease this blow to your pay check and honestly that’s probably the way they get away with it, but addictive, sub-par coffee beans doesn’t pay the rent. This makes it very common for people at Starbucks to get second jobs. I always felt like I was putting in so much"
good,"my store was disgusting and unorganized. Did I forget to say unprofessional? Great benefits but wasn't worth it. Nothing but ""grown"" folks arguing with teenagers"
good,"It's a fun environment depending which store or management you work at but the store I worked had a busy pace but only receives little tips that is shared with everyone you work with. It has good benefits, but low pay(minimum wage)"
good,"My experience was a little different because the store was in a mall, so it was a very busy store, but it was too small (physically) to have enough people working. "
good,"It was a decent place to work.  I enjoyed almost everyone I worked with and those that were a little more difficult were still bearable.  I had a second job that I needed to close at on a regular basis and even though I asked repeatedly NOT to be put on opening shift, I was.  I couldn't do both successfully."
good,A pesar de decir que buscan el bienestar del empleado no fue mi caso
good,"It was a nice job but not something to have for a career. To get into the job was fairly easy, very exciting to walk in for the first time but after a few years, it started to lose that ""New Job Smell"" and you start noticing that you'd rather be somewhere else. I found my efforts to be very unappreciated and I was overworked. After almost 5 years of working there, I still made just as much as any new hire. The company stopped caring about their partners and it's starting to show."
good,I would recommend this job for those who are looking for part-time or do not have at least a Bachelor's degree. Starbucks offers a lot of benefits to their employees- but your manager can make or break your experience.
good,"Not the best place to work if you have a family. They are unwilling to work with you if you want to switch to days, even when there is an opening. Long hours and lots of overtime."
good,I personally didn't enjoy working at Starbucks. The scheduling was ridiculous and most weeks I ended up working with no days off and multiple double shifts a week and I showed an exceeded amount of loyalty to my store for over 2 years and was let go for something extremely minor and it was very upsetting. I honestly would never recommend anyone work for this company.
good,It was fast paced but  the location we worked at was busy from open to close. It was so busy that the pace was sometimes too much to handle for even our best baristas.
good,I really enjoyed working at Starbucks but I couldn't survive with the little pay that they offered.  The company is great as a part time job of if you live with parents or someone else with a household income that covers all the bills.  I miss working at Starbucks but I had to leave to find a job that paid better.
good,"It was an ok place to work, super stressful though. I wouldn't work there again, definitely not for me. I would maybe recommend to someone I know. The food is good, some coworkers are nice, manager was nice too, had an average experience."
good,"Starbucks was a good place to work while in school. I was able to meet many friends through Starbucks, and make connections, however, the management was unorganized, and the district manager's philosophy was that it was easier to hire new people then it was to give long-term employees a raise. It seemed a strange way to run a business."
good,"While I wouldn't consider the pay very good, it was better than some customer service jobs. The free online college was a huge benefit for me, as well. Management at the location I worked at leaved much to be desired, and in order to get trained on new skills, I had to be proactive to the point of being forceful about it. There was no opportunity and no future there. It was just a dead end job. But as dead end jobs go, it was one of the better ones to work at."
good,Good job to have to make extra money. OR a good job to have if you need experience especially in customer service. I learned a lot of skills that I applied to other internships or positions.
good,Your experience at Starbucks really depends on your co-workers. I worked at a drive-thru and sit down Starbucks. Every day would depend on who I was working with.
good,"Starbucks cultivates one of the best company cultures I've had the pleasure of being a part of. It's really your coworkers you come to work for every day, as everyone is a super star. This company also gives you the most power in your position to make the moment right with your customers, and does try to foster as much time as possible to create those customer connections."
good,"Starbucks was a temporary job, but i never learned how to make the drinks. It was always too busy for a barista to stop and show me what to do. So for 5 months I just took orders and cleaned."
good,"Fast-paced, fun environment. 50% of the customers are amazing, the other half refuse to acknowledge your existence. Amazing supervisors that will bend over backward to help you succeed."
good,As a shift manager you dealt with workers who didn't care and who were rude to one another. They complained daily even if you tried to make the work place better. Nothing was ever good enough for them. The customers are rude and entitled. The pay wasn't worth dealing with workers or the customers
good,"I loved Starbucks when I started. I worked there for two years. Over the last six months of my time there I noticed how far removed the management was from the work. I was never cared for, and I have many friends who felt the same way working for Starbucks. It was patronizing and demanding. They made you feel bad if you didn't put Starbucks as your first priority even if you were part-time and a student. Management would tell me they would train me to be able to advance, and I would do the work they asked and keep pushing for it, but I was never told anything concrete. My manager just blew me off all the time. My manager also held grudges. All of them that I worked with do. They show favoritism--not based on merit. They favor their friends who kiss up to them, and they bury the hard workers who actually ask them why they do things or why they pass over people who are more dedicated and better at the job. I do not recommend this job. It will wear you down. Everyone I worked with had been there for years, and they all were dying to leave. It is not a place for growth."
good,Its drama every body worry about every body people saying what they want to do and where they want to go thats poor management you not telling me where u want to go nd management dont konw how to talk to their crew
good,"Was babysitting the manager. Didn't have proper training as my trainer and manager would just eat from the grocery store at one of the tables in the café part of the store. Had really hard time with the drinks so I tried to teach myself and would make notecards after asking them for the book of recipes. It was really slow paced until certain hours of the day, but being in a very tiny space in a grocery store; when it got busy many spills happened and it was hard to move around. Wasn't any communication and the schedule was always all over the place. I enjoyed working with the drinks and learning how to make my favorite ones but the management of that Starbucks and the grocery store the café was in made it difficult to enjoy working there."
good,"On an average day at Starbucks, you are assigned a position and are expected to ""flex"" when needed. The environment is fast paced and stressful, so maintaining a level head is important. The workplace culture is accepting and inviting, but the stress levels can make others difficult to work with."
good,"It all depends on coworkers. It gets busy, it is a very fast paced job. Customers are understandable (some). It involves teamwork, and being able to learn fast."
good,I loved making the drinks and they let you drink the drinks for free at work and they feed you one free food item or meal every day you work with is great. They offer health benefits and 401k to part time employees. But if you aren't as fast as one person or as friendly as one person they will get all your hours and the managers don't care if you have kids or bills or how dedicated you are to your work or your customers
good,"I worked inside a target Starbucks so it was a bit different. No tips, lower wages, one person per shift. My reason for quitting was I was taken away from Starbucks to cover understaffed departments."
good,"if the management was better and they had actual good communication, this job would be wonderful. Current management says one thing to you then when you ask them about it later they flip their own words around and make you seem like an idiot."
good,"While the culture varies from store to store, working at Starbucks is fast-paced and requires quick learning and adaptation.The corporate culture is better than many other companies, but the day-to-day experience varies based on management."
good,"While it is impressive that a large company like Starbucks took the time to employ me when I was quite young, they were an unsatisfying employer. There seemed to be little care for me as an employee from those further up the chain of command. There was very little care for the fact that as employees we were being made to work much larger hours than we were contracted and limited concern when the consequences of these much longer hours took their toll. "
good,It was a pretty relaxed place because of the attitude of my manager. She never put pressure on the staff so we all felt respected and valued and we all wanted to perform at our best. And we consistently did. Because of her it was a good place to work.
good,"Starbucks seems like a great company to work for, unfortunately I had poor management, and an inability to pursue a career with them. It was a very fast paced, and stressful environment most days."
good,"Starbucks always makes an effort to make customers feel welcomed. It also does some good charity work, some donations, and general good-for-the-planet stuff. But... they terribly underpay and cruel managers are allowed to run rampant. They are very sales-oriented, and that makes employees feel like little more than numbers. Stores are constantly understaffed to allow for higher profitability. This isn't the tale of one poorly run location. I worked in many over the course of years."
good,Its a typical day in another coffee shop. I learned how to multitask more efficiently as well as time management. The culture of the work place is boring not very challenging either
good,"good to start and learn for fresh graduate"
good,I can only talk about my location which once was the dream job we actually felt like partners in the company but now it’s like a franchise or something where the rules only apply to some store my location is like it’s on separate company which confuses the Starbucks way
good,"It's the perfect job while attending school. friends turn into clubbing buddies. Customer turns into stalkers. The discount is awesome, you also get free lunch and free coffee. Easy transfer to other starbucks as well. Whenever low on hours you have the option to  take shift from other starbucks employee."
good,"Great for College Students due to the flexible hours. Unfortunately,  there is very little advancement opportunity and the hourly pay, even for a 5+ year supervisor, is far below the cost of living."
good,"You never know what the management is going to bring at you that day, customers are nice and great to get to know but the company is way to focused on drive through times to keep up with their mission."
good,"I always tell people that if I could have had 40 guaranteed hours a week at Starbucks, I never would have left. I love the high-paced environment. However, you have to fight to get more than 25 hours a week. I found myself working opens and closes just to get 30 hours."
good,"Just really busy, but the busyness made the day go by faster. Lots of making drinks and cashiering. Management was okay. Alot of people really enjoy the job but wasnt for me."
good,"If you work in Target, and you work in Starbucks inside the Target, you are not entitled to Partner benefits that Starbucks members get at other locations."
good,There was a lot to improve in the overall store. and management experience. Opportunity to rise above position seemed bleak even with proven achievements.
good,"I like working at Kroger/Starbucks, I enjoy the customers and the new promotions each season, the only thing I don't like about the company is job stability."
good,"Hectic job with many responsibilities, management is not good and there is a lot of organization within the store. The hardest part of my job is not being able to work with my coworkers."
good,Starbucks was a great place to network and make social connections. I learned a lot about coffee and enjoyed working with up beat employees.  The free drink perk was awesome.
good,The management is not the greatest. Compensation is not enough to live in my area anymore. Labor hours are not spread enough for staffing. The culture of the environment is great.
good,"Not too bad when you don't have to keep running for 10 hours while only having 30 min brake a day. Also don't go to big stores, you will be abused for the salary you'll get , it looks like everyone above store manager level is living in another world and their only goal is to milk from their employees as much as possible."
good,"Recent events have made being an employee increasingly difficult. We have had several instances on customers harassing employees or other customers and no longer feel safe trying to protect ourselves. Other ""Social"" stances taken by the company have done nothing but created difficulties for store level employees (ie #racetogether or comments on gun control)."
good,"DRAMA, the amount of high schoolers working in Starbucks being rude to customers AND employees were not professional. Starbucks seemed to hire anyone. Loved my job - but definitely didn't like how employees were treated."
good,"Starbucks is always busy so the work days go by pretty quickly. "
good,Starbucks was a good place to work and I liked my workplace environment. The fellow teammates worked great together as a team. I would recommend Starbucks to anyone for work.
good,I had a good time working at Starbucks with fellow co-workers but the head manager is not the greatest to work under. I had opportunities to meet new people like my co workers and also customers.
good,The training I received at Starbucks as very sufficient and helpful to hep me advance in new career paths. The work life balance however was not good. Too much was expected from you outside of the company. I would receive phone calls almost daily when I was not working. Overtime was always expected but never appreciated.
good,"Starbucks is an excellent company to work for and it is a privilege to represent such a famous, well recognised global brand. It was a pleasure to serve the majority of customers who were very friendly."
good,"Starbucks expects you to do the job of 3 people and get paid for only one of those. The management was poor, uncaring and distant, and only trying to make money for the company as opposed to caring about the employees. It was stressful and fast paced, and even if your shift was only five hours it felt as if you had worked ten when you got home. There were many benefits but the benefits did not outweigh the negatives of bad management and an immense and stressful workload."
good,"It was OK. I definitely think it's good for someone to start with, but would not recommend for anyone who is focused on a career. The company I believe prioritizes a high turnover, so it is better to make bad, but fast drinks instead of good quality."
good,A typical day is preparing for a busy day and cleaning up afterwards. The hardest part is making sure to get paid correctly but you learn a lot of patience! It has helped me learn to work well with others and to be communicative in a productive and polite way.
good,"Fijne bedrijfscultuur en werksfeer. Met leeftijdsgenoten gewerkt en gemakkelijk te combineren met studie. Geen tot weinig doorgroeimogelijkheden. Moeilijkheidsgraad 0, maar moet wel onder druk weten te werken ivm ochtendspitsen."
good,"Had a terrible store manager that only scheduled me four hours a week. Needed to find something that was more stable in hours, and better starting pay."
good,"Job is not too stressful. There are a lot of ""regulars"" and it is not as fast paced compared to a corporate store. Overall, a good job to have. Sometimes you are short staffed due to having a small team. Not too much to complain about."
good,"Starbucks is a great first job for an older teen, I would not recommend it to anyone wanting a serious job, serious compensation, or serious repsonsibility. If you can handle customers being rude and let it slide off your shoulders and like fast paced environments, Starbucks is for you."
good,Very fast paced. Monotonous. At times extremely stressful especially whilst under poor management. It's a great job for short-term work but ultimately not what I'd like to do in the long run.
good,This was not a job that I enjoyed. The rules were never enforced in the beginning regarding the dress code and then all of a sudden were enforced. Not a fun job.
good,The job isn't bad for a student or young professional while looking to move into the real world. The benefits included with every job here are surprisingly wonderful.  They will pay for a full 4 year degree taken online through Arizona State University. I don't know any other companies that will do that.
good,"Starbucks is a good entry level employer.  The benefits are excellent and the product is good.  The pace is very fast and can be physically demanding.  It is, at times, not well organized and the communication from corporate is not always timely and clear.  The most enjoyable part of the job for me was interacting with the customers."
good,"Starbucks offers great benefits and also free college tuition to Arizona State University online.  The job itself is extremely complicated and difficult.  The customers can be very rude and can be very demeaning at times.  There was no clear career path for baristas and the managers were terrible at providing mentor-ship for future leaders in the company.  In my time at Starbucks, I witnessed several management positions being hired outside of the company that did not pan out for several reasons.  I also witnessed favoritism among the candidates that were selected for promotions.  The main problem I had was the expectation to work off the clock in order to be considered for a promotion.  It was never explicitly stated that I should work off the clock, however it was implied and as a result of my principles I was not considered for promotion because I refused to work off the clock on my ""development"".  Overall, I would not recommend this company unless you really needed great health benefits or college tuition.  The stress isn't worth what they pay."
good,I would have loved working for Starbucks if it came with its own Starbucks management. Fry's in Globe Arizona made it a joke. I would have stuck around but I left for school in another town.
good,"While I enjoy Starbucks as much as the next person, the management, organization, and culture around the stores I worked in were less than agreeable for me. I enjoyed working my shifts well enough, but management was always driven at bottom lines, and rarely on anything else. There is also very little room for promotion, and it is not a good job if you're a single parent with young children."
good,"Overall, I love what the company stands for. However, after working there for awhile, you begin to get used to seeing certain things. Typically, the Store managers and district managers will hire from the outside for other store managers and assistant store managers oppose to moving people up who deserve the position and are already knowledgeable about what they are doing. I worked at two different stores in the three years I was with them and they promised certain coworkers a promotion to become an assistant store manager, yet ended up hiring someone from the outside who had a bachelors degree with no experience in retail/food. Also, the customer base is terrible! a lot of familiar faces here and there, yet I've had instances where I've been physically and verbally attacked by unhappy customers. The pay isn't all that well but the benefits are great!"
good,"My experience as a barista is that you have to be ready for anything at all times. The strangest things happen and you have to be ready at any moment for a rush, a crazy order, something going on in the lobby or the back room, something is always happening."
good,Loved working in a fast paced environment with amazing co workers who were always helpful and happy and treated everyone as family but “family” dynamic decreased when under went new management.
good,"Although I ended up leaving the company, the pay was alright and the job taught you HARD WORK. This is not a job for lazy people. You have to hustle.."
good,"Super stressful, customers were terrible, you were expected to somehow improve sales which makes no sense as you cannot force people to come into the store or upsell a drink."
good,"I really liked working at Starbucks. But I was at a store in a discount mall, and our tips were an average of 50 cents per hour at best. Try to get a position at a store in a neighborhood, as you will get more regulars who you get build a rapport with."
good,"enjoyed working there, co workers were amazing. The environment and fast paced tempo in the stores are amazing. I enjoyed demo ays. I miss my former coworkers"
good,"If you don't mesh well with your coworkers, and especially your manager, it's probably going to be a difficult ride. Keep your head down and don't ask for reasons behind anything you are told to do."
good,Starbucks was a great company but as a part time employee I did not make enough especially because I had insurance through them and a big chunk of my paycheck was gone
good,"Must have ""thick skin"" when working here.  Must be a fast learner and have exceptional ablility to multitask. Must be able to focus during periods of high volume/high stress. Attention to detail is a must."
good,"While working at Starbucks, I was given hours almost double what was agreed between my manager and myself, when I got hired. The expectations of the employees are extremely high with little regard or care for their wellbeing. I felt belittled by management, and saw all shift supervisors treated poorly, having extremely high standards and duties put on them for little more than what I was getting, minimum wage.  Unfulfilling and unrewarding work. Every other minimum wage customer service job I have had was better than Starbucks."
good,"No other work place has as cool of a mix of young, interesting people, but the management is under a lot of pressure from corporate and transfers this down to the employees. Very cut throat management environment, where everyone is trying to get their own leg up the corporate ladder. "
good,"For the work that was expected from the staff, I do not feel that that Starbucks adequately compensated the workers. There were decent perks like a free drink each day but working as a campus Starbucks we were not entitled to any of the normal corporate perks which lead to me leaving."
good,"Unless you plan to advance onto management, this is really a place for college kids to work while they're going to school.  The pay at the time I was working was minimum wage and tips were not helpful.  I could barely make rent.  People really weren't serious and there wasn't much of a balance in job positions.  Drive through was the worst.  I liked most of the people I worked with, job itself is simple but tiring after 8 hours if you work in a busy store."
good,Great college job. It is very stressful especially if co-workers aren't friendly. I enjoyed my time at Starbucks before I transferred. Shift supervisor are very hard for the salary .
good,"Its a great place to work if you work with the right people. Lets just hope you have a hardworking managements and hardworking coworkers. "
good,"Its a reliable job, where you cant meet some great people. There is place for advancement, though the managers are not always the best. All in all I will admit its a good company to work for."
good,"There are few individuals I respect more than Starbucks employees. They work so hard for low pay. The company culture is amazing and stands for so many incredible things. I loved working for Starbucks. However, work life balance doesn't match up with the company's devotion to providing great affordable benefits. Especially if you are working in the stores, the work is HARD, the hours are long, the customers are tough as nails and the stress is high. I think if Starbucks didn't drive such a hard line on controlling labor costs, the customer and employee experience would be SO MUCH BETTER in stores."
good,Starbucks employee were great! Customer Service oriented and they're fun to talk to. Workplace culture is wonderful when it comes to us workers out on the floor.
good,Son yıllarda fastfood kültüründen etkilenerek çalışanlarına gerekli ilgi ve önemi vermeyen yöneticilerin varlığının çoğaldığı önemli bir değer
good,The work life balance is almost non existent it creates a a lot of stress. The company is great to work for but it depends on your managers and how effective they are at communication. It is a great learning experience and challenges you to step outside your comfort zone at all times. Work schedules are not consistent unless you are going to school other wise be prepared to not have regular days off. They are a great company to work for in the long run of things just wish that they did more to improve the work balance between the ranks because from my experiences it is not equal certain ranks are expected to do more work than others.
good,I had a wonderful first few years working at Starbucks. Your experience there is completely dependent upon the team you work with. If the manager of your store does not supply good hires and does not fire those who need to go it can become a terrible experience. If the max amount of people working on a shift is 4-5 and one person doesn't show up thats 20-25% of labor. Everyone else has to pick up the slack and its not fun.
good,very stressful environment always short manned and so much falls on you since you are almost always needing help. some coworkers are lazy and so their work falls on you aswell.
good,"Provide customer service and beverages to customers. Prepare to open at 6am. Serve coffe and other drinks all day. Midday pull sandwiches and half pastires for the following day, once a week order main truck of supplies and ingredients, make a schedule, 3x a week order frozen and dairy for our shop, once a month inventory"
good,It’s good to work in Starbucks if you’re a fresh grad and need only working experience. It’s really hard to adopt their culture but you need to be strong and keep motivated to surpass every challenges.
good,"Good place to work, have to know people in order to get hired, are allowed certain amount drinks and food during shift. Have to work your butt off in order to get your full eight hours plus your weekly hours without people asking if they can cover your shift because they are hungry for hours."
good,"Sometimes management isn't put together and coworkers are just unbearable. However once you find your group or the right store it is amazing. Customers can have their days, but regulars are amazing and so kind, and they become your best friends."
good,"I genuinely enjoyed my first few months at Starbucks. I was a full time college student at the time, and my manager was wonderful with working around my schedule. We then got a new manager, and she hired poor employees she refused to fire, and let ill equipped people run the store. She was not willing to work around my class schedule."
good,I really got to know my customers. I used to enjoy having conversations with them while doing my work. It was a wonderful location to work at. I still visit to check and see how's everyone doing.
good,"They are really Serious about Coffee. Even Though I Didn't take advantage of anyof the benefits there, at least they have them as an objection most workplaces don't."
good,"I thought the Starbucks ""culture"" really aligned with me as a person, unfortunately with unneeded stress and unreliable co-workers, this made for a very stressful and anxiety ridden place with no real accountability being placed on anyone other than the manager."
good,"It's about all one can expect from from a minimum wage kind of job. Not a super rewarding job, but with the right coworkers and management it can be a fun job. Plus side you get discounts on all the food and drinks and get a free hot drink during a shift."
good,"Working at Starbucks was insightful experience. I loved working with customers but the managers I had during my time there were not great and didn't treat not only the employees but the customers very well. I enjoyed being able to make coffee and getting the opportunity to meet new people and strike up conversations with customers, also the pay wasn't too bad for only working part time while being in school."
good,good work life balance and scheduling made it easy to work around school hours. Great to meet people (nice or nasty) you wont like it if your anti-social but it is interesting learn about different types of coffee
good,"Poor pay, stressful environment, unsupportive management, high turnover, unskilled staff, non-existant quality control, difficult & mean clientele...."
good,Hours are up and down.  On your feet all day. great people to while working there great place overall.  pay could be better but i guess the benefits make up for it.
good,"Great benefits, poor pay. Great community and global involvement (community service, activism, sustainability). Lack of career advancement and favoritism/internal politics are a huge problem. Compensation does not match time/effort and company values. A full time employee should not be paid well under living wage!"
good,"Barely enough hours to even get benefits, schedule is always different and never what you would prefer, management is terrible at scheduling and is notorious for small 4 hour shifts even at 4am "
good,"I was with Starbucks on and off for 12 years. Not a lot of room for growth if you have children or are caring for family members. I made a lot of great friends though. I couldn't afford the benefits though, like dental, medical, vision. The competitive pay is a few cents above minimum wage. The district I was in for a majority of the time had a lot of turnover because of management. In a period of 9 months, I saw 25 managers and supervisors come and go. One store I was at had 8 people quit in a matter of 6 weeks because of management. It's a good company if you are living at home with your parents if you don't have to pay much for bills. Hours you get fluctuate from week to week, so many employees (partners) had 2 or 3 jobs to make ends meet."
good,"A empresa em si da a seus funcionários boas oportunidades de crescimento, mas para isso exige muito trabalho, conhecimento na área de café e gosto pelo mesmo. Exigindo sempre o melhor de cada um para o próprio ambiente de trabalho e seus clientes."
good,I really enjoyed working for the company. Only issue was my hours and child carcare was an issue to work around. Better pay would've also help with the daycare costs
good,"Starbucks has wonderful benefits such as choosing your health, dental and vision insurance and the stocks. You work long hours in one position for most of your shift dealing with the most obnoxious customers! People are terrible to Starbucks partners but we're forced to smile and say thank you to everyone. You have to come in to work sick or else you get in trouble and/or you simply can't afford the day off. My partners and I have had multiple break downs while working and overall our health isn't worth serving people coffee. The managers that make the schedule don't follow your availability but get upset when you don't follow theirs. If working night shift, you'll have no life and no time to yourself. Drive through stores are the worst as you have to keep times below two minutes and you get in trouble if they go any higher even if it wasn't your fault and tips are a joke. The only real good thing about working here is you'll make the best friends you've ever known and the benefits package. My experience here wasn't very good and I don't wish to return any time soon."
good,"This was a very fun job to have.  The employees and customers were a joy to work with.  I learned about more than just coffee here, I learned how really provide quality customer service, even during fast paced and high stress moments with lines wrapped around the store.  Unfortunately, management during my time there was unstable and at times hostile towards many of the employees.  However, I do not this one manager was an accurate reflection of the quality to be found amoungst most starbucks employees.  During my time there, I mostly enjoyed participating in managing and creating community events at starbucks locations such as teen open mic night and poetry night, that aimed not only to promote starbucks products but most importantly to aimed to foster community awareness and productivity."
good,"Slighlty better than Mcdonalds, Subway, or etc. Not paid much entitled customers. Boss wasn't great baristas were cool. Tips are decent but not great better than Dunks or Subway for example. its ok for a bit."
good,Most locations are quite busy and require workers to be working at 110% just to ensure they don't fall too far behind.  Management is usually not very helpful and the pay seems to be lacking for the amount of commitment this company expects from its employees.
good,"I had great managers, but the system is flawed. It was difficult for managers to lead well and effectively train people without having to deal with high turnover and customer satisfaction."
good,Great staff to work with. Willing to help whenever deemed necessary or when it was asked for. However did conflict with my internship schedule. Flexible hours.
good,"Good and flexible company for those wanting to go to school. Benefits are okay, pay should be a bit more. They always put customers first. Discounts are a plus."
good,The specific store I worked at did not meet expectations. It was not fun and recently they change all of their policies making it impossible for partners to work comfortably.
good,"Starbucks is a fun, fast paced environment, and I loved it every second I was there."
good,"people were so nice and helpful but the per hour they give so too low."
good,"If you need the job get it, if you can avoid it, do. Upper management has little regard for their employees. While working there, we took an undercover pay cut and for a couple of years the pay rises were laughable."
good,"Do not work at Starbucks unless you enjoy fast-paced work environments and the possibility of being yelled at by customers. That and poor management were the worst part. However, it's incredibly fun and if you have fun and amicable coworkers, you will have a great time working there. I wish I had never left. You'll definitely learn about time management, customer service, and how to make the best out of a bad situation."
good,"Decent benefits, but the "" do more with less"" mentality prevails, making managing a life balance impossible. Also, the expectation that one can manage a business and spend 95% of you time as a barista is unrealistic."
good,"Starbucks as a whole delivers awesome service and products to the end user.  The downside is that the company is very unorganized internally.  It does not have the infrastructure nor training needed to pursue the initiatives it promotes, especially for Veterans, terrible supply chain management, and a very high turn over in senior leadership.  All that leads to a very stressful work environment.  Choose wisely!"
good,"It is really fun working with all of my coworkers, but since we have gotten our new manager, its been much more stressful and a lot harder to enjoy being there to work everyday. There is only so much someone can handle without being appreciated or noticed by their manager. The environment is great, but you will usually end up feeling like you are not getting paid for the work you are putting in."
good,horrible. i hate the manager i have now. coworkers are ok. customers are a pain and the job culture is very very obnoxious! the hardest part is having to put pride aside and become a yes man of sorts. pure bull
good,The hardest part of the day is working peak which is from 9:00 am to 11:00 pm. It’s stressful because everything is moving at at really fast pace inside and outside for drive thru. At times costumers become impatient and can get rude and have an attitude toward you even when it is out of your control.
good,"My favorite is to communicate with the customer, ask how their day is, or if they are traveling and where to. The hardest part is keeping up it can be stressful."
good,"Working there was fine. I didn't work long shifts and wanted to work more actually but never got the opportunities. The manager was not good at all, most of my co workers agreed that we all could do better."
good,You can expect to have rushes and lots of pressure put on you. This job can be messy at times and emotionally pressing with the amount of people you deal with every day. For the most part this is a fun place to work and the perks are pretty good. You get free coffee each week as a partner markout and also free drinks while you are working as well as 30 minutes before and after your shift. There is a 30% discount for partners and you get premium spotify and gold status on rewards.
good,"steep learning curve. understaffed a lot of the time. Never given 40+ hours. low hourly pay. can be fun at times, but for the most part a lot of unrealistic expectations"
good,"Company is growing way too fast and a lack of qualified District managers is hurting it. The vision is clear, but the training and ability to promote to keep up is not there."
good,"typical day is having 7 places to be posted at, but being placed in the same position every single day. I learned that being the managers favorite gets you hours."
good,"Every day at work was a disaster. I worked at Starbucks for 9 months and only 7 of the 30 partners that were there when I started are still there. This is partly because people quit all the time but it was also because Starbucks sends all of the experienced  baristas and shift supervisors to ""better"" stores. This left us constantly understaffed. Additionally, I worked under three different store managers in those 9 months. The main reason why I left Starbucks was the lack of respect of my time. Almost every shift I worked I got held over my scheduled time. The worst was when I was scheduled to get off at 10:00pm and I didn't get to leave until 11:45pm. Because our store was always behind good customer service was a very low priority. I found myself hating customers and making my goal to get them to go away as fast as possible. I did not like the way I was viewing people so that also made me want to quit."
good,I don't know what to say honestly. It was okay I didn't really enjoy it management was poor. Customers were always nice and the people just worked with were nice as well.
good,"I had been working at starbucks for about go on 5 years and had  5 different managers. my 4th manager was not understanding to the work/life balance and believed that you could not do both school and work and would make it very difficult for you. "
good,"Great place to work if you are a barista or shift supervisor. Once you become a manager, they basically just take advantage of you. They expect you to work a ton of hours for little reward."
good,"Safeway is extending a great out of high school job to start with. The staff was very immature they gossiped and started unnecessary drama. My job overall was very good my supervisor was the best , patient and friendly. If you want more I suggest working and going to school"
good,"Starbucks is losing it's focus in connecting with it's customer and focusing too much on the bottom line."
good,"Minimum wage & don't honor part time hours. Got promoted from barista to supervisor with only a 10 cent raise, wouldn't accept my part time hours as I was in school and wanted 16-20hrs/ week tops. Most weeks I would get scheduled for 30+ hrs"
good,"Starbucks was fun and fast paced, but Target Corp. has terrible policies and some terrible team leaders. Starbucks was awesome though! Friendly staff, lots of drinks and food to try, and hard working people to make every experience as great as they can."
good,Salary is barely anything. It takes a 2 years to get maybe 5 days of PTO. Management is barely there and she doesnt know how to do her job even when she's been doing it for 12 years. District manager is ridiculous and doeant care about the partners.
good,"Although the media or popular belief is this company is a great place to end up, this is no longer 1990. Most, if not all of the time Starbucks promotes from outside the company. From store manager to executive positions, the company does not show any regard for those with specific experience from within their own. The pay is minimum and even though they pretend the benefits are good, they forget to mention how many they have taken away to offset that. This job is good for high school students, and that is exactly what they are looking for. Young people who do not have aspirations for advancement or knowledge in benefits and wages so they don't know how mistreated they are."
good,"Ultimately Starbucks has the potential to be a good workplace, a job that would be ideal for those going to school. although if one were to live off of Starbucks it would not be feasible. Plenty of employee benefits despite that however, including weekly coffee markout and stock options after a year."
good,"You know how sometimes you walk into a store and you can just tell it's run well?  Anyway, I really relate to this letter."
good,To much to even explain. Way to stressful there’s no way this could be my full time job. Couldn’t support myself pay bills. Depending on location you could make good tips
good,"Fast paced work environment"
good,"On a typical day at Starbucks, you have to be prepared to work quickly, efficiently and give the best quality you can. While the vibe in the workplace is nice and inviting, the stress of getting so much done with so little staff is breaking for a person. Its not something I can see doing forever, but I don't regret learning and being apart of such a hard working team of people."
good,While I was a part of the Starbucks team I gained first hand experience in interacting with customers and getting a sense of how they react to certain stimuli and what they usually look for in service.
good,"I worked at Sbux for almost 10 years. It's fun at the beginning.  I noticed the last couple of years as a shift supervisor, the highest of upper management would implement many changes to the store culture, inventory pull, deployment, and adding more drink specials to the menu.  I felt with all the changes,  the more expectations were put on the shifts, and I felt we were not monetarily compensated."
good,"I worked for Starbucks as a Barista, a Shift Supervisor and as a Store  Manager over an 11 year span from 2006-1017. The company has declined into a business that is more like a fast food chain restaurant instead of that of a cafe/coffee shop experience. This business direction has changed how I feel about my job  there and the company in general. My job there has gone from one that I enjoyed every day to one that I dreaded going to."
good,Starbucks core values have gone astray.   It doesn't have the coffee house appeal anymore.  The push is in food and speed. customers have to be gone in less an 45 seconds out the window. No time for customer connections.
good,"No complaints about job within itself. "
good,"Typically I and one other partner would get the place ready to open, preparing coffee, tea, pastries and sandwiches for sale.  I was also responsible for inventory counts, placing and receiving orders and pulling frozen foods for the next business day.  The management is very structured and inflexible.  I learned how to really manage time and tasks.The culture was enjoyable, mainly because of the grerat regular customers.  Hardest part of the job was getting all of the required 'back of house' tasks completed at the required time while still serving customers and only having one other person to help. The most enjoyable part of the job are the many regular customers who come to visit every day."
good,"Starbucks talks a big game about the culture of their company, and in smaller, slower stores there is a greater emphasis on this, but in a busy store (any drive through) the employees are overworked, underpaid, and not given a chance to authentically connect with the customer base as the company claims to want. Development in the company is like pulling teeth, as it is not a priority to upper management."
good,"If you love coffee and have no desire of being advanced in a company this is your type of job. Customers are 85% amazing but behind the seen is a place where you can’t see no advancement. Store Mangers and District Managers are the most conniving, there word means little to nothing. Trust  and loyalty means nothing to he company."
good,"While being a decent place to work for after high school, Starbucks however does not pay a livable wage nor does it supply hours. Good benefits, if you are given the hours required to maintain them."
good,To much favoritism in the work place and to much lazy workers are getting paid to do nothing.  I enjoyed working at Starbucks but when it came to feeling like i was a target i was extremely uncomfortable and out of place. Im a great worker very fast service i have worked on my attitude thanks to working at Starbucks.
good,The job was very exciting the only thing is the pay sucked. Made 9.50 and the raise after a year was about .25 cents. Starbuck has a lot of diversity which is always a good thing .
good,The manager of the Starbucks at which I worked had no idea how to run a Starbucks.  I had more experience working as a manager than he did prior to becoming the manager and had more experience working at Starbucks.
good,"Can be very fast pace and fun with a good group of coworkers. Always moving and doing something. Been with the company a long time, but I feel you have to choose between compensation and work-life balance. I have very open availability but to get over 30 hours I have to work on a day off. There's a sliding scale for compensation so if you move or decide to step down for better work schedule you may not be making much more than a new employee after minimum wage goes up."
good,fast paced food service while handling and satisfying customer needs. Teaches one how to multitask & handle the public. Enjoyable & fun atmosphere. Hardest part is handling customers need and maintaining clean & stocked workspace.
good,"You don't get paid what you work for or for what they expect of you, the management is shady depending on the location of the store, luckily I have had good coworkers, so the job is not as bad."
good,It is a fun job. You got to learn different drinks. The company culture needs to be improved. The morning shift requires a punctual person and early riser.
good,A group of passionate partners trying to add value and do good work. The work can be challenging but there are often times change in structure which causes work to slow down.
good,"Fast multitasking Place to work ,manger assist if help is needed ,learning all about making different types of drinks learning different type of coffee"
good,"Dit is een bedrijf dat uitsluitend richt op winst. Het maakt niet uit hoe efficiënt u als werknemer bent, hoe belangrijk ze u aan het einde van de maand betaalt. Ik voelde me gediscrimineerd  voor mij lijftijd, ik had niet een contract omdat ik was te duur!!"
good,"Starbucks is a good company but they should work on thier management and keeping their workers satisfied by giving incentives and fair salary "
good,"We all have been to a very busy Starbucks. We all have seen the amount of drinks and nonstop busy busy busy they are. "
good,Manager and HR are terrible and make leading difficult. Employees are entitled and whiny. Management isn't interested in hearing what is wrong and they do not back you up. HR is completely worthless and two faced.
good,"Starbucks can be a fun place to work if you have friends, but it is stressful, fast-paced, and it can be very difficult to remain composed with difficult customers."
good,"A typical day would include me on the cashier register, my manager wasn't fair but my supervisors were understanding and made us feel like a team. The hardest part would be the activeness and pressure of the job/ role a cashier and barista plays. But the most enjoyable part would be seeing a regular costumer or any costumer enjoy their service, leaving with a smile."
good,the hourly wage is unimpressively low with baristas making on average $11 per hour. There is an obsession with you being busy at every minute of your shift which I find to be taxing and reduces employee morale.
good,"I worked for the company off and on for 6 years and I do not recommend it. The pay is peanuts for the amount of stress this job brings. It seems very cool and relaxed at first, but it tears you down quickly. It's a good first job, but there was no room for advancement for me because I am a straight, white male and dont fill a diversity quota."
good,Over all this company is easy to work for and can be a lot of fun at times. There is ample training and always a new fun thing to learn. Over all I would work here again if the pay was higher.
good,When I started working for Starbucks I thought they were an awesome company but over time seeing who they placed in management made me really wonder. The manager of the store I worked at was the reason I left. She was verbally abusive and unwilling to work with peoples schedules even though they tout being a great place to work for college students.
good,I've learned management is an essential part of a job.  Hardest part is dealing with angry customers and lack of work on co workers.  Work culture is laid back and easy.  Most enjoyable would be not stuck behind a desk.
good,"Starbucks treats their baristas like gods, and their managers like dirt.  Too much work, not enough resources.  Unrealistic expectations and really sub-par training for managers."
good,Overall the team I work with are good people individually but when it comes down to working in an intense situation there are only a few who can manage. Not everyone is focused or they just don't care at all. Our hours are being cut as well.
good,"I love working for Starbucks, its a fun place to meet a diverse group of people both co-workers and customers a like. the only qualms I have for Starbucks is the lack in communication and opportunity for advancement. You get a lot of run around answers and passed over for people who have outside experience, but not the experience needed for the culture we have created within."
good,"I took this job for part-time work to receive full health benefits. If you are pursuing a career and are not receiving benefits, I would recommend getting a job here. For 20 hours a week you can be fully covered for dental, vision, and health."
good,"Working for the company can be exciting and the potential to grow is great as well. But it really depends on the store where you start and the management. The store I worked for was fast-paced, consistently packed, under trained, and those who were trained were over worked especially during peak times. The hardest part of my job was knowing that my peers were not as skilled as I was and if I needed to switch places or take a break, I had to wait for an extended period of time for someone else to show up and take over for my break to step away. Now don't get me wrong, we had qualified baristas that worked at this location, but not nearly as much as we needed for the demands of the store, especially on minimum coverage."
good,"Provided proper training for job duties. Was provided baraista certification, training a trainer, AST Certified, Coffee Master Certification. Gained access to ordering processes, as well as meeting their standards."
good,"Starbucks regularly overcomplicates its menu and drinks combinations which constantly require more effort and energy to make. Don't get me wrong i love my job. I get to go to work and dance, tango out with friends and be what feels like in the center of everything. But unfortunately Starbucks takes advantage of people like me knowing that I'll work hard no matter what based on my personality so therefore lets pay him as little as we possibly can. Also lets make sure no employee ever can work work overtime no matter how how working or efficient you are. Not to mention how much you need the money. And if that is not bad enough I can't even get 70 hours on my bi-weekly check even though I'm my manager's most reliable partner. By the way i don't even make $10/hour."
good,"I work at a Target-Starbucks & it has not been the best experience for me. Management sucks, Target doesn't value baristas even though we bring in many of the customers to the store alone. It sucks. Don't work at a Starbucks inside of Target."
good,"Starbucks is a fun place to work and drink free coffee. It would be great for a college student or someone just looking to work part-time. Working here full-time (or just under), however, post-graduation has been very frustrating. Limited opportunities for advancement and monotonous routines make it a short-term only kind of job."
good,management needs help! the baristas the crew runs the show with no help at all n communication or anything from high up an no appreciation from management no matter how hard the workers work. no matter how sick people are or  no matter how many overtime hours are provided none of it is appreciated
good,"Starbucks can be a great environment and provide many opportunities "
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for. The culture is great, and you will meet great people working here. Benefits are great if you want to stay with the company long term."
good,"made me hate the company i once loved "
good,"Understaffed, would flow better with more competent employees. Fast-paced job, must be a hard worker and quick on feet to succeed, some days better than others."
good,"Aramark isn't known for being too great to it's employees, and this is a REALLY busy location in the middle of a university. The store management in store was nice, but Aramark superiors seemed unfair. Paid minimum wage , no tips. Every year they MIGHT give you a small raise of like 10 cents. Best part: interacting with people was nice (even though there were some annoying customers) and coworkers are cool college students. Everything else pretty much sucked since you didn't get paid much. Really great if you live on campus - short walk from the dorms, can't go wrong."
good,Respective employees need to feel out their manager and the store itself. I worked at an extremely busy Starbucks with a manager solely focused on drive through sales. The end result was a very stressful and often dissatisfying experience.
good,Starbucks is a stressful job especially during the mornings and evenings. some customers are not always nice but it is great to see the customers that come in every day.
good,I've learned to be quick. You can't be slow because orders will pile up and that gets customers angry. The morning rush will always be the hardest part of the job.
good,"It's what you would expect in a ""fast food"" service industry. The demographic there is fun but it doesn't pay enough and I don't think they really care about you."
good,They run everything by the book and are always very professional. Not great benefits and do not value their most loyal employees. Negative work environment at times.
good,Working at starbucks you will learn a lot about coffee and receive good barista training. It is very busy and stressful at times but also its very rewarding and in most stores you will have a great team to get you through the rough shifts.
good,This was my first job and it was years ago. Pay was sad since it was minimum wage almost not worth it with how the customers had treated me. But coworkers were kind.
good,"It was fun, it was tough, and it was always interesting. We'd learn how to make such stiff foam that you could (literally) balance a nickel atop it without it sinking, and we learned how to steam eggnog so it wouldn't scream. I got good and fast at making drinks, and I took especial pride in making them to the best of our abilities"
good,"self managed"
good,"It's a very fast paced environment. It keeps you on your toes, but there's always something to do. We are always busy. The most enjoyable part is the connection you make with the customers though."
good,"At Starbucks through having the zero hour contract it means that there is no financial security, making it hard to want to stay with the company. It can be difficult to get hours, even if you are fantastic at your job because there are so many other people with unstable hours. When they expect so much from employees yet are not able to offer them the bare minimum of what they need."
good,Starbucks is a good company to work for if you need the benefits. Management in most stores is awful and the company itself does not think of the baristas. More focused on making more money for the company. There were labor cuts and more work is put on the barista's back and is a very stressful job.
good,I actually was the team leader at Starbucks in Target. i loved my job. i looked forward to going to work every day. The hardest part of the job is when i was down-sized and placed on the sales floor. the most enjoyable part of the job is making almost 15/hr to do re-shop/push cafs.
good,Everyone works well together and learns coffee art.
good,I loved working with my co-workers and hated dealing with the customers. The managers vary greatly as to ability to run their stores effectively. Mine was not one of the decent ones.
good,Starbucks is a good place to work and they are generous and helpful to there employees. They have great benefits. Your are able to transfer to any Starbucks if you are moving.
good,I enjoyed my job at Starbucks until we where all working twords nothing no raise no more hours because we where all full time already we worked very hard and got paid less than we deserves I did enjoy getting free drinks in order to know what I was offering our costumers I did enjoy the environment and the atmosphere
good,Stressful not so much of a good work life balance job showing favoritism ok work environment i liked doing the job duties very fast paced environment & increased traffic flow
good,"Over the years the Starbucks culture have changed for the worse. It was all about the coffee and customer culture. They have recently started to push more sales and labour, which puts stress onto the entire team, especially management. The wage is not competitive and there solutions to the low wages is added ""benefits"" which is a bonus but not necessarily used by all. The hours are flexible, but are all very short (4-5hour shifts) mid day."
good,"Working at Starbucks is sort of a double edged sword.  You'll find great people to work with there, but the management is often difficult and lacks understanding.  There are some great regular customers, but they tend to be the minority in the mob of ungrateful need-it-now people who make up most of the customer base.  The hours are inconsistent, and the pay is just enough to get by if you have an apartment and want to feed yourself too.  Now, the work is very stressful and fast paced, but at least you can say it builds character.  Overall,  it's just an OK place to work.  Some people love it, many tolerate it, and for many it's an awful place to work at.  I guess, if you're desperate, it's better than no job, but no one should have to work that hard for so long for the meager compensation they provide.  If you're not going to school or living at home, I'd recommend finding anywhere else to work."
good,"I liked the job itself, but I had some coworkers that were rude to me and other employees, as well as to certain customers. My manager failed to repair these issues. Therefore, I left my position as a barista to find a better workplace with better employees."
good,"It is all good for the first year or so, but once you are there for any longer it drains your soul. Makes you feel like you can't do any better. Nice starter job but not good for long term."
good,"The day would start off fairly slow and you would mostly be making teas and simple espresso beverages, then as it gets to midday it would get a lot busier and more active, it was very fun as you get to joke around with your co-workers."
good,A typical day at a Starbucks is usually dealing with various people with different personalities who just want to grab their coffee or lattes and go. Working at Starbucks you learn a lot of patience not only with the customer but sometimes with the employees. The most enjoyable part is getting to know the customer and building a bond with them. The hardest part of the job is working in an environment where the effort of teamwork isn't being presented.
good,"I was required to provide outstanding customer service at the register as well as at the coffee station while making various drinks for customers, maintain back room area and bathrooms."
good,"Era muito corrido, mas a equipe era boa."
good,I left because of management and the way my hours were set up. The assistant manager who made the schedule gave me hours I was unable to work. My manager was always negative and that made my workplace uncomfortable to work in.
good,"This job isn't for everyone and it goes same for this review. The management at starbucks (at least at the one i worked at) was not great. He was inconsistent with hours, would make schedule according to his scheduling and disregarded the days you asked for no matter how far in advance it was. However, the people i worked with were amazing and infact a few i am still friends with now. you can easily make new friends and AT TIMES costumers would be amazing to speak with and be able to hear many of their stories and jokes. If you are looking for a job that pays well and has room for job growth this might not be the job for you."
good,"Starbucks benefitially is a great place to work. It caters to those who use insurance and want to attend college partime, but it's semi hard on those who live on their own and need to afford rent/mortgage. Plenty of hours are made available but the hourly pay adds up as if you where to work 3 days out of the week (9am-5pm) getting paid $10 an hour not including federal withdrawals. The work culture isnt really diverse but it is welcome to everyone. The hardest part of the job was living with the payment every two weeks. The most enjoyable part of working there was the friendship and personalities all in one room. Higher management is well organized but nonrelatable when it comes to the needs of us workers. The lower management is respectful, considerate, and hard working."
good,"For all the pomp and circumstance surrounding Starbucks, it's really just a glorified fast-food chain.  It's better than working at McDonald's, but that's about it.  Everyone makes a big deal about their benefits, and admittedly they are decent, but they aren't as good as people think they are, and the pay is lousy.  A large proportion of the customers are pretentious snobs, upper management is constantly demanding the impossible, and scheduling is inconsistent and unreliable.  It's better than most, but it's still just a corporation."
good,as a part of working nights it was very difficault to work around my daughters lifestyle. it was a very freindly place to work and they were very welcoming to me on my first day. it was challenging to get everything done in time before the hand over in the morning but the people you worked with made work very enjoyable and fun. if you had a problem then management would get straight on the problem and sort it out.
good,"the only problem will be fellow partners, and management. work overall was fine. The starbucks I've worked at, had very poor management, and partners (mostly women) whom caused active High school drama."
good,"I liked working here. It was a cool place, but the chances for growth were really slim. The store I worked at was poorly maintained by the store manager even with my proactive efforts."
good,"Most disappointing was the pay. Expected to learn a heck of a lot and work your tail off for very little money. I enjoyed learning about coffee, making the beverages and some of the social aspects of the job. I am a hard worker so enjoyed how busy we got, but for such a large, successful company the pay is ridiculously low. There are gas stations nearby who pay more and that work is simplistic compared. You will work your butt off here but I enjoyed the customers and sometimes the tips were decent. Management seemed to change every few months and that is disappointing. It is not as if you could talk to your manager during a shift, so discussions about hours and pay were always done on the fly and you felt pushed aside."
good,the management at the starbucks i work at is pretty bad the boss was way to strict and would write up anything that anyone would do. otherwise the expierience was okay
good,good culture and then a lot of change. They should of kept it the same! not a bad company but a culture shock ! they want you to be a robot!
good,"This company takes several years to advance in, so honestly it is better for a younger person who just needs some extra money. The pay rate is generally minimum wage, and the only real perk is the free coffee."
good,"Starbucks requires a lot from their employees.  Be ready to spend ALL of your shift occupied with tasks and customers.  If you are lazy or work at your own pace; don't apply.  Starbucks has made coffee difficult and complicated.  Even when you know the rules/procedures/drink standards customers can belittle you to get what they want (or to get what ""their other store"" gives them.)"
good,Kind of repetitive but that helped me make every visit more special for the next customer. I learned everyday that i was here. Staff help me improve my skills as we all worked on achieving a team goal.
good,"Starbucks is a very fun place to work, however the amount of stress put on the supervisors is astronomical. can be over worked easily and very intense. making the drinks is very fun though!"
good,"They say they embrace a family atmosphere, but if you work there for more than three years theyll look to replace you.  After working there for six years i saw many people who gave theyre all for the company disregared."
good,"Mejorar el clima laboral , cumplir con lo que se le dice al trabajador, no sobrecargarlos de trabajo , ser empaticos"
good,"Typical day at work would be, starting the day at 5:30. Setting up food case and brewing coffee."
good,Customers at this location are overall friendly and you are able to build a relationship with them over a course of time. Many of the customers were utilize the eating facility here on a daily basis. Which allows you to know what products they are wanting and looking for.
good,"I enjoy this job and my team.  Position can be enjoyable, yet stressful. Toughest part of the job is the toll on me physically."
good,Encuentro que es un trabajo que se adapta excelente a tu disponibilidad pero no puedes ser tú
good,"Starbucks is a good company to work for if you are trying to go to school. Flexible hours, and decent benefits for an entry level retail job are definite pluses. "
good,"They are very by the book for the brakes, traing, and raises.  They were always understanding of people needs and wants.  Getting the free coffe, discount of food and items"
good,"I worked for Starbucks for many years and overall I had a wonderful experience. Toward the end of my career at Starbucks I found myself more and more disappointed in the management that was being chosen to lead our team. As a leader for our store I was having a difficult time leading a team when we were not being supported the way we needed to be by our managers. However Starbucks as an overall company is wonderful. The benefits were above and beyond, and environment that is created between you and the direct team you work with is really fun, you really feel like you are a part of a family."
good,"The job is decent the customers can be terrible. Making the drinks takes some time to get down and remember, eventually it becomes natural. The hours suck sometimes."
good,Being at starbucks was a lot of work for no reward. We got paid way too little for the amount of work we do. The environment was very good. Always had great customers that treated you like family
good,"Although Starbucks is known as a good place to work, that perception is all media hype. Starbucks is great in giving partners benefits and compensation, because they treat you extremely poorly. Although in the long run there is a lot to learn working for Starbucks, and it is extremely rewarding interacting with customers, the management is very poor. In the day to day, it is extremely stressful working understaffed and asked to do the work of 4 people at once. If the business is not doing as they expect it to for the day, they ask that you send people home so they do not ""waste labor,"" regardless of what tasks have been completed for the day, and regardless if the business picks up at a later time. My recommendation, do not work for Starbucks."
good,"тяжелый рабочий день,научился пахать,в целом,неплохая компания,но есть свои недочеты"
good,"Avoid, No really a good place to work, Unstable salary, exhausting, bad management, to much responsibility . You can do better."
good,no weekends off vacation time gets denied pushy about sales the #1 priority is sales girls can be catty the discount is nice and gratis (free makeup) management is not helpful
good,"I've worked for the company for about three years. I've had many jobs in food service and customer service. What I've learned is the quick expansion then retraction of growth, poorly affected the company. Business is business, that's a fact. The communication of that is poorly received, simply because they want people to work there. So there is a surface advertising of great pay, benefits, etc. But the underlying issue is that there are so many locations that you can't know what you're going to get. Management varies and partners vary because although they expect a standard out of their baristas, some of the management team can slide under it. They dazzle you with policy changes and dress code improvement, while they slyly take away hours. It's a typical corporation in that respect. Don't make a career out of it. The pay is average for the amount of work you do. It is high volume, therefore high stress. Avoid the drive thru stores if possible. It's a great job for school, if you make it clear that you have a set schedule. You will be expected to bend over backwards for customers, even the rude ones. It's not a highlight of the job, because people take advantage of the barista promise. When management sucks, your whole team sucks. You may be a hard worker, but your coworker isn't. Multitasking and doing the work of three people gets old really quickly. Alot of that hard work will go unnoticed, which makes you question your pay rate. You will feel overworked, because an 8 hour shift with a four thousand dollar day on a staff of 12 people will have you deflated. It gives you little"
good,"Starbucks, depending at which location you work at, and who your managers are, can be wildly diverse. I've worked with accepting, and very much not accepting people. Managers who were flexible and understanding, and those who were a little more dead set. The co-workers are extremely hit and miss. The hardest part of the job is probably maintaining both customer and co-worker relations."
good,Under paid labor and full of crabby workers because the company won't release enough hours that workers can live of off.
good,If you are a college students or don't have many job experience this is a good platform to begin with. It gave the opportunity to balance my student life and work. You have to be cheerful at work even if you don't feel like...it's the Starbucks experience what matters
good,"We are constantly busy and working toward better customer service, but the management is not organized. They tend to focus on small issues and do not give the hours they are required to give."
good,Went through 4 managers in little over a year and each one does things so different. Hours dropped recently drastically from new manager and she had no explanation for it all. Pay is already low although you get tips which isnt much but something.. This Starbucks was inside a price cutters which also offers no discounts and min wage
good,"Great place to work for students or anyone looking for a fun part time job. Benefits are nice and it is generally a fun and engaging place to work. Management varies greatly depending on the location you are employed. Schedules are usually flexible as a part time employee, but it is difficult to get full time hours and schedule is very sporadic once in management."
good,"free coffee free food free college lots of benefits "
good,"Bad management, bad hours. Co workers were nice, but noone managed to stay in the company for more than 2 years. The manager was not prodessional."
good,Grow so fast that some of the leaders don't care. some others are just managing up and stores are not to standards. my time was great until the quality of the leaders decreased. I guess the cost of growing fast.
good,"Les journées sont biens, le travail est simple et si vous êtes chanceux vous avez des partenaires dynamiques et agréables."
good,"Always understaffed"
good,"I have been working for Starbucks for a year and nine months, and what I have learned is that everyone is very easily replaceable. The work is considerably difficult for a starting wage of 8.25 an hour, there are many tasks involved which are tedious and draining. A typical day at work varies depending on your deployment, and the length of your shift. There are quite a few deployments; including hot bar, cold bar (during the summer months), drive-thru, cafe register, customer support, and oven. Management is slightly difficult to talk about because every store is different, but in my personal experience management in my area isn't the best (but could definitely be a lot worse). The sole reason I stay with Starbucks is my coworkers, typically Starbucks will hire quirky, energetic people. I have come to know my coworkers as a second family. The hardest part of my job would have to be the clientele. The people that come to Starbucks can be very particular, or pervy, or just plain rude. The most enjoyable part of my job is definitely being able to go into work and know that I am appreciated my my coworkers."
good,"I worked for this company for almost three years at two different locations. Day to day life had ups and downs, but I didn't mind my time spent there."
good,"starbucks is a very fast paced enviorment. it can sometimes be very overhelming. a typical morning at starbucks is very hectic, long lines, impatient customers, which was the hardest part of the job in my opinion."
good,Fast paced with particular customers.  Scattered/long hours.  Heavy workload expectations with little time given to complete.  Great company culture and great people to work with.  No development options past store manager unless you wait years.  Upper management varies with recognition/coaching techniques.
good,Flexible scheduling. Partners become like a second family in this company. Learn different multi-tasking skills and balancing work and personal life better.
good,"The job is great, however management needs some tightening up. I would definitely recommend it to a friend. Overall it was a good job for high school."
good,"Honestly, the job is rewarding and the people I work with are amazing. Everyone is willing to help one another out, however the management of the store needs improvement. Scheduling is not consistent, and the manager is not emotionally stable during stressful situations. May occasionally take out frustration on the staff working."
good,"Came in from the outside. This is a very tough transition! "
good,"a typical day is good, it is just the customers that makes it hard to deal with and be positive when they damp-up the mood. I am constantly learning from work but the management from the district I am at can be better improved."
good,I would make boxes and also clean up coffee if it spilled I would double check the coffee bags and make sure they met every standard before loading on to a pallet to be shipped.
good,"I had always wanted to work at Starbucks, but when I got hired on I realized what I had gotten myself into. This may be different at other stores, but at the one I worked at the managers played favorites, but blamed others for it. There was a manager who worked there 6 years who would sexually harass the other workers. People complained to the manager countless times, but he never got fired or punished for it. They also almost insisted you work over 40 hours, even if you were in school. They refused to hire anyone who was in high school. This workplace was filled with drama. I don't recommend working at this location."
good,If you are a fast learner and have good memorization skills you will be fine. Must be able to walking talk and make drinks all t the say time plus ring up the person.
good,Most days you would go into work knowing you had to pick up the slack of whoever worked before you because unfortunately the manager at the time was shown very little respect by the other employees and she did not know how to take control. Most shifts were stress filled and in the end it was not a company I wanted to be a part of as I did not like how the rest of the team decided to present us.
good,"Provided excellent customer service in an extremely upscale environment. Up sold on a wide variety of retail items while serving and preparing a array of menu items. Most challenging part of the day included a heavy flow of traffic with limited staff, and also learning all menu recipes. Most enjoyable part of the day included the diversity of staff and friendliness of the regular customers that mainly come in for someone to talk to."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of keeping the cafe clean, and interacting and connecting with customers to create a warm, and familial experience. I learned how to keep busy even when there was very little to do. Management was always on top of their game making sure their employees made each and every customer happy and that they went above and beyond customer expectations. My co-workers always worked as a team and helped to keep everything clean and organized. The hardest part of the job were the occasional rush hours, and the most enjoyable part was being able to meet new people, and of course, drink the coffee."
good,"empresa excelente para quem estar começando no mercado"
good,"This would have been a really fun job, but the particular store I worked at had a high turn out rate and the management was awful."
good,"Although Starbucks provides a great opportunity for growth, training regiment needs improvement.  Starbucks need to invest more time in consulting with basic policies on managerial levels."
good,"Great company to learn from and not a hard job by any means. However, you are at the mercy of upper management in regards to promotion of any kind."
good,"I worked at Starbucks for almost 3 years. I loved it initially. Over time, Starbucks became money hungry and they started burning out their employees. The fact that Mcdonalds starts their employees at a higher starting rate than Starbucks does speaks volumes. The stress of working at Starbucks is not worth it. Forget having genuine conversations with customers. It's all about the times, the sales, the cheesy smile on your face, the perfect looking lobby, etc. the only thing I liked was the job flexibility and a few awesome co workers. However, be prepared to get asked to come in early, stay later, get called on your mornings off to come in, etc. You will burn out. My last store had a wonderful manager, but Starbucks became too stressful to balance with school. All you'll want to do is go home and veg for multiple hours to relax. Forget productivity after work. Overall, I learned some great life lessons at Starbucks but it's not worth making a career out of or staying with long term until they learn to treat their tenured employees with more than minimum wage."
good,"Very intimating off the bat but I loved the people I worked with, making drinks was fun and my favourite part of the job. Management wasn't the greatest. Would often take vacations during the busiest parts of the year and wouldn't communicate important events making things stressful."
good,Great co workers but not paid well enough. A typical day in Starbucks consists of being in a tight space with a bunch of workers. Depending on what time of the year it is it can be either really cold or really hot in the store.
good,"I love making coffee, I Like making someones day better with something as small as a cup of coffee."
good,"Learned how to work as part of a team, However management was unprofessional. "
good,"Working at Starbucks required you to be on top of your game and kept your mind working. Hospitality is a top priority and it shows. It teaches you how to be fast but proficient with customers orders. Management helped just as much as you would hope they would. The hardest part about working there is how fast you have to be, no matter what position you may be in. Although, the free drinks during your shift, and a free drink at the end of your shift had to be my most favorable part of my experience at Starbucks."
good,A great place to work if you are a student or want part time employment within the Starbucks. With in Safeway the moral is low and unfriendly.
good,"This job was an excellent employment opportunity while I was in my post-baccalaureate pre-med program.  Customer service is hard work, especially when working for a company like Starbucks that has a strong reputation.  The partners need to reflect well on the company, and I appreciate how the managers made sure to communicate that with frequent store meetings and one-on-one coaching.  "
good,"i learned a lot about working for this company. Working at a fast pace,doing inventory, management, and much more. what i love most about that job is forming relatonships with the customers. They are the reason that i have  came to work everyday."
good,"I was a General Manager but really only a high paid Barista. The company did offer great benefits, and would be a good job for new managers."
good,Great benefits but not a great place to work. Hard to have a life with this job. It pays poorly and over works its employees. Maybe if you were in school but not great for someone needing income.
good,Management favors those of similar race. They ignore the availability you inform them on and schedule you during conflicting hours. Quick to take advantage of employees and overwork them.
good,"Varied activities each day. Fast paced culture, not overly structured. Fair amount of senior leadership interaction. Brand halo is a great attractor for talent."
good,"Starbucks in an overall fun job to have. Can be stressful, but my co-workers always made it worth it. Management, at times, was a little questionable, but in overall I enjoyed my experience. Life work balance was tough since we were often short staff."
good,Worked for Starbucks for 7 and 1/2 years.  was assaulted 5 times (twice by customers and 3 times by Starbucks employees)!!!  Couldn't take it anymore.
good,good for a first time jobber. takes a while to move up in the company. very strict on protocol and policy. busy environment but great on production in customer service skills
good,"Started the job well, but overtime it lost its lust. Store manager was FIRED after I left the location. Assistant manager was a saint and loved working with her. Store manager would come in and sit in the back office for 90% of her time in the store which was about 5 hours a day. The other 10% she would help on the line but mostly to keep up appearances. Took a second job during my employment, and asked for a 30 hours a week instead of 40. Store manager actually got mad at me for this, an kept my schedule. Worked with her from 5am-1:30pm and didn't get off my other job until 11pm. Turned out the store manager was fabricating her own time sheets and using my hours and other's hours to make up for the discrepancies. "
good,"Fun place to work. Learned a great deal about people and myself. The partners are wonderful and helpful. I loved my customers, always friendly and enjoyed being a service to them."
good,"-Make beverages"
good,it's always busy. I have learned that all people in there don't get along with each other they don't participate to make the place a better place. i believe that they should be more strict on management and shift managers because half of this places are just teens being shift managers. The hardest part for me was when i try getting help from the crew and i don't get it so it made me to get slacking in my performance. I enjoy making drinks and to talk to the customers and help for there needs.
good,"é uma empresa com um valor cultural muito grande, onde seus funcionários realmente aprendem sobre o café, sua principal matéria prima."
good,"Starbucks needs to pay employees market value.  Work/life balance is good overall.  "
good,"Je wisselt vaak van taken op een dag, daardoor heel afwisselend."
good,"A typical busy day there considering the building it is in. Consists of opening at 6am and closing at 5pm. In the morning around 6:10am there is a line of customers waiting from a three or four store distance to get their orders taken. They call it a rush which is consistent until about 10:30 or 11am. There are about two or three hours of downtime which is when everyone takes turns breaking for lunch or just a break. NO one gets a morning break before the rush."
good,I hate working here. My supervisor has me in a position and I am not being paid for what I am doing. My supervisor could care less about the issues that have transpired within the members of the team nor does she care if some of us are uncomfortable.
good,Compensation for baristas and supervisors are as expected -- low. But management is overworked and severely underpaid. Expectations are nearly impossible to reach and you are not rewarded as fairly as expected.
good,"Friendly and enthusiastic, I have two years of specialization"
good,"Did not like most of my co-workers, hard work and random hours. Not much sense of camraderie. Unenjoyable time working there."
good,"Making drinks, cleaning, stocking and serving with a smile"
good,"A typical day included taking drive through/front register orders and making orders. I learned how to make most espresso drinks and work in a very fast paced environment. Management was very poor, store manager couldn't make drink or take orders. Also shaved off peoples hours so she didn't have to pay them for over time. I was friends with almost all my coworkers, some still to this day. The hardest part was the speed you had to work in order to keep up with everything. The most enjoyable part was probably the free coffee and the people I worked with."
good,"Depending on the store and location it can be either a slow yet somewhat steady flow of customers or it can be busy and hectic in others.  The job itself as a barista can be a an enjoyable one.  There is a lot of cleaning that needs to happen and as long as everyone pulls there weight and communicates it is a lot less stressful.  "
good,"Starbucks is a very fast paced job, this job is not for the faint of heart. It's a great company to work for because of all the customers that come and get their pastry, breakfast sandwich, or beverage of choice. We all get along as co-workers. the hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult customers, there times where no matter what we do, we just can't make a customer happy."
good,"Its a good job, but when you have nothing but kids working for you it can be very very stressful. but I was working under Safeway Inc."
good,"É uma grande empresa e com muita cultura e muita coisa a ensinar, no entanto perde muito pela alta rotatividade de funcionários e pelas gerências de suas lojas, que nem sempre possuem a competência necessária para tais cargos."
good,"It's a great workplace when you have the right people and labor hours to make smoothly run shift. Otherwise, you constantly need tons of O2 and caffeine to get you through. To conclude, mostly a typical day at work is under-staff."
good,"Starbucks has taken many steps in the past decade to ensure employees are taken care of. On the hourly level they have in the past years. In the current once salaried you are underpaid, overworked and underappreciated. They set high goals so we cannot bonus, the pay makes it so your poor yet to rich in the government's eyes for any kind of help. I never have food in my fridge and have to spend over 15% of my income getting to work for a month. They are a typical corporation. They preach one thing take care of the low levels to keep them at bay. They do another and the bottom line is all that matters not their people as they preach."
good,"With a large number of customers coming in every day we have to be very organised. Not only does this involve great costumer service and drink preparation, but also constant stock checking and renewals, awareness of offers and products but also a strict cleaning routine. Cleanliness is paramount to the workings of a cafe, not only the customer area, tables, toilets, floors, but also large equipment such as ovens (pannini grills), espresso machines, fridges. These tasks have to be completed everyday and through time management it can be achieved. I am happy working hard, but also like to converse with costumers, many of whom are regulars."
good,"Although I learned a great deal in my year-plus working there, it is poorly managed and very stressful with little to no support from leaders."
good,"Each day at Starbucks was both unique and routine. I have learned many things such as the diversity of customers and their individual likes and dislikes. "
good,"Hay mucha presión en cuanto a la cantidad de gente que asiste a diario, es líneal, todo lleva un patrón establecido, es un sistema, si se esta en la mañana es muy raro que se salga a la hora establecida, se dan unos 30 o 40 min del tiempo personal, tiempo que no se paga por supuesto, la comunicación con altos mandos es escasa, por eso cualquier cosa que se exponga se mal entiente, he aprendido mucho, tengo una mayor fluidez en cuanto a la comunicación con las personas, me a dejado muchas cosas buenas, como la rapidez al antender al cliente, siempre mantener una buena actitud y ser comprometido."
good,"A typical day at work consists of drinking coffee, checking email, data analysis, adjusting forecasts, meetings, socializing..."
good,"this was a cool place to work at, but unless management Loves you there is no growth."
good,"Every day at Starbucks you are met with successes and challenges. You can work an 8 hour day, or a 14 depending on your team and where the cafe is at. I learned how to work with a diverse group of people while rolling out new, innovative things every quarter. Peers can be fickle, but thats in any company. Hardest part is meeting the demands of the leaders on a consistent basis. They are out of touch with what managers really work with. The best part is getting to meet new people, the coffee, and the benefits."
good,"When I first started, I looked forward to coming to work in the morning.  When my first manager left, however, things changed."
good,Great place to work and be social with colleagues and customers. Busy and fast paced environment but it makes you more adaptable to difficult situations and thinking on your feet.
good,"Ambinete piuttosto rigido ma anche flessibile nelle ore lavorative,"
good,Everything was good until certain employees decided to ruin it.
good,"Working for Starbucks, like most food/ beverage industries was difficult at times. What I learned from this job is how to better my customer service skills. The management was constantly changing so it was hard to keep up with all the changes but my co-workers and I were very close and that made my job very enjoyable."
good,"On a typical day I take drink orders, run the register, make drinks at the bar, serve food, clean, stock and make people happy. "
good,"Starbucks is an interesting and complex company with a culture to match: while there is a great pressure to focus on making genuine connections, creating finely crafted beverages and maintaining a welcoming environment there are even greater pressures to perform almost as automata: tasks are broken down into timed increments and punishment doled out for any who don't perform quickly enough."
good,The hardest part of the job is working with the staff at the particular place I worked at.  It was not enjoyable to go to work because their was poor communication between shift leads and baristas as well as between baristas.  It was enjoyable conversing with the usual costumers on a day to day basis.
good,"Working at Starbucks is physically and mentally challenging, but it is also rewarding. It's nice being able provide excellent service and good products to people in a friendly environment that encourages customer loyalty. It is very fast paced and difficult, but fun. The people I work with are amazing. The hours and pay are not great, however. I would like to work somewhere that can provide more reliable hours and a set schedule that does not involve working so many evenings and weekends. This was a transition job for me, and though I've enjoyed it, I am ready to move on."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks starts with a a line outside of the door and continues for about 3 hours before there is a slight break. I multitask throughout this time by brewing coffee, operating the cash register, heating up pastries, making beverages, answering the phone, cleaning and restocking. It can get hectic and it is easy to get frustrated but when you have a great team it helps the process run smoothly. From my experience in working here I have come to appreciate teamwork and being a team player. The most enjoyable part of my day is getting to work with hardworking co-workers."
good,Company thinks that it's better than it is. Work is physically demanding. Breaks don't always happen. Shift managers aren't always trained well. Workplace drama happens frequently.
good,"Great members of staff, they all work well together and make you feel very welcome."
good,"The company has great benefits, the pay is not good, and if you have a good manager then you are seriously....just don't ever quit! "
good,Starbucks was a fun job to have. It was very fast and interacting with the customers and being able to make their drinks was the best part of the job.
good,"Starbucks is a company with many positives and negatives. And as time continues with each year there are more negatives. Upper management has lost touch with how it is to work in a store. Increasing responsibilities are coupled with decreasing labor allowances, leading to staffing shortages that make it very difficult to accomplish the tasks assigned and difficult to maintain store cleanliness."
good,"Working for La Boulange has been great. I've watched this company develop and become part of the Starbucks family. There is no work life balance, just yet, but hopefully it will come."
good,"Starbucks is a fun place to work but it is very hard work also.  The good news is the best customers go there and they are so interesting."
good,"As a Manager you are a robot who does the bidding of upper Management. You can't succesfully take care of your Partners (staff)"
good,"Starbucks is a decent enough company but like most corporate entities cannot be judged as a whole based on one persons experience in one corner of the world.  In my time with the company I've met several talented and delightful people but only a few have stayed with the company and made it what we generally read about in terms of positive reviews.  Mostly I have met irresponsible children who don't like work and management(on more than one level) that doesn't know what is going on or how to to do their jobs effectively.  At this point I'd like to point out that I work in South Texas and am considered a veteran partner after only a year."
good,"Very settled environment, workers wouldn't mind helping each other when needed. The most enjoyable part of the job were the workers, if you have a positive and joyful staff work will be a lot easier."
good,"Sadly, it all depends on your manager.  Sometimes you get childish coworkers, but you could also get amazing coworkers as well.  It can be a hit or a miss.  Breaks are short, and sometimes you don't even get them.  Starbucks is currently working on that problem.  The hardest part about the job is that you are never really off of work because you are getting calls from other stores and your coworkers.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the regular customers that you become friends with.  I also really enjoyed making drinks.  During the summer and Christmas time it is SUPER busy.  And drive through, you have to be a master at multitasking in order to stay sane."
good,"Highly customer service oriented. Learn to make drinks and prepare hand-crafted beverages. Develop new skills such as communication skills, money handling, working in a fast-pace environment with a team or independently. Learn to deal with different type of customers. The attitudes/moods of customers vary so be prepared and professional. Keep work environment up to Quality Assurance Standards (health/food safety and clean areas). Most enjoyable part is working along side some of the hardest working people juggling work and school. Tips are nice depending on location. Hours vary."
good,"Most shifts start early and end late, a Barista starts her shift by setting up the store for the day and making sure that everything is fully stocked. The day is spent entirely on your feet constantly moving and serving others. There is lots of repetitive motion and many things to remember like customer orders. The whole time that a shift is happening a smile and personable attitude has to be kept, even in the middle of a giant rush."
good,"Customer service heavy, but highly enjoyable. Encompasses many aspects of customer satifaction."
good,Good healthcare for part time employees. Flexible scheduling but erratic hours week to week.
good,"I had a good time overall working at Starbucks. My coworkers and supervisors were friendly and helpful in showing me the ropes. My problems all happened with my manager. Her approach to instruction was to let you keep guessing until you got it right. If you didn't know how to do something perfectly by the second time you did it, she was done with you. The first time I opened, I was already getting scolded for needing an explanation as to how something worked that I had never done before. I was also told to stop complaining and get back to work after I got what was likely a mild concussion. My manager told me that people who hit their heads don't feel nauseous after, which was a lie. All of us had to work while sick or injured. Getting sent home might happen if your supervisor thought it was necessary, but you would get lectured and possibly written up if that happened. We had one partner who injured his knee pretty severely who still had to work while undergoing physical therapy. Though you start out earning minimum wage, I was told I would get a raise after my review based on performance. I learned that a typical raise is something like $0.75 with a $0.40 cost of living adjustment. One of my supervisors had been working for Starbucks for ten years and couldn't support himself unless he worked full time because his pay was so low. While the customers were all nice and interacting with them was by far the best part of the job, I constantly felt like the hammer could come down at any second. Eventually, I came to work thinking I was fifteen minutes early. I was actually fifteen"
good,"formation complête en theorie, sur le terrain manque de comprehension du à la différence d'age entre le manager du site et le stagiaire"
good,"A typical day at work, could include from burning your hand from spilling coffee or even steamed milk. To an unhappy customer because all the lids are the same. "
good,"A typical day was opening the store, putting together the pastry case, brewing the coffee, making the tea and making sure everything was in order. During the day it is very faced paced. My team members were amazing. i learned so much about the drinks and dealing with not so ideal customers. The management wasn't so great. My manager was never around the area. I only talked to her a couple times. The most enjoyable part was being apart of a team."
good,A typical day includes making drinks and taking orders for customers. Chatting with customers and co-workers.
good,"A typical day at work is assisting customers and providing them with timely, friendly service. The team members are friendly and very professional, the hardest parrt of the job is keeping up with the high food demands of customers. Overall, the day runs smoothly."
good,The hardest part of the job was how busy it was all the time but i also like the challenge
good,"Starbucks was a great starting job. It forced me to get a head start on my day as i started a typical day opening at 5:15 a.m. I would prepare coffee and stock blends and ingredients that were going to be used throughout the day. I would brew coffee and make drinks costumed to how the costumer preferred it. I learned a lot about how people work and how to work well with people who do things differently than i do. I also enjoyed being with people while working as i think it is important to be respectful and have fun doing your job. The co-workers were always willing to help out in covering and switching shifts when needed and were there to help out when things started to get hectic. Management was alright, i had some issues with scheduling while going to school. In The end the hardest part of the job was to remember the certain order to make the drinks and the most enjoyable was making a friendship with the regular costumers who came in every single day."
good,"*Days at work are very unpredictable.  You dont know if someone has called in sick and things can change in an instant."
good,"a typical day at starbucks is hardworking, face pace, physical and fun all at the same time. my co workers are all team players and we serve our customers with the best quality of customer service."
good,"fun co-workers, interacting with customers, enjoy making drinks and peronalizing them.."
good,"Made drinks for customers, provided customer service, and handled cash register."
good,"A typical work day included making drinks conversating with regular customers, stocking and warming up pastries. I leared how to build customer relations and how to be a barista. The managment was horrible not orderly at all. My co-workers hated working there but I loved it. The hardest part would be.. coming to work with people who didnt like being there. The most enjoyable part was seeing the same customers coming back because they were always satisfyed."
good,"Great place to work if you're not a manager. Take great care of their people, but ask for managers to do too much with too little."
good,It is overall a good place to work if you are going to school because they can work around your schooling. Management is not that great they need to work on that more. My co-workers were for the most part fun people to socialize with but when it came to work they were very lazy. The hardest part of the job was tolerating inconsiderate behaviors of my co- workers. The most enjoyable part of the job was making drinks.
good,"A typical day in work involved serving customers in friendly manner, connecting with them on a personal level. Making Coffee. I learned how to make coffee and how do deal in a fast paced environment. Management was decent, I decided to leave at this time because of a change in managers, the new manager was not the best at dealing with people. My co-workers were friendly, all from different parts of the world, it was interesting to meet people from different parts of the world. The hardest part of the Job was the fluctuating hours, never knowing what my next week would be, I could ask for days off if I needed them but I never knew how many days working I would have. Talking to people of different culture's to my own, from every part of the world."
good,"Great smell of coffee greats you when you enter, you get your apron and sign in and your supervisor lets you know what section your going to stay (usually favoritism had a lot to do with this) the hardest part was dealing with the favoritism and racism I had to deal with. The most enjoyable part- the smell of coffee."
good,This was one of two jobs I worked at simultaneously. I basically worked here to make ends meet. It was basic retail pay and requirements but I genuinely liked the environment I worked in. I didn't make much money there but I loved working there
good,"This Starbucks was inside a Target, so everyone had to follow Target rules. This made it very hard to enjoy your job with Starbucks. As we did not get the same benefits other Starbuck employees received. The shop was in the front of the Target store, so when you needed to refresh your cooler you would have to walk all the way in the back to find your stuff. Not to mention the Target employees would cover the Starbuck merchandise up with their stuff, making it even harder. Starbuck corp. would tell us to do things one way, then Target management would tell us to do just the opposite."
good,Working various shifts from arriving at 5:00am to a closing shift and leaving at 11:00pm. Another experience in customer service where remembering customer's name and drinks was a large part of customer retention and growth. Extreme product knowledge and training of the staff to get them up to speed in this fast paced environment. I learned about the coffee business and somewhat developed my palette for tasting coffees over time. High turnover with a younger staff and so recruiting was constant. Sales were grown over my period there which was satisfying. I introduced live music to the location which still continues today.
good,"You truly get to know who you are as a person when you work at Starbucks. You become keenly aware of what you are made of, how to handle highly stressful situations, and what to do in a time of crisis. One of the most difficult jobs I've ever come across. Hard on your body. Great opportunity to build relationships and be a light to those you come into contact everyday."
good,Starbucks as a corporation has fantastic benefits for their team members and is committed to Global Responsibility.
good,Company was exciting!  Learning about coffee and it's culture was fun and beneficial.
good,This is a great compnay to work for. but they need to either stop hiring externally or train their managers to stop thinking with their heads so far up their bums that they cannot see their subordinates as anything but lower life forms or robots. I worked under 2 managers during my time there and both were horrid is different ways.
good,Enjoyed working in the busy atmosphere meeting and serving new people every day.
good,I'm a cashier and work only part time. I enjoy the customers and talk to them. 
good,"Honestly, a very enjoyable job solely based on most staffing and customer interaction.  It taught me the value of seeing a customer's genuine smile after every cup of coffee while providing my honest and earnest gestures.  Initially, my time with co-workers grew a bound that can truly allow us to be called partners as opposed to just fellow employees.  These other driven individuals created a warm, but thriving work environment that allowed me to grow both as a person and as a sales associate."
good,Its' ok but need a few things to change. No work life balance.
good,"Fun working with different types of cultures from staff members to customers. "
good,Make orders quickly and neatly as possible
good,Great company overall to work for as a Batista. Advancement within the company is relatively easy if one can get follow the politics that's being handed down tron the upper management. Training is a joke for middle management. Really depends on who you got assigned to as your trainer. Upper managements does not appreciates you only the number that you could crank up. Some uppermanagement are not fully trained and are incapable of training and developing of managers who looking to move up.
good,Learned great customer service
good,"A typical day of work starts dark and early, having 30 minutes to prepare coffee, tea & pastry case for the people waiting outside the door, They line up impatiently for hours and then the day fades into side tasks and shooting the breeze. You have the opportunity to learn a lot about the human race and also the world of coffee in many facets. The Starbucks corporation LOVES itself and proudly proclaims all of its accomplishments to the world, often times while ignoring other priorities to their business. The hardest part of the job is doing the same thing over and over again everyday, without even making enough money to support a lifestyle of basic needs. You not only are expected to make and serve coffee, tea or frappuccinos, connect with customers and be a cashier.. but you are also expected to deep clean drains, wash dishes, scrub toilets and floors, take out the trash, maintain appliances, manage inventory and suggest-suggest-suggest whatever new product the company is focusing on. But the best part is, at the end of the shift, you can walk away and leave all of your ""work"" behind you. Clock out and go home without thinking twice about the guy who accused you of giving him the wrong amount of change back, or the lady who made you count 16 splenda to put in her latte and asked you 4 times if you were ""sure"" it was decaf."
good,"Coffee ,tea, food and juice the perfect place where you can meet new people and still git your work down all at the same time the perfect place. A typical is very busy, caring funny .Starbucks"
good,Provide customer service in a coffee based cafe. Offer a community like atmosphere.
good,"Count your cash, check your prep, execute tasks that were not completed on previous shift, complete your daily tasks."
good,"As a customer, I love the Starbucks Company. However, I believe that you have to genuinely love the company to enjoy working there. I say this because a typical work day is always steady with customers. So, if you like the fast pace environment then Starbucks would be a good place for you. The Starbucks that I have worked at was located in a outlet, so it was busier then stand-alone stores. Management there is good, but not great and same with co-workers. I enjoyed working with them, but if anyone was having a bad day, you would know it. There is nothing hard about the job although it may come off that way because of all the drinks you need to remember. After you learn it once, it becomes second nature. I did enjoy working for the company, however, it is just not the right place for me."
good,"A typical day at work for me was to clean up after the morning and mid-shift and prepare the openers for their tasks. In doing this job I've increased my ""people"" skills and can approach customers with ease as well as work in a group or individually toward a common goal. I've worked at three different Starbucks stores and my first two I worked for had good management. My third store's management lacked skills and professionalism expected from management. For the most part, my co-workers were easy to work with but no one was trustworthy. The hardest part of my job was to work with co-workers who did not complete their tasks when asked or to continue working for a job in which no forward promotion came my way. The most enjoyable part of my job was that I made some good relationships with a few of my coworkers and I love working and communicating to people and this job was a great place to do that."
good,"A typical day at work involves me coaching and inspiring my team to adhere to our customer service vision. In addition to that, I am responsible for reviewing key business indicators that affect the performance of the business. I serve as a liason to the CEO of the company by advocating and believing in the product I am selling. I am an accountant, inventory specialist, coach, mentor, teacher, human resource specialist, loss prevention all wrapped up in one role as a Manager. What you learn most about being a Manager is dealing with other people's personality and being able to keep them motivated during day-to-day pressures. The hardest part of my job is what I learn the most about being a Manager. The most enjoyable part of my day is when I am actually able to create a truly genuine inspired moment in someone else's day."
good,"I learned how to make quality beverages, did a lot of cleaning. Handled cash and completed transactions on a daily basis. Worked with a lot of lovely people. My favorite thing would be meeting new people every day, and seeing the regulars and putting smiles on everyone’s faces."
good,"When I arrived at work at Starbucks it consisted of running the cash register, making coffee, and keeping the kiosk clean. This job taught me customer service, how to deal with a difficult customer, and multitasking."
good,"At the time that I joined Starbucks, they were going through major changes. The original CEO returned to work again after 11 years hiatus. It was a great deal of learning and then relearning, but I welcomed the challenge. My team consisted of 33 employees so it required some strategy as far as being able to spend time working and getting to know each one. I must admit that the early morning shifts can be tough and very few people ever wanted to work it, so it was hard to find people who wanted to do so. I liked that the company was always launching new products so boredom was not an issue."
good,"Good employees and a fun atmosphere. Kept busy and learned customer service, and how to deal with people. Management was good and how schedules out with 2 weeks of days working. Reliable co-workers that stayed long term. The hardest part of job was working late. The most enjoyable part of the job was having repeat customers you grew relationships with."
good,was a great place to work for until Howard schultz took the company back over and stared to change the standards that had been set by people who acually new what they were doing
good,"I helped others in the field, I received schooling and I loved my co-workers. So many talented people, a lot to learn from."
good,"I had lots of fun working for Starbucks, no problems with the shift leads or the store manager, but it's the ones in corporate who really mess you up. A lot of times they promote who ever sucks up to them the most, but that all depends on what region you're working at."
good,"I loved the people and the message Starbucks has, but the management at my store was absolutely terrible. There were call offs all the time and they wouldn’t be reprimanded which added stress onto the team that shift."
good,"Customers were often very rude, and the environment was not always welcoming and friendly. The most important thing was speed over quality like a non chain coffee shop would be."
good,"I put orders away placed orders and helped customers find what they are looking for. "
good,This job was great for making friends and having a great time but not a good long term job. Certain managers can overwork you and not give you the schedule you need for school or 2nd job
good,"A recommended first job to help individuals realize the basics of customer service, organizational skills, social skills and multitasking skills. It is a good environment to build confidence and problem solving skills as well for those who lack job experience."
good,"This location is on Highway 50 as one passes through Canon City. Thus, it is regularly overwhelmed with customers."
good,"working at Starbucks requires you to be able to multitask in a fast paced work environment , as well as connect with customers. if can be hard to get used to but given you get along with the other staff you can learn to love the job and what it entails. ( i specifically worked in a drive thru store which explains the fast paced environment, this is not true of all locations.)"
good,"Management was great until a new manager took over and lacked empathy for team, a lot of my coworkers left except for me. Teams need leaders they can look up to."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Starbucks very much. Unfortunately, my hours were cut at a rough time and because of this I am looking for a different line of work."
good,"The company itself is amazing and if all managers adhered to the company vision- it'd be a great place to work. Unfortunately, at my location, my manager had clear favorites and did not pay mind to the other ones of us actually doing the hard work."
good,"I do not have anything to add at this time.  However, if you do need something I feel that the pay scale could be adjusted to help get more qualified partners."
good,"Die Arbeit im Team bei Starbucks ist sicherlich anstrengend und kann auch stressig werden, jedoch macht es unhemlich Spaß täglich so viele Gäste durch guten Service zufrieden zu stellen."
good,"Your experience with the company is directly affected by the type of manager you have. I went through 4 in my time there. 2 were AWFUL and made life harder, 2 were great and supported their staff and encouraged their advancement in the company."
good,"The job itself is fast paced, and interactive it has great benefits, and a fun atmosphere. Being friendly and enthusiastic is a huge part of connecting with customers to create that genuine Starbucks experience. "
good,"It really depends on your coworkers and management. The store I'm at has fantastic coworkers and fair management. Be prepared to work. This is not a job for sitting on your butt and texting people. There is a lot to learn, lots of details to remember. Like any job in a big company - corporate makes decisions that aren't necessarily in touch with the front lines work. But if you have a decent manager it all works out. Benefits are decent, but the pay is terrible. Great job if you need a second job or are looking to just make a little extra cash. Hard to make a living full time here unless you are a store manager or above."
good,"Staff were friendly and fun to work with. Manager was picky with who they got along with, thus making some staff do a lot more than others, such as scrubbing skirting boards, cleaning and washing up instead of being able to serve customers and make coffee."
good,"Starbucks was just not for me. I enjoyed it a lot at first, but management was not flexible and not as kind and inviting as I had hoped. I let them know from the beginning I needed flexibility and I did not get that."
good,"A good first job, a challenge in the beginning while you develop people skills. The advancement opportunity is ok but reliant on management turn over rate.  Your coworkers have a big influence on your work load and stress load. You are like a cog in a machine, turning and turning while staying in the same position. If you have bigger dreams for yourself this job is a stepping stone and should not be the final destination."
good,"Working for Starbucks can be very challenging especially working at a drive thru. In the last year (2019) they have decided to cut training down from about 1.5 weeks to 4 days with absolutely no way for you to learn anything during your training because its always so busy they will kick you off the position you were at."
good,Overall working in starbucks is enjoyable. There are times where things can be stressful or have the odd customer complaint apart from that the team was fun to get along with and with the occasional incentives things can get competitive.
good,Working for Starbucks gives you the challenges that are shown every day such as making sure customers are happy with your service. You should always have a smile on your face. Communication with your coworkers as well as your managers. Understanding that there are many different people who are going to walk through your door expecting each service to be detail towards them. Customers are always right even if you may not think they're right. Customer service should be top-notch and your first priority.
good,"This job would be good for high school or college  not for a career. My personal location did not have good management at the time, but it could have gotten better by now. They are open through most of the day, so getting hours wasn’t difficult and finding a schedule that worked with my person life wasn’t too hard either"
good,"No matter how great your manager, coworkers, and customers are- you're still working for a big corporation. They do not care about you. You will be doing the job of three people."
good,"It was tough being one of the oldest worker, the younger workers were not very respectful. And I felt the management was more worried about sales than their employees."
good,"Loved the idea of being apart of the company, management somewhat stand-offish at my location. Could have been more training. Hours and schedule was pretty flexible. Good benefits for part time."
good,"Cliques"
good,Our store manager wasn’t a very good one. She has trouble balancing a social life and work. For the most part the benefits were good such as free food and unlimited drinks. Making a genuine connection with the customers was my favorite part.
good,"The job came with a lot of benefits such as free coffee and the ASU college program. All the employees are really great, but stress can get in the way of enjoying your job a lot of the time.Overall, management puts a lot of their work on their baristas and shift supervisors. This made it an under paid job in my opinion."
good,"Sometimes, working at Starbucks is fun and exciting. Sometimes, it honestly sucks. As of recently, the company has placed a bigger focus on profit and has cut labor significantly, increasing the stress of all of its employees."
good,"Don’t get me wrong, Starbucks is a great company to work for because of its great benefits it offers for both part time and full time employees BUT with this particular location there are lots of flaws. Favoritism and Seniority come into play a lot when it comes to requesting off or wanting to move your way up. Doesn’t matter how hard you work it won’t get recognized. If manager is upset and cranky just know it will rub off on everyone else. Work shouldn’t be about pleasing the manager should be about pleasing the customers and having a fun time doing so."
good,it was a great place to get work experience and get out of my comfort zone! i learned a lot about cultures as well which i thought was cool. They also only hire people who are HAPPY!
good,I worked at multiple locations for over a year and a half. Theyre okay with giving you your availability but suck if you have an emergency call out with out notice and cant find a replacement though you could be dying an they still want a replacement for you
good,"I absolutely loved working at starbucks. The movement in the stores always gave me something to do and the people I worked with were great. The hardest part of this place is just getting used to the routine and trying to figure out the timing of everything, but once you get used to it, it's all just muscle memory from there. The benefits make the job worthwhile and it's pretty good experience to have."
good,The hours and expectations are super flexible. The pay is poor and the turnover is high. Its a good bridge job and the access to the caffeine is fantastic. the management is apathetic to problems and turnover.
good,"I didn't have a good experience at Starbucks. I enjoyed the work, but my team was clique-y and introverted. I didn't feel set up to succeed. It feels like if you find a good team and group to get in with, you can definitely be happy, But it really depends on where you land. I was laid off and told it was not performance based, but after interviewing for six other roles within the building, and not getting any of them, I'm starting to wonder if I truly have the support of my team as a reference."
good,No trabaje en mexico fue en Starbucks de Chandler Arizona
good,"Was consistently understaffed because we weren't allowed to go over a specific amount of hours despite business needs. District manager is very unprofessional and rude at times. If you work with good people it makes the job more bearable and still stay in touch with my coworkers. I learned to be very flexible, adaptable and handle conflict during my time at this job."
good,"Great co-workers and managers but if you’re late more than 4-5 times by mere minutes, you’ll get fired even if you have a valid reason. Also make sure you’re working at a wealthy store or good luck finding hours. "
good,My manager at this job was barely present in the work space which caused for a lot of unnecessary drama. Also I am a full time student and it was hard for them to schedule me with my class schedule.
good,"Partners are great. Management could use improvement. It's a fun environment to work in a far as meeting people and working side by side. Managers, however, at my current location in Los Angeles could work on managing partners better and overall running the store."
good,This really sucks because I loves this job so much. When I got there and started it was everything I hoped for during the first 6 months roughly. My manager started to act really shady and it got really toxic. People were getting fired with no evidence of wrong doing. Safe to say I didn't feel safe in my job. My manager did like me and it was obvious he played favorites. He just fired the last of my friends so I'm leaving soon because it's only about time that I get on his bad side and get fired too. Maybe it's just my manager but corporate has done nothing about it even though we have filed so many reports about him.
good,I am always smiling and getting to know different aspects of peoples lives or learning something new. There are so many types of people working for the company of Starbucks. So many opportunities to make friends! Vast benefits and flexible schedules make for a good first job or something for fun.
good,This job would be fun for someone first getting into the job scene. Very busy and fast paced. Good way to learn starter skills. Plus they have some pretty neat benefits.
good,"It is a job that can get very hectic and busy. Ever day, you are Dealing with customers every day, making drinks and maintaining the store. If you are strict with your availability, the manager will respect that."
good,It’s hard because it’s been mostly good. Most recently I had my worst experience and honestly I don’t even want to step into a Starbucks. Maybe it’s Phoenix Starbucks but I don’t know.
good,"I am sure this could be different depending on where you go and I truly hope it was, but my experience at Starbucks was that they expect too much for too little. They give their employees a discount on the in house items, and feed them on their shift, however many of those shifts are overburdening the part time workers due to difficulty in staffing."
good,"Working at Starbucks is difficult because not only are you responsible for transactional customer service and making drinks, but you are also responsible for cleaning the store, processing shipments, and getting tasks completed in between customers. When processing 145 customers every 60 minutes, it often feels overwhelming and like the pay doesn't match the work requirements. I learned so much about store operations, but I had to learn it in a stressful environment."
good,Starbucks is an ok company. That have a lot of benefits it’s just the people that needs to change. They are contradicting but once they fix there little problems then everything should be fine with the company as an whole.
good,"If you're the type of person who likes to have things go smoothly and be consistent, then working at Starbucks is not going to be enjoyable. It's a minimum wage job, so yeah, you can't expect TOO much. It was hard for me to be happy at work knowing and feeling that all of my coworkers didn't want to be there and would put in the minimum effort - making it much harder on people like me who need things to be done right. I was constantly putting in the extra work - and there's not much reward for that, except maybe the manager will give you more hours. Maybe it was just where I worked - I worked in DC, so there's probably a different vibe to a store in the city that can't handle it's flow of customers. "
good,The hardest part about working ar starbucks is being in a good mood the entire time you're there. You must have the patience to deal with rude people.
good,"Good Place to work, especially for a first job. I would recommend working here for a high school student. Nice learning experience and good benefits when it comes to getting free coffee."
good,"Compensation being provided by Starbucks is not currently appropriate based on the demands of the job. Do better, Starbucks. Be better. This job could be a perfect place to build a career if they were less concerned with profit and more concerned with the well being of their employees."
good,"I've learnt great customer service skills, how to handle cash and run shifts in a busy and built up environment. I thoroughly enjoy the work environment and love what the company stands for and their attitudes towards employees. Hardest part of the job is staff turnover and handling people quitting and not turning up for shifts."
good,"Typical work day - good"
good,Awesome place to work. I met a lot of great people. Costumers were most of the time sweet & understanding. I worked in the downtown Los Angeles area so it can be hectic but fun.
good,"If you're a quick learner, and good with customers, this is a good job for you."
good,"The resources, benefits, and lasting relationships that can be utilized and formed at Starbucks can be great. When strong team members are present to help, the job can be very enjoyable. However, there are many inconsistencies when it comes to what Starbucks values. It is extremely easy for customers to scam Starbucks for free items, and employees HAVE to act as if they don't realize it is happening. It is vastly easier to be hired into management, rather than work up to it. Yet Store Managers are scarce. There is a recent focus on mental health awareness... for the Store Managers, but not much help at all when it comes to the wellness or care for the Baristas or Shift Supervisors. All Hourly workers are underpaid for what they have to go through, and many who especially hard will never get the bonus they deserve."
good,Great place to work while in school. It’s not somewhere I would want to work forever. The managers were great but the long hours and low pay wasn’t enough for me.
good,"It was fun to work at starbucks although it was very stressful, mostly because it was an all girls team AND the manager wasnt too great at staffing. And the customers were awful."
good,"Although my coworkers are delightful to work with, this company has poor management & refuses to recognize their problems. Workers call out every shift & don't get fired or replaced, causing other employees (me) to pick up their slack. its not fair to the baristas, how much we deal with & how much we make."
good,"They follow the old and very out of date 'The Customer is Always Right' adage. Unfortunately this leads to many customers bullying, harassing, and purposefully lying to get anything they want. So much so that most training encouraged NOT reporting disturbances that would otherwise be unacceptable in most lines of work. Apart from that, many great people work at Starbucks but the culture and lack of initiative by corporate made work unbearable."
good,"A typical day you make drinks, clean, take orders, organize, provide customer service, go through the inventory and complete tasks. The management and employee turnover was awful. I worked there for four years and had 5 managers and countless co-workers."
good,"Great customers and working environment, poor management at my location. Rare pay raises as well but decent benefits, free drinks during shifts and weekly markouts included both full time and part time."
good,"I worked at Starbucks for 3 years, got no progress no praise. I wanted to move up but was shot down. I got paid very little for all the stress and clustered work that was put trough me. I learned every postion and never got anywhere. I loved my coworkers and my customers but I didn't see my life going anywhere."
good,Customer would come and speak and enjoy their drinks . It was a chill relaxed job I enjoyed it other then some rude customers . That will kinda ruin the day but it will eventually get better .
good,"In Ireland it was great, However, in London I wouldn't recommend it."
good,"If your thinking of working for Starbucks it is good for a part time job if your going to school and and don't need to work for a lot of hours, it is a fast paced environment you will meet new people and will know your customers."
good,Good company for work jut could be paid more staff and bit more holiday and also some extra benefit is good that we have off on weekend near my house good staff work there
good,"This job isn’t for everyone. It’s not terrible but definitely takes a toll on you. It’s mentally and physically draining and stressful at times. The pay was okay. You would get two 10 minute breaks and 30 minute lunch break, but sometimes it would get so busy that the managers forget to run breaks. If you’re someone who likes to work in a rush / under pressure then this is the job for you. Just wasn’t for me."
good,I loved working at Starbucks in Kroger. Starbucks has a set way of training new employees that is easy to follow and implement. Starbucks is passionate about providing a great experience for all customers and serving excellent products every time.
good,"With the lack of management at the store, training was slow and difficult. Most members of staff were petty and did not like being given instructions by the supervisors on shift."
good,"Upper management is clueless, pay for salaried folks is low for the amount of work expected but benefits are amazing.  Starbucks is great to work at as an hourly employee."
good,"Great job, must have patience. Management could be better. Pay is good, the benefits are good. The culture can be super super toxic, even though you're just making coffee"
good,"This job is pretty fire if you need benefits at 20 hours a week, but some like the free college are limited to how much schooling you already have. Pay is weak compared to other jobs. Over all loved the staff. Always keeps it interesting."
good,"Low working hours not enough hours and management isn’t the best! "
good,I worked for this company for a number of years and enjoyed the fast paced team based kind of work. Great management and team members. My only disappointment is the steady decline of product quality over the years that I worked there.
good,It was okay the pay wasn't good.but they have great benefits. Management could've have been better .most enjoyable  part of the job was learning drinks
good,"Store managers do the best they can but at the end of the day it’s their bosses that make things difficult. District managers & corporate have a different idea of what it’s like working in store. We are expected to be extremely kind and courteous and understanding while customers verbally abuse us & complain for free food and drinks. We are always understaffed either because there aren’t enough hours or because people decide to stop showing up to work for their mental health. The job requires a lot of cleaning and ladies, no nail poliish! It is easy to get promoted to shift supervisor but it’ll be years before you can advance any further than that. Tuition reimbursement and benefits for part timers is the best part of the job."
good,"Good job for people in school or looking for something easy to pass the time with, especially part time. Pay wasnt great but nothing to complain about either. Management was friendly on occasion but frankly had no idea what was going on in the store, and cultivated a pretty cliqueish store environment. Shift leads will sometimes throw you under the bus, but there are few hidden gems among the staff that really make the experience worth it."
good,"The place was always busy and needed to be working at a fast pace. I didn't mind working at a fast pace though. The manager was completely unorganized and sometimes had us working one day a week. The most enjoyable part of the job was making friends and being able to meet customers from all over due to the fact we were working at a rest stop. I learned a lot from the job, skills that I would carry on with me for the rest of my life."
good,It was good! The one in JFK is okay fast paced.. but I worked in outside Starbucks and they were good. Get tips and the customers are very friendly and cool
good,"as much as i love being a barista, the specific starbucks i worked at (was in an airport) and the management did not care at all about the people. it was extremely annoying and rude. my coworkers for the most part were great & were a huge part on why i stayed for longer than i wanted to. the actual job itself was great"
good,"Honestly, each store has a different dynamic. The company itself is corporate beyond belief to where if you miss 3 days of work you HAVE TO submit a form to a 3rd party so you don't risk losing your job. As mentioned though each store is different and so is each team there are some teams I've worked with where I felt we embodied the ideas Starbucks wants from us then I worked for some teams where we worked exactly like the books which then caused extra stress because we're understaffed due to demands."
good,"Personally I think I would have enjoyed working at starbucks if it weren’t for the manager and the constant flux of new employees. Most of the employees did not stay long and on my first day of work I was told by two employees to leave while I still could, but I chose to stay and give it a chance. The company wasn’t very accommodating to scheduling around school or other job times."
good,I was not given as much opportunity to work in all areas of the job. I was given the task daunting assignment more often than other areas. I was also told I was too slow.  I felt like I was not treated fairly. If you aren't under 30 and cute don't bother working there.
good,I personally didn’t really enjoy working for Starbucks. But it is a good job to have if you have time and have little to no bills to pay and just need some money
good,"When i first started working there we had a great staff, the manager wilma was amazing my co workers helped me in everything i needed help in. few months later the owners did the mistake of bringing a manager in that knew nothing at all and disrespect her employees"
good,"When I first started working for the bux i was so happy but as time goes on you realize the mismanagement and poor behavior of leaders that leads you to have a terrible time at work. Unfortunately my manager was one that could get work done but also was getting complaints while doing it. Some stores are a hit and miss, so really try to feel out the manager before getting to excited."
good,"The job/life balance at the Collingwood location is terrible. We are far too understaffed and cannot keep staff enough to be open as long as we are."
good,"I tried for 3 years of my 6 there to become a manager because I was more than qualified and they preferred hiring managers from the outside than working around my schedule to accommodate child care. I was willing to work the nights and weekends that were required but they told me it couldn't be a set schedule with the ability to plan my life in advance and I ultimately wound up running the store anyway because the people the would hire would not be able to walk and to do everything. It takes at least 6 months to learn the menu and understand how to do everything well , you can't expect an outside hire to learn all of that and keep the store working properly."
good,"kinda in-between a fast food joint and a nice place, all management cares about are numbers, drive thru is miserable. eccentric coworkers are fun and 401k was nice to have. all in all would have been much happier at a non drive thru store."
good,"I was told the job would be a set amount of hours each week, then once I got the job it was suddenly a zero hours contract with a whole day's worth of hours more than promised, which as a university student I really didn't want. I was hired as a barista as well as another temp, yet they were quickly trained and all I did was clean, so it was clear I was not the one being kept on after the temporary role. The management and other staff members were lovely people though so the culture was fantastic. I did also get discount and a free drink every shift but it didn't outweigh the hours I was doing and the pay, which was also less than expected."
good,Working at Starbucks has been a great experience! I’ve came across some great people and I made really cool friends. Management could’ve been a lot better but overall I’ll recommend this Job to a friend.
good,"Early morning shifts.  Difficult environment to accurately set customer expectations.  Learned a lot about how to prioritize tasks and manage work environment for maximum efficiency. "
good,Management is inconsistent. Too many ethical issues among managers. Policies change too often and not communicated to fellow staff or employees. Other than that it’s a fun job to have while going to school but is not a career.
good,It’s a wonderful job if you enjoy making coffee the customer connections and Starbucks culture can be worth it at times but the labor is slave work. The stress to maintain a happy positive attitude and the make the moment right gig is a bit much when working in such a high volume store. My experience with the company was fun SOLELY because I had an amazing manager and team to work with. T
good,"Just another corporate company, but not as heartless. If you need schedule flexibility or looking for decent benefits, this is your kind of job. If you want to become a manager, prepare for no work/life balance."
good,It is a good job. A lot harder than people think but they have great benefits.  There is room to grow and you get to meet some really interesting patrons.
good,I found myself stuck as a barista for the 2 years I worked with the company. it was very difficult to move up because I felt that my work ethic was overlooked. I found myself just coming and going to and from work without being recognized for the work I was doing.
good,"Poor work life abalance due to high turn over as barrista jobs werent paid enough to warrent them staying long term, as management you end up having to pick up the slack and work over your contracted hours."
good,"I enjoyed working here, the hours were convenient and the jobs were easy. I also was trained as a Barista and recieved a certificate. I learned a lot about the types of coffee. I was paid minimum wage however which doesn't reflect the success of the business and the amount of work you put in. Also you get paid £7.50 for your trial shift which is misleading."
good,"This job is one I'd say I learned the most at but, ended up leaving due to hostility. The job itself is fun and very fast paced. If you can not handle stressful situations well, I suggest that this job is not for you."
good,"I mean ive had a particularly bad experience with my job here, the a managers choose favorites. If we’re cut down on hours, it’s not really split up equally. They don’t care consistent pay and they don’t care about scheduling, they believe they need you and don’t care and make it your problem"
good,I just wished they took our personal lives as serious as they did our work lives. It’s hard when out of no where you get sick but you’re still responsible for getting your shift covered.
good,"At Starbucks you get to work with some amazing people and the benefits are great. Overall, I believe that too much is asked of the baristas for the compensation."
good,Starbucks is definitely not a job for those who value work/life balance. They expect you to always be ready to come in to work if someone calls out and some managers kind of treat their employees like theyre just sitting on a shelf at home waiting to work. Training is almost non existant these days in the company and unfortunately this makes for an unnecessarily stressful workday 75% of the time.
good,A beautiful and fun place to work that will chew you up and spit you out if you dedicate yourself to promotion. Mixed feelings but on to the next chapter.
good,"Starbucks started out as one of my favorite jobs, however with corporate cutting labor hours but still expecting us to improve production and customer satisfaction while having less people on the floor, it turned into kind of a stressful nightmare."
good,"I've been here for almost two years, but I'm looking for something that allows me to get bonuses and something that has more adults on the team. I'm a shift manager, so it has been nice being able to learn how to lead a big team, but I work at a high volume store so it is extremely busy all the time and can be very hard work with little incentive to stay."
good,"Starbucks didn't have drive thru and drive time nonsense.  It sold coffee, tea and spices, not foo-foo frappucinos.  Corporate management has tried various programs for employee togetherness, customer service and general morale, but they've fallen short.  Our store manager spends more time in meetings than managing the store."
good,"I love working here, however, the flexibility of scheduling is only to an extent that is mostly given to partners who have been there the longest. I get random hours, 16 one week 25 the next. Management is just not good and unorganized. The partners and customers are great though, its the only thing that makes me want to stay. The wage is just pathetic. With the cost of living it is just not enough especially with the unorganized scheduling."
good,"It's Starbucks, which can be very fun to work at. However, with constant hours reduction, and the want to have a full conversation with every customer (which there are a lot), it became very stressful for little pay."
good,I wasn't happy with my general manager at my location. I was constantly understaffed on the busiest days while expected to meet goals more or less out of reach.
good,when i came they were having management issues abs everything was disorganized. The call out process was also a bit much. often times people won’t answer their phones.
good,On going change all the time. Can be challenging managing all different priorities. A lot of employee turn over. Very high demanding customer service job.
good,"I worked at a location in Florida and developed such a passion for it.The team felt like family and the company took care of their partners. I later moved to a brand new Iowa and was completely appalled at how horrible management was once we got going.With all of my experience I brought to the team I felt neglected, and martyred by my boss and our district manager. There was so much favoritism, and I felt so undervalued for as much time as I invested in the team. What I thought would be a life long career ended as I walked about to our DM but was immediately shut down and attacked for even mentioning it."
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work if you need flexible work hours, however some of the restrictions that have been enforced by corporate make a truly happy workplace hard to achieve."
good,Leadership constantly changing causing partners to be lost in their personal development. I've seen multiple opportunities extended to partners to advance their careers only to have the leader that made the promises move on from the company before delivering on the promise.
good,A typical day usually consist of us baristas preparing drinks as well as keep the store clean at the same time i guess my boss wasn't aware of that. I had training hours posted when i never trained. My schedule had me off monday thursday but the days i work would be closing then morning then closing just all over the place. Sometimes made things confusing but i was able to push through. All in all tho i will never go back to starbucks.
good,Enjoyed most of my time at Starbucks until the professionalism went down too many yound staff who dont really have the work ethic in them
good,management needs a little work. working there and the supervisors know you do a good job you might have to do everyone else job too. very fast pace...
good,"The whole experience overall is overrated. And the fact that I am forced on this website to do an in depth review is completely idiotic. A lot of the people I worked with were kinda fake, especially in management. They were only concerned with putting in a good image and then would gossip in the back room. They would also take up the break room, which is the only place where employees could have privacy, and use it for gossip and 'private conversations' and kick people who were on break out."
good,"Fast paced work environment. Business never stopped, which was tiring. Fun team environment. The management was hit and miss. Some managers preferred the workplace a different way than other managers."
good,Fast past environment with addictive regular customers. Very demanding physical and emotional labor that should be compensated through pay. Interesting coworkers who share the same mentality as an employees.
good,Difficult place to work and not enough pay for how much effort you put into it. Very messy. Good luck with smelling like coffee everyday. Though they are very relaxed but they do pressure you to learn drinks quickly.
good,"I learned a great deal about customer service. Definitely recommend for entry level job experience. Depending on the location, there are bullies within the co-workers, but I lucked out in a good working location. Badly managed in general. I had a lazy but kind manager"
good,"I worked at a very high volume store with drive-thru. It was very stressful at times, but when we had good partners it usually went pretty smoothly. I went through 3 general managers in my three years and the turn over rate was pretty high. Hardest part of the job was continually having to train new people and therefore always having to pick up the slack for others. Most enjoyable part of the job was making life long relationships with some of my coworkers and our awesome regular customers."
good,"Starbucks is a great stepping stone to hone interpersonal skills for later employment, but poor management had been rampant throughout the district of Richmond for years, creating a large disconnect between the working staff and said management. Corporate continues to short stores on available hours and so stress levels are often high."
good,"I have worked for Starbucks a few times.  It is great for a college student, mom's looking for benefits, or a teenager.  If you are looking to Starbucks to sustain a good financial income, it is not the job for you.  For me it was a seasonal job, so I was grateful for what it was.  However, the amount of work you put in verse the compensation you receive can be very frustrating.  That and the turn over were the most frustrating parts of the job."
good,"People asked me if I liked working at Starbucks, and I always made it clear that it takes a certain kind of person to really do well in the store. The environment is either fast paced and hectic without a moment to breathe, or incredibly slow. I worked at two separate locations, so I got a taste of both."
good,"This job can be very fun and very stressful at times. The best part of the job is the other employees and making customer connections. However, poor management and poor pay is not worth the amount of effort required to complete tasks efficiently."
good,"Everyone has different experiences, the worst part of this job for me was definitely the customers. Just the absolute worst kinds of people like to come into Starbucks and give everyone a hard time. The pay was minimum wage, benefits were amazing. I never really got to learn how to make any drinks, I was always forced to work as the one that just restocks everything and then cashier. Overall, it really just depends on your team and the area you’re working in. The customers were just the one thing I couldn’t handle anymore."
good,I worked for sbux for over 2 years and it wasnt worth it. I switched stores multiple times and it was great having a secure job when I moved but the people are hit or miss. My co-workers were mostly all amazing. Sbux does not pay a living wage unforunately..
good,"Its typically crazy busy but its not the partners who are bad to work with but its the management.  Not all starbucks are bad to work at, just a lot of them have bad management."
good,"Fast-paced environment where they focus heavily on meeting drive-through time quota. Overall company is good to work for but management at my store was awful. Several people left due to one person who was in an authority position and even after it was reported to the store manager nothing happened. Hardest part of the job is timing, best part is meeting new people."
good,While working at Starbucks you are constantly moving and doing things. It can be stressful but it was a fun environment. I especially enjoyed the people that I worked with and the family like experience.
good,"Shifts varied, coming in at 4:00am to open, or closing the store and leaving around 10:00pm, with all shifts in between and no real consistency.  Learned a good deal about coffee and time management.  One of the harder aspects was  dealing with some of the picky customers."
good,we get paid only two cents over minimum wage so that they can brag and say that they pay over. Some of my coworkers have been there for several years and have still not gotten paid. Management works a fraction as hard and gets twice the pay.
good,Don't have the best manager. He's never there and schedules horribly. Puts a lot of stress on the shifts supervisors! Also feel like his ineffectiveness sabotages not only us but him.
good,"A typical day at work is taking orders, making orders and keeping the store clean. The hardest part is working on your own and trying to keep the guest happy when they don't get there way."
good,"The fantastic benefits justify the low pay. "
good,"It’s a great job short term, however any longer than 1 year and you notice all the issues settle and go unresolved. If you bring something private up with the manager, everyone knows. If you request to just do your contract they will listen for about 2 weeks and then it goes back to normal and you end up doing 10 hours over. "
good,They really give a lot of benefits and other things most part time jobs do not provide. I do wish there was more support and understanding from upper management who may not be at the stores day to day and might not know what works for those of us who are on the floor daily.
good,Made promises to advance but with so much higher management turnover . Store Managers get lost in the shuffle. Poor work/life balance. Too many promises made to me without follow through.
good,the usual working day consists of working on the bar making drinks for people and working on the tills. Would have to close up which consisted of cleaning everything down ready for tomorrow.
good,"Opening shifts require a good amount of work to be completed within thirty minutes before customers arrive. Management insists on speed and excellence for customers, but allows workers to arrive late or not show up without penalty, causing other Baristas to pick up the slack. Staff morale in store is low and workers have a quick turn around time. "
good,"Management is shifted around with no regard even if the individual is not a fit for the established team dynamic that has been on-site for 4+ years. The everyday rhythm should be seamless due to following the pre-establish company guidelines, however,  that is not always the case. Often, new management steps in and alters what he/she believes works best for the operational follow of the business. Which intern goes doesn't work for the store because they haven't observed the workflow long enough, nor does it meet the company's standards. More often than not  mana"
good,"The expectations are high, so be prepared if you decide to take on a job like this. Customers are very demanding and do not care if you are short staffed. The ability to memorize many recipes, regular customer’s names, faces, and beverages is a must. The ability to multitask at a very rapid pace is also a necessary skill."
good,Working for Starbucks is a great thing if you’re willing to do all kinds of people in a fast-paced environmentBut waiting there with rude people that have been to also be your manager is not a very good environment it can be very stressful and I would not recommend working there unless you already have a pretty good relationship with working with strangers or people that can be very controlling and in unnecessary way other than that my experience at Starbucks was a wonderful experience I enjoyed all my customers I enjoyed my tips I enjoyed the page and that would probably work there just at a different location
good,Working at starbucks was the first job I had in college. I was a barista and could make every drink on the menu with no problem. We had to do temp logs and wash dishes when needed.
good,"Good starter job, nothing I would recommend committing to for an extended period of time without plans for upward movements w/i company.  The day to day operations somewhat depend on your team. If you get along and are generally collaborative, things will be better, but you are somewhat at the mercy of those with whom you work to dictate the general culture."
good,"great entry level job. barista jobs are fast paced and high energy. the company has unrealistic expectations of 100% peppy, energetic perfect service that they are aiming for, but it is nice to think that a cup of coffee can change the lives of customers."
good,"My review on Starbucks lacked the amount of respect, accountability of some managers due to how my situation went down. I made it clear I only applied to one position and I was given that due to being hired to find 2 weeks later I was not hired for that but for less pay and a barista which I said I wouldn't of left my previous job to than drive further for less pay for a barista position. I only applied for the shift position and again should've been acknowledged that but of course there ""supposedly was a mix up?"" No mix up, I only applied for the shift position which was addressed upon and after hire. Overall, I liked the people just didn't have much respect due to that situation."
good,The job is very hit or miss depending on the store and your coworkers and management. It's a decent enough job but the stress from under-scheduling is not worth the pay.
good,"Decent job, pay could be a little better."
good,"-set up everything"
good,"Starbucks is a great job if you are a young adult, its a very face paced work environment and very stressful. It all depends on your manager and the team you work with."
good,"Most days are stressful and feel understaffed. Customers will dehumanize you, so you have to deal with that. If you have a tough skin then this job can be very rewarding though. Management is spotty. Ive had GREAT managers at Starbucks and I have had ones that probably shouldn't be managers at all, just depends on luck I suppose. Starbucks offers great benefits though including all the coffee you can desire :)"
good,"SB is always stressful. Customers are rushing, managers never have enough hours to give their employees, and Corporate is always breathing down the necks of those it can reach."
good,"If you find working for a corporation inspiring then you might be inspired. There are a lot of expectations put on employees and not enough compensation for the work put in. Their guiding principles are good, but they are not always followed through with by management."
good,I only took this job because i was in school. I really don't remember much of it but i knew it was flexible with my schooling before i joined the military.
good,"Customers are cool but some locations management enforce different rules. Environment of working depends on your partners. Communication is also key, just like in any work place."
good,"The crew is fun, but the company clearly doesn't care about its entry level workers and only promotes outside hires over experienced baristas and shift supervisors. Too fast paced and stressful for not nearly enough money."
good,Very hectic and chaotic. The hardest part of the job is training new people that aren't use to working in fast paced environments. The customers are always great.
good,"I worked part time at a chain at my university that was run by Compass group. You're required to learn and regularly cover 5 different positions at work; hot bar, cold bar, cashier, oven, and storeroom. Good relationship with co-workers. Rush hour is very stressful, outside of rush hour it can be pretty chill. This is a job that keeps your mind active, but once you get settled into things the job stagnates."
good,it is a job and good job you work and so you get paid and you hope and pray that it will be enough to survive this capitalist wasteland. you make coffee and drink coffee.
good,"When I first started I thought ""wow, what an amazing company, they truly care for their employees"", but that slowly changed as I moved up in the company. Its good for a while and its amazing if you have a great manager."
good,"Coffee drinkers to the front of the line, always trying and drinking new coffee beverages. customers are crazy and will look to argue with you because corporate will give them gift cards if they complain. management changes a lot. hardly any room to advance. 5 people going for 1 position."
good,in order to have a solid team you must be able to lead. leading consists of showing the way and leading my example not just instructing other and i feel that my last manager was more of a micromanage than a  encompassed lead.
good,"You get worked to the bone. The company doesn’t pay a competitive amount and moving up is quite difficult. It seems over the years at Starbucks it has become more and more about making money; and less about treating the employees fairly. It’s constantly busy and they give you less and less labor to rectify the situations at hand. The benefits are amazing however. Free college tuition, 401k, insurance benefits and sick and vacation time; even for part time employees. The hours can be flexible as well."
good,"Starbucks requires an ability to multi-task under fast paced, stressful environments, which is not for everyone. I learned how to make drinks and food through safe and sanitary procedures, and I also learned my love for customer service. Management was challenging to work with and is one of the main turn offs for people looking to start a career at this industry, but the pay is satisfactory with pooled tips, and raises are available. Overall, this job is not for everyone, but it's a great learning experience for first time workers, and the pay and benefits are good."
good,"Starbucks is very hard to make a career out of. I had my hours cut drastically without warning and lost my benefits. It was fun, but I would not work there again."
good,"Going into starbucks I knew it would be a fast paced/ high stress environment.  And that was fine because the people I worked with were great.  However my manager sucked, and he made people not want to show up, myself included.  From what I had heard, he had a habit of choosing people to single out and then getting on their case until he fired them or they quit.  He was also terrible at scheduling.  He was recently fired, but in the 2 weeks we have gone without a manager, the store has been a dumpster fire.  On top of all that you have your usual complaints from someone who works in retail.  Starbucks boasts customer service but keeps doing things to impede how fast we can help people AND be as kind as possible.  Two of those things are mobile ordering, and the fact that we have a drive through.  A drive through is a fast food tactic and we are not fast food, especially when a mom in a van with 8 seats orders 6 frappuccinos and we only have 2 blenders (this happens way too often, even for people who have a tiny car)."
good,"I love Starbucks, its mission, and everything it stands for. However, my current manager does not care about the partners at all. The manager, after almost a year and a half there, has never once done a partner development plan with any partner. I'm leaving thanks to the manager, not the company."
good,The job was made more stressful by unnecessary corporate demands and a need to run staffing at bare minimum. Your only means for advancement are akin to pyrma scheme techniques or what they would refer to as “moving up the pipeline”.
good,Management could be a little better but overall I enjoyed working there. I wish they had better Benefits. I had a good team that I worked well with. Over all there are things that could be better just like every job.
good,stressful. not paid enough. co workers are great. love the atmosphere. customers can be rough. lots of cleaning. tips weren't always great. paid time off isn't great
good,"Starbucks is a fast paced environment that requires focus and the ability to learn fast and on your feet. The beauty of the job is that once you cultivate the skills it demands, you can handle a great deal of stress and multi-task efficiently. You learn exceptional customer service skills. It can be trying at times dealing with customers who have trouble finding satisfaction even with tremendous effort. However, that is the reality of customer service, you can't please everyone all the time. "
good,"Starbucks is a job that will push you and teach you a lot about working with (and for) others but if you find yourself working in a ""kiosk"" location (a ""booth"" in a mall, at a grocery store, or on a college campus) then find out if tips are accepted at the location you're looking at. From what I was able to gather, working for a proper corporate location was fine -- tuition assistance is available, tips were accepted, etc. The on-campus location I worked at provided low wages, no tips, and no benefits as its guidelines were determined primarily by the school's food service provider."
good,"If you want to test your skills in customer service, this is a great place to see if youre as good as you think you are.  Its fast paced and you'll know you're doing well when you're being asked to do things that you aren't 100% on - which is paradoxical I know."
good,"They pay is minimum wage, and you are expected to do a lot. If you work 6 hours+ in a day you get one 30 minute break and one 10 minute break. If you work under 6 hours you only get a 10 minute break. Really busy, you can't even drink water during your shift, only during break. Air conditioning has not worked as long as I've been there. HOWEVER, the customers are great, some of my co-workers are lovely. But ultimately, it just doesn't pay enough for what they ask of you."
good,"While I am so grateful for the amazing benefits, the rest of the job's challenges almost do not make it worth it. While this is a fast-paced job, and that is very clearly stated in all job descriptions, we are never staffed enough and there are often unforeseen complications (equipment breaking, power outages, customer incidents, etc) that can make it impossible to reach expectations (running a fast drive thru experience, consistently demonstrating Starbucks level customer service in every interaction with a customer). Management is not very understanding of these things. The mission and values Starbucks has had since the birth of this company are no longer executed, while they like to say they are. There is no focus on equipping partners with the necessary skills and resources for success, even enough to reach bare minimum expectations."
good,"Management doesn't give a Feck about you or your needs. You're lucky if you get someone hands on who knows the work and is willing to help when it's crazy. "
good,"I feel like the company lost focus. Their ethics is what real pulled me in when I first applied, as time when on I felt like I mattered less and less, even with the term ""Partners"""
good,"I loved working for Starbucks, but I was unsatisfied with the management and harassment at work. I felt some things that were said and done were unprofessional, and my personal life and concerns were brought into work in attack against me and I was questioned unprofessionally."
good,Every day has new challenges. Fast paced with many tasks needing completing in a timely manner.  Great team of people to work with. Good work life balance
good,It’s a great place to work people who are in school and can work part time. However it doesn’t value its employees very well. They tend to hit outside for promotion rather than within.
good,"I worked at Starbucks for almost 4 years. I loved it for the first couple years and generally most of my time there I enjoyed, but eventually it got old and I got tired of the rude customers. I was being over worked and underpaid and honestly, the health insurance benefits weren't enough after a while. I had one good manager out of the 3 I experienced while working there, at two different locations. all in all its not a position I would recommend, until they decide to pay their employees a bit more."
good,"It is easily to pick out the bad things of the workplace, but the Starbucks I worked at genuinely tried to reduce this list. "
good,"the managers do  not care. about us working for them the managers feel entitiled and do not respect the 9 to 5 workers they are way over worked and dont get o"
good,"The team and manager really determines the tone of the store. Some are great, fun, lively. Others are cliquey, demeaning, and grating. Also, they dangle promotions in front of you like a carrot, sometimes for years, so they get the hardest work out of you s they can and then they might not even promote you. Happened to many of my coworkers. I found a new job and happened to quit the day I was officially promoted."
good,"Pros: fun atmosphere "
good,"Fast pace, Good menu, and standards. Poor management and employees. Flexible hours. The dress code was simple, and the requirements were easy. Location was good."
good,Good place to work stable environment.  A lot of upper management changes. Opportunity for advancement and great pay.  Moral within the team is great.
good,"Las personas te exigian cosas que no te decían que teníamos que hacer, trataban mal."
good,"Store Manager was not nice, shift managers were not either, only manager that was easy to work with was assistant manager. Pay was terrible for amount of work that had to be done. Hours were given out generously. Work attire very relaxed, only things required was apron and hat. Connection with Phoenix University was nice."
good,It definitely isnt a place id like to work for again. Customers are really rude and don't care about you as an employee. The also have a really Low pay as well.
good,"A typical work day was pretty smooth and fast paced, i loved the mornig rush. I learned a lot about different types of coffee around the world. I learned a lot about the quality and history of Starbucks and its importance. I enjoyed the job and the people, both customers and employees. The most difficult part of the job for me would be opening shifts. It was difficult waking up at 4am to arrive at work by 5:30. other than that it was great."
good,"A typical day here was very fast but also could be slow there were lots of doctors from the area who've come to make purchases here.I learned a lot of things at Starbucks such as how to brew coffee,and also make it.Also I learned how to work the oven and the cash register.I think the hardest part of the job was dealing with hours that were cut very short and the very unhappy customers that made threats.I also think the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to sell and satisfy a happy customer, a customer who walks away with a smile means everything."
good,Management in my district went down hill that last  six months to a year that I was there. The current manager in that location was hired outside of the company from a banking background.
good,"So I worked at a Starbucks inside of Target. The Starbucks was amazing, loved seeing my regular customers, it's just Target is horrible at scheduling people no matter what department you worked in the store. The HR and other top leads just like to redesign there offices which in fact is time fraud, but that might just be my Target in my hometown. I'm sure there are other Targets that are more professional and care about there employees."
good,"When I started at the company as a part-time job, I felt welcomed into my store and felt confident that I was trained well. We were always fully staffed and the hours were flexible. Over the years that has since changed. Tenured managers and partners are driven out of the company and replaced with outside hires who are unsteady in their role and unable to provide proper support because they also do not receive proper support. There are not enough hours anymore for partners to get a full 40 hour week, but stores are notoriously understaffed despite having a higher customer count than ever. The benefits and discounts are nice, but the lack of support from corporate coupled with the low pay (you absolutely cannot survive on just this job full-time) cause stress and low morale."
good,"understaffed  and the shift leads are horrible.good work environment,terrible management.im a human,I need my breaks.I don’t care about how many drinks are served in the day.I want my break.expect losing your hearing and wrist pain as a barista."
good,"I've worked for many years in many locations with Starbucks. While the connections you make with customers and partners are amazing, you are subject to being absolutely berated by customers over coffee. The benefits are great and you early PTO/sick days, but the pay is not a livable wage."
good,"If you work at Starbucks you learn teamwork and swiftness. It is a cool environment to work there. However, you don't make enough money. It can be sad to get burned or come home smelling like coffee, but in the end it is semi-worth it. I worked there with the love of my dreams. At first, everything went smoothly. We spent a lot of time together and we made new drink recipes. Then, everything spiraled. Now, I work at a bank and a hospital trying to make ends meet. And by that, I mean a house on the beach. I would kill to have a true love again."
good,"As far as advancement goes, it’s either shift supervisor or nothing. They don’t give raises based on performance, it’s nonstop work all the time, you’re seen as replaceable if you can’t keep a smile on your face 24/7. People are allowed to talk to you any kind of way and you can’t stand up for yourself. The company doesn’t keep their employees in mind and everything is a front for the PR side. We haven’t talked about the bathroom incident since it happened. The culture at Starbucks in just corporate. It’s a red flag when store managers step down after 10+ years to barista or leave the company all together. It’s not a sustainable business model and the turn over rate is high."
good,Excellent customer service with a great attitude serving and preparing beverages. I learned how to become a great team player under stressful occasions and how to work along side with others.
good,Starbucks has some great benefits but low pay. The management is often rude but bearable. I have always loved my fellow coworkers and customers. I have made so many friends from working for Starbucks but sadly it has a lot of faults.
good,The position is very intense.  It was very hard to get everything done with the amount of hours given.  Most of the time Store Managers are working positions and are glorified baristas.
good,"I began this job in May of 2018, when I started I was very excited as the culture was very uplifting and all of the 'partners' (co-workers) were enthusiastic. Overall there is minimal chance for pay increase and they often keep their employees on a part-time bases. You do not get paid extra for doing more of the work around the cafe so there is a imbalance between people who work hard and people who do not. The hours can range however the cafe is open early in the morning and late at night which provides flexibility with hours available to be worked."
good,"one thing i always hated about starbucks is that they look down upon you calling out sick or ever having emergencies. i worked at 3 different starbucks and they are ALL like that. if you call our sick, you have to find coverage and if you don't they expect you to work even though you CAN'T come in. they basically don't look down upon you calling out if you're in the hospital. besides this, they people usually tend to be caring about the customers and their experience making sure they feel welcome and don't wait long for their cup of coffee. the place is super fast paced but i loved that because it would make the 8 hours fly by."
good,"Perhaps I lucked out a bit in terms of location. The people the manager hired were generally agreeable, and the few people I didn't like working with didn't survive for very long. On the one hand, you have to deal with corporate BS and everything Starbucks does. It drops new drinks on you, and there are lots of little BS reasons to do this or that that irritate and confound. Such is life. On the other hand, you can get a really good group of people and have a pretty good time with them while you slog through your shift. Hours can be hit or miss, partially because there's getting the hours and there's working them, so a short day is a combination blessing and curse because you have to deal with working there but the folks you work with are pretty good."
good,Okay job just very stressful also fast paced the pay is okay not to bad the managers suck they attitudes is not worrh dealing with at all but overall okay place
good,"I learned that Starbucks, especially locations with high traffic, are stressful and demanding. Compensation is not always worth the work effort. "
good,"great job if you need supplemental income, but will not support an individual alone, even working full time. Does provide health insurance, but that is paid out of employees' pockets. Other benefits such as free coffee and food during working hours are nice, but do not contribute to a useable income."
good,A non stop movement job. When it is busy you take care of customers. When it's not busy you prepare for more customers. To do the job correctly you need to be fast paced and team oriented.
good,Had few that I liked to work with. Management was poor and they weren't very fair with me when they found out I was pregnant. I would not recommend working here.
good,I have been with the company for 9 years and for the last Four I have been trying to get promoted and I have not been able to move up. I feel like the amount of effort in what I put in my job is not what it pays. I want more for myself.
good,"A typical work day would be coming into either a mess or clean bar. Depending on your shift you would start your duties. you are usually alone a lot and there is always something to do. if someone calls out, you usually are stuck there alone till the next shift person comes in. Management is not very helpful when we need more hands on deck. I have worked 12+ hour shifts to make sure that we have the coverage done. A lot of the girls are not trained properly if they are needed to cover the food court area and they don't really care if they need to be. however, I do love working with all my girls. even when it seems everyone is giving us impossible deeds we work together and get as much done as we can."
good,Starbucks is a fun place to work. Fast and friendly. You get to meet a lot of people and see your regular customers and get to know them everyday. I miss our Starbucks.
good,This job is fairly quite easy and fun if you have a consistent time frame and are very professional. You meet amazing artsy people. The management on the other hand is poor
good,"The hours are great, but it's the shift times that aren't flexible. Trying to shift to morning shifts with no luck. A lot of teamwork; pros: working together, busy store, lots to do. Cons: not everyone pulling weight, and short staffed."
good,"fun place to work if you don't work at a busy store with a drive thru and get paid a pittance. Making drinks is fun, but customers are allowed to be cruel to you."
good,Good place to work for a first job however they don’t pay us enough for the stress and mistreatment we go through. The new change in owner will be the downfall to this company they care about how fast you go and how much money you can make than the quality. Sad.
good,"Working at Starbucks is great for students with flexible hours but if you are in a store that keeps on changing managers, it is very unlikely you will be promoted to supervisor if you wish to."
good,Bonne Ambiance dans les équipes mais malheuresement n'encourage pas les nouvelles idée
good,Great insurance plan did not offset how little I enjoyed the actual job unfortunately. The perks are good and the ease to transfer stores means you will a store for you.
good,"Working at a stand-alone store for the Starbucks company was great. But working at a kiosk Starbucks inside of a grocery store or other establishment is frustrating. You don't receive tips, you don't receive any of the same benefits, and the management was always (for lack of training) harder to work with."
good,managers is really awful poor work life home balance its mostly a good place to work up until management changed and it became an un happy place to be
good,"Pro its over all fun and pays decent"
good,during my time there I went in 2 years I went thru three district managers and Regional Presidents . there was a lot of influx in the company at that time.
good,"Fast paced environment at times stressful, but can also a fun place workplace when there are regular customers and sometimes new. Learned a lot more on customer service and connecting with customers. The hardest part is when we are in a rush of customers and a customer decides to take his actions farther by causing a scene making it difficult to focus on our work."
good,"busy during peak hours, you learn to work as a team"
good,"I am presently employed at Starbucks. My position is mainly Customer Support which is to help baristas and other co-workers with items they might need to continue working.  I  restock supplies, make coffee, work the registers, I maintain a clean environment."
good,"overall could be a great career, but a lot of unprofessionalism going on at store level, trainers setting bad examples, need a no- gossip tolerance policy, supervisors unprofessional that have been in their positions for years, company knows this and is slow to correct"
good,I loved my job at Starbucks but I got stuck with a bad manager. Unfortunately when that happens there isn’t much else you can do! It was a good run Starbucks...
good,"I feel like Starbucks is a great place for teens to work, but in my opinion its not a place for someone trying to advance in their career. If you are a teen that just needs a job to pay for gas and extracurricular activities, then Starbucks is a great job. On the other hand, if you are an adult trying to progress and advance in your career, you won't get very far working at Starbucks."
good,"It's alright, once you work your way up on the latter it can get really difficult and high-stress. They are very customer focused and driven, which is great but I think they lack that sort of devotion to their fellow partners."
good,"I loved working at Starbucks because of all the great regular customers and amazing baristas I had the pleasure of working with. However, the management showed extreme favoritism and supervisors treat their baristas with great disrespect when they call in sick. They go so far as to ask the details of how sick you are and then tell all your coworkers that they think you are lying. I have found this to be the case with several different locations from asking other baristas. It was an incredibly stressful place to work, but it's still a great place to grow and learn how to handle difficult customers and unprofessional supervisors."
good,"very fun environment but yet the stress gets intense at starbucks many rules to follow and regulations "
good,"When I was originally hired at Starbucks, I looked forward to every shift. My coworkers were supportive and unique, my manager cared about her team and the way we were being treated, and the customers were conversational and happy to receive their delicious, handcrafted beverage. After a year or so and a lot of upper management changes, it became clear that the interest of the workers and even the customers was no longer the main priority; the only thing that matters to Starbucks now is profit and ""productivity"" (a.k.a. orders per minute). This shift in focus caused negativity to fester within the company and rapid erosion of the warm, welcoming culture that Starbucks was once famous for. The great benefits don't make up for the pathetic wages and poor treatment from management and especially corporate Starbucks."
good,Its a good job if you like coffee. learned skills being a barista. The work atmosphere could be a bit catty due to regular disagreements between staff leaders.
good,Its a job. It wasn't great it was bad. I did not enjoy the randomness of the workschedule and the feeling of being forced to take hours you didn't want. If it is you thing you won't mind it tho.
good,"After almost 5 years the most difficult thing to put up with is bad management. Once you learn the basics it's pretty easy to do apart from being understaffed and overworked. Customers are pretty much the same everywhere, some are nice while some are downright nasty. "
good,"Depending on the management and coworkers, this company can either make or break you. The pay is no where near deserving of what we should have earned. Getting to know customers and having them become regulars was one of the only things that kept me at this job, along with the free coffee while you worked."
good,"Flagship Store located in central London, very busy not always offered the best conditions to its employees. Discount on food and beverages."
good,"Corporate atmosphere can be stuffy and clickish, there exists a glass window between retail partners and corporate positions.  Although upward movement and hiring within is encouraged"
good,"It was alright. Company plays favorites a lot. All about numbers, not about service or individuals. Very fast-paced, often really fun coworkers. Made lasting friendships."
good,I love working here but there is room for improvement with management. Not much room to grow as a partner. Many older associates have been passed up for promotion. Many benefits and tips weekly.
good,"Okay as temp/ part time job for students or recent graduates. but certainly not somewhere I'd like to find myself working long term."
good,"Upon hiring I was told there was nobody scheduled to train me. I ended up going to the cash register on my first shift and being completely overwhelmed. Coworkers were disgusted by my manager's decision to put me on the floor unprepared, and half of them were hostile towards me as a result of it. It took several months to learn everything, I became a valued employee to the point that I was asked to become a supervisor. Upon promoting to supervisor I found the same problem. I repeatedly asked for help with deployment standards and specifications of Starbucks standards, and was always put off by my store manager. I picked up a lot of information from my former coworkers who had gone on to other stores, and from Partners who had transferred into our store. Overall, I believe Starbucks expected me to do work with fewer than required employees, resources, and training. Often I was left to do the work of more than one person, and I often felt alone, overwhelmed, and unprepared. I can't wait to leave my job!"
good,"There was always something to do and you stayed busy all the time, which I actually enjoyed. Although, the manager switch but the store into a funk. The employees still managed to keep a smile on their face, just a barista is intended to do."
good,"It's all about patience, and technique. Need to know how to follow proper rules of marketing coffee drinks,if not it can taste really bad.its fun and hard work to certain points. When the rush hour comes and you get really long lines."
good,"If you're, fresh out of high school, in college, need a second job, are interested in food and beverage services or, like me, taking a small sabbatical from office life, Starbucks is for you.  If you have time to wait for it, Starbucks has a lot of potential career wise, but if you like the fast-track, this isn't for you.  It's hard work, and doesn't pay a living wage, in San Diego, CA stores, anyway.  If you happen to work in a good store with positive vibes and healthy management in a socio-economically stable community, then yes TIPS ARE AMAZING and depended on weekly to get you to your next paycheck. I know this sounds negative, but Starbucks really is a great place to work whether this is your career or a means to an end. I would however caution against working here if you are a true coffee connoisseur, Starbucks very retail, often driving high priced food items over coffee beverages."
good,"When I first started, it was great. But with promises of promotion that never came through and my hours being cut to unlivable degrees, I couldn't do it anymore. As a full-time employee, I was only receiving 17 hours my last week of work having dropped the previous weeks from 38-39 hours. The job itself was enjoyable and not overly difficult If I could be guaranteed hours, I would go back in a heartbeat."
good,"Starbucks is 1 of many coffee shops that are fast paced, contain great benefits, but the one thing that working for Starbucks has taught me was that the pay isnt so great."
good,"Typical day means working with great people who are in the same years of their lives, nice customers, and a flexible schedule. However, the management needs a lot of work. They are not consistent, favoritism is common, and a lot of shady things happen regarding HR."
good,"This company isn't all its made up to be. The management is poor, scheduling is terrible if you go to school and want a life as well. The managers don't take your complaints seriously."
good,"The managers were either wonderful, or awful with no inbetween. The free coffee was a nice benefit, however it was practically required to drink enough caffeine to see Valhalla in order to be able to perform the expectations of you. There were some pleasant coworkers, and some very unpleasant and hostile ones. I wound up going into the hospital and was released to discover I had no job 2 days before a hurricane."
good,It was stressful for the pay but it allowed me to acquire skills I can take with me to future careers. I do not regret working at Starbucks. I worked there for 2 1/2 years
good,"Great culture, always pushed you to be your best and put the Customer first. Lovely people. Consistent training always given and the opportunity for development for those that want it always available."
good,"Overall good job, good discount, okay pay. However only had 2 staff at a time over Christmas period, meaning we were very very overrun. Management hadn’t a clue of some things. This is understandable as we were a new store."
good,"In a fast paced environment like Starbucks, great leadership is truly important. Not all locations are equal. I unfortunately experienced terrible leadership from as high up as the District Manager, but I also see the value in the job as well as my co-workers and customers. Under proper circumstances, Starbucks can be a great place to work."
good,"-Typical working day is a roller coaster of extreme rushes and dead lulls."
good,"All my shifts were only 4 hours long, but with doing the same action over and over for those 4 hours made it very stressful and tiring. There were lots of procedures for making the drinks, and each supervisor had a different way of doing it, so it would get very confusing. I loved the people I worked with, and all the customers were college students so they were all very nice and understanding. The job was very flexible, especially around mid-terms and finals."
good,Starbucks has excellent benefits and pay for a part-time position.  Management tends to be inexperienced and accommodating for religious services was not done for me.
good,"I mean... it is Starbucks. Like any other fastfood chain (although Starbucks is incorporated system, unlike franchise system) it is tired when it’s busy and cleaning time when it’s slow."
good,"On a usual day working at Starbucks, the business flow is constant. making sure everything is stocked while making beverages and food. I have learned how important it is to treat others with dignity while working and serving customers. My current management currently projects their stress on their employees, which can make work stressful. Although the best part of the job is the connection we make with customers. Which is stressed everyday upon the baristas to make sure every customer feels welcomed."
good,"This job was an experience I do not regret. I was taught the fast paced customer service skills required for other jobs I have had post Starbucks. I was placed in a structure with many rules and strict procedures to every job task in the entire occupation. There was room for growth but I was uninterested in this because I was already having issues making sure I got paid for extra services as a trainer. The staff is incredible, due to the team dynamic of this company. The rules and procedures were too micro managing and did not fit every scenario. I was in a location that had a lot of pressure on sales and was consistently busy throughout most of my work shift."
good,"This Starbucks job was at CSULB. They work you around your class schedule, so the job is perfect for students who need flexible work hours. This particular Starbucks is busy often due to the fact that it is located on a University Campus in the University Library."
good,"If you love people and serving them coffee, you'll like this job. The pay isn't great, but the benefits are, if you can make use of them. You have to be good at multitasking and have a sense of urgency, especially in a drive-thru store."
good,Although Starbucks is a good company. The employees there make you feel very uncomfortable. I Would Love A Job where I can grow and have great friendship with everyone.
good,"There was room to grow only if you were the type of person they were looking for."
good,"Starbucks gave me a lot of experience with multitasking and customer service. Workplace was fun and efficient. However, management always pushed to be more and more efficient, affecting quality that was produced, thus affecting the products that were served. More efficiency also increased stress level within the workplace that affected employees and often led to tensions and arguments. Management was many times unreasonable in resolving conflicts, and the manager was often time, the source of that conflict (trying to dig dirt on employees, calling names on employees behind their back). Perhaps that was just an experience I had from one location. Despite that, I have had the chance to gain plenty of resourceful skills from Starbucks. My only complaint would be on management."
good,"Fast-paced work with enjoyable people, regular customers and interesting daily events. The workload was often a bit overwhelming but could be accomplished."
good,"A typical day at work starts VERY early, and you work extremely hard from 6:30am till 10:30am or longer. Management is hit or miss, but if you find a store with a good manager, it makes a world of difference."
good,"It's very busy and your work isn't typically appreciated. You'll make friends with your partners but management really doesn't care about you, they'll say they do but they won't act on it. I've enjoyed my time for the most part but I do plan to leave soon."
good,"Great as a stepping stone for management jobs. I started as a barista, they promoted me pretty quickly but I felt like I was being underpaid for the amount of time I put into helping out the store. IE. Finding coverage for my team during my days off... Or having to work with a throat infection because nobody was willing to cover my shift."
good,alot of duties at once. management isnt the best. coworkers make the job fun. Chill work environment based on your manager. have to do stuff very by the book.
good,The store does not give benefits or vacation. The company does not give raises nor do they really care for the employees.The store needs attention but the owner will not give proper attention to the store. There is also no room for growth which is hindering. However the team still remains awesome and is like a family and makes it bearable to work there. The manager also has a huge heart and makes it easier to work there as well.
good,"Startbucks is a great place to learn and grow, as you enter the work force. Unfortunately, it doesn’t succefully cater to older emplyees and their needs."
good,"Fast paced, think on your feet type environment. great job to introduce company life. Very flexible with availability. Management was fair. Strict Corporate policies."
good,"This is a great job for people right out of school or in the middle school trying to earn that extra little bit. Although the pay is okay at best the scheduling is very easy to fit life, school, or a second/third job into. Personally I do not believe this is a career that offers much for quality of life and really puts weight into appearing like a 'fun' and 'up-in-coming' business to work for."
good,"During my time at Starbucks, the company has given many opportunities to move to more convenient locations for my family. along with a flexible work schedule, Starbucks has been a pleasure to work for."
good,Every store is different. My previous manager was wonderful to work with and had great managing skills. The latest one caused a lot of separation within the work family we had created. It is a very busy job and you'll be on your feet all day.
good,"The benefits are really great, but hourly rates are not. The company encourages development and promotion from within but local (regional/district) politics can get in the way of advancement. "
good,"If you do not plan on having a career at Starbucks or you are looking for your first job then Starbucks can be a good place to work, but you can not support a family on the pay."
good,I think it was cool that starbucks allows for schooling or insurance opportunities but the whole company talks a great deal about helping out a community or preventing bullying but that didn't stop the actual problems of bullying and favoritism at the place I worked. And the the company policy really did lead to allowing rude customers to create a hostile environment at times.
good,TEA!!! You are introduced to so so many different kinds of tea from all over the world. You get minor sales experience learning how to sell the tea and tea products. Great second job or job for high school students.
good,"Starbucks is a great company as far as benefits. There is no work/life balance in the store manager position. Never off, even when your not scheduled. Upper management doesn't hesitate to contact you on your days off."
good,staff in my store weren't the friendliest. and in general rather unorganised and poorly run. not enough staff to cover shifts and shifts in general were poorly organised.
good,"I would like to begin this review by stating this: I love Starbucks. It is a phenomenal company with a great mission and strong core values. That being said: If you do not handle stress well, don't apply. With sometimes vague and nonsensical direction from management on top of sometimes un-achievable expectations it can be an incredibly hard company to work for."
good,"Starbucks needs work, with accommodating work school life. The shifts are either over staffed or understaffed there is no balance. Also it is to strict."
good,There are some team players but many seem to be there to talk to each other when they are not waiting on customers. Management seems extremely busy. They have great bagged coffee.
good,I work with my colleagues beıng as team member. I ve learnt how you can make coffee and how you can taste coffee. Also the job ıs requıred to understand coffee beans taste and level.
good,"Al principio adecuado pero luego, no toman en cuenta el esfuerzo del colaborador"
good,"I had a good time for the most part at Starbucks. The original manager who hired me was amazing and the store ran efficiently and smoothly and we got a lot of stuff done. He left to run a new store and new management came shortly thereafter, which is when things went downhill. Morale was low and baristas were not getting along. After that there were too many changes in management and I didn't feel good working at that location anymore."
good,Für Studenten oder kurzzeitig ist es einer super Arbeitsplatz das Team ist super und man knüpft schnell Kontakte. 
good,The workplace environment stayed positive. My typical workday was an opening shift and I worked 7-8 hour shifts Monday to Friday. The hardest part of the job was from management and not being organized without help from all shift leads. It is hard at times to rely on management.
good,"I never saw myself working at Starbucks, but once I finally got hired, I fell in love with it. The regulars treat you like on of their own kids or siblings. The customer connections (the good ones of course) make the job worth it. Those are the reasons I've stayed."
good,A good atmosphere with kind people and a nice environment. Too much overtime given without being asked for. Contracts hours are almost always exceeded without request.
good,They weren't very flexible with my schooling schedule which made it hard to balance both at the same time. Therefore left me no choice but to leave the job
good,found some amazing friends working with this company. was very sad to leave but had problems with scheduling due to being a new mom. had a very hard time working Christmas mornings and Easter with small children.
good,"Extremely underpaid, but a good way to get out of your comfort zone if you're extremely shy... You receive benefits like stock options, but say you dont use health or dental insurance, the benefits aren't really that much of a help and you get extremely underpaid."
good,"Job is fun, perks are great, store managers are on a short leash. Fast paced environment, close knit team, overall good experience. But you must follow the outline provided by upper management."
good,"This company strives to put people first and build what Starbucks calls ""Customer Connections"" by encouraging employees to learn customers names, get to know the people and their favorite orders. Cleanliness is a huge priority but never takes precedence over customer service! The customers always come first over any other tasks."
good,"A high pressure environment, rush times are frantic but can be managed with a good team. Often overburdened baristas vs cashiers whom quickly breeze through the line up. Teaches discipline and is good for preparing yourself for other serving jobs as you learn good habits for managing work-flow."
good,It was typically busy and most of my employees were too much drama. The management was poor at best. And peak is the hardest part. The freedom of bar was fun.
good,Starbucks is a place for someone who just wants a job to make some cash while going to school. I feel like if you have bills to pay this job doesn’t pay enough to make a decent living. As a supervisor you barely get paid more than a barista and have tons of responsibility. At least in my store the manager puts tons of pressure on the supervisors and my store barely has any supervisors to begin with. A lot of managers in my district could care less about the problems going on in the store because once they aren’t in the store they feel like it’s not their problem if they aren’t there. It’s stressful especially when you communicate with your manager and they don’t do anything about it and there aren’t a lot of opportunities to move up. I know so many 4+ year supervisors who have been told they’re getting looked at to become an Assisant Manager yet they hire outside hires for the position who turn out terrible. I wish managers would care to help out their store more but it could just be where I’m located at. I feel the company also put customers first at the expense of partners and customers can sometimes be rude and nasty but thats also every customer service job.
good,"A typical day at work was intense from start to finish. "
good,"This is a great company to start out in. Good benefits, good hours. Very customer focused and you are expected to be happy and cheerful through thick and thin. Management has its pros and cons. The workplace usually feels short staffed even though it is considered not to be. Depending on your specific manager this job can be really great and fun. Or it can feel overwhelming and unorganized."
good,I was in charge of opening my register when it was my shift. I took peoples order with a smile to insure they enjoyed the rest of their day. At the end of the night I counted the draw and helped clean up.
good,"Very very early mornings, amazing smell of coffee. High pressure and fast paced. Can sometimes be messy. I learned how to use a P.O.S system, how to make drinks and how to handle cash. The most enjoyable part was getting off at noon after opening in the morning and the discounted coffee."
good,"Honestly, one of the best parts about working for starbucks were the partners that I got to work with. during a particular period of time i felt like i was going to work with my good friends. this made the my time there go by so fast and enjoyed going into work"
good,"Partners are great. Management could use improvement. It's a fun environment to work in a far as meeting people and working side by side. Managers, however, at my current location in Los Angeles could work on managing partners better and overall running the store."
good,"When I was working here I did enjoy interacting with the other members of the team and the customers, we would sometimes have really busy days and quite days through out the week. At this Starbucks they would sometimes treat people differently and letting others off lightly where as some people would not get off lightly and will be punished with a written or verbal warning. Overall it is a good work place and you do meet new people but you have to be up for a challenge!"
good,I truly did love working there until Starbucks decided to starting hiring in managers instead of promoting their own partners. The company itself offers some wonderful benefits.
good,Everyone was at each others throats half the time. It was really a toxic work environment. It was missing respect and a good work ethic. If I ablustly had no choice but to work their I probably wouldn't.
good,A lot of favoritism takes place and baristas are usually taken for granted.  Can be hit or miss depending on who you end up meeting or cross paths with.
good,"I needed a job and I am good with people, so I figured I would work the cash register. I'm not a coffee person though and the amount of things I had to learn were pretty immense. Dark, medium, light roasts, frozen coffees, iced coffees, lattes, macchiatos, teas, etc. however, most people are proficient with coffee, so it's not a big deal. I felt like more a liability than an asset, which is a feeling I am not used to. Co-workers were usually frustrated with me because I couldn't procure various drinks in a split-second notice. I got better with time, but it just wasn't worth the level of stress on me."
good,"The cost of living in my area is crazy high and starbucks pays pennies so I can barely afford rent. It's not just making coffee, its lifting heavy, tall things all day long, doing repetitive motions. Even when I ask for extra hours my manager says no because ""there's not enough labor"" but I know for a fact my store alone, after all losses, makes about 2 million dollars a year. They keep on asking us to make everything perfectly, quickly, while maintaining a ""connection"" with customers, but all the while we are underpaid, overworked, and understaffed."
good,"Working for starbucks was hard for me because the customers really expect you to lick their shoes if they desire it. But, if the customers are regulars with great personalities the day can be full of nice interactions. It's a very fast paced and demanding job. My health couldn't keep up eventually."
good,"It wasn't bad. Overall enjoyable. This was a licensed Starbucks. If you had a reward on your app, it may not work at a licensed Starbucks. We just sold their products. I enjoyed making drinks, but it can become hectic when you have a line of order. Just recently, you cannot stack 2 Tall (size small) for a Venti (Large) order. Back then, I was able to do it to ""speed up"" the process, but it's not allowed anymore."
good,"Hard to deal with customers sometimes, but overall it is a nice place to learn how to be fast, deal with people, play different positions at just one place."
good,"It is an overall easy job, however each store is different with management and business. It can be stressful at times, but the benefits are worth it. Customers are probably the worst part of the job because most of the time we are short staffed so we are working harder so it can be stressful. With any customer service job, the customer always comes first, but after a while, it is exhausting. It can wear on your mental health."
good,"If your lucky enough to have a great manager things will be wonderful.  However, management is always being moved around and moving up can be very competitive and time sensitive.    The hardest part of the job would be dealing with customers, while the most enjoyable can be learning to create wonderful beverages."
good,"Multitasking is a must at this job. If you cant do that they fire you are put you on register all day. A lot of customers are  grumpy due to not having their caffeine yet, other the it when their order is screwed up and that happens time to time. Prepare for early 8 hour shifts. You are on your feet all day too. There really isn't any down time. If there are no customers, then often times you are cleaning something."
good,At an average Starbucks I would say that it would be fine but at the Starbucks in Target you are left all alone to do the work for most of the time. They schedule you so that you are working with someone for about an hour before they leave and then you are all alone.
good,"Working with Starbucks was a bit of a challenge for me due to my disability. Standing for good 7 hours was quite hard on my back since I was born with it. I did how ever loved making the coffee for my customers even if they yell at me I'm happy re making it for them so they can leave with a happy smile in the morning. I understand how it is in the morning, everyone is tired and hungover from sleep or what ever else so they can get cranky. I get patient with them and I just do it until their happy and ready for their work. If they still give me a hard time for example when the customer was angry at me for making an error on their coffee and it made him/her late. I ended up seeking the manager for help. I always ask for help when I need it."
good,"licensed store is very stressful, unorganized and always under-staff"
good,Its a mostly fun job but they pay and work doesnt add up. For how stressful the environment it the workers should be paid much more. Even the shifts arent paid very much and they will spend 11 hours a day there sometimes.
good,"Nice up-beat friendly work place."
good,"The job is easy, just stay busy. Baristas are treated nicely and the customers are always kind. It is fun making relationships with the regulars that come in and want to talk about the day with you."
good,"My manager was awesome and my fellow employees were okay. Mostly poor wages. 8 dollars a hour is a rip off even for at seventeen year old. The minimum should be raised especially since I never get full time hours. They know its cheaper to rotate multiple employee's between 20 and 30 hours so they do not owe them benefits or anything extra."
good,"Cultura laboral"
good,"The atmosphere here is wonderful, the people I work with are great! I love this job, it just doesn't pay enough for me. The work is also something I don't get tired of, but the pay isn't good enough to provide for my family."
good,"- Lots of angry customers"
good,"Had some great managers.  Unfortunately, I also had some that were definitely morally and ethically corrupt.  I felt uncomfortable making certain actions that were asked of me as an assistant manager when dealing with corrective actions of baristas or supervisors. I was also fired over the phone after my shift had ended for being sent home sick too many times and being late for the only time that same day.  Before that I worked in a store with a lot of nepotism."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the first line staff and helping the customers. Very rewarding to be able to coach and inspire the people around you.
good,"As a Store Manager your job changes as the company changes direction, which can happen every quarter, or as your DM changes, which can be every few years or every few months. There is no regional or national consistency- something you are held to task for can be something a fellow manager in another town is told is unimportant and doesn't matter. Higher-ups are often hired from outside and have no management experience or in-store experience, yet you are held to a standard they have created with no experience of their own. You are expected to work longer hours than scheduled and if your team members are unavailable you are often required to do the work yourself regardless of work/life balance or hours already worked. Raises are at the discretion of your district manager and promotions from store manager to district manager are almost entirely based on which store you get lucky to be sent to and which district manager you have at the moment. There is little consistency in leadership and all work towards a promotion resets for every level of the company when a district manager transfers to a new district or is let go."
good,"Provided Excellent Training however management wasnt up to par. Store was routinely understaffed and poorly supplied to accommodate the large influx of customers."
good,I would not have left Starbucks if they allowed me to transfer. They always made excuses as to why I couldn't transfer to a different location even though I was fully qualified.
good,Starbucks experience consisted of great and friendly coworkers lead by an uncaring and gossipy manager. Flexible schedule was a bonus but store was understaffed .
good,"Starbucks is a fun place to work in because of the customers.  You interact with them and have a good time with them. I learned so many things working there. Such as everyone is different, everyone you met all from different places. The hardest thing about the job is getting other workers to do the right thing like you do. The most fun I had at the job was making the drinks, That always been my favorite.."
good,"Work was constantly busy. We were always on the go between all the customers, with lines sometimes out the door, and mobile orders. The workplace/ environment was good. We had our regulars who came in and were excited when we had their drinks ready for them. I learned to memorize drink orders to faces and how to work in a crowed, fast pace environment."
good,"A standard day at Starbucks Consisted of making drink for a variety of customers. Aside from the supervisor, management was acceptable, and depending on the day, the workplace would be calm and entertaining. I learned how to hone my peoples skills as well as my ability to draw in people to have more of an impact in the workplace. The easiest part was making drinks because it was always something new and exciting, however going to the deep freezer was the hardest part though that was due to my dislike of the cold."
good,"Good job overall, worked in location at Target. best fit for someone who is out going and able to work in a fast paced environment for at least 8 hours."
good,Kesinlikle sorunları olan bir sirket.daha fazla özverili olunmalı.
good,"I didn't mind working at Starbucks but over the months of working there, I was constantly having to repeat my preferred working schedule.  I had no consistency and felt that my work wasn't appreciated. My partners were great but there were some conflicts with the openers and closers that made being a midday shift stressful. I enjoyed my supervisors but felt that I wasn't getting fully or correctly trained. Which made it not so great when trying to improve."
good,"Not paid enough. No benefits. Unequal pay, poor hiring system. Poor training technics. Everything changes all the time. Easy job. Ok work environment."
good,"It was a good company that allowed decent notes and pay depending on your location. Locations that allow 40 hrs/ week for full time partners, others that allow 25-30 for full time.  Management never seemed like they were in control or understanding of their role as they mainly are promoted from within with little to no management experience."
good,"You may be lucky and find yourself in a store with a great manager, but having a bad store manager can really make or break the experience. I've worked at several stores and each store has difference reasons for stress."
good,A large part of your job satisfaction at Starbucks will depend on who your manager is. I had a couple of poor quality managers but many others who also worked there had excellent managers and did well. Be wary of people who feel trapped in the job and their bad feelings towards their situation leech into their interactions with their coworkers and employees.
good,"Equipe soudée et agréable à vivre mais les manageurs et les responsables de magasin sont exigent et oppressant."
good,"Typical day was very busy at most days.  My management at my location was terrible, which was the main reason for my seperation decision.  The hardest part is being understaffed meaning it was impossible to properly train people.  Most enjoyable was definitely the people you work with and the customers"
good,"I loved my co-workers and the customers, however, the job pays very little. The management wasn't great, the store manager was very passive aggressive. It's a fun college job but after working there for almost four years I was ready for something that paid better and focused more on the human connection part of the job."
good,"It was great opportunity , It taught me time management and I really loved interacting with customers. I caught on quickly with remembering recipes and regular customers orders."
good,"I enjoyed the creativity I got to use on the job. It was fast paced, but a ton of fun, especially when coworkers get along. I loved seeing the smile on peoples faces when they got a drink that looked and tasted to their satisfaction."
good,"I worked there for 3 months. the job was awesome, the manager was bad. Every other person i worked with loved to work with me and said i was a great employee. But, my manager felt different and fired me instead of his crack-head friend."
good,"They are uncooperative with hours. They did not work around my schedule, even knowing that it would be impossible for me to work certain hours or certain days."
good,"I was grateful for the opportunity I was given at Starbucks. Though I am no longer with the company, it did help me get through school in order to become a Teacher. Through my creativity, I was promoted to do most if not all of the art design for my store and a numerous amount of stores in the surrounding area regarding promos and various creative aspects. I did have my practice as a Barista too. The customer service at times could get rather difficult and learning how to manage the bar in the midst of a rush, but through time you develop a sense know how and it wasn't all that bad. It taught me how to handle people and see things from another perspective."
good,"Worked here for a year, but would not go back to my location. The management was way too strict and was not a healthy environment. Does not offer job security as hours can go as low as 10 hrs/week."
good,"During my time at Starbucks, I worked much harder than I was paid. I feel that my work there was only recognized only some of the time. In my experience, the store managers I have worked with (five in total) in the course of four years at my single store all relied on my efforts. My efforts were superior to my coworkers (which tended to be students like myself, but lazy) and known to be superior. If I worked harder, it seemed to have little to no pay-out I received a total of a $1/hr increase in pay increase although I was a barista trainer, and I received awards from QASA audits and was supposedly one of the 'best' baristas in the Denver District. I declined an offer to be promoted to a shift supervisor position due to schedule conflict (plus the pay was not right). The employee turnover-rate is absurd, I never transferred stores in the four years I worked for Starbucks, but I must have had a complete roster change three times where I was the only alumni. I most likely worked with around 100-120 different employees."
good,Quick learners and fast paced people showed work in that type of work environment. Also people with joyful attitudes and show a lot of positivity in everything they do.
good,"A typical day at work entailed taking orders, making and serving drinks to customers, and performing various cleaning and sanitary duties. I learned how to multitask and keep myself preoccupied. One manager I had, who was promoted from within the company was great. The next one I had, who was not, wasn't so great. The workplace culture is somewhat relaxed. The hardest part of the job is keeping yourself preoccupied. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was socializing with my coworkers."
good,"Worked nearly 80 hours a week for almost a year, put my body through the grinder trying to meet unrealistic goals. Finally catch wind of a promotion coming up, only a few of us are qualified. Due to a clerical error, I am passed up for the Supervisor's unqualified, probationary phase employee. Get approved to switch to part time so I can pursue my education. Supervisor changes their mind first week of school, they can't afford to lose my productivity. There's a line in and out of this facility of people starting, and people quitting. That should say something."
good,"Starbucks is a good job for the worker who is just getting into the work force. As for long time, it is not a good place to work. My location had many management problems."
good,Great place to just pick up extra money not enough pay nor hours for a real bill paying job. They have a great school program and offer flexible hours
good,tiene preferencia de empleados sin importar el trabajo
good,"Empresa con mucha cultura, ambiente de trabajo agradable, con gran enfoque en capacitación a los lideres."
good,Nothing much to say all I can say it was a very difficult very fast past work environment witch I couldn't handle at the moment  but when time came around I had got use to the job its just I kept coming to work late so I had got fired but there was a really good atmosphere to begin with.
good,"There is an increasing amount of work put on single employees that should be more distributed throughout the entirety of the managers and baristas. Although this company tarted as a close knit group perusing their dream of a ""third-place"" in mind, it has recently become just another business that takes it tenured partners for granted while catering to brand new hires."
good,Overall there are some great people you can meet . It's a very fast paced job so if you arent into that DO NOT APPLY ! Other than that it's interesting meeting people from all over and learning new drinks. It's like a second family
good,This job fits well around classes but is very high stress. There can be a lot of social drama due to the young age of those working there. other than that this job isnt bad for a beginning.
good,"It was a good experience, gave me a sense of belonging. It was definitely fast paced and there was always something to do. I really like the interaction with the clients. The hardest part of the job was the early morning shows and the lack of appreciation for your job, by others."
good,The days are sometimes long when business is slow and that is often. When its busy its fun because there is something to do. Corporate doesnt understand what its like to work in a starbucks which is why some of the rules seem a bit ridiculous.
good,"It was a nice second job. Not too stressful and a lot more casual than my current job. Loved my regulars. It was not something I planned on making a career out of, but the benefits were really nice. I would go back to the company if I needed to."
good,I just had the misfortune of being in an area that is prone to having poor management.  Otherwise the fast paced environment is a great way to gain experience working under pressure.
good,"I worked at a Starbucks Kiosk for a little under 2 years. I was in high school at the time, and even I could've run our store better than both of the managers we had in that time. Both had poor communication skills, little knowledge of the products and how to make them, and didn't understand the basics of what needed to be done during each shift. It was very disappointing and frustrating, but I think with different managers I would have really enjoyed the time I worked there because I really did enjoy the work."
good,My experience at the store I was hired was great. But then my store flooded under Harvey and never reopened. The manager left without a word and no one from corporate office helped to relocate us.  I called around to other stores and was bounced around. The managers were no friendly and did not give me the hours I need.  I just had an overall bad luck but the first month was great.
good,It was a cool job for the time. I was about 19 or 20 but it definitely was not enough money to live off. I enjoyed the free coffee and the schedule was very flexible
good,"Great place to work if you have a good manager. If you do not have a good manager, there is no option to move up to a better position, and they expect way too much from you. Very hard working job that does not pay enough."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Starbucks. I loved my customers and my coworkers. However management there was really bad. They didn't care about there people and favoritism was out of control. This isn't true for ever Starbucks. some are very well run. I worked at one in Charleston, West Virginia and we had 4 store managers in the first year of the store opening."
good,"Consistent high turnover in upper management leading to inconsistent direction."
good,"I thought, when i accepted this job that it would be wonderful and i suppose had it have been a proper Starbucks it might have been. As a supervisor i received very little support, minimum staff and a lot of hassle. Was glad to leave"
good,"Here one must be fast-paced, incredibly patient, and brutally kind to everyone. The customer is always right at this facility regardless of the way they treat or talk to their barista. The culture is intended to be warm and welcoming, however if you're not perfect at your job you will be belittled and patronized by your fellow partners, including management. If you are decent at your job, you are expected to carry-out your job every single day - sick days and call outs caused by chronic illnesses and/or simple flu/cold cases are looked at very negatively and results in a passive-aggressive, very tense environment with management, shift supervisors, and fellow baristas for ongoing months at a time. Management and shifts talk to each other and other employees regarding other employees weaknesses and mistakes. Write-up's are always first warning."
good,I was 3-4 months pregnant when I worked here my hormones made this job very unpleasant for me to work in the staff was OK the people were nice but it was not for me
good,I loved my job and my customers. I was promised a store of my own but never got one. I worked hard to get moved up but felt unappreciated. The management was one sided and did not work with the team.
good,"Everyday we had a deadline to meet for certain pastries that had to me made: rolled, proofed, sprayed and baked, cooled and quality control inspected before sending to packaging. So every day was a little different then the day before. I liked that"
good,Starbucks has their great moments and then there not so great moments. You most likely won't advance in this field. The pay is pretty terrible considering how stressful and fast paced it it. You can't mess up or else you will get some rude customers or your fellow coworkers will get mad. There is no time for mistakes.
good,I wasn't given any training and was expected to be able to manage making drinks and serving customers on the drive through. Perks were free drinks however the bad outweighed the good.
good,"The company is good to a extent the most hours a barista can see is about 35 with a praying chance of seeing close to 38 only the managers get those hours "
good,"The management in my area is typically pretty bad. And there's always some kind of drama among co-workers, shift leads having relations with baristas and managers not saying anything, Managers showing blatant favoritism. It's a mess."
good,"The company is very selective on who can advance. Shifts at my store don't typically exceed 6 hours. Yearly pay raises are a bonus. I really love working with the people most of the time, some customers can be a handful but aside from that, I would recommend this job to someone who is looking for a part time job."
good,"lo que mas me gusto del trabajo es el mmmismo trabajo en equipo que tienen los trabajadores con todos nosotros, se apoyan todos entre si"
good,"Can be fun, depending on the team you are working with. Great to build relationships with regular customers. Hours vary from day to day, and sometimes employees are sent home early (not getting the full hours they were scheduled for). Long hours on your feet."
good,"Starbucks is extremely fast paced, and stressful. The costumers can be very rude and demeaning. My first manager had her favorites and I was not one of them, unfortunately. My second manager didn't like his Job at all, but he was a very nice man. My overall experience of Starbucks was being under paid, and over worked. There were some fun times, but constantly had drama, which I guess is normal for work environments where everyone was so close all the time."
good,"Being my location specifically, it's extremely hectic and the pay rate doesn't suffice for the amount of work that's done on a daily basis. The management is fair (to an extent)."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of taking orders, transactions and making sure customers drinks were made correctly and on time. The most enjoyable part of my job was the atmosphere, everyone that worked there was outgoing and friendly which made my shifts easier when it got busy. As an assistant manager at my job, we had our managers leave us twice and I had to step in as a manager and do the same work they did without recognition or increase in pay. I wasn't fully trained as a manager only an assistant manager which made it difficult for me especially since the direct manager knew and didn't really step up to help. Although I wasn't trained properly i feel like i did a great job in managing the place."
good,"I enjoyed working at Starbucks as a Barista. The others who were at my same level and I all got along great."
good,It was a fun fast paced environment but not good at giving employees benefits or working with hours. They didn't give me many hours even though my availability was open. Also the training was minimal.
good,Starbucks is their own culture in itself. There are a ton of things to learn and at first it's very overwhelming. They offer excellent benefits and the partners that work there are diverse and fun-loving.
good,"There is a lot to learn, and many opportunities to grow with the company. A typical day was nonstop, but in a good way.  Once you arrive you either prepare the food, or stock up cups."
good,"Its a good company if you are upper management. Thats all, but nothing more than that. good for college kids first job while in school, but they ask too much for too little pay"
good,"Had to clean bathrooms that many homeless people had been using to shoot up in. One girl had to go to the hospital for getting her hand stabbed by one. "
good,An assistant manager showed up for work late a few times and was lazy with how he kept and operated the establishment. The store was kept tidy and had good workers who knew what they were doing.
good,Everyday people would come into work and not enjoy what they were doing. The pay wasn't great and it often reflected on how people worked. Customers would often times get annoyed with employees regardless of what they did.
good,"It was a wonderful job , They Help You With School , They Work With your time . It’s a good company they just need better management , Your Get To connect with nice people. You learn about other and They lifestyle it’s definitely a nice place"
good,"It's decent for a short-term job, but it really is meant to be temporary. The fact that the manager doesn't truly do anything to help increase work hours at our store without just having us  ""work at a different store"" speaks volumes. He's a nice guy, just really not helpful in terms of a living wage."
good,"Working for Starbucks is a really good opportunity; which I believe people should take advantage. However, if you are looking for advancement, raises, or anything of that nature (depending on the location) you may be waiting a long time."
good,constantly on your feet. you're lucky if you get a break. very fast paced and you don't get the pay you deserve... management picks their favorites even if you are a good worker.
good,"A typical day for me would be to get up at 4:30 AM to arrive to my 5 AM shift and open a cafe store in 30mins with 2 people. After a while 2 more people come in and help out however only for about 4 hours of my 8 hour shift."
good,"Starbucks was great back in 2007-2008, but it started slipping.  They took shifts down to a skeleton crew and focused more on money instead of coffee.  Eventually, it all just turned into how many frappuccinos a store could pump out.  They did have amazing benefits, though, for part-time employees. I learned a lot about coffee in the beginning, before it changed into whatever it is now."
good,"This is a fast paced job, but you get paid well. It is fun to build relationship with the customers each day that you see them. "
good,i worked at a high volume store so we had a high turn over rate amongst workers because some people could simply not keep up. i was a trainer so i was busy training people to get on the floor and integrate into the team.
good,Good if you don't have kids or a second job to accommodate. Easy to move up if that's what you desire. Can be clique-like behavior in stores. Lots of pressure on management.
good,"Working at Starbucks is a great job for being in school because they work with your schedule. However, there is always drama of some sort and everything is very petty. The culture between the partners is finger pointing and management is always lacking in their administrative role. Starbucks offers amazing opportunities for benefits and to go to school for only being part-time, which is a real perk and hard to find."
good,"This was a great experience, but there is no work life balance. If you get sick and can't make it into work, good luck finding the coverage; you'll end up going in anyway."
good,"Over all good company to work for. Compensation is not great."
good,"The staff was always the best part of the job. Worked at one of the busiest drive-thru locations in the state. Unfortunately, we were never staffed properly due to lack of applicants. This made the last year extremely stressful."
good,"Starbucks is perfect for those who want a fast-paced, busy environment interacting with people. It's not always interesting work by itself, but with the right team and customer relationships it can be very rewarding."
good,"Starbucks is a great company for all that they do for the community and their attempts to give back. That being said, since the company is so ""top down"" when it comes to being a store manager or supervisor, there's lots of room for a lack of communication, and an expected over exertion on the barista's end. The type of customer service offered at Starbucks is wonderful, however, when 8/10 customers have their own agenda in mind, its nearly impossible to create the ""customer connection"" that this company has so close to its heart. In my opinion, the company is very superficial. Not in the good, getting stuff done way. More like, the communication is terrible, and interpersonal connection is FAR out of sight."
good,"starbucks could be very stressful if you cannot handle working under pressure in a fast pace enviroment, but that it what makes it challenging and fun"
good,"You meet a lot of cool people, and you meet customers who are genuinely great people. You will have the odd rude customer, and an intolerable barista to work with. Overall, I have stayed mostly for the people I work with, and for those customers that are great to talk to. "
good,"Great place to work, could have got paid a little more, more hours, very relaxed yet u stayed busy. Management was good, very relaxed on making schedules,"
good,"It really depends on who you are working with and how your manager runs the show. It can either be really fun, or awful, it is a toss up. If your manager is cool, supervisors are cool, it can be great."
good,"Ideal for Students"
good,"Starbucks is one of those places that seems fun to work at and sometimes it can be. These that affect that can be co-workers, managers, and district managers. Things change on a whim and its so fast paced. Often you are just thrown into the atmosphere and it can be so overwhelming. You have to be so fast and work to a standard."
good,it was typically a relaxed day with bursts of energy throughout the day. my manager sucked though and would never give out a schedule and would give us a 20 minute notice if we worked or not.
good,"A typical day at Starbucks is filled with more cleaning than anything. They train most of the new partners to learn how to do tedious cleaning tasks rather than actually prepare coffee. Skill and mastering bar only comes with practice, which is hard to come by as a new partner. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the customers if you are not making the drinks fast enough."
good,Working at Starbucks was fun and fasted paced. My manager was really flexible on hours and we got discounts on items. Very stressful at times but enjoyable all in all.
good,"Starbucks offers the best benefits for this level of employment. However, they are a horrible corporation that does not care about its low-level employees. The work is extremely easy and the pay is good for the tasks given. This corporation waves the flag of ""TOLERANCE."" However, they are extremely INTOLERANT towards any contrasting ideals."
good,"Starbucks can a be very stressful place to work, but it can also be extremely gratifying. The management varies at each location, but my manager was not very good at her job. She would schedule you outside of your availability and when you were having issues with completing your role at work, she was not very helpful with trying to assist you. I had a disability and asked for her to work with me on my attendance as my new medication made me oversleep at times. Instead of assisting me, she fired me a few weeks after our conversation when my car was booted improperly. The co-workers are the most enjoyable part of the job, as well as the free coffee and food. The hardest part of the job is frequent no-call no-shows and lack of adequate training. The company prides itself in assisting with benefits, but after you pay your 20%, the salary is not enough to provide rent and food, so you likely will have to work another job as well. Hours are never guaranteed either, even if you are in a supervisory role."
good,"When I first started working at Starbucks there were many good baristas and workers and everything got done in time and the job was fun. But slowly and one by one everyone started leaving and was replaced by new workers who some had no work ethic and that made the job more difficult on me as I became the person with the most experience as everyone else left. As a closer I noticed that many things weren't being done as and when they were supposed to be done. The hardest part of the job for me was to do all the catching up on things that were supposed to be already done, causing me to get behind on the things that I need to do for close. If the store has good management and people with good work ethic then the job can be fun, but if you come to work and have to catch up on things that should have already been done then it might not be so great. The team makes the difference."
good,"Not a bad job to get through college with. Hours are inconsistent, as are the days. Benefits and perks provided are extremely generous. Really just would depend on the individual store and the training consistency."
good,There was more concern for production than customer relationships and actual coffee crafting. I also was hired for a shift manager position that was supposed to be full time and was never trained for my position and received only part time hours.
good,"Fast paced environment, teamwork, room for growth, and plenty of cross training. Depending on who you work with will also affect your experience (as does every workplace)."
good,"Working at Starbucks is awful. I haven't quit yet because I need to find a new job first. My co-workers are a huge part of why I am leaving the company, they are very rude and make people feel uncomfortable, oh and they are racist."
good,"This was a great 1st job, but after a few new life changing milestones it was no longer a good fit. I loved my customers and the fast pace of the job."
good,"Decent Company, lots of coffee lol if that is your thing and sometimes free food. Management varies i have had great managers and not so great . Can get really busy pro and a con i guess"
good,Work here was very fast and always stressful. Hourly pay was really low for the conditions. Although the perks are enjoyable such as the discounts and free drinks.
good,"Very high paced and fun to work with, but management and staffing was always a struggle. Some stores were handled better than others but most employees were under trained and over worked."
good,"A day at work is super great. A perfect job if it paid well."
good,It is a good work environment for people who need to find a part time job. Easy and relaxing. I enjoyed working and gave me skills to make better coffee and interact with more people.
good,Working at Starbucks was basically working at any fast food place. The pace was very fast and the orders were detailed. Customers are sometimes less than pleasant but the majority are fine. I found often times I did not get the support I really needed to do the job effectively.
good,"I would not recommend this place to anyone until some things change. "
good,"It can be a great company if lead by a competent leader. While being flexible in any job is par for the course. The inconsistency in which managers are treated is vast."
good,Working at Starbucks was a great experience. It was my first position in customer service and helped provide me with the tools I continue to use for the job I'm doing now.
good,"At times could be very stressful, but decent if well maintained. They pay for tuition reimbursement and have decent medical benefits. Mostly young people working. Decent place to work."
good,"The company culture is amazing and the management is pretty good in both states I worked in, but the pay differs based on where you live and the pay is not adequate in the south, especially in Texas, where my pay dropped when I moved there and I was not informed of that, hence why I left the company when I did."
good,"If you work at a drive thru store be prepared for non stop work. Very fun job, flexible with school schedules, pay could be better for the amount of work you dish out."
good,"The pay is higher then the corporate stores. Unfortunately Sodexo the company that oversees the Cal State San Bernardino location is horrible. Upper management is rude, they take nothing seriously, they do not care if they are under staffed, or if spoiled food and beverages are served to the faculty or staff. They feel since the staff is paid well, you should shut up, take it and be grateful you have a job."
good,"The company was once a great place to work, but every year they expect MORE from employees while reducing coverage simultaneously, until people break."
good,"Airport Starbucks in Calgary has definitely one of the best customer service in the city although the management should really look at their workers benefits since the baristas can't even get a free drink or food. It is one of the most hard working baristas in the city. Although it is a private owned Starbucks, the baristas wage should be the same as the ones outside of the airport."
good,"Progression is often talked about but very rarely ever actually happening. Management are very tight knit and if you're not 'in' with the right managers you won't really get anywhere."
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work as a first job, but i would not recommend the company as a long term career choice. There is a lack of understanding and communication from managers who expect you to do their jobs for them, and also hold you accountable for actions they neglect to perform. Hard work does not get you far in this company, but rather favoritism which often overshadows those individuals who take the time to do the work efficiently to help boost store performance and customer satisfaction."
good,"I quite enjoy working for Starbucks. I find it very hard to progress, however, once you have reached a certain level in the company. This is why I am here, looking to rebrand myself and get another job where I can constantly progress and develop myself."
good,Management changed from bad to worse while I was there. It went from indifferent to openly hostile. No career path for computer operations personnel. Very hard to transition from night to day shift.
good,"The job will be better if the employees are getting paid well, my place of work is very busy compared to other Starbucks and therefore should require a better pay as a motivation for their job well done. Because that is the only way you know that your efforts will pay off."
good,"Starbucks for me was a good first job. I’m very sociable and was able to use that to connect with customers and , to help them make their drink choice a little more fun. However the management wasn’t that good. The district manager and my store manager were cool with each other so, any problems we had with the store management got looked over."
good,"Very collaborative company.  Many layers of management but little leadership,  Slow to make decisions with poorly defined roles and responsibilities.  High turn over of senior leadership."
good,"It is hard to get hours unless you have complete open availability, this is difficult for college students to make a living wage. For a long time I was only scheduled 8-12 hrs a week and am now finally being scheduled 28-30 hours. Management argues with you for giving out a free drink and making the moment right, they do not seem to care about employees or customers. They are more focused on having good drive times than your level of stress. I have with Starbucks for almost 3 years and recently they have me in window for an entire 8 hr shift. It is stressful. Partners can be and are very rude and disrespectful. They do not follow availability very well either and will argue over availability. Expects you to cover your shift when calling out no matter how sick you are and if you can't find coverage they will try to force you to come in anyway. Doesn't matter if you are puking or have step throat."
good,"Starbucks used to be a culture that was full of warmth and belonging.  Today it has become nothing but ""make more money on far less labor.""  Good luck"
good,"Although corporate was constantly stating in emails and publications to the staff that its employees are the most important part of how their operations were run, they did nothing to actually show that we were integral to their success. They constantly increased the cost of benefits whilst keeping raises at the bare minimum. The management at all the stores I worked at was either unable to do anything about the lack of staffing hours to customer ratio or did not care to do so. They often parroted from emails about how things would get better without offering a time table or plan of action. The store managed to lose 8 of its 12 employees before I left and either could not or would not higher in more people to take their place putting undue stress on employees making very little above minimum wage."
good,"It’s a great first job, if you want to work a somewhat set schedule then it works for you."
good,"overall a good place to work, especially if you’re looking to balance your schedule around another job or school. benefits aren’t too well- employees only get 10% off and thats it"
good,"Starbucks is a place routed deeply in customer connection and the personal experience of getting coffee. If you cant hold conversation or prefer to limit your communication with others, I would not recommend this company. I love the fact that I get to talk to people every day."
good,The workplace culture at Starbucks is amazing. The partners all get along and the perks of free coffee and other beverages is fun. There are problems with turnover and sales expectations with limited staffing.
good,"If you're a good, hard worker who doesn't mind getting abused and used for your ethics and quality work, then this is the place for you! The opportunity to move up is slim as the internal workings has dramatically taken a turn for the worse and the baristas are cared for less and less. Honestly, this has become a high school / college job: something to just pay the bills and get you by until the next better job. Nothing to make a carer out of."
good,"Usually work either morning (around 5 am- 1 pm) or evening shift (1pm-9pm). Could be difficult to do an evening followed by a morning, but managers usually avoided this. Generally great employees and close relationships formed. Frequently have morning or after-school rushes which could be somewhat stressful, as well as long periods with no customers, which could pass very slowly. Being able to jump between stations and work with others would be a plus."
good,I like the fact that they will work with you if you have to change your hours do to life changes or school. While still accommodating to the hours that I need.
good,"Starbucks is perfect for a kid going to school, and pursuing a career.  as this company will teach you management, customer service and much more will prepare them for a future."
good,"Condition de travail correcte. "
good,Busy fun and exhausting place to work. Enjoyable but a thankless job. Great if you are a young people person. Much harder if you can't be on your feet all day.
good,Management unprofessional which resulted in no stability in schedule and frequent staff changes. Wouldn't recommend the location where I worked to others.
good,"After working for Starbucks for as long as I have, the company has just become a glorified McDonalds. Yes, they give great benefits, but that is about the only thing that is great about the company anymore. You can't survive on the pay. They no longer put an emphasis on customer service except to get the customer in and out. We used to have time to build relationships with our customers, now we barely have time to get their names. With the addition of all the food, it cuts even more time out of connecting with customers or fellow partners. I used to be proud to be a partner at Starbucks, now I feel like a sell out."
good,"Improper development and management of workers usually led to most of us simply waiting for a position to move up as opposed to it being merited. However, the company did provide an adequate pay rate and many other benefits."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks on the Northern Arizona University campus consisted of long lines, coffee demands, and a natural buzz that did not seem to leave a person, even when they left. The barista position was demanding, and non-stop with continuous improvement being the objective. The most enjoyable part of the job was making the drinks and testing the quickness of accomplishing the task."
good,The job is very demanding. Constantly having to do 4 different things at one time. There is little support from management and they require a doctor's note for calling in sick.
good,"Starbucks has gone from one of the best companies I've worked for to one of the ones I cannot wait to get away from. I do believe Starbucks once put their partners first but they've slowly stopped doing that. They try to flash benefits and perks in your face, which are great don't get me wrong, however they don't make up for all the other things we deal with.  Partners are stretched thin, with understaffing still being a major problem. Breaks aren't always spaced out during your shift, scheduling is ALWAYS a problem wether its you needing time off or them scheduling you out of your availably, and there is zero consistency in scheduling so you can open one day then work a mid and then a close. Nothing ever stays the same, theres a constant change in whats expected of partners. Its a tiring job, that I only recommend one do for a short amount of time so they can then move on to bigger and better things."
good,"Always busy, multitasking either making drinks, or taking care of customers. If you work together with your Starbucks crew the day goes by much faster and much easier"
good,"Love my partners, but sometimes the general environment of the company could be a bit toxic in regards to labor and sales growth versus supporting and valuing the people working for the company."
good,It is a great entry-level job opportunity. It allows growth in communication and interactive skills. It also offers many benefits for their associates.
good,"Everyone deserves this job, and everyone deserves to move on. It's great when you're first growing a career and your abilities, but eventually you get tired of poor management, lack of accountability, and customers who are allowed to disrespect and harass you with no consequences. I love this company's culture but it truly isn't lived out in many locations. When it's good, it's so wonderful, but when it's bad, I wish I worked literally anywhere else."
good,Poor management and low wages. Not enough room for growth. Working at Starbucks is very impersonal and they offer minimal training for baristas. Not worth the pay.
good,"Coworkers have constant attitudes, shifts yell at you for things you didn't do or don't know how to do. Everyone I worked with was really mean never know what personality you'll get when you arrive at work. The job is stressful and very demanding. Customers generally expect the world from you."
good,"As soon as you clock on you hit the ground running."
good,"I had kinda always wanted to work at a Starbucks since I moved to Vancouver and when I finally nailed a job at Starbucks I was super excited. But when I started, I did the best I could, but I was always expected to do better, and I had no idea why. By the time I quit I was too afraid to ask."
good,"Every day at Starbucks I'd be cashier or drive thru window. All the tasks given were fast paced and exciting. I did get very worn out at the end of a work day. I learned a lot of patience skills, communications, and how to work under stress."
good,"A typical day can have morning's or afternoon's shift. "
good,Starbucks is a great company to work with except it does not seem to pay enough as a barista. throughout just the one year i have worked there it seems as if Starbuck has cared less and less about the partners and focused more on the company itself.
good,I was first hired before the store was open. I was apart of the first groups of employees to get the store set up. I was hired as a cashier and preformed basic duties. Then they started training me at Starbucks for additional staff and gradually I stayed behind the counter than at the checkout. I enjoyed working at Starbucks and I was always eager to have more shifts there.
good,The job culture is interesting however the original culture where all employees are treated the same does not applied. The management are also poor in terms of working hours. But overall it was beneficial experience
good,"Le poste de Barista est très polyvalent donc on a pas le temps de s'ennuyer et les tâches ne manquent pas. L'aspect le plus positive est le travail d'équipe surtout quand il y a une bonne entente et le contact client qui est très important. Le travail est très agréable, même si je travaille dans la restauration rapide, l'ambiance y est très conviviale et détendu. L'aspect le plus négatif est le management. Je ne pense pas que ce soit une généralité dans l'Enseigne. Cela dépend juste du Manager auquel on est confronté. Il est très facile d’évoluer car les supérieurs proposent très régulièrement des formations pour devenir Manager, s'ils remarquent du potentiel chez un Barista."
good,"After seven years with this company, i have found that the business decisions were great for salary status partners and not part time partners. The hiring of so many students that have no flexible work hours has put a damper on its work flow. It is extremely difficult to be promoted. I dont mind puttin %110, but i expect advancement with it. I put in %100 for 6 years to be promoted. Now i know even more about this business and just cannot agree with its labor politics"
good,the customers understood the shop can become very busy but the store itself kept having such a fast turn over of staff there was always new people left unattended not knowing what is required
good,"Typical work day can get pretty hectic, because lets face it people love coffee, the managers and shifts do an amazing job at trying to make it as stress free as possible especially at holiday time. I do enjoy getting tips every Tuesday and having amazing benefits however these are to shadow the average pay they offer. Hardest part of this job would be the holidays and trying to calm down the very antsy or angry customers."
good,"Despite my less than satisfactory experience working with Starbucks, there is one reason that I would still consider recommending Starbucks to someone as an employer: The benefits. If you are not in a position to take full advantage of the benefits offered by this company, then the wages alone are far too low for what is asked of the employees. We are essentially fast food workers who are asked to go above and beyond at every turn. We are asked to thrive on the connections we make with our customers, yet these connections are few and far between in comparison to what I see at other coffee shops. More often than not, our customers are more akin to those found at McDonalds or other fast food restaurants (save for the racy suit-and-tie customers you can find speeding their way through the morning rush). Under-staffing is also a big issue contributing to the increasingly dropping morale of our baristas, as you can find on many pages and forums. Overall, My experience was not what I had hoped, but my love for the knowledge and art of coffee kept me pushing through for the better part of two years."
good,Starbucks has great benefits and good hour flexibility. Management varies from store to store. Pay rate is garbage considering everything that is expected of you.
good,"i had many good memories working for starbucks"
good,I liked the job because I like working fast and I was always busy but people would always call out so that would make me have to work harder. I was there for almost two years. I knew how to function at every station. But for some reason I never got promoted so I decided it was time to move on to something better.
good,I love Starbucks as a corporation overall but the location and shift I worked on wasn't the ideal job. I was working under a new shift-lead and we did not work together well. Others on my shift cared more about closing than giving proper care and service to every guest.
good,"at mall rd its so busy you dont have tim eto do all the normal things a barista should do, you learn how to make drinks as fast as you can and try to get people in and out of the door as soon as possible."
good,Takim calismasina yatkinim surekli yuksek butceli hizli operasyonlarda yonetici olarak gorev alip sorumluluklarimi layigiyla yerine getirdim.
good,"If you want a fast-paced work, being a barista is best. You stand for hours and really sweat it off! The only thing I did not like was the lack of employees."
good,A typical day is consistently busy in the mornings and afternoons. I learned how to make different things and a lot about being a barista. Management is okay but seem to get overwhelmed easily which messes with the atmosphere. The hardest part is going long shifts being overworked and having short staff and short breaks. I feel like we are not paid enough for our job. The most enjoyable part is the free drinks throughout the day.
good,They need to rethink how much they pay their employees. For how much they do they don't get paid nearly enough. They also need help figuring out how to get there partners better benefits at a cheaper rate!
good,"the management toward the end did not treat the employees in a positive manor. Schedules were not done on time & paychecks were often not correct. If management was different, Starbucks itself was an amazing job experience for me."
good,"se aprende de todo un poco, desde preparar un producto, limpieza de tu area de trabajo, hasta tratar con clientes"
good,"Long, hard hours (I actually have a 15 and 13 hour shift next week) but you get out what you put in. Plenty of room for advancement. While the atmosphere in store is always great I do wish there was more of a coffee culture in the company."
good,"Stabucks can be an amazing company to work for, however it always seems that managers get put into place and then left there even if they are single handedly destroying their store or the morale in the store. These managers get away with manipulating the district manager and HR in order to suit their purpose."
good,I personally enjoyed working in a coffee shop as a high school job. The hours and work were appropriate and allowed creativity and customer service to be applied.
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my nearly 10 years sith this company, however terribly disappointed to find the support structure from upper management wasn't there. After 3 managers in 2 months, a personal friend of the district manager wss given the position (violating Starbucks policy). DM was unresponsive to any attempts to communicate issues with her friend, and corporate was slow to unresponsive when we neede them. Lost a lot of good employees and some were fired and black listed from the company for reasons unknown."
good,"Higher ups only care about themselves! They pretend as though they care about you but they actually do not, at all. People in HR are FAKE and try to pretend as though they have a higher position than the regular employees."
good,I loved working at sbux and enjoyed the culture of the company as well. The only reason why I left is that I was barely making above minimum wage and my manager wouldn't schedule anyone over 30 hours.
good,"Then BAM. You're on 26hrs for the forseeable future with a new house and no extra hours. "
good,This was a good job but I was very unhappy with my managers performance and I just wish to see further guidance elsewhere. I would always be watched like they were trying to find some reason to fire me. And when we got new employees I would have to be the one to train them which is very poor on Harris Teeter to insure that everyone is being trained the same.
good,"This review only applies for Starbucks kiosks within Ingles grocery stores. The dress code is strict. Ingles uniforms are required under the green apron. No piercings; tattoos are frowned upon; no ""trendy"" hair. The place is incredibly conservative, which is what you get when you're in the South, I guess. No free drinks or employee discounts like at free-standing franchises. Not only do you have Starbucks corporate people coming in to inspect, you have Ingles corporate people breathing down your neck. I prefer Starbucks corporate over Ingles any day. There are no benefits. If all you want is to make coffee, clean, and bear the title Starbucks Barista, then go for it, but keep in mind that the super cool, free spirit, hipster environment you may think is present at any Starbucks is nowhere to be found at any Starbucks kiosk that lies inside an Ingles."
good,"I personally felt all of us, (the staff) was used as we never had enough staff and was mostly busy. I didn't have enough time to be trained which caused some problems later on which was resolved due to my capability of adapting. "
good,There is a ton of labor cutting in the retail field leading to harder shifts. The compensation for managers is below average and only helps if bonus is attained. Work life balance and benefits are great
good,"Para quem gosta de café é um otimo lugar para aprender muito mas nao só sobre café mas coisas para vida mesmo como o trabalho em equipe, paciencia,se comunicar melhor mas tambem muito cansativo e com poucas oportunidades de subir."
good,"Its okay depending on what store you work at. Your managers and shift supervisors, as well as store location determines if this is a fun, calm job, or torture. Bad managers in this type of job ruins the entire the job for everyone else. Ask current employees if they like working there before you apply to a specific location."
good,The only reason I give Starbucks a low rating is because the manager I had was putting unnecessary stress on all employees. The benefits is amazing and the pay is decent.
good,"Early strange demanding and very busy, you need to have all your pawns in place to play this game accordingly Starbucks is the place where nothing can go wrong because it will throw everything and everyone off."
good,"Starbucks was an adventure. The store in which I worked, had high traffic. Helping people was the best part of job. The culture changed all the time depending on customer."
good,"I routinely supported the opening crew, beginning at 4:30 am. I learned repeatable routines to ensure consistency. I learned to delete all personality and insert how, what, and when to say whatever Starbucks said to say. I am a robot."
good,"I was a barista at Sbux and it was honestly a wonderful experience. I loved the pace and free coffee every week. The only thing that prevented me from being completely happy was the management. But overall, great job! Especially as a first job."
good,"The hourly shifts were very flexible and catered for special individuals who showed willingness to work. Starbucks offers 401k after 6 months, sick days, and insurance. Hourly pay is not recommended for people who are trying to make monthly rent. Therefore, much of the working force are students, older generations, or people who needed extra income."
good,"I love Starcuks, hated the store I worked at. As long as they saw customers loving your service then that's when the team would turn against you. Everyone was not like that just most of the partners who have been there for so long."
good,"They expect everyone to adjust to the fast paced coffee life, with little training. They constantly hire outwardly, so there is no room for advancement, You get great befits, with little pay, and i haven't gotten a raise there in three years."
good,A great company to be with if you love working for a small business. Time management is key and dealing with angry customers is difficult. Dirty work environment.
good,"very fast paced, managers and supervisors could do with getting better training overall an okay job however amount of work you have to do does not correlate with the pay"
good,"A typical day of work would start off by me setting the shop up for opening shifts that I did by myself , and then prep all the food items and make fresh brewed coffee and begin serving the customers."
good,Stressful if you aren't 100% on top of things all the time. Must be available 24 hours a day for phone calls from store or District Manager. Fun customers with a fast paced environment. There are good training programs in place you just need to follow them.
good,"Fast paced, usually the people who worked there were super nice and friendly, but there are some who just want to be super mean and make your life miserable.  Manager was decently nice and would help make scheduling exceptions if you needed them, however management wouldn't recognize those partners who wanted to help make a difference with the company and help make things better.  The good barista's never got picked to be trainers or supervisors."
good,"A typical day for me will start at 5:30. If we are properly staffed (which was rare), the day will go by smoothly. If not, you'll deal with not only the backfire from customers, but also the management. Staff is mainly split between to groups: regular baristas and supervisors. The supervisors get paid a little more than $13, while regular baristas are paid $9.23. The unfair part comes when regular baristas are doing the same thing as supervisors, but aren't paid to do those various things. Other than that, the job was enjoyable, especially getting to know regular customers and having the right team with you."
good,"Location pretty much determines your career success and how far you will go. My location was not one of the greatest and I was miserable majority of my time there. However, being a barista at Starbucks was a great experience and I will never regret working there! :)"
good,Starbucks is a great first job/ get you through college. The hardest part about working for Starbucks is the rude customers who cuss you out for their mistakes.
good,"Management sucks. And depending on your team, it can go very well or just awful. There was a hard time having workers because Starbucks wasn't willing to raise wages in an affluent county. "
good,"I work at a high-volume drive-thru store with very poor management. So, my experience with the company has not been the best. However, I understand that experience varies store-to-store. If you're at a slower cafe store, Starbucks is probably wonderful. At my store, it is difficult to keep morale high due to partners not showing up without consequence (again, poor management at my store) and rude customers. I would not recommend this environment at all; it was a bad idea to make DT Starbucks locations, as quality, hand-crafted beverages and human connections cannot be made in less than 3 minutes total, from order to drive-off (this is the maximum amount of time the company expects a customer to spend in the DT). So, if you can find a nice cafe store, go for it."
good,"Management was not the best"
good,I was treated very poorly at Starbucks. There was many times I would get cursed out or humiliated by customers and my managers would defend the customer or tell them that I was wrong even though I didn't start or entertain it. There's also been many times where customers would say racist things to my face and my managers would still defend them. The only good about Starbucks were the benefits and the others partners.
good,"It is okay, fast-paced. You have to be a quick learner and be able to multitask. You have to know how to work independently because there will be times when you work alone."
good,"Some staff members were very immature, and were putting more weight on others than need be. Management also had this type of behavior, making the baristas uncomfortable. There seemed to be a higher turnover rate when new management took over. I was also promised proper training, but my training was cut short and I had to learn everything with little help."
good,"Working as a Shift Manager is rewarding in its own right, that is to say that its great to be a positive influence on my peers. Often times there is a draining corporate environment being reinforced, creating more stress for both myself and my fellow barista's. When I first started this job 4 years ago, now almost 5, there was a environment of fun, encouragement, and overall support to make connections with everyone, there is less of that now sadly... I'm thankful for the opportunities and benefits that Starbucks has and still does provide for its employees, it's something that is hard pressed to find for a part time job. All in all, Starbucks is a great in-between job, that I hopes continues to find its roots again."
good,"Basically there are two positions:"
good,Starbucks is very fast paced with multiple parameters of your job changing and you need to be a very flexible person to succeed with Starbucks as a company
good,When I first started working for this Starbucks FRANCHISE I thought I would learn a lot... wrong! My first day they were understaffed and I was on the register.. let me tell you it was a disaster! After hat they had me on the register every day and I was pretty much the best in the store. I was the fastest and I would get the most tips. That's why my GM had me on register all the time. But soon it got very irritating because I wasn't learning anything new. When I would try to make drinks I was slow because I was never really on the bar.
good,"This is a job that is great to work around a collegiate's school schedule. However, the pay is poor and the hours are inconsistent for anyone to live upon. My manager was amazingly supportive of her crew and it showed in how well the entire staff worked together and for each other."
good,"Starbucks is one fun place to work. You may start clueless in making coffee and customer service, but you will learn to love it and do it everyday. It is really fun to make coffee and connect to different kinds of people everyday, i love and enjoy this job. However, the salary I received is not enough to support my daily living and the management in the place I am assigned is quite disappointing."
good,Starbucks is a great job for someone who is in college or in high school! It can be a really great experience depending on your store. I worked in Westchester and it was an amazing store with an amazing manager. I then transferred to the city and my manager was great but very shady and spoke about everyone's business amongst the staff and wasn't responsible when it was her time to be responsible.
good,"Love being around the environment the customers and employees are great. There were stressful moments, but I stood strong for the customers, myself and my fellow employees."
good,"It was a good job, I had lots of fun working there and made lots of people's days, it was fast paced at times. "
good,Starbucks is a great place to work the only thing that will decide if it is good or bad is the store you work at. I was fortunate enough to being at the best store in my district. everyone got along and everyone wanted to see you succeed now I have been to stores that are the exact opposite. this job is super easy yet starbucks does demand alot from their partners but you do get good benefits and decent paid. the work enviroment does absolutely depend on the managment.
good,"Working in a high paced environment on a daily basis was great. I enjoy the opportunity to stay busy throughout the work day. I learned how to handle and properly serve and be attentive to customers. The regular customers were people working on laptops or meeting up in small groups or organizations. The job did get difficult during the morning or ""after school"" rush, but with other excellent team members we were able to keep our customers happy."
good,A typical day at Starbucks requires constant patience and a constant desire to perform your best and to deliver outstanding customer service. The most enjoyable part of working for Starbucks is our ability to really make someone's day better with one cup of coffee.
good,Starbucks is a fun place to work when you are going to school or just working part time. However after awhile it can become mundane and the pay and benefits are not enough to sustain oneself on.
good,Not a bad company to work for.  Communication was good when necessary.  Supervisors were good at their jobs.  They were helpful when needed.  Always available.
good,"The Company is good when it comes to their benefits,  but when it comes of financial stability you can't tell it is good to work there for a lifetime. 10 hrs of work plus some of your Overtime that is not paid. It is not worth it."
good,The benefits are amazing but when you have to come in during a blizzard or you get in trouble then you really start questioning their values
good,"Fue un invierno donde fue una bonita experiencia trabajar para este tipo de negocios.El ambiente no era el mejor,demasiada presión.No creo q asi se venda mas ni mejor"
good,I have been with this company for 5+ years. They treat their employees fairly. Just management in every store needs more help in every store. Most of the time the partners are overworked. Sometimes I feel like they need to staff better and understand that when someone gets sick it is literally impossible to get a shift covered or taken care of. I love this company... it has been a hard year as far as staffing at our location. I feel like my development has gotten pushed under the rug for no reason explained to me. I don't feel that the opportunities are there to move up within the company to those who won't be treated like a door mat.
good,"Environnement agréable, possibilité d'évoluer rapidement, équipe dynamique et réactive. Grande qualité d'accueil et de service"
good,"Good place with culture and vision.  Needs better management too help this vision have a place.  They mostly just push you into doing stuff, taking your development into their hands.  So it doesn't work for leaders that already have a direction.  "
good,"A typical day at work here involves taking orders, creating different drinks and learning the creative yet traditional ways to present them, interacting with the regular customers along with new customers, keeping the place clean and tidy and ensuring every customer has a great experience so that they leave wanting to return again and again."
good,This job is good for people who are just entering the work force. I think the hourly rate for the work you put in doesn't add up. I learned that Starbucks is a company I don't want to work for ever again.
good,"Great for entry level job, right out of high school.  Has potential for advancement if you are passionate about the industry and or management. Great environment to learn management and interpersonal skills."
good,"Every location is different, and there are so many locations, but a few things that are true at every location are: "
good,"Its not a bad company , but sometimes you working for them isnt enough . i feel they need to show more respect to the barstia because they work really hard"
good,"Good starter job, clickish advancement opportunity is very selective in district. They have forgotten to take care of long term employees not the same atmosphere as Starbucks started out as."
good,This job was hectic and always changing. Corporate office would hand down legislation not thinking how it would affects their employees. Middle management was carelessly hired and do very little to help the floor staff.
good,Making coffee is a delicate and tedious process. One wrong move and it's burnt or not mixed correctly. The best part of the job were my coworkers.
good,I had a great experience working here had the chance to meet great people. It's a fast pace job. Very knowledgeable. Great  Opportunity to move up an start a career.
good,My experience working at Starbucks was quite a wild one i really enjoyed working for them because of the amazing atmosphere everyone is always so joyful because of the various smells and warmth that the company brought. I would start my shift usually cleaning this job requires you to clean most of the time but the good thing about this was that the store was always kept clean. I really learned to be patient with customers in this store and how to communicate and understand the needs of the customer i also learned how to mulitask while having a conversation with the customer. Management was alright at times but when push comes to shove the kicked it into high gear. I had a great relationship with my co workers everything in this store is about staying on rhythm with each other making sure that the groove of movement was undisturbed working here really requires alot of teamwork. The hardest part of working here is its ability to shift from slow pace to high speed in a manor of minutes and also having to deal with extremely upset customers because they can get pretty mean with their words. Overall though even though it doesnt pay much it is a highly enjoyable job i really had alot of fun working here theres never a dull moment.
good,"The manager at my Starbucks store was very petty and immature, and thus created that culture for her shift managers. There was no one to go to in order to complain, because I feared some form of payback from my manager, even if that was her simply being more rude and making work more miserable."
good,"It's quite an experience to work at a Starbucks store for more than a year. To see the high rate of turnover and understand why is a frustrating thing. I enjoy the experience and environment enough to stay, but am beginning to imagine myself elsewhere."
good,"I was unfortunate and worked in an biased work environment because I was ""pro-choice"". I had managers that specifically took anger out on me, and my store manager was always late and always gone whenever he was supposed to be there. I had a very unfortunate experience whenever I arrived to work early to open, and my shift supervisor yelled at me in a very inappropriate and uncalled for tone because I left my work shoes in my car, even though I was early for my shift."
good,"Very fast-paced, but still fun. Must be reliable and work well in a team. The hardest part of the job is working drive through espresso bar, making all the drinks during peak hours. Get tips from a tip share every week. Hours are flexible especially for college students."
good,"tâches polyvalentes: "
good,Starbucks has come a long way from when I worked there. It's a great job while you are going to school as they offer to pay for schooling after so many years.
good,"I worked there for 7 years, and had 7 different managers in that time, every single one hired from outside the company, and most with unrelated experience."
good,"Pros:"
good,This was my first job while I was a senior in high school so I worked and reffered a lot of my friends but when the crew and management changed I did not like it as much.
good,"The plus is I still have a job, the negative is that I struggle check to check. I've worked for This company long enough to realize the bigger picture"
good,"In the mid 2000's Starbucks was a wonderful experience. In the last year though (2016), resurrecting has made non lateral promotion difficult, and they are more focused on maintaining a large number of part time workers instead of smaller sized teams of full time employees."
good,"learned to speak fluent ""starbuckanese"" "
good,"This job equires a lot of energy and the ability to multitask. Although the pay is low for the amount of work you do, my team makes it worthwhile and fun."
good,i had an incident where my manager very unprofessionally spread information that was sensitive and personal in nature around as gossip
good,"As a Shift Supervisor at Starbucks, it really teaches you about how to be a leader. You are leading the baristas throughout that day, motivating and coaching them to deliver the best service possible to your customers. It also teaches you how to remain calm in high volume periods. Furthermore, it helps develops your ability to be detail-oriented in regards to labor variances, inventory, and daily deposits. Overall, it is a great, well-rounded, starter job."
good,ilk kahveyle buluştum starbucksta  ve kültürel olarak değiştirdim kendimi
good,"Starbucks can be a fun, energetic work environment, but your options for growth are quite limited. There is mismanagement everywhere, and to get promoted is simply a matter of who sucks up the most to upper management. Half of your long-term employees are well paid, I am in the other half who are not, due to constant changes to the development schedule for employees. It can be a fun place to work for a while, but after a couple years it stops being fun and more of a chore. Unless you are desperate for the benefits (which are actually pretty good) I wouldn't suggest this job, ESPECIALLY if you have an actual passion for coffee. This is a corporation, first and foremost, they care little for your love of coffee and more about your ability to sell it."
good,"I loved working with coffee, making drinks, even doing the basic store cleaning and stocking. The company itself has a way of making you feel included- like in a family. You get the chance to transfer after a few months, making it great for job security, yet when I tried to transfer when I moved, I was told I had to wait 6 months plus as a shift. Later, when I tried to quit, I was told that I could step down and transfer immediately. I felt bullied into staying at that particular store, and I will explain why."
good,"The job was enjoyable. I stayed busy and had many tasks to complete. Worked early morning to early afternoon. Typical day consisted of starting work at 5 am, counting milk for the day, cleaning display case and filling with pastries, pulling the pastries for the following day, putting shipment away, inputting cash deposits into computer, dropping deposits at bank, counting change and going to bank if needed. Assisted manager in any other activities that needed to be done. Left work about 10am every day."
good,"I had a blast working with a great team, but I didn't feel appreciated by Starbucks corporation.  I am currently looking for a different job because the demanding work with so few people just isn't worth it. It's always better working mornings than closing. I honestly do love the regular customers and the environment, but every store I have worked at always feels like we need more people."
good,"the location I worked at was poorly managed. I was promised 15-30 hours weekly but regularly got fewer than 12. The job itself is fine, no real complaints."
good,I think started off at starting off at starbucks is definitely a way to learn how to work well and hard. but over the years it wears you out very much because the compensation of pay is not enough for the customers and the attitudes they develop. the over all job is pretty cool but the over tone of most management is that they just want to hire by word of mouth these days and some retards get hired in the process.
good,"- Learnt new skills and customer service"
good,"It was a great place to work , it was very diverse ,  open, management was okay they just expected one person to do the job of three and it got frustrating and irritating at times ."
good,"Some of the finest companies to work for with all the policies aligned properly and much in favor of employees."
good,"Was a fun, but hard job to work for. Management was very unorganized and did not get breaks on time. Would not recommend anyone to work at Starbucks."
good,"I learned SO MUCH from working working at Starbucks but I'm trying to leave as soon as possible because I don't like working with customers, I need to make more money and it's really hard to get promoted. You have to stand on your feet all day long and that's really difficult. I've developed plantar fasciitis because of it. We got a new manager a couple months ago and they are very controlling and won't give us enough hours. "
good,"My manager was new and I was younger at the time. She micromanaged our employees. It was a very unpleasant time. "
good,I obtained extensive knowledge for having an excellent work ethic. I am looking for full time work and unfortunately it is very difficult to get that at Starbucks.
good,"It is a fast paced place to work. But compensation is not so great. "
good,"Aprendi el trabajo en equipo, atencion al publico directamente , alegrar el dia de las personas"
good,"I've worked with some pretty cool folks and they taught me all I know about working at SBUX. The co-workers are friendly and the regular customers are always fun to talk with and it's great remembering their orders and having it for them. Not much pay for me, but it's such an easy job just clean and make drinks really. Some good benefits too. Good starter job if its your first time in the work force. If you have open availability as well."
good,"Learned a lot about coffee! the customers were loving and fun. the company it self was a great company to work for, I just out grew the job. Without being able to work 40 hours a week I was unable to provide for my family which I why I had to leave this great company."
good,"This is more of a specific store issue, but still. My boss was ALWAYS late, especially during morning shifts. He has been an hour late for morning shifts and we have had to sit out in the cold until he got there. Even on my second day, I tried to ask him a question and he would ignore me."
good,I've worked with people who are good at preparing hot beverages during busy hour to the customers with an on going service. I've learned a lot from them.
good,This job definitely wasn't for me because of the minimum hours they provided. Overall the expereince wasn't bad. Your supervisor will train you 1-2 week/s or more if needed depending on the individual. Coworkers were friendly and supportive to emotionally and with further teaching.
good,"Positive:"
good,"A typical day at would be opening up for the morning, that would include starting the teas, setting up the espresso machine, and putting together the pastry case. I learned many things working at Starbucks including better communication skills with guests, working very efficiently and quick to give the guest the best experience and a quick in and out trip, I learned many little things like new cleaning techniques and being prepared (restocking). I loved my management when I first started, she was very nice and she taught all of us very well and it was a fun work environment with lots of laughter, that also goes for the co-workers, we were the first employees at the new Starbucks so we all had to learn together and that made us all work together. The hardest part of the job was the constant line, it was very busy all the time and a lot of the time I would be working by myself I learned how to be faster and more efficient but it caused a lot of extra stress. The most enjoyable part of the job was the guests, I got to know so many people and they got to know me, I made many many friends that I still am in contact with."
good,"I ve joined Starbucks in 2012,It s a good company to work for."
good,"The benefits were fantastic, but the pay, management, and job culture was terrible. It was all men for themselves. It was fun making beverages, but even then they were not of the highest quality"
good,"Although Starbucks is a fantastic company to work for, working your way up the ladder can be challenging. The company sets a great culture which has been similar in every store I have worked at and I have always enjoyed the interaction with customers and co-workers. The greatest benefit is full benefits eligibility upon working an average of 20+ hours a week: a great benefit for college students or those looking for a ""fun"" job. Work as a Starbucks barista or shift supervisor can be highly stressful with queues of people inside the cafe or drive thru but once you get the hang of things the job becomes increasing more fun and easier to manage (although still highly intense)."
good,"I would say that overall Starbucks was a perfect place to work while one is studying. But when transitioning into an adult working life, it provides neither job security or piece of mind. Schedules are badly managed and hours aren't regular and it really is up to you to make up and find your own hours."
good,"Working in a highly demanding, fast paced environment with  a constant demand for attending to customers needs,and my number one priority is to ensure the customer has a speedy but amazing Starbucks customer experience.Co-workers are nice and there is usually a good sense of team work. The most enjoyable part of my job is making and learning new drinks."
good,"I work in Starbucks in the airport. Thisjob is definitely not what I thought I would be. Most of my coworker are pretty cool, everyone works well together. Most of the employees are late regularly or absent. We are often very short staffed. Depending on what manager is there and how many employees there are you might not get a break. Full-time employees (9 hour shift) only gets a 30 minute break."
good,"Great Staff! Sadly no other benifits- "
good,Starbucks is a company to work for. I do believe their employees deserve higher wages but the people I have worked with were amazing
good,"I really enjoyed my costumers they are great and still see some around and they have told me how much I am missed their.  I really enjoyed working with people and helping them any way I can. "
good,My co-workers were fun to be around. There wasn't good communication between the employees and the manager. The shift supervisors were good sometimes and others I avoided. I learned I could memorize many drinks at once. A typical day at work was fast-paced but fun.
good,"This company offered a steady college job with above average pay. The management lacked communication and planning skills, but coworkers were great. The hardest part of the job was working at Starbucks and maintaining poise while dealing with customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with."
good,"o pessoal era muito bom de se trabalhar,e a empresa ajudava muito tb"
good,"Estoy algo cansado de la monotonía del trabajo y del puesto que me encuentro ahorita, la verdad no me han dado la oportunidad de crecer mucho, cuando entre la verdad era una emoción muy grande para mi trabajar para esta empresa, sin embargo no duro mucho tiempo para comprender que la ética y moral de los administrativos, se basa en los trabajadores que ""les caen bien"" siendo esto un favoritismo a las personas que son hipócritas y lame-botas con los administrativos, la verdad eso es una cosa que no me gusta de aquí y no quiero rebajarme a lo que hacen los demás para conseguir el puesto, estoy fastidiado y eh entrado en una zona de confort que me cuesta mucho salir de ahí y la verdad la misma empresa no me da motivos para seguir creciendo con ella."
good,"at starbucks as a supervisor my main responsibilities were to make sure the shop is always ready for the customers (stocked up and clean and safe ) and that the shift is running smoothly ( right person on the right place and everybody taking their breaks etc.) and the cash handling is followed and secure"
good,Didn't feel welcomed nor apart of the team my two years at the company. Wasn't compensated for the work and the people you deal with on a daily basis. Didn't feel I was fairly treated but the benefits were the best thing about the company
good,this job is a wonderful job to have the team members are very helpful and they make you feel welcome. That's why I would recommend this job to anyone.
good,"lucky to work in a good store with nice people, don't rate starbucks as a company at all. looking forward to finding a new job. only reason I am still there is for the benefits you get and for the flexibility of the store."
good,"Starbucks Cypress location had some bad management. They lacked people and sometimes would abuse the new comers. For example, They would ask you to stay longer because the other barista suddenly didn't come in. New comers can't even say no because of being the newest and who needs to learn more. Although it was just the management that lacked with discipline. They didn't not fire those people who was slacking off nor acknowledge people who are doing good. Everyone who works there are good friends and the diversity isn't bad but I would say that if it wasn't for the lack of people then others would have good schedules. I love working in fast pace areas and I love how clean the store can be."
good,"Workload is overwhelming and training is vague and minimal. Store gets slammed and understaffed, stress causes tensions to run high."
good,Always trying to exceed the previous week's coffee sales goals. Fast paced work every day. Co-workers and managers do not know how to handle stress in a professional manner. The hardest part of this job is knowing how much I love working for the company yet the employees are making it difficult to maintain a professional and comfortable work environment. The most enjoyable part is being able to make a beverage to a customer's liking consistently.
good,"Often times stressful, but overall enjoyable work experience with an emphasis on team work. Significantly about the connection between Starbucks Partner and customer, as well as time management, ability to work with others, proper delegation of work tasks, and organizational skills. The flexibility of work hours would often be demanding, sometimes having 10 hour shifts, but is understandable from a food and retail store."
good,Fun co-workers but management can lack sometimes due to constant shifting of management. Good benefits but the lack scheduling makes work load more difficult. It really all depends on the location worked.
good,"I've been working for Starbucks for about (5) years in NYC (lower manhattan) and a typical day at starbucks day is very fast paced and high pressure. Once you begin with starbucks you're expected to learn bar (beverages, beverage routines, cleanliness etc), cash register, expectations, more cleanliness. I currently still work at Starbucks because there you can better your interpersonal skills, better your net work etc. But your work expereience at your starbucks depends on who your manager is. If he/she is disorganized, hurry up and get a transfer! Because Starbucks depends on manages that are dependable and accountable. Hardest part of the job is getting along with people at Starbucks that are not really committed to Starbucks ( its alot of hard work)."
good,A typical day working at Starbucks includes the oppurtunity to connect with all sorts of fun and unique customers as well as creating customized beverages for each individual. The management while working there was great. While working at Starbucks my co workers and I were like a small family. The only difficult part of the job was trying to make upwards of 10 plus espresso drinks with only two espresso machines in a timely manner.The most enjoyable part of the job for me was the oppurtunity to connect with the customers. I met so many awesome human beings at that place.
good,"great, fun company with great benefits and fun people. "
good,"Starbucks is a good first job, I feel this company has turned into a fast coffee industry meaning your more just a number to them they're less about quality & customer service as they once were but overall its not bad."
good,Starbucks as a company is a great company I have worked for a licensed branch of Starbucks before starting in Cookeville. The Cookeville store is very unique in a bad way. It was full of drama from the day I started until I left. Customers had warned me when I got hired and they were right.
good,Part time job I work when I'm off of my full time job. Everyone I work with is easy to get along with but management changes quite often as they are often changed around throughout the district so it is hard to get to know them. All other coworkers are excellent with good attitude toward business. Customers are regulars and often greet me by name.
good,"I was immediately given a supervisor position, which are almost handed out like candy within the company. However after talks of advancement realized that there is a plateua before advancement. This coupled with the fact that I would like to be on the expansion, development and real estate side of any business is why I am looking for a new position. Through being with Starbucks, I have learned just how much a smile and a thank you can really change a customers day. Unfortunately my direct manager was not someone who was easy to follow and did not keep with the company change in  retail employee roles which was the hardest thing about the job. The enviroment kept myself and my coworkers in a great mood through out the entire day."
good,"It truly depends where you are for what your experience will be with Starbucks.  Sadly for me, my region is very anti-men.  Rarely do they advance in my region.  One guy at my store became a shift, but only because of a lack of options during a time when a lot of people were leaving.  He later was asked to step down and was replaced by a girl with much less experience and much less ability.  We now have all girl shifts, girl manager, girl regional manager and a total of three guys in a store of around fifteen.  This is the typical standard for my region in the southern Portland area. "
good,"Its a fun, fast past job. It does get a little repetitive but overall its still pretty fun. The company gives you amazing benefits like health at 20 hours a week and tuition reimbursement even at part time."
good,Good management. Workers are very diverse and provide different strengths and weakness can be a problem. Very warming enviroment for customers. The job is extremely stressful at times due to the high demand of starbucks.
good,"A typical day at Starbucks entailed of a consistent customer flow of approximately 1000-1100 per day. I learned a lot about the process of running a business and having full overall ownership for all store operations. "
good,If you have a good team Starbucks is a great place to work. You build very close relationships with your coworkers and bond over ridiculous customers and being shorthanded. If you have a lousy team there is nothing positive about working here other than it pays better than McDonalds. Management is lousey and there is no room to advance beyond a supervisor position.
good,"Personal connections with the customers are the best part of the shift. I learned that customers come first and without them there wouldn't be the business. The management are cool and understanding; they make the place easy to work at. The co-workers make everything fun. The hardest part of the job is meeting every customer needs when it becomes really busy. The most enjoyable part of the job is just being there in the environment because the people, the environment, and the energy is so positive that I can call it a second home."
good,The hardest part of my job was dealing with angry customers. I cared for the co workers that were down to earth but overall I didn't care for most of my co workers. They were snotty and stuck up.
good,"I work at a licensed Starbucks store, so we are unable to do some things unlike corporate stores (like certain promotions, can't redeem free drink rewards, no Starbucks Partner number for discounts at other Starbucks). The store manager seems under-qualified for managing such a high-volume store. We are constantly out of syrups, sugars, powders, and occasionally cups. All employees worked entire shifts without breaks on multiple occasions, yet have 30 minute breaks taken out of our time card. The store manager rarely shows up for work. We are often under staffed. Sometimes you would be sent home early or in my case, the supervisor always ""forgets"" you were supposed to get off work hours ago. Not to mention the work ethics and procedures are questionable."
good,"As a Starbucks employee my jobs included cleaning all tables and equipment used on the job. As well as taking orders and using cash register to ring out costumers. My tasks were to help the costumers and keep the work environment clean and stocked. I cleaned bathrooms and stock room. "
good,"Starbucks is a fantastic company to work for, but the day to day operations is stressful. Internal promotion in the company is much harder than getting hired as an outside hire manager. I learned how to lead courageously, and I also learned so much about coffee culture. My co-workers are wonderful, but the hardest part of the job is keeping everyone's morale and spirits uplifted. The most enjoyable part of this job is definitely the benefits and the flexible schedule. it is ideal for the part-time barista who needs health insurance."
good,"Work can be stressful depending on the store location."
good,This company is a good company to work for. Although this company can be great to work for or it can be really bad to work for. it just depends on who you are working with.
good,"Not pay well but have great employee discount and good break time,"
good,"The environment was fun, sometimes hectic, but I enjoy that kind of atmosphere."
good,"Great work place, Ok pay and great manager at the time I was there."
good,best part of my job were my customers! loved the connections and relationships i developed. ended up making new friends behind and in front of the work line.
good,"Maybe it was the coworkers I had and maybe the customers. I'm not too cocky to think that it could've been me.  However, this place was not for me. I wasn't a big coffee fan when I worked there so the benefits of a free pound of coffee week didn't appeal to me. I took the job so that I could have money since I had just moved to a new area."
good,"weiterbildung möglich"
good,At the beginning of my job i was told to clean the tables and wash dishes. I was then promoted to making drinks and i was able to learn it fast. My management was not that good as they made me work overtime and did not pay me. My co-workers were very friendly and i was able to get a long with them very well. The hardest part of my job when it was the free drinks period and there were very less employees. But i was able to handle it well. Enjoyable part was making the drinks and able to personalize it myself.
good,"- Enjoyed coming into a positive, busy atmosphere"
good,"Starbucks was a very flexible job that would work with my school time to allow me to get things done when needed. A typical day of work consisted of normal barista duties such as heating food and creating drinks, Starbucks  management hired many college students during the time period that i have worked for the company and allowed everyone an equal opportunity to advance it was also quite easy to relate to many of my co workers that had the same problems and life issues as i have had with school and dailty life which made it a fun work environment. The hardest part of the job was trying to not become addicted to coffee because it was there in abundance of taste testing and drinking it on breaks. The most enjoyable part of the job was making new ideas for drinks for customers"
good,"great customers"
good,"I would sign in say hello to my coworkers, ask my manager what job I would be performing for the day and get on it."
good,Working at Starbucks is fast paced and extremely stressful.  Just when it seems you have a good system in place new initiatives come from corporate that gunk everything up.  I enjoy Starbucks but the stress and alternating shifts constantly is catching up with me.  I have met some of the greatest people I know working at Starbucks.
good,"I was fortunate to be in a store with great co-workers and a great manager, however the expectations and workload for the amount of money (minimum wage) was ridiculous. Typically the floor is run with one supervisor and two Baristas (ideally). Opening means you're at work at 5am and typically work until 1:30pm. Closes start at 2pm and end at 10:30pm. At 7am the morning rush starts and hopefully you have three people working, it will last 1 to 2 hours ending around 8:30-9am If you work at a busier store it never really ends. Following the morning rush you have the lunch rush, which is really based on your proximity to a high school (we had two). Finally there is the evening rush which is usually after dinner and if you work at a ""slow store"" your probably gonna see very few customers coming in after 7:30pm."
good,you are responsible for remember several regular customers names and beverage orders while serving hundreds of other customers every day. Opening here means being awake as early as 3:30 am depending on location and where you live. It is overall a positive learning experience with a very intense atmosphere.
good,"A typical day at work involves arriving in the morning and having 30 minutes to get the store set up to open.  The expectation is to be open 10 minutes before posted time and stay open 10 minutes after posted closing time.  Mornings are busy with customers on their way into work. There is something to be learned every day, whether it's a new policy or getting to know a new customer. Store managers are told to run their stores as if it's their own business, however, district managers visit on a weekly basis to coach and provide guidance. Store managers in each district work to help each other out with daily issues whenever possible. The most difficult part of the store managers position is staffing.  It is difficult to find time off the floor to conduct interviews and do hiring/training.  Work/life ratio for a store manager is also a stressful issue as managers are required to work as many hours as needed for their store's successful operation.  If coverage cannot be found for a partner calling in sick, or not showing up, the store manager is required to come in to cover the shift.  You are told not to log the extra hours in the computer and only get paid for 40 hours.  No time off in lieu is given for extra time worked. The most enjoyable part of the position is the partners you get to work with, and the customers you get to know."
good,"An average day at Starbucks via the Xchange is busy, busy, BUSY. I loved to fast-paced morning rush and the smiling (and sometimes not so smiling) faces that came through to get the caffeinated beverage. I learned an abundance of patience working at this particular place. I was the youngest on staff, the next youngest being ten years older than me. So people considered me a ""breath of fresh air"" because I was young, energetic, and was just happy to work! The hardest part of the job was keeping up with all of the new drink recipes and names, for so many was added throughout the season I was hired, The most enjoyable part was getting to know my customers personally and making them smile."
good,With the proper management and right people work this job is very fun and I enjoyed it very much.
good,"Typically a fun time working with most customers and baristas, and enjoyed the flexibility offered during the school year. Unfortunately, dealt with some deeply condescending attitudes from some of my managers, and felt the attitude trickle down to shift leads. The hardest part was working hard there for 6 years and being treated so poorly. Emotionally trying, especially for a company that supposedly promotes respect among partners. "
good,The missions statement says To nurture and inspire the human spirit.  Maybe someday they'll actually understand what that actually means.
good,Working as a cashier and a food server.  While working at Starbucks I learned how a cup of beverage makes someones day.
good,"Fast paced, customer oriented store. I learned a lot, and I want to apply that to another company"
good,Starbucks is one of place where you can explore specially if you are fresher.
good,Starbucks is a multimillion dollar company and should be able to pay their partners more then they do.
good,"Good experiences, met interesting people. Learned how to balance school and work. I loved co-workers and management. Free food Items,"
good,"Great way to meet people."
good,"Used to be in the people business serving coffee, now its just the people business serving people. Management likes to load up your plate with plenty to do but with no time to do it. Coffee is only a small part of the pie these days. Refreshers, smoothies, cola, lunch and breakfast sandwiches."
good,"I worked the early shift which was 5:30am to 10:30am. Between the hours of 8am and 10am were the busiest. Sometimes we even had a line out the door. I learned that the customer is always right and speed and accuracy is your best friend working at a place like this. The management was ok, could've been better in my opinion. The hardest part of the job was taking orders from the person on the walkie talkie and making sure it was the correct markings on the cups. The most enjoyable part of the job was even though it was busy during those times, we always made it fun and easy to work. Everyone helped everyone."
good,"my typical day in work is doing my best for a customers and make them happy, I try my best for make the best quality coffee and always be happy and smiling. "
good,It was a nice atmosphere however I was not sufficiently trained and much was expected under a lot of pressure
good,"A typical day at Starbucks consisted of me handcrafting drinks, and ensuring the steady flow of shifts/shift transitions. I learned to assume a leadership role daily despite it not being a part of my job description. My relationship with my coworkers was more than amicable; however, the most challenging part of my employment revolved around their inability to carry their weight. The most enjoyable part of the job was the interactions I had with my customers everyday. Overall, I enjoyed my employment with Starbucks, but I should have been paid more for the work I did and the time I invested."
good,"Principalmente el ambiente de trabajo es bastante bueno, ya que desde un inicio es el objetivo de la empresa, asi tambien poder compartir muchas experiencias de clientes hasta compañeros de trabajo mientras uno explica el producto en si, que es el cafe, mis dias tipicos fueron hacer full promociones a las empresas del Mall para poder realizar alianzas con ellos, la direccion directamemnte me enseño un monton ya que era la primera vea que tenia a mi cargo un grupo de trabajo y lo que mas me gusto es haber vis.to como realmente es que se constituye una empresa."
good,"good co-workers nice people, hardest part is keeping everyone happy, normal customers."
good,"- friendly culture"
good,"I worked for Starbucks for about three years and in three different stores in Chicago, IL.  I worked almost exclusively full-time downtown while attending college, and worked my way up from Barista to Shift Supervisor.  "
good,"I will come in to work and find out what position to work. It could range from being on the font register , drive thru or store support which consist of washing dishes, taking trash out and making sure the store is clean."
good,"Until the economic crisis that hit a few years ago, this company was very nice to work for.  The benefits are still very good for part time workers.  Depending on your district, some of the DM's are great, but for the most part, Starbucks hires the worst District Managers."
good,There was always a lot to do and never enough time to do it in. Often asked to work extra hours beyond the normal schedule. Overall it was a fun place to work and had some great moments. Not ideal for someone like me looking for a career path rather than just a job.
good,"I used to work in fully busy outlets."
good,"not the greatest hours but the people where cool, no awareness for safety"
good,"it's a great job to have while you are in school"
good,"If you love coffee, or would like to learn more about it, you cant go wrong working here."
good,"I had a great experience with Starbucks I learned a lot."
good,This is a fast paced job that involves tons of interaction with customers.
good,"Durante minha passagem na Starbucks, tive muitos desafios e conquistas. Os desafios foram conquistados um a um, em conjunto a uma equipe, que pude contratar e treinar, maravilhosa. "
good,Being a barista for a Starbucks that was managed by Target was interesting. We had two different sets of rules to abide by as well as thorough inspections for a clean service. We all worked together to do our best to succeed. There was a lot of training involved and a lot of job movement.
good,"Starbucks gave me opportunities to develop myself both personally and professionally.  I was able to work for and earn a tremendous amount of opportunity hear that I will always be appreciative of.  All management I worked for had no experience as store managers.  I believe that everyone who hasn't worked as a store manager since the ""operational efficiency improvements"" that came in response to the 2008 stock market crisis, should have a re-immersion and work as a store manager for a period to better understand today's operational complexities."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks involves chatting with a lot of customers, taking, and making their orders. It also involves cleaning, and constantly maintaining the display sections. I learned good customer service, and acquired a vast knowledge of the Starbucks menu, and the different featured coffees. The management is typical. You will get commended when your work is outsanding, and get bogged down when you make one mistake. My co-workers were generally nice, but sometimes nagging. The hardest part of the job is maintaining good customer service during high volume customer rushes. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with nice customers."
good,This is a good entry level position I'd recommend for anyone looking to go to school.
good,"service et caisse"
good,"A typical day at  starbucks for me was too assign register  take peoples drink orders  foods orders ring them up You always gut smile and say thank you be nice no matter how mean they are and get they what I learned  too have good listen skills customer service skills one of the most hardest part  keep smile on face sometimes the customer can be really rude sometimes and just got keep on smiling. my co workers were great good communications., good atttitudes. the most enjoyable part  of the job was making customer happy leaving with smile on there face"
good,Dealing with the horrible customers and management makes you quit after the first week. You better hope your co-workers are easy to work with.
good,"The Shift Manager typically supports the manager of a store with low sales volume and routine operations, and is responsible for day-to-day supervising of non-management associates, assigning specified work to non-management associates, focusing on store level operation performance, coaching and developing Shift Supervisors and other non-management associates and performing all other responsibilities as directed by the business or assigned Management of which associate is capable of performing. This is a non-exempt position and typically reports to the Store Manager, depending on local requirements."
good,"Preparing to serve our customers to the highest standards, and making sure they left our facilities 100% pleased.  Whether I worked on drive thru, register, or the line.  I learned to make a plethora of different coffee beverages, and to always be punctual.  My co-workers were helpful, and the management was as well.  The most enjoyable part to the job, was the experience I took away from it.  I learned a lot pertaining to coffee."
good,"My typical day at work consists of making drinks and serving them to our guests. I am also required to do scheduled weekly and monthly cleanings. "
good,"management was rough, promotions were not easy to obtain, small pay."
good,"high pace work environment with great people. cleaning, helping customers, speed of service and sales are huge."
good,"i really did enjoy working for the company, the management slacked with scheduling which was frustrating and there was a lot of unnecessary drama in the work place."
good,"As a student, it's a great way to start working. The job is fun but as any gastronomical job it's quiet difficult in terms of flexibility. "
good,A typical day at work would be very busy from my peers coming from class or just socializing in the game room which was adjacent to Starbucks. I'm very familar with working under big crowds and a fast enviornment so no matter how many people would come to purchase coffee I'd always keep composure and get the job done. 
good,Starbucks offers good trainings for Supervisors/ Managers
good,"set up bakery display. put out sandwich/lunch offerings. brew coffee, prepare espresso and tea beverages"
good,"it was a great place to work for, but there is always that one store that the manager simply dislikes an employee"
good,"Was a great place to work most of the time. Lot's of fun, laughs and smiles. Lot's of interaction with the public, and most of the team were incredible to work with."
good,Benefits were great and job was fun. Raises and tips were poor and the corporate rules were ridiculously unrealistic and stressful. Would not work here again or recommend it.
good,I loved my customers and that the store was a team. Such a great environment to work in.
good,"Starbuck was a great place to meet new people and connect with people that love the smell, taste, or culture of coffee. While I worked here I learned the different types of grinds, tastes, smells, and roast of great coffee. Management was hard to find, with a busy schedule and long days in the 20 months of my employment I had went through 5 managers. My co-workers were always supportive and help with making a day productive and interesting to help the time fly."
good,Busy store in downtown Santa Rosa. A wide range of customers; including the many homeless that come in to get a free water and use the restroom.
good,This is a very flexible job to have through school. The management will make or break the individual stores.
good,Opened or Closed store unless schedule in middle of the day.
good,"Lots of cleaning, drink making, cash handling. First food service job."
good,"Typical day-placed in deployment (making drinks, drive-thru, DTO,etc.) by shift supervisor. Provide cheerful and friendly service to customers."
good,"Prepared coffee and tea drinks for many customers. My co workers were awesome, we all worked together well. The hardest part of the job was that the manager did not help us out even if we were extremly busy and running out of things. He just stayed in the back on his kindle."
good,always busy day
good,"Working at Starbucks is a hit or miss depending on where you work, who you work with, and what types of customers you get. Some days are ok and others can be nightmares. I wouldn't suggest anyone working for the company for more than 5 years unless if you really love the company and are looking to move up the corporate ladder in some way."
good,"The job is ok, however there is minimal potential to move up in certain districts."
good,"When I was with Starbucks, it went from being one of the best hospitality employers to the exact opposite."
good,Busy is a typical day at work. I have learned how to be diplomatic. Management is ok. Very few Co-workers are good to be around. Hardest part of the job is standing on feet allday. T he most enjoyable is making and serving drinks to customers.
good,clock on start taking orders and making orders working cash register giving great customer service after closing the store wash and clean everything and set it up for the next day
good,"Let me lead off with saying that even after being gone for a year from Starbucks and moving 2,500 miles away I still find comfort in my local Starbucks and I have every reason to believe that that will never change. If you have a passion for coffee it is hard not to gravitate towards a company you recognize as quality and a reassurance that if you can find it on the GPS you can find a little slice of piece of mind."
good,"free pound of coffee a week (or comparable product) - free drinks for yourself while you are on shift - 30% off merchandise, food and drinks when you are not on shift (plus special shopping days throughout the year with additional percentages off)"
good,"Moving form another country and getting first job on the American market was a great opportunity. In 2006, when I first was hired at Starbucks, I felt very privileged to work for the company. Unfortunately, in the recent years, while working in Sacramento, I am starting to conclude that company's values and appreciation for its working partners might be slowly declining. Recently, typical schedule requires you to work over 30 hours a week, really hard to take days off, and depending on the upper management might have no holidays off. I feel that respect for the working partner is declining, while demands are increasing. I have always loved food service, coffee and being able to provide great customer service. Through years I perfected my skills of multitasking and ability to deliver excellent service with quality product. In my opinion, the hardest part of the job is to find right dynamics with upper management."
good,I am not getting the hours I need so I'm not enjoying my time there. Also the Safeway till that I am using is very confusing since I do not have enough shifts to figure out the system.
good,When your a trained barista you can easily become a bartender ar a rest or a nite club and attend barista tournaments; some of the employees i worked with gave me hardship and managers didnt want to see me get ahead by not transfering me to another store.
good,"Starbucks has been a great learning experience for me. I love my employees, they are by far the bast part of my position. The management has varied. Some have been horrible, they had no customer experience, and felt thing were unorganized and stressful. In the location im at now we are a very high volume store and as friendly as we are the troubles of being short handed can be tiring but manageable. I love my job but there comes a time when we need to move on from our comfort zone, and make moves for a career. From day to day i make coffee, adhere to customer needs, manage labor, and clean. Ive learned to keep a calm exterior, but still keeping a sense of urgency. Ive learned to always create and environment then enriches the daily lives of each and every one of my customers."
good,the partners are fun to work with
good,"fun making new drinks, and they are really great in working with your schedule, and usually everyday was pretty steady, the hardest thing was just keeping up during rush hour but after a while you get use to the pace"
good,As a barista at Starbucks you feel intimidated by the job when training but after you learn the drinks it becomes easy and mundane. Pay is not enough if you work at a high volume store to
good,"Great job to have while getting through college."
good,"Starbucks is a great opportunity. They offer many benefits that are important. The work is systematic and the culture is thriving. There are opportunities to grow with the company depending on the work you put in, so best to take advantage."
good,Each day can be different and  it is best to be prepared for a busy day. There really hasn't been a day that we were running around like crazy. Depends are on the store for what the managers are like. Some can be very good and willing to listen and be a manager.
good,"They expect quite a bit from you from barely above minimum wage and I've never worked in a more corporate environment than when at Starbucks. Pretty much the words ""food growth, customer connect scores, and numbers"" are all you'll hear about on a daily basis. "
good,Working in a kiosk for the grocery store was more responsibilities than a normal starbucks employees for a smaller paycheck. Grocery store benefits instead of starbucks benefits.
good,"Fun interacting with customers, easy to get used to. Lot of coffee knowledge, etc. Most enjoyable part of the job is good relationships with coworkers and making customers' days. MANAGEMENT IS SUPER ANNOYING in downtown district. Beware."
good,"A typical day at work was always unpredictable and chaotic. Most days, the management had difficulty with creating an efficient and effective work play. With a fast-paced environment, management failed to encourage and support baristas in their individual roles. The company itself has high expectations for its employees."
good,"Unusually great benefits for a part-time position. Including 401K matching, healthcare, life insurance, and Employee Stock purchase plan.  Low hourly pay."
good,"-hours weekly can be extremely inconsistent, so you never know what you are getting paid unless you are a shift lead or higher. "
good,"What I learned about management was that it wasn't stable, there was a lot of managers. The employees never stayed for a long time. On a good day, everyone was happy."
good,A fast paced work environment that requires you to memorize drink options. You need to be able to communicate and work with other people. But it is a great job.
good,A lot is put on your shoulders and a lot is expected of employees with not much recognition afterwards. The best part of any store I've worked at is the other employees I had a chance to work with.
good,Good coworkers most of the time. It is a lot of work but flexible hours. management can be strict but most people working there are very supportive and caring.
good,"It was great some days, other days you honestly just wanted to quit. Customers were incredibly rude but some really did make your day better. I did overall enjoy myself. Not a place for the faint of heart, you learn how to work under immense pressure."
good,"I would say that Starbucks overall is a great college job to have. There are very flexible work hours (depending on location), exceptional Part-time benefits (vision, dental, health, tuition reimbursement at ASU, PTO, free coffee and more), and a casual work environment. Promotion within the company is a nice and simple process, that is another plus. However, that is about it as far as the pros go. The management again depends on location, but the higher the management, the less trusting and dependable they are. Customers are a priority; standards, safety, and the wellbeing of employees are put way last. The pay is simply not enough for the amount of work you will be asked to do. It is a fast paced work environment, yet staffing is very little due to labor cuts made by corporate every few months, so your body will be put through a lot of physical labor. Early onset carpel tunnel, back pain and tendonitis is fairly common among employees. This job was enough to get through school and to get a degree that would help kick start and advance afterwards, and that is about it. You would have to have very thick skin, as customers are not so very nice when something goes wrong, so be prepared for that. If you have thick skin, want to get a job with flexible hours and nice benefits, and aren't bothered by physical activity and incredibly low staffing, this is a perfect job for you."
good,"It was nice working at Starbucks but the schedule was very hard. Nice culture, environment and nice co-workers. Friendly supervisor and management. Everyone is ready to help you when you’re new at work"
good,"Starbucks was a great first job for me. When coming into work, it depends where my shift lead puts me because we would have workers already in their stations. I tend to create a good vibe when I come into work and I put a smile on everyone's faces. Which makes work little more fun."
good,Starbucks i would describe as a very high paced high volume work environment due to everyone loving starbucks. Working mornings we would see about 300 in an hour.
good,"It's very hard to get full time hours if you are not a shift leader or manager. The health insurance isn't bad. And the weekly tips, depending on the area the Starbucks is located in, is nice grocery money. It's also kinda nice getting free coffee. But the pay isn't that great because you'll get part time hours."
good,"There were some good benefits for both part-time and full-time employees. The training could have been a little more extensive, but overall, it was good enough to get the basics down."
good,"It is a good company, but I was not trained enough. Everyone there was nice, and kind. We had good customer service, everyone that came in and out had smiles on there faces"
good,"I've had some of the best times working in Starbucks and some of the worst."
good,"There is no more entitled customer than the Starbucks customer who is late for work.  If you work here, prepare to be yelled at for things outside of your control, to never have all the ingredients you need in stock, and to feel like a cog in a corporate machine designed to wear you down.  You get a ton of free coffee and they pay pretty well in Galesburg though.  So apply at your own risk, I guess."
good,Starbucks is an inclusive environment that is open to all backgrounds.  The growth opportunity is somewhat complicated based in a system of networking.
good,"It really has its good days, but sadly, more with the bad."
good,"Decent place to work, lots of free starbucks items.  Feels like company cares about employees.  Decent pay and benefits.  Management sometimes waste your time and theirs with pointless tasks."
good,the store is poorly managed and run by immature and dishonest management.  people often do what they want and when things do not go the way they want they blame you for their actions.
good,It is a very stressful job and you always have a million things to do. Management can be amazing or difficult. I like most of the work we do however it can a lot if your coworkers do not help you. Certain positions are a lot easier and less stressful than others.
good,"My colleagues were actually really nice, thats what made it better. You have a lot of standards to meet at starbucks and its a lot of work just to get the minimum wage at the end of the month."
good,the work was busy making the day go by faster but often felt under staffed on promotion days causing the store to be behind and under stocked and not operate as smoothly as possible.
good,"Excellent managers , work after high school they helped me out for my future and they prepare me with good customer service and with the life out there"
good,"A typical day at work is pretty stressful for me, and it doesn’t feel like a calm cafe for people to hang out in. It feels like a fast food place where everyone is impatient and the baristas are struggling to get drinks out for 8 hours a day. I love being a barista and crafting beverages but the workplace I’m in doesn’t allow me to enjoy it to the fullest. The ideas and principles Starbucks tries to uphold are great, but sometimes we fail to actually carry them out during work. The management at my store leaves much to be desired, and I don’t feel as if my store manager has my back if I’m struggling with something ."
good,The store could use better management services and more partner development to help with the store. All partners should be able to communicate with the management without being scared of something taken wrong.
good,Great job but depending on who is scheduled there may be a clash of childlike behavior. Being a supervisors helps because I can defuse these types of situations but the customers could be left with a bad impression when given a bad attitude by childlike baristas. I love being a supervisor though with a great team
good,overall my experience was great besides a coworker who was racist and a manager who didn’t seem to care ab her even after multiple complaints from employees and even customers. :)
good,"There are a ton of companies out in the world,but most of them will not help you pay for school. This company does and allows  one to tailor their schedule around what they please."
good,"Ambiente laboral estresante y cansador, pero buena convivencia de equipo."
good,"Working at the Target isnt the same as working at the real Starbuck's because they do not allow tip, benefits are different as well as training and other common issues. You are a target employee."
good,"Μια εταιρεία με εξαιρετική φιλοσοφία, ποιότητα προϊόντων και συνεχής μάθηση και εκπαίδευση, που ομως καταστρέφεται από το ελληνικής νοοτροπίας management."
good,"reliable company, but stressful shifts and lots of corporate pressure. The workplace culture is generally fraught with frustration, and there is little attention paid to mental health. However, they pay on time and do try to foster safe spaces."
good,"This was a fun place to work however a little clicky. "
good,"It is not a difficult job if you like the food industry, if not... it is not enjoyable. I have heard from other coworkers that they love it and they have a great time working there. For me personally it just wasn't the right fit."
good,Everyone at Starbucks always helped each other. We would teach and learn from each other. We became a family. I still have really good friends from Starbucks even though I no longer work there.
good,I learned how to pay attention to detail and work at a fast pace with a smile! Starbucks values include high customer satisfaction ratings with consistency of selling quality products.
good,Starbucks is a great company they sure do care about their employees. However sometimes it doesnt feel like it. I often view starbucks as a fake friend.
good,"They will cut everyone's hours without notifying anyone. Management will literally do anything behind your back without speaking on it and expect other employees to tell you and lastly some of the managers try to have a dry humor but trust em, It is not them."
good,"The job is easy and overall a very fun place to work at, many areas can be greatly improved. An overall 4 out of 10. The hardest part would be remembering all of the different responsibilities and duties each shift needs to have completed. The store management is not very uplifting or motivating to employees which can be improved."
good,"Starbucks is an overall good workplace, the hours are not the best and authority plays a big role at Starbucks. Depending on which location you're placed in, the manager plays a big part in whether the store will be a good environment or not"
good,"Absolutely love Starbucks as a company , management in my opinion in needs to be fixed. A lot of personal issues brought in by management, however the job itself was amazing and very enjoyable."
good,"Starbucks isn’t a bad company to work for , it’s a lot of memorization with guest and also there drinks and the drink menu. Just have patience and deal with every guest the same , you will learn as you go along"
good,"Very fast-paced work with a lot of self-sufficiency and self-starting required to keep the pace moving. In drive-thru settings, positions are often planted with each partner doing their part in their place as briskly and efficiently as possible. In a cafe-only setting, many tasks are left to two people to keep the flow going creating the fast pace in following the mental task list."
good,"While I was working here although it was for a short period of time. I learned some Costumer Service, as well as improving on my Communication Skills."
good,"不能否認的是員工的福利和其他的公司比較是不錯,工作環境亦不錯,但有些管理層的工作能力真的令人思考如何可以勝任此職位"
good,"It’s a good job for high school grads and college students, provides you with people skills that will be valuable further down the road, it has good benefits, and they do take care of their workers"
good,Developed a rash that to this day won't go away due to harsh chemicals that is used to clean the whole store. It sucked working there but also had lots of fun. Recommend for younger people.
good,"great staff, very friendly and clean culture. very productive. you just have to be precised, especially working in the morning customers are very unpaitent."
good,It’s a good job to start of with but it’s only for temporary after that you are gonna want to move on and find a different job the most suits you and one that you enjoy
good,"Working at Starbucks affords one the opportunity to grow and learn in their position, which could lead to advancement. I learned a lot working at Starbucks. I am able to apply all that I learned in my current position. However, with a focus on drive-thru times, some of the coffee culture has been lost."
good,"This is a fast-passed job that can prepare anyone for handling stress, providing quality customer service, and multi-tasking. Management varies between locations. Advancement was more difficult than advertised."
good,"My time at Starbucks was quite a mixed bag. While I enjoyed my work and coworkers, the lack of competent management and high turnover was a dealbreak."
good,great place to work great atmosphere managers and employees were very nice and worked together would recommend this place to anyone seeking employment
good,My experience was not the best. It would include me not feeling comfortable at the location I was at. I didn’t get paid enough to get treated the way I did.
good,"Honestly, the management (at least in my experience) usually don't do much and leave you to your own devices and are willing to help but usually not much more than a short explanation."
good,"Overall, it was pretty fun, but it is pretty stressful depending on how busy the environment and if you have fun people to work with. Sometimes a really toxic person can destroy the environment for you."
good,As a company Starbucks is great to work for. I believe the issue for me was the store that I worked for. It’s not the fault of the employees or the current management. There was a previous issue that caused the store to not run at it’s full potential. The store was severely understaffed which made things difficult. Most of the employees worked very long shifts to overcompensate which proved to be very stressful. It was very difficult to find coverage in the case of emergencies.
good,It’s a nice company for college or fresh out of high school students. My opinion though. Good company and great associates in most cases. Overall it’s a fun environment and if you are a people person you would love it.
good,After the creative studio was dismantled it became a different place. Camaraderie was gone and it was everyone for themselves. The people who are left are not happy.
good,"Its just a part time job for the short term. I suggest if you qualify for the benefits, apply and use it. It really depends on the store but for me it is just a place to work"
good,"It was okay. I enjoyed the people and the work but the higher management was hard to work with sometimes.  A lot of situations were out of their control, but I wish they did better at helping us."
good,A typical day at starbucks would consist of me coming in and mainly just cleaning the bar area. The job was very slow and I mainly worked by myself. The most enjoyable part of the job was making the drinks.
good,"Depending on location, Starbucks can get pretty busy. This job has definitely helped me learn to multitask and taught me how to work well under pressure."
good,"Most of working at Starbucks includes dealing with grumpy customers at their before-coffee worst. Interactions with consumers aren't typically as pleasant as you'd expect to be. Tips aren't great, as we split them up between all employers. On the bright side, hours are flexible and you do accumulate paid vacation time after a year. Free drinks during your shift are nice, but there are many strict rules surrounding those policies."
good,"Nette Kollegen, guter Arbeitgeber, zu wenig Gehalt"
good,"Expect the world from staff not compensated enough for what we deal with. Emotionally and mentally exhausting being so ‘on’ for customers, especially on their bad days. We used to get raises twice yearly, not anymore. Turn over high, pay your teams their value."
good,"Workplace is okay, i would not recommend this job to people who are looking for a career because there is barely any movement up the ranks. Barely any room for improving"
good,"If you want a long term job that will help you pay your way through college and those tough times, this isn't the place for you. Starbucks prioritize the customer service and the store profits over your physical and mental health."
good,"Great benefits, opportunity for periodic pay raise. Coworkers make the job more tolerable because customers can be just as horrible as all the story suggest and management more often than not has to 'take their side' to appease them."
good,"Starbucks allows you to set up your life outside of work with a massive degree of flexibility by allowing you to decide how many hours and on which days you want to work. However, you can't do much with the paycheck, and you are all-but-prohibited from working more than 40 hours if you need some extra cash."
good,"Fast paced and fun environment.                        "
good,Enjoyed working there while I was in college. It was great benefits to have coffee when ever I needed. Management could be better and it is stressful.
good,"Good: diversity and friendly - workplace culture"
good,"I had a good experience at my specific location. My manager worked with partners on scheduling, moving around shifts and simply life complications. I also really enjoyed my coworkers. The benefits are great."
good,"If you apply be prepared to learn a large amount of information. Even if you are not at drive thru, all team members must wear a headset. There is no free food. Floors must be mopped twice a day. It's a lot if you are already a student."
good,"It was an excellent experience to work at, meet a lot of nice people."
good,"The job itself is pretty good, it can just become a high stress job depending on the season and what type of coworkers you're working with. Overall, not a bad place to work at if you're a high schooler or college student."
good,I would really rather not don't find a need for this
good,"Starbucks offers a dynamic culture that uniquely balances aggressive business goals with a focus on people and their development. The company lives its mission and values and has stayed true to the modern day founder's vision, to redefine the role of a public company."
good,"Positives: Diversity and inclusion groups within the workday as well as outside of working hours. Immersions and coffee connects across the company are highly encouraged. Lots of lunch and learns, training opportunities and ways to self improve. 5 month paid maternity leave w/ high cost daycare attached to corporate building. Full service gym with free personal trainers and classes."
good,"Working at Starbucks, although ""easy work"", was a waste of precious time due to mis-advertised benefits, not being what they seem. Starbucks does not initially inform employees of their tuition reimbursement limitations nor do they encourage you to ""read between the lines"" thus camouflaging actual benefits."
good,"a typical day was just making sure u made every customer satisfied , and I learned a lot about coffee. the hardest part of the job was making drinks and taking orders alone."
good,"I love coffee, but working in distribution showed me the business culture, where most workers have been there 5 years and I only 3 months. The environment is strict but you can approach the managers both as individuals and experts that they are. The wages are enough to support yourself and a spouse if you never get a rase."
good,"Any time we get new products at starbucks, starbucks encourages trying everything new so we can best recommend products to our customers. it helps connect us with customers"
good,"Good job if your struggling, at the same time- it’s more demanding than you’d expect. That being said, there’s definitely room for growth within your district."
good,"Your manager makes or breaks your experience. I had 3 different managers, and 3 very different experiences. Supportive manager creates a supportive team. While a manager who picks favourites instills tension between coworkers leading to a hostile work environment in an already stressful job."
good,Worked for Starbucks before a lot of policy changes. Now you are allowed to have tattoos and piercings and wear what you want. You also get a free meal on shift now and they help pay for college.
good,"Working in my current starbucks is enjoyable mostly for the company of those whom I work with. I multiple times showed interest in advancing in the company and every time I did I felt that my higher ups just ignored my advances.However, very flexible hours. Very good for students, but not for someone trying to support themselves and pay their bills."
good,It's fine for the interim. They pretend to care about their staff. Benefits are good. Flexible schedule. Kinda purposeless and I do not feel fufilled.
good,"This was a great first job experience for me! I was able to enjoy coffee discounts and free units per week which saved me some money. However I worked harder than most and felt like the entire weight of the store was on my shoulders. "
good,"Starbucks offers financial help for education, competitive pay, and a flexible schedule. During my time there, I made connections with both coworkers and regular customers."
good,I loved connecting and seeing my everyday customers . I loved that the most . But I wasn’t appreciated for all the hard work I did . Always gave 110% . Hated how sometimes it felt like I didn’t belong because of the racism situations that were going on and it was true I felt like I didn’t always fit in . Other partners or employees would look at me weird I stopped going to the meet ups . But I did meet some pretty cool people and I really miss my customers the most .
good,"I get there, I stress about being understaffed and having to complete tasks so that we can get out on time. In between all that, I take care of customer's needs."
good,Great support team just need a better job and career. They support each other well but a lot comes with the job and it can get overwhelming and tiring
good,Starbucks is a fast paced and fairly stressful environment. The pay is very benefits heavy so if your someone on your parents insurance or aren't able to take advantage of the free schooling then it probably isn't worth it.
good,It was alright. I usually closed and then they switched me to open. It get really stressful and hectic with only 2 or 3 people opening and getting busy right off the bat. They normally didn't have anyone else come in till 6 so for an hour while still trying to open and take care of everyone was a bit crazy.
good,"It's a good part-time job. If you're in school or if you're working full-time somewhere else. My manager was very flexible with my schedule, so going to school wasn't as stressful"
good,"Starbucks is a friendly environment, but the hours for part time are exactly like full time. Your barely get any days off. After work you feel rushed and it takes awhile to come off of that feeling."
good,This is a good stepping stone for those starting out. It is a good place to gain experience in dealing with conflict situations and taking that to the next position.
good,"working at Starbucks taught me many things, but first and foremost is that people are awful without their caffeine. I learned so much about handling difficult situations and people. Ultimately, i would say that it was the most educational job i had in terms of time management, delegation, and learning how to rise and grind."
good,"Very nice scenery to be around with great customers to serve. Connected to Monarch Place so most of the clientele will be business men and women, Always something to do as long as you keep yourself busy,"
good,Definitely hard at the beginning but was able to prove myself. Customer were difficult but it helped me grow and be able to handle with different people.
good,"good workplace culture with understanding shifts and fellow baristas. If your manager is able to secure your work schedule, then there are no issues. Sometimes no shows are hard but that is with any job."
good,"Starbucks was a good place to start networking and being confident in customer service especially talking to the customers, gave me opportunity to move up in the company."
good,"it was good working there but food industry was not my thing. i actually enjoyed working for Starbucks, most people who work there are friendly. at time it can get crazy, when its busy but you will adapt that if you are fast paced person."
good,"I worked at the Starbucks located in Target, so I helped a variety of people. we didn't receive tips and after 10 years for working for Target I needed something new"
good,enjoyed meeting new people and service great customer service. I most enjoyed the regular customers that would come in to greet us a hello and a wonderful smile. over all a great place to work at and i would go back.
good,"It was a job which allowed for the development of many different customer service skills. Starbucks was my first job, and provided the essentials I needed as far as experience."
good,"It’s a really good job when you first start there. Like any other job it has it’s moment’s but so much better than working anywhere else when you are a college student. As a barista, hours are very flexible but a shift supervisor requires you to sacrifice some things in your life, which that part sucks"
good,"A typical day at work is very stressful. It always felt short staffed and you are expected to serve and genuinely connect with every customer every time. "
good,good temporary work place. would not reccomend if you are providing for a famiy in the spring hill area. poor management at the kroger marketplace location. would love to work at another starbucks that provides better management.
good,"The benefits are pretty good. It’s a typical work place, you have your ups and downs. "
good,"Your experience at Starbucks is entirely dependent on the skills of your manager.  If you have a great manager, it's a great job. Unfortunately, their management compensation is lacking so more often than not you will have manager that are not invested in your success."
good,My typical work day would consist of wakeing up at 5 in the morning to be there by 6. As soon as I got there I usually went to drive through and stayed there for about 3 hours then I'd go to brewing the next batches of coffee and stocking.
good,very fast paced environment. you'll need to be able to learn fast and move quickly without getting overwhelmed. the hours are great and flexible but the stress of the job is often too much.
good,"The job can be overwhelming at times and you don't always receive support from management. When I started with Starbucks in 2012 it was a very positive experience, but as the company began to change I really felt more like a number than a valuable employee. That being said, I did work with really great people and the company does offer very good benefits and incentives."
good,"I did not enjoy working for Starbucks because of the store I was at. There was a lot of drama and the store was extremely busy, which made it hard to learn the drinks because nobody could help me when I needed it."
good,Starbucks was fun. Not something I wanted to make a career out of but it was a good fit when I was younger. No room for growth after you become a shift unless you want to run your own store.
good,"it was stressful but an upbeat environment. does not have many tips and pay is below average. good benefits, especially free online classes. free drinks are nice. plenty of hours."
good,"Great place to work with a good, social atmosphere. Just not enough pay to make a living on. Very flexible on scheduling for the most part, but can be difficult at best to get 40hrs/ week."
good,"N/A, I only worked for this company for a short time. While I was at this employer I had gotten so ill with pneumonia and the flu that I was hospitalized due to a 106 degree fever. While I was off I had a doctor's note forcing me to stay home and get better, they had me call out ever day till I came back. I came back to work almost a whole week early and they asked me not to come back almost a week later cause I ""didn't call in one of the days."" I had proof that I called and at what time and"
good,"Starbucks is decent, I pass down my position onto a friend. "
good,They hire way more part time workers so youre lucky to get 20-25 hours a week. More typical is 7-10. Best way to get hours was to pounce on people giving away shifts meaning it was tough to plan your life with any certainty. No room for growth. Its a glorified fast food position.
good,"The pay wasn’t good at all. Ended up staying just 5 weeks because their absent/late policy was ridiculous. Took 3 days off for a sick kiddo and got a “final warning”, then fired the same day. Free drinks on the clock was nice though, that’s about the only good thing I got from working there"
good,Not great  as a barista it’s fun but the second you get responsibility corporate starbucks really comes through. Great benefits. Great health insurance
good,"Not my favorite place to be at due to others around me and the unfortunate treatment I've experienced at these stores near nashville. However, a good environment for workers."
good,I love my team but every day is ruined by rude customers and multiple homeless people showering/doing drugs in the bathroom. We often find needles and body fluids. The company doesn't do enough to help city stores avoid or deal with these issues.
good,"To get experience and traning in the barista work force, I belive that this would be a great job. Otherwise, for myself being a single mother this was not a realistic job."
good,"The job overall was very entertaining and sustainable, however my manager at the time did not make admin, holidays or receiving correct pay very well. This in turn made the made it stressful when working long hours because it made it feel as if you would not be paid correctly for it. "
good,Working at Starbucks can depend on your team and the customers you have that day. The benefits are really good but the shifts can sometimes feel long.
good,Je ne peux que donner l'avis du starbucks au chili.
good,Depending on what staff I worked with I enjoyed my work quite consistently.  I left when I didn’t feel like coworkers and leadership weren’t holding up they’r their end of job duties
good,Bad management    If you were a male and young I felt you received special treatment    Great benefits   Flexible hours   I believe they want young people   It’s a dis service to not hire people over 40
good,Really great environment for building customer service experience. The team environment is perfect for understanding roles and filling them. Management is really helpful in creating a perfect environment to grow.
good,"Stressful but good benefits. Free food, coffee beans, and drinks. Sometimes customers are nice. Baristas are usually young and pretty Immature. Must have a sense of urgency all the time"
good,in my opinion working at starbucks is a decent part time job but if you are looking for something more set and full time then i personally would not recomend this company.
good,"I didn’t feel like the pay was worth the stress, and some of the long term employees could be pretty rude to new employees. The tip system changed for people paying with cards, which cut our tips significantly- people had no way to tip us, which is unfair."
good,Working at starbucks was a great experience. Someday were harder then others but as a team we made it happen. Working as a team in this company defenitly benifited everyone.
good,La société starbucks peut être une bonne école mais pas tous le temps
good,"great place, pays every week plus tips. Its a very fun job and a great work environment to meet new people. very easy shifts and great partners. shifts aren't long and training very simple."
good,"productive n fun,but no fixed schedules,no work life balance."
good,"I found that the job as a whole was very fun, very fast paced. I mostly enjoyed the regulars that came in and the overall speed of it. Everyday I encountered different obstacles to overcome which made it is so it was not boring."
good,"100% employee turn over. Very little consistency and struggle to keep employee moral up. I believe it was just a store specific issue, not the company. Lack of support from District manager."
good,"Working at Starbucks was convenient due to location, however was very fast paced and did not have the best management. I stopped working there due to moving cities."
good,Worked here for about four years to help me get through college. Made my own schedule and the caffeine helped fuel me for school. Busy store but it made the day go by faster.
good,Poor dms.  They are too close to store managers and their friends not holding them accountable.  They should not be hanging out every day together Outside of work
good,"Multibillion dollar, international company pays its workers minimum wage. Higher positions don't pay much more. Coworkers are friendly and most are helpful."
good,"I like a lot of things about Starbucks and it's culture. However, as a store manager, there is no work life balance. I am on call 24/7, even on vacations. I definitely recommend being a barista or shift supervisor if you are looking to make some extra money! It is just not a good place to have a career unless you like long hours, being under appreciated and being overworked without compensation."
good,"I would say the best part of the job would have to be the free food and beverages before and after your shift plus the discounts and benefits. The worse part is the pressured, over-busy environment which employees work under with, a lot of times, late lunches, unsteady work flow and sometimes you work with unreliable teammates. Which is not work the pay and tips, which are decided by the amount of hours you worked which can be spotty due to the different times everyone wants but do not worry since a lot of workers call in, expect a text asking for coverage."
good,Management was always changing and hard to get used to everyone sometimes  Coworkers were great. They would sometimes work with my schedule. You usually have to be on top of it.
good,"Working for Starbucks can be fun with the right crew on the shift. "
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for if you have a good team and management does they are supposed to. It's a great first job. They do offer lots of benefits, if you're proactive about taking advantage of them. There's a wide internal network of support and resources for all the employees to access with ease. On paper, this is an ideal entry level job. But as there are so many locations and types of stores, work conditions can vary quite a lot. It can be a hit or miss sometimes. Some stores can have reliable management, capable staff, and amiable customers. There's also a matter of volume and size. Even some of the services offered at your store can effect your experience. Tip compensation also relies entirely on how willing your customers are to comply. Despite the perks and constant communication with the district manager and other managers within the district, store managers have less of a support system than the baristas and shift supervisors have. This means that, often, there are discrepancies between how managers run things. Keep an eye out for managers that do not inform you of all your rights, and take advantage of your understanding of what your obligations to the job are. Again, this depends on the person and is not always the case, but as I've experienced many times, it can be. And things can get rough if it is. I don't want to get too personal or detailed, but make sure you're always aware of exactly what it is your role entails. Positivity, diligence, and a hearty work ethic are important characteristics to bring into the job, as with any job, but make sure"
good,Management was the only problem with this place. Manager didn’t know how to schedule people correctly or do his job. Always on his phone. Coworkers were great
good,Compensation for your labor is great. Fast paced environment. A lot of fun! Teaches you how to multitask. It's a place of warmth and belonging. Starbucks has created a culture like no other.
good,"My experience with Starbs was a little different, as it was actually managed by a company called Sodexo and was in a dorm. We were not allowed to accept tips as is Sodexo's policy, not Starbucks. The environment was friendly and relaxed, although the rushes could be stressful. Overall an alright job."
good,"Starbucks would be a great place to work if it weren't for corporate or bad managers.  Meaning, working closely with co-workers and making customers happy can be really fun and rewarding, but corporate's expectations of baristas and stores are not realistic, especially considering the lower pay.  Tipping is poor as well.  I made about $0.50/hr in tips on average.  Stores are almost always understaffed for shifts, but your store is still graded on customer ""connections"" and interactions AND speed of customer service.  It often feels like a lose-lose situation.  Fun place to work if you enjoy interacting with people; NOT for those who can't handle stress or grumpy customers."
good,Management singles out one person to semi-harass. I just happened to be that person. Otherwise an enjoyable experience. I would recommend this job to someone who likes a fast paced environment with superiors that are prone to micro-managing.
good,"It's a great job if you plan to just work full time. It's not a good first job, and it's hard to plan around your schedule if you go to school, or have another job"
good,It was an ok place to work for. Friendly enough. Decent hours and ok pay. Good job for kids coming out of school. Free coffee and drinks on the clock.
good,"made lots of new friends here, the hours are long but as long as your an early bird youl be fine. good staff perks and incentives. customers are like second family"
good,I learned to have patience and assuming the best in my partners and others. I learned to connect better with others. Making coffee was a lot of fun and I really love it.
good,"This job can turn into a great career for those who would like to move up within the company and really appreciates what they stand by and how they operate. However for others who are looking for a paycheck and passing time by while pursing school, a dream, or any other career choices this can be a bit much to handle."
good,Starbucks is fine company to work for. It is far more stress than the pay actually affords though. I'm looking for a change of pace and better pay. It is fine though.
good,"typical day was fast paced, with little down time between customers; I learned better time management skills; hardest part of the job was handling customers that were rude; most enjoyable part of the day was connecting with customers on a personal level, to ensure that they became a returning customer"
good,"Depending on who was managing the shift, it was a good experience. We were very understaffed though and that made for a stressful work environment. It’s okay for part time work."
good,"I have a lot of fun when I am working, however it is a lot of standing and not very much understanding when it comes to pain or other physical issues."
good,"The co-workers were great people, but the customers most times were not. Having to smile all day was the hardest part. It's a good job, but it's a hard one to make a living off of."
good,I had a good time working at Starbucks but they discharged me because of my disability that is a hearing loss. I loved the job & I loved the people I was working with.
good,"Working as a barista is exactly what you expect. Having to shave every day kind of sucks but the job is pretty fun, especially once you get to know the regulars. I would also recommend having some nice soles in your shoes."
good,Grateful for the opportunity to lead others while developing the business and myself.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with.
good,"The culture was excellent, it was like walking in to your grandfathers coffee shop somewhere on the streets of London in the 1950's. I really did enjoy working with some of the many talented individuals I came across. Many of them moved on into different careers, and some left simply just to start families. It was nice to go in every morning and have a god cup of espresso for free, and know that I was going to be ready to tackle the day."
good,"fast paced. high demands. great way to pay for colledge and benefits. always need to bebusy. customers first, even above you. does not do full time or anything close unless you constantly pick up shifts on your own time."
good,"The book works on many levels—as a case study for one organization’s turmoil and recovery, as a blueprint for building a company on a foundation of values, as a peek into the mind of a passionate entrepreneur, and as a wake-up call about the power of the digital media."
good,cool liked it for a minute short term job don't wanna get stuck its cool tho cause they pay for your school if you're interested in going that route but yea
good,Starbucks gets VERY busy so you need to be ready to handle that type of stress. I worked at a store with a drive thru and that added even more stress onto the job because it got super busy. The benefits are great though. Free drinks on the job and 30% when your not working on any drink so :) overall it’s a really good learning experience because you learn how to manage multiple things during stressful scenarios
good,"Enjoyed working with this team - job itself was enjoyable. However, due to company costs often extremely understaffed resulting in complaints from customers for issues beyond our control - eg having only one staff member during breaks and sometimes only 2 staff members (one on till, one on drinks) meaning the cafe was a mess and there was nothing we could do. Becomes very disheartening when it is like that for a long period of time!"
good,"Un dia tipico en Starbucks empezaba alistando, limpiando y manteniendo los equipos detrás de la barra como las Mastrenas (máquinas de espresso), las cafeteras CoD, el horno de alimentos y arqueando la caja registradora, al igual que re-stockeando la hielera y los refrigeradores con leches, cremas y numerosos concentrados. Durante el dia, me rolaba entre tres actividades: atendiendo a los clientes en caja, preparando bebidas y por por último limpiando las premisas de la tienda."
good,"Working for Starbucks was a little like dating an angry boyfriend. Sometimes you hate hate HATE your life, but sometimes he tries to make up for it by buying you stuff??? I got free Spotify Premium in exchange for a chronic stomach ulcer so there’s that."
good,"i love starbucks. i love everyone I work with. The ASM is bad. Hopefully she will have her own store or be at a different place soon. Other than that, the opportunities were good and discounts were good."
good,Starting out I was a cashier. In less than 1 year I became a key holder because I got a Dollar raise (WOW) but the bonus was that my boss wouldn't come in until 5 hours after my shift started. That was the real bonus since my boss was always paranoid about the District Manager. The way Starbucks was set up to run after 2 years I realized that there wasn't enough time to do so. Employees are set up to Fail Fail.
good,Entreprise qui met en avant le café et les nouvelles Boissons...
good,"Starbucks has a great missionplan and culture, but that sometimes gets lost when having to deal with the daily rush.  I worked at multiple loations and and quality of work differed greatly depending upon the manager."
good,At first my experience was great. After a few months that changed. All of the help I was promised disappeared and then it was all about getting good numbers.
good,"I love working for the company but hated the pay and the short staffing ...........................,........,............... Great management and staff. Wonderful benefits ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤"
good,"Starbucks is okay if you enjoy working with companies. I think their program is great for school and their ASU program is cool, but you have to be a partner for at least a year with sucks."
good,"Starbucks is overall a pretty neat job, you need to multi-task well and do well under pressure. Also its good for benefits and discounts. Tons of perks as well."
good,Good job for people who wish to work part time because of school or any other reason. Job requires a lot of patience and willingness to work in a very fast paced environment while dealing with stressful situations.
good,"The manager would not allow me to learn new positions and only had me work drive-thru. Everything I had learned in training was a waste because I was not able to use those skills when I started working at my assigned store.The manager would step into place if you were doing something wrong, rather than teaching you the correct way."
good,"Love working with my Starbucks partner family! I go to work each day and see my favorite people. Love seeing my regular customers each day!! It can be stressful if we are short handed at peak sales time of day.  This also makes for longer wait times and upset customers. However, it usually passes quickly and you can catch up"
good,"En general, el ambiente y el tipo de trabajo es bastante agradable. Pero es muy difícil hacer carrera dentro de la empresa, porque los jefes solo ayudan a sus amigos."
good,"My experience with starbucks was generally a positive one. Being a Barista requires being able to put up with a variety of characters, many of which are half awake or on the brink of a midday meltdown, awaiting their cup to save them. Being open and prepared to deal with a range of emotions is a must if you want to thrive in the environment."
good,keeps you on your toes and always using social skills and making strong relationships with customers. although do not like having to wear black shirts and pants while other starbucks can wear causal clothes.
good,I’d clock in and start off by cleaning my work station and preparing for customers as customers would arrive I would engage in conversation with them and take their orders I would make the order to perfection for the customer and hand it to them wishing them to have a great day.
good,Starbucks is an ok company. The chances for advancing are there depending on your gm and dm. I encourage anyone looking for a good start to try entering Starbucks
good,It's great meeting new customers on a day to day basis. Creating drinks with different flavors and getting to know everyone! It's a great company to work for!
good,"Depending on the location, workplace can be good or bad. Management can be sketchy and favouritism is common. Employees and customers are usually better."
good,"people where great"
good,"I was an excellent employee that truly enjoyed the early schedule. I was fired after a new district manager came in because I Made everyone feel uncomfortable according to her. I had never been fired before and in fact many ""partners,"" walked out when they learned what had occurred. I basically ran that store and was fired because this new district manager did not like me, the store manager was furious. I know, because I know her."
good,"They don’t care if you don’t know how to make a certain drink or if you need help. Angry customers, and rude coworkers. I don’t recommend this to anybody who isn’t used to a fast paced environment"
good,Good company to work for when you're starting off or if you have interests or passion for coffee.I worked here during my university years and they were very accommodating.
good,"The customers are the worst part, however the work isn't hard and keeps you up on your feet.  The pay is reasonable and the coworkers are the best part."
good,"I was very eager to get on with Starbucks because I had heard of the amazing benefits, the discounts, and what looked like, a great working environment. I did not end up enjoying my job with Starbucks and I don't blame my coworkers/manager because they were great, corporate is the issue. For the amount of work that my coworkers and I put in, the pay was not sufficient. It takes a good amount of skill and a large stress threshold to handle the job. The job is very demanding and can wear people down quickly if they cannot handle the intensity of the environment. The hardest part of the job was staying within the expectations (under one minute drive-thru times, making drinks quickly while connecting with customers, etc.) My favorite part was my coworkers, they were wonderful people and have become like family to me including the fantastic supervisor. I enjoy fast-paced, intense working environments, but there is a fine line between that and overwhelming/unhealthily stressful shifts, which happened nearly every day. Underpaid, overworked, and exhausting."
good,"Starbucks is pretty simple barista work as far as that type of work goes. Learn the drinks, learn your timings and the rest falls into place. The job is really about how good your team is."
good,"Starbucks is a great company overall, though it's very stressful if understaffed (which most stores are) and could absolutely use better management at some of the stores."
good,The management was the worst overall. Unfortunately I found the supervisors and store management to be very rude. Overall Starbucks is a great company to work for and I wouldn’t consider the management rudeness to be the sole factor of holding someone back from a great opportunity.
good,I enjoyed the job and the people I met—both co-workers and customers. Maintaining a work/life balance is difficult because the company requires that you remain constantly engages with the company.
good,Working at Starbuck could be very stressful when attempting to go to school and raise a family. The benefits are Great and my management income was awesome. But I really needed to step up my education to provide for my children better.
good,"A good first job but too stressful to be there for too long. Good benefits and good pay but not worth it, especially if you work at a drive thru. The people there generally are just very gossipy."
good,The new board of management are the reason why lots of staffs left the company. They do not care about the reality of the job that the staffs are working on.
good,My store is like the black hole in my district. Been there for two years and the customers and the workers are all in all hard to tolerate and I plan to leave after my college graduation
good,Yes the company does provide benefits which is wonderful but being paid $8.50-8.90 per hour is not at all worth enduring the conditions under which we were made to work.
good,An overall great benefit company to work for.  The store hours are long and sometimes are really early.  New drinks are a constant and get more intense each new one.
good,This is a good college job.  It is very flexible and has good benefits.  It is not very stressful.  You do not take your work home with you.  It is a springboard to a lot of career opportunities.
good,"The equity companies are great to work for. Excellent training, great drive and very supportive of personal development. I worked for this company while studying and they were fantastic at supporting this. The franchise stores however lack the same supportive and organised work environments."
good,"Enjoyed working at starbucks although many of the supervisors are questionable...good paying job and good environment if you are comfortable working in a fast-paced environment but be careful which supervisors you trust with certain info, a lot of them will relay anything you said to other supervisors. Depending on what store you work at theyll force you to follow a certain dress code, it doesn't matter if you dress according to the lookbook. you Must dress how they tell you or you'll either be written up or sent home."
good,"Working at Starbucks was good but it could be boring because I worked alone a lot. It was boring at times, but sometimes it was super busy and that could be extremely stressful."
good,"I worked in 2 different locations, both very different from the other. First one was great but the next one our manager was shady, cutting over-time hours from paystubs when he under staffed us and wanted us to do over time, but didn't want to pay for it. Also always expected us to clean up his messes. Tried to talk to our DM about it but I finally quit. When I sent my response into headquarters they finally looked into it and after major investigation he was fired. But was a horrible experience while I was there."
good,"*i was at a licensed store "
good,the wouldn't have been to bad if it weren't for bad lead staff such as managers and supervisors. I would have had a better time if i could rely on all my partners but most were incompetent.
good,Typical days at work were either very busy or very slow.  I learned how to work quickly.  Management was hit or miss.  Some of us were friends.  The hardest part of the job was having to cover for other people who would call out too often.
good,Bad management and sloppy rules. Always busy cause in the hospital. Fickle leadership. Not my cup of tea. Learned a lot though and overcame every obstacle.
good,"When I got the job at Starbucks I was excited, but I soon lost the charm of it because the even though most of the coworkers were great, the few made work tedious. Management also sucked as my manager would side with more senior employees and wouldn't listen to anyone else's complaints. He also was never there except on rare occasions. Had good benefits though with free online college, stocks, and free drinks on the job."
good,"You aren’t guarantied a lot of hours, so don’t expect to earn much, you do get a lot of benefits though for it being at most a part time job. 7 out of 10 times you’ll deal with rude customers. From my experience you’ll have a huge turnover in management, most of whom are either incompetent or (I’ve been on both sides of the coin) play favorites."
good,"Working at Starbucks is fun at first. Then you begin having to deal with some of the most entitled people I have ever encountered in my life. The other baristas are great for the most part. And the management was great as well. Corporate was another story, consistently asking for better scores and handing out fewer hours and man power."
good,Starbucks is very paced you learn how to make different drinks almost every month. It takes quite awhile to learn how the Starbucks language. Very fun job just be careful not to snack to much
good,"Starbucks offers decent incentives to continue to work, however they only are offered every so often. Most of my time spent here was dealing with problems on my own as a shift manager, my store manager was little to no help to me, it seemed as though she did not care. Other Coworkers were a big plus side. I made many friends, both coworkers and customers in my time spent here. Unfortunately, most of Starbucks customer base are very rude and arrogant people, who are hard to deal with on an every day basis for extended period of time. The Company would rather keep its customers happy than to keep its employees content and driven to work. Overall, this place taught me a lot and helped mold my work ethic into more of a professional manner when dealing with people. It is not a bad place to work, but i do not recommend making a career out of it. There are better jobs out there to make a career with."
good,"Typical minimum wage job. A lot more cleaning than you think, management never held accountable as their bosses interact with basically only them and not their staff. High expectations to multitask cleaning, FLAWLESS customer service (in which they expect you to get to know the customer personally, like every customers lives and personal questions) pay raises are a joke, they say they arent a minimum wage job because they include benefits into the ""pay package"" yet when they remove something from the pay package or make benefits less comprehensive,  its not like they raise pay. Work here temporarily its fun at time with good coworkers but DONT STAY TOO LONG. Its draining."
good,"I got a job at Starbucks solely as a second job to make extra income. Worked 25-35 hours a week usually. The location you work at is everything. I worked at a kiosk in a mall, a dumpster fire of a mall at that, and overall the job  it had its pros and cons. "
good,"Once you learn how to do the job, it is easy. After that, it becomes monotonous and fairly lackluster. You work primaraily on your own and customer interaction is so minimal that the days drag on. There is no room for growth unless you plan on managing the whole place."
good,It was very stressful but worth it. Teaches you a lot about patience and customer service.  Your coworkers make or break your experiences. Although there is a nonchalant environment keep your personal life and work-life separate.
good,"Starbucks can give you a great work experience, but sadly no matter how great your manager and team are, the company does not care about their baristas, and it shows. "
good,It's hard to trust upper management with personal information after telling upper staff what I was going through and why I would need time off everyone ended up knowing of my situation .
good,The Lake Bluff Starbucks had a few shift supervisors that took their jobs for granted. The pace was often very fast with poor team communication depending on the employee's. Often the new employees didn't last due to being under trained and pushed to learning while performing the job.
good,"A good place to work when I had a good manager, a stressful place when had a bad manager. The company focus has changed, now its sell sell sell..it used to be about customer connection. Hard to maintain good staff."
good,A good low paying part-time job for low skilled work in the customer service industry similar to bar tending or being a server. Long term growth is a toss up solely based on sales and where you live. Younger folks tend to promote quicker than older or educated and equally experienced or skilled.
good,I gave this business an overall rating of 3-Stars because your experience will differ entirely based upon your manager/shift leaders. Do yourself a favor and ask about / observe the store you wish to apply at.
good,"I enjoyed working at Starbucks for the most part. The shifts were flexible, transferring to other stores was fairly easy, the staff and customers MADE the experience! I was stuck with a store manager I did not care for- she was very abrasive and not well suited for the people business and that made my experience less than wonderful."
good,"It’s okay, they need to learn to willingly pay the workers because we work hard to keep a smile on the customers faces. As well as give us a livable income pay. I’m"
good,"The job doesn't pay enough for the work you do, but they do work with your schedule- which is a must-have for a college student with a crazy schedule like myself. You also get free coffee and a free food item a day ^_^"
good,"I worked at a fast paced store, it was a good company to work for. I got 20-30 hours and got trained immediately after being hired to make drinks. it is definitely a family kind of company."
good,"Honestly, if you need benefits for your family, you can work part time and receive them at Starbucks. Good bonuses too. Free pound of coffee a week, free food during your shift etc"
good,"Starbucks is fast food for people who think they are better than fast food. mostly customers think this way. Depending on your store and store manager, the environment can be toxic and stressful. however, Starbucks is pretty good about solving any issues with coworkers (as long as you complain to the right people). "
good,"I enjoyed working there, but it’s another corporate retail position where they get you to do as much as possible while paying you as little as possible."
good,"Enjoyable for high school student, can get very hectic at times so most important thing is keeping your calm, and not getting too stressed out. Can be good."
good,I really enjoyed working for them while there.  Anyhow I was always looking for something better that would challenge my work ethic.  I would recommend Starbucks for first employment to anyone.
good,Great place to work but the company needs to make sure it’s focusing on its employees as well as the customers. as well as be more involved with their partners.
good,Did self studies at home to better my self for work an how to properly make every drink on the menu. learned a lot about coffee I didn't know before having the job an continued to further my work ethic as I learned new skills each day.
good,The overall Workload can vary from day to day depending on the customer volume and staffing trends. Partners must have the ability to multi-task and prioritize responsibilities based on urgency and business needs. The company does have a comprehensive benefits plan.
good,"Great work environment, generally worked alone. Great customer interactions and overall a great work experience. Management wasn’t the greatest but other than that great."
good,"I’ve loved working for Starbucks, but the company is heading in a direction that I’m unsure of. There is a lot of grey areas that is making it difficult to manage the demographic that makes up our hourly partners."
good,I moved to Utah from college without knowing anyone and quickly made some of my best friends as coworkers at my Starbucks location. Great opportunity to meet new people.
good,Day to day operations can be stressful but also fun. All the way from the top management does not care about regular employees. The only thing that matters is sales targets and cutting costs.
good,"It was a great place to work in the beginning but as time went on, the job was no longer fulfilling. It took some time for management to settle into their role as a leader."
good,"working at Starbucks was okay long day rud customer, but the company was not to back. help my work and pay bills but wasn't really flexible with my scheduling watch may it hard to get to work on time."
good,"The respect across employees is usually pretty bad. The pay is good for living in a city but Starbucks is in the suburbs pay less. Overall, just work there if you really need the money."
good,It is a fast-paced environment and will require that you are quick on your feet and able to make drinks in a timely fashion. Hours are scarce but you may be able to pick up more hours at different locations.
good,I enjoyed working at Starbucks. I made a lot of good friends and felt a good connection to my employers. The work environment was positive but challenging at times.
good,"Definitely was a good company. enjoyed working with others within the company , everybody is goal orientated & truly made myself better overtime. Blessing"
good,"Basically, there are people that just got hired and make just as much as me and I have  been there for almost 3 years. I want to advance but I don't know if it is worth it if I am barely making above what someone else is getting paid when they been there for a month."
good,"The Starbucks I worked at was absolutely hectic. There were a few times I wouldn't go home until 1am and have a shift starting at 6:30am the next morning. I would work there again, I just really didn't like the exact location I worked. I also wish the hours I got were more regular so I could plan things outside of work."
good,This job taught me a lot but if you live in an inner city and are stuck cleaning disgusting toilets and scrubbing dirty drains it sucks. There were days where I would feel so gross going from janitor mode to being on bar to make drinks. DM’s were feared in my district and not every store holds the same standard and quality. Now that I’m on the customer side the Starbucks on Collier blvd and Immokalee Rd here in Naples FL is the worst store I’ve ever been in my entire life
good,"management is the reason why I quit my job. "
good,"This is a good job to have while in school, but otherwise I don’t recommend it. If you’re looking for a full time position than this is not for you, they only allow full time for managers, not even supervisors."
good,"Constant Change. Every day is an experience. Every customer has a special way they like their drinks. Most customers are returning customers so you learn exactly what they like and their names. "
good,Personally I felt like the company was very clique. A lot of gossip and drama but I guess that’s everywhere you go. I feel as though people were in positions of leadership that should not have been there.
good,Starbucks has great benefits but can be stressful at times. I loved learning to make drinks and the people I've met while working there. There is a lot of pressure to serve people quickly while simultaneously connecting with them.
good,"There is a huge amount to learn from this job.  I have gotten to better my customer service skills, and learn a plethora of skills pertaining to the management of a business.  As well as food safety and sanitation skills.  I think this job has a lot of skills you can learn and take into many aspects of of life and your career.  I am certainly grateful for the opportunity."
good,"it was a nice place to work. but it was always understaffed and the pay was just ""ok"". manager was not very good at effectively handling people and the supervisors were rarely chosen for their ability to manage, only that they would be willing to ""clopen"""
good,"Reasonable pay, fun place to work."
good,"Starbucks provided a high then minimum paying job but the quality of the atmosphere the workers gave was so horrible. They may have just not liked me, but I touched it out. Until, eventually, my sports schedule and work conflicted."
good,Team was great overall. The management however was not good at the two stores I worked at. The hours were flexible for my school schedule. Working holidays was not very fun though.
good,"There was always alot of customers, it was a quick-paced environment where you were always doing something. It was an okay job overall. My manager was great."
good,"The working floor of an urban Starbucks differs from that of a suburban or rural area Starbucks. In an urban area, it is improbable to reasonably accommodate a drive-thru. That means that there is a single point of sale and a single point of product pickup. With a drive-thru, there are two points of sale and two points of pickup. As one might imagine, this added layer of complexity increases the difficulty of all operations."
good,"I worked at two different stores and found that really quickly co-workers form cliques. Generally its the morning crew and the afternoon crew, with a little overlapping. Corporate is amazing at taking care of their partners (employees) with a wide variety of benefits and career paths. Lower level management is hit or miss. Some managers are great at helping you achieve your goals, while others can hinder them for their own sake. My most recent manager consistently promised to help people move up and never followed through and would often talk poorly about staff behind their backs to other partners. I ended up leaving due to poor management."
good,"I made a lot of great friends but the management and pay could've improved.On top of that, i feel that advancing could have been promoted a little better than it was."
good,Spent 7 years here and am leaving due to the lack of care for safety in stores. They need some type of security in most stores. Cops take hours regardless of area.
good,"I enjoyed the day to day at Starbucks, and the company offers amazing benefits. the training for an external GM had a great platform, however the people whom perform this training are inconsistant."
good,Starbucks is a fast paced work environment where the work is never ending. A barista needs to handle multi tasking and strong customer service skills in an area where you obtain verbal abuse from your customers.
good,The typical shift at Starbucks would be coming in the work and assigning duties that needed to be done and Take care of any that were missed prior. Depending on the volume for the day you would need to delegate appropriately to get duties done and provide great customer service. Hardest part of the job was coming in and already being behind for the day. But it was also the most rewarding when it was all finished.
good,"Overall job is relatively easy. Essentially the same as being a barista, but you have a key to the store. Working for this company is generally a little stressful, keyholder or not."
good,"Partners weren't as knowledgeable as expected it caused some tense and uncomfortable shifts. So many different personalities and so little interaction on a general level created many awkward an often funny moments. "
good,After working at STARBUCKS I come to the conclusion that it was a pleasant work environment overall. I personally didn't like the management of the workplace but I was paid fairly.
good,"Starbucks has a very fast-paced work environment. I learned how to take on the busiest of days with my teammates. It was a great way to build relationships with the locals, who became like family that I'd see every day for coffee."
good,"It really teaches you to serve with passion. Customers aren't always right, but they always come first. Best part is that you get to practice becoming a barista and learn how to make a decent cup of coffee. Some managers are terrible. Racial discrimination may be on the table if you're the minority."
good,"I spent five years with this company and they encouraged advancement and tenure. After two months in the role I was separated in, I was transferred to a location that had a lot of toxicity and management issues. I tried to express my unhappiness to my district managers and requested a transfer on three separate occasions and they were denied. My work performance suffered and I was ultimately terminated after 10 months in my role."
good,"I learned a lot about customer service, since Starbucks has particularly concise customers. Sometimes, the managers would favor their friends, even if they didn't do what they were supposed to do."
good,Good company for part time employment. Starting pay was too low. Internal hiring is a positive aspect of the way the company operates. They take care of people that invest time into the company.
good,Starbucks was an okay job through college. They however don't pay well (in comparison to other jobs) and it can be quite stressful. I liked the people I worked with however the culture can change from store to store.
good,Like the fellow partners that I work with but for the money you make on a daily basis and the way customers treat you topped with the fact that we are never properly staffed makes for a bad experience
good,I had an okay time working their but they didn't fully go through with promoting me like they said they would. Also I just slowly grew tired of the job
good,"I worked for Starbucks as a Barista, Supervisor and Store Manager. The job could be stressful and hard on the body, but can be fun for an extrovert who doesn't mind random work week hours."
good,I worked very hard but you would get very low raises. And while they had a standard for raises it was all determined by the store manager. It never felt like coroporate cared more about you than the money
good,"Starbucks offers good benefits to partners working twenty plus hours. Insurance and tuition reimbursement are among these. "
good,"it was a good place to work at for a first job and i dont really recommend as long term . great benefits and amazing employees , management needs work but other than that"
good,"make beverages, ring up customers take payment handle food and talk to your customers. learn recipes many recipes. Expected to keep all stations clean"
good,"It was a work experience from school, it was fun. Learned how to do salads and other stuff. Made me confident with talking to clients. I learned how to be well organised."
good,"high volume store"
good,It was a great place to work if you weren’t looking for anything that would last forever. Great for people in school they really balanced the work and school.
good,"I worked at a store in an area with a very high minimum wage. Otherwise I think the pay is probably bad in most areas."
good,"Overall good, average workplace. Just focus on fast service more than quality service. the most enjoyable part is to serve loyal customers as they are regular and i always feels like a part of starbucks family."
good,"I think for my age it was a perfect job, things could’ve been better but that’s anywhere. My first time working for Starbucks was great couldn’t of asked for better. However when you transfer stores and get a pay cut it’s discouraging and working for licensed branch stores isn’t the same, the pay can be better but the other things you have to deal with is not worth it."
good,I was told I got the shift position the only position I applied for and led to believe that then after 2 weeks told I got only the barista position less hours and excelled a lot working there but didn't get appreciated much over it.
good,You'll deal with various situations that will enlighten you as to what kind of workforce member you are and what kind you wish to be. Be prepared to work hard.
good,"Easy job, low pay, great benefits, fun work environment at times. Great manager at first location along with fun employees. Free coffee and online education! But would rather get paid $$$..."
good,"My time at Starbucks was okay. My manager was definitely involved and caring, and my coworkers were nice. The downfall for me, however is that is was a very high-stress job that paid very little. There was always too much to do, with not enough time. Being in school, the job was constantly a drain, especially knowing there were jobs with less physical strain and stress that paid better. For a minimum wage job, the benefits were very good, however."
good,"customer service and customer relations are usually high, fast paced, always moving, diverse environment, learned the importance of ""the customer is always right"""
good,"Although I did enjoy my job, the management was un fair and unprofessional. I did not like that there were favorites and that you could tell. Without speaking of the management I did enjoy my job."
good,"I loved our customers, being in a small town we had a lot of regulars. However, the young girls I worked with had absolutely NO work ethic whatsoever. No cleaning, organizing, or product would be made unless I did it. I felt like I never got paid the amount I deserved."
good,"A typical day at work includes a ton of cleaning, serving and making a personal connection with multiple customers -while maintaining efficiency - within each hour, crafting beverages and/or preparing food, and running a cash register."
good,"Overall, my time at Starbucks was challenging and stressful but a good learning experience. The training was thorough and I really liked my coworkers, but we were often understaffed with low pay."
good,"Management is often poor, with many lapses in policy enforcement making policy enforcement often impossible due to harassment laws."
good,"While there are many benefits to working at Starbucks, it comes at a cost of poor work/life balance. If you have children this job takes its toll because of its hectic scheduling to meet business needs."
good,"Management isn't the greatest and you don't get paid enough for what you deal with. Would always be scheduled outside my availability and would work 6 days per week, and they would still call me on my day off asking me to come in."
good,"Huge variance in workplace experience depending on your store and district managers. Decent scheduling flexibility. Great perks and benefits - including free drinks, product discounts, stocks (there's a reason we're called partners!), health benefits at part-time, and tuition reimbursements. Stress levels are fortunately decreasing with recent changes to how labour/available hours is being calculated."
good,I learned a lot at Starbucks considering it was my first job. I took what I learned and became a great employee at other company's. Made my team proud.
good,It was an okay place to work for my part time scenario. But when I needed full time hours is was a bit hard to get. I had to leave due to an allergen (Almond Milk) being brought in as I am highly allergic. The process in which they dealt with my allergy was incredibly stressful and very slow. I was out of work for months without pay since they wouldn't allow me to be let go and collect unemployment to find my next job.
good,"Fast paced, need to be a quick learner and go with the flow. Cant take anything to heart. Get get upset with customer requests. Always make sure to smile and try to enjoy the job. It can definitely be fun at times. I did enjoy my time there."
good,"Work load at Starbucks depends on the store. Some stores are busier than others. What a lot people may not know is that 60% of your day will be spent cleaning. It's not only about costumer service and coffee, it's mostly about cleaning."
good,The general manager treated her employees unfairly. Unfortunately I was one of the baristas she did not like and she fired me. The job is easy and fun!
good,"Starbucks is an ok place to work, but they need to raise their minimum wage. The hours can be inconsistent depending on which location you work at. If you got consistent hours it wasn't bad."
good,"Honestly if you devote your life to the company its not worth your time. The company has great benefits, and will take care of you, but the job was hard"
good,"Working at Starbucks had many benefits, but eventually took a turn for the worse when poor management stepped in and the company began to lose focus on the original values and offerings when they first became fairly well known"
good,"It's an awesome place to work and build experience and skills. On the other hand, it's a stress-inducing work environment. I like my coworkers but overall chaos leads to stress and dissatisfaction."
good,"One of the easiest locations to work at in Stony Brook. It can get occasionally busy but is generally slow-paced. The supervisor, Alfa is incredibly understanding, but her higher-ups aren't. So working day-to-day will be easy but if the higher-ups are there they will not be as forgiving."
good,"Had good benefits, but there was little support for management, bad scheduling, little chance for promotion. Limited vacation time. Raises based on merit"
good,"Working at Starbucks was a mixed bag. What made it worthwhile was when you worked with a great crew and a manager who supported you as well as the wonderful customers. That is highly rewarding! Upward mobility was dependent on your abilities, but also contingent upon whether or not upper management liked you. A manager in the company can easily undermine you if he/she doesn't agree/like you. The perks/benefits were decent, but they could be easily undermined by the low pay and insufficient hours. And therein lies a huge problem within the company. Wages are stagnant and upper management and the executives could care less, The company labels you as a ""partner"", but that couldn't be any further from the truth. With the massive tax cuts you would've thought with such a ""progressive"" company that Starbucks claims to be could've started paying their store baristas/shift supervisors/store managers more, but no that's not what happened. Long-term employees such as myself felt underappreciated! Bottom line is that there are positives to this company as long as you focus on learning some invaluable people skills and soft skills as well as some hard skills, but you have to have a mature mindset and understand that unless you want to move up the corporate ladder right away there is no point in staying here beyond your college years. Take what you can from this company, you can learn a ton and for that I am eternally grateful for, but make sure you have clear intentions once you enter into this company."
good,"Develop outline training materials and standard routine memory tricks for new trainees. Incorporate organized daily routines for barista team members to do on and off the coffee line"
good,I was constantly told how much I was valued only to receive the same amount of pay as the individuals getting paid for onboard training. There is no organization with the company. While the individuals that work for the company are always a joy: the lack of structure and uniformity causes the build to topple.
good,fast pace have to be a quick learner. doesn't know menu or customers well sometimes get free food. rude customers all the time. have to know how to keep your cool
good,I usually have a very busy day at work. I learned how to interact with customers and use a point of sales system. The hardest part of the job is when we are under staffed
good,the best part of working is meeting new people and seeing the kids come in. I've learned at lot working here. I'm glad that this was my first job. Thank you !!!!!!1
good,If you like a fast enviorment starbucks is fast paced in the mornings and you can have a good customer base however lack of good pay and only part time hours doesnt make it permanent
good,"My manager who hired me was fired within one week of me working there, it was a scramble to find a new one and it left the job very difficult to learn how to begin."
good,"It was a great work culture in terms of the customers and making drinks, however hours were horrible. Part time hours were only given which caused a great deal of stress since it was my only job and no benefits were offered."
good,"people there were pretty cool, you made alot of friends, it could get a little dramatic at times. you get some cool benefits like free spotify premium and free coffee all the time. i wouldn't recommend relying on it as yoir only source of income as an adult though."
good,Good start to learn customer service and how to become efficient in fast faced service. It is not something that is suitable for life long career. It is good for students.
good,"I worked at a drive thru so after clocking into work I would either be assigned to bar, cafe (inside cashier) or drive thru window. Unfortunately, most of our shift would be at that one station which grows extremely exhausting after a few hours. I work mostly a night which requires staying late (11pm) and completely cleaning the entire store (doing all dishes, making prep, cleaning floors/bathrooms, etc.) even though I have open availability and have repeatedly asked to not always work at night, my requests are almost always denied, leaving me tired and drained from always closing late. However, I am fortunate to have very wonderful shift leads to help motivate their partners and keep our energy high. Although we do receive great benefits, I work at the busiest store/drive thru in our district, however we still receive lower pay than some cafes with no drive thru in our district (drive thru requires harder work, faster pace, but has the same amount of partners as a cafe)"
good,would definitely want to find another place to work. I did learn to make a lot of drinks which was really interesting. Management really was not friendly.
good,Went downhill. Customers and sales over employees. It was good in the beginning but then it consistently went downhill to the point sometimes I would dread going to work. I had full morning availability but was only given opening shifts.
good,Good customer service experience and picked up many skills. With how to make high quality drinks and the best ways to deal with customers in these high pressure situations
good,It can be very cliqueish. The manager wasn't really helpful. Its really up to the person if they think they can do it. I wouldn't recommend just because I wasn't told all of the policy that I needed to know.
good,"Had fun collegues to work with which kept me around, however bad management with rota's being posted a day before and forced to work hours over my contract, I had a 32 hour contract but had to work 50-52 hours a week 3 weeks in a row with only 1 day off a week."
good,"I enjoyed my time there, I had great coworkers but we all agreed that the management lacked in a lot of ways. Over all I would at a Starbucks again if the management was better"
good,the benefits were good to have. met and worked with a variety of people. ideal for students because starbucks will now cover certain tuition fees. room for growth within company
good,"poor management no benefits no consideration of life outside work "
good,"Nothing against the company itself, but food service in general tends to suck the life out of anyone. Mixed with a corporate agenda and you will be left feeling like a robot."
good,"Creative department was not productive or well organized. Management was weak "
good,"Starbucks has great benefits for it's workers and is a pretty solid place to build a career but the company needs to support it's workers better. The customers walk all over the workers and it's extremely discouraging. Overworked and underpaid, generally. Your manager makes or breaks your experience."
good,the people I worked with were fun and always made work a blast but the low pay rate and upper management was horrible. they would switch shifts with me whenever they wanted to give me less hours for the week when I was the most under paid employee they had.
good,"Lots of perks, but the pay was heavily lacking. Overall a good job, but mostly for kids until you get into store management. Great for college students, and okay benefits even if you're part time."
good,Too strict and not very nice or helpful to new employees. Schedule is not flexible and the bosses are not on your side. every issue is your fault and not thers
good,"Working at this Starbucks was an incredible place to work while attending school. No matter the workload, anywhere from 9-18 units, I was able to work hours that fit with my school schedule. This job also allowed opportunities to make connections outside of the classroom environment and grow from differing individuals."
good,"Starbucks was a great place to work when I started. I met a lot of really great people, both customers and fellow employees. The days went by quickly with plenty to do. There are routines in place to make sure things ran smoothly. Every thing stayed clean and organized. I worked with great people that made coming to work fun! Then eight months in, management changed and I no longer enjoyed the environment. My hours were cut and I found it harder to come to work. This is a job that is as amazing as the people you work with."
good,I work full time and unless you're a store manager or shift manager you get around 30 hours and less. You don't get paid enough for the amount of work and people you have to deal with.
good,My time at the Starbucks was awesome until I switched managers. Very high expectations with limited accountability to the manager. Filing a complaint with HR was more harmful than helpful in terms of coming up with a plausible solution to employee conflict.
good,"Get ready to bust your butt and get sticky and sweaty.  Working at Starbucks is not for the faint of heart.  You'll clean the most disgusting trash cans, toilets, and you'll have to deal with the rudest of customers who think they are entitled.  "
good,"It was an alright job, I just didn't enjoy my coworkers. It could be stressful at times, but the discount and free drinks were a good perk. I wouldn't want to go back though."
good,"Working at Starbucks didn't last long for me because I had to relocate but management was efficient, and the team was great to work with! Most customers were regulars and very friendly, I would highly recommend working their if you are able to keep up with all the wonderful flavors and variety of other things on their menu."
good,"It's a good company on paper but they put more emphasis on customers than they do on their employees. They are too busy trying to stay competitive in the fast food industry that the quality of their actual products has fallen. "
good,It really depends where you work and who you work with. I personally felt like I got paid to have fun and make friends. I was trained properly so I was able to handle the fast paced environment.
good,"As long as you work for a good management, have a good team to work with and teach you, you'll enjoy it a lot. also depends on the location you work at."
good,Th management wasn't ran well at all. My very first day of working they made me stay and close and I worked 12 hours all by myself. The manager left all the things she was supposed to do in the hands of the other coworkers.
good,"Overall, it was an ok part time job during college.  There were times I really enjoyed myself but mostly, I found myself getting stressed out.  Customers treat orders at starbucks differently that any local coffee shop.  Very minimal training, I learned on the job."
good,Balance the 60hrs of general weekly stuff to do while only being able to be not working in the operations for about 16hrs a week also dealing with the employee and customer issues as well as exceeding your Store Targets. The balance of doing all that and not having enough time was hard because you do not want to rush things but you always had to.
good,Its ok. Management cld be better. Very frustrating making the same amount of money as someone who was just hired a few months prior than you. I have been with the company almost 10yrs.
good,Not a bad place to work.          Good hours and quite flexible.         The management during my stay was satisfactory.         Hardest part  is night shifts.
good,"customers are great. fast paced workplace. communication with the customers, knowing your customers on a personal level and their drink choices.  making friends"
good,"Fun high paced work environment"
good,Its ok place to work definitely need to go through the company not temporary because they wont keep you long pay was ok security was to much though late a few times dealing with security
good,"Starbucks is a good job if you need money and felxible hours. Not if you need a lot of hours and need to support yourself. I’ve NEVER had a good experience with management in the two years/3 managers I’ve had. The people can be great, but they don’t fire anyone when they’re not. It can be a hostile working environment because they choose not to fire people who can be lethal to a healthy, productive working enviroment."
good,"Flexible for working and being in school. No sick days— if you called out, risked losing your job. Decent discounts and benefits while on the clock. Doesn’t pay enough for a living wage."
good,"Starbucks provides ease for customer's needs. however, behind the scenes there is a certain lack of compassion and humanity within the culture. power trips are higher than ever. skills are used for personal gain, not for quality of community"
good,"Starbucks is an ever changing company that requires highly adaptable individuals for its success. It is a challenging and rewarding work place environment that really develops work ethic, character, analytical, and team building skills."
good,"It is just an OK place to work, doeesnt really offer career advancements.This place is a good opportunity for the students but not for the people who have actually started their career."
good,"this location is not for the light hearted, can be extremely fast paced and are expected to work long lines by yourself. pay is more than your average starbucks."
good,Great place to work I spent many years here and would go back if correct opportunity. Pay should be increased but that is one of the negatives to the job
good,One of the co workers made up lies and spread rumors about everyone. Besides the working environment was good and the job as fun especially making the drinks
good,"Enjoyed my time there when it was about core values and making sincere connections with customers. They started catering to children and really sweet travesties, along with getting overbearingly corporate as far as oversight. Great friends, learned a lot, just not as it used to be"
good,"Excelente equipo de trabajo, multicultural. Aprendí mucho."
good,"Each store is allowed to be run by their own managers, and the particular manager I was dealing with did not handle confrontation well. Which made progress and growth within the company difficult. Otherwise it is a good place to start for customer service and confrontational issues with customers while providing good service."
good,"-Fast pace environment around peak times "
good,Benefits are nice but the pay is low for what you deal with. A typical day can be very physically demanding and it can be emotionally draining when customers do not treat you well.
good,That is if you already have a job that pays the bills and can work in a fast-paced environment. I got this job when I wanted to save up money and didn't want to go broke at the same time.
good,"Estoy muy contenta, pero hay cosas que no se cumplen como se indican, o a veces hay malos comentarios por parte de los compañeros hacia los clientes. Y en mi tienda ya no dejan que nos cambiemos los turnos entre nosotros, no sé qué más da, al fin y al cabo lo importante es que se hagan, y si las vas a hacer mejor en otro momento y a tu compañero no le importa, ¿Qué más da?... y la otra cosa que me parece fatal es que si la comida se va a vencer, prefieran tirarla que dárnosla. Pero si es verdad que de resto muy bien."
good,"Working at Starbucks can truly be rewarding at times, and other times it can be truly irksome. I have been attempting to move up over the past year, and have been promised countless times to be put into our ASM training classes, and no manager has even followed through. District Managers rarely intervene with store manager behaviors. Working here will definitely keep you busy, and time flies by. It can be stressful, fun, and annoying all at the same time."
good,"It was a nightmare, never right."
good,My personal experience with Starbucks is that if the manager is not someone you like then do not work there because the amount of fun you have at work is completely dependent on your coworkers and people around you. its fast paced high stress at times especially in drive through stores. its a steep learning curve and you have to be prepared to ask a lot of questions and have very little training. they pay is mediocre. Starbucks pay me 2 cents over minimum wage and i have worked there for 3 years now. Its a great job for high school and college students but i would recommend In-n-Out before Starbucks.
good,The issue is that Starbucks is so rapidly going and changing that they often put people in roles out of necessity rather than actually qualified for the position. The standards and expectations also vary greatly from location to location.
good,During my time at starbucks I have officially had 5 managers split between two stores. Each time that there has been either a managerial switch or and overabundance of workers post-holidays my hours have been cut short.
good,I didn't have a great training experience.  It's very difficult coming in as a General Manager.  There is a lot to learn about their system.  I would recommend coming in as an assistant manager
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with, I met some really great friends.  The store I worked at was one of the busiest stores in Ohio. I would've much rather preferred working in a cafe only starbucks than a cafe/drive through.  My manager went on maternity leave, and they brought a lady in from corporate temporarily while she was gone. While she was there I felt I was singled out. She made me feel pretty awful about my job performance, when I knew I was doing a great job. I was put on an action plan to improve my performance, even though when this temporary manager was in charge she would only put me on the drive through window. My favorite part of the job was making drinks. I made quality drinks, and could keep up with the busiest of days. I was forced to resign because I was told I had not improved in the allotted time of the action plan and once other managers got wind of that they approached me and told me that they thought I was doing a great job and that they thought I had been improving."
good,Working there showed me that there are so many different kinds of drinks.  So many more then I knew.  I would recommend working there if it's a first time job
good,"It depends on where you work and who you work with. The job can be stressful and you sometimes have to deal with aggravating customers, but it is a good job to have while attending school. The hours are flexible."
good,"I'm not saying Starbucks is a bad place to work, but for the most part the only reason why I stayed as long as I did was for the people I worked with and my manager(s) I had throughout the years. They are still my family to me."
good,"My store was new when it opened so the beginning was hectic, some coworkers put in more effort than others and the customers could get very very rude."
good,"-	Provided exceptional, friendly and professional service"
good,"It was ok, management sucks. It was basically everybody for themselves. It’s overall a cool job if management would get better. Nobody cares about nobody else and everybody acts totally different when corporate arrives."
good,It was okay but the treatment of employees could have been better. It was a very cramped space for four to six people to be working in. Very busy location to not have staff caught up on how the work gets done at this facility.
good,Didn’t like the managers or coworkers. The location was intense. A lot of costumers and not enough staff. The establishment was too small as well. Very stressful.
good,"A lot is required for very little. Which is to be expected with an entry-level food industry job. Starbucks was an okay job, its great for college students and those looking for an extra gig. However turnover is high."
good,"The 2 assistant managers would actively encourage baristas and supervisors to ""take sides"" with them and be dismissive or negative towards all other management. This attitude resulted in poor customer experiences"
good,"A typical day at work usually includes making sure things are stocked and ready for whatever day-part comes afterwards. Management where I work can be a little stiff, with not much interaction between bosses and subordinates beyond explaining what more needs to be done to improve this or that. The hardest part of the job is definitely a ""customer is always right"" sort of attitude we're expected to take, with any unreasonable and mean customers being compensated rather than shunned. But the people you work with are usually worthwhile, good people who care about each other and look after each other, with some exceptions. It's not always easy but when you have a good team, it can still be enjoyable. For me, the stress is generally pretty exhausting, but in the right conditions this is a good job."
good,Starbucks was a fun place to work. It is fast paced and you really do get to know the regular customers. Working at Starbucks challenged my memory skills and pushed me to work fast while making sure quality was not sacrificed.
good,"Had to be very fast with drinks and at the register, trying to get through as many customers as you could. Made for a some what stressful job, but the days went by fast"
good,I learned much about people and the world. the most important thing that i learned was goal setting and resolution. I liked the spirit of the mission statement.
good,"A typical work day is fast-paced. I work morning to mid-day shifts where the main action happens. During this time, a particular two hours is set as our peak which is where it can be the most stressful. Our peak time is our busiest time of the day where our customers, products, teamwork, and efficient all come to play."
good,Was a fantastic job in all aspects for a solid year and then the company started focusing heavily on numbers rather than the previous customer and partner focuses.
good,"Working at Starbucks wasn't the worst job ever, but I wouldn't want to work there again. It's a good first job and usually the people are pretty nice. Occasionally there will be very rude customers, but you kind of laugh it off with your co-workers."
good,"Overall fun place to work, lots of benefits, and decent pay for a part time job. But environment is kinda poisonous. Alot of gossip, and angry customers. Definitely need to have some people skills to work there."
good,"Easy enough, flexible hours which was handy for working around my college hours. Most people working there are sound, the odd customer is a pain but most just want a coffee to go"
good,"I enjoyed my job. I had regulars who loved me and enjoyed what I did. I saw myself doing it for years and years without end but management just made me feel a little gloomy about my job. Bad with my availability and obvious favoritism to anyone who spoke spanish. Job gave me a lot more confidence, made me able to move quicker, and gave me such amazing communication skills. Would definitely recommend the  job. It changed my life and im so glad I worked here even though it didnt end the way I wanted."
good,"Crear horarios medio y completo tiempo."
good,"new manager in store nothing to add don't know him"
good,"was fun and is a great starting job, but advancement is minimal due to the nature of the job. most people don't want to work at starbucks for the rest of their lives."
good,Fast paced work environment with a lot of multitasking involved. Very different culture store to store. You get to know lots of different people. They encourage you to constantly improve.
good,"My shifts are well under qualified and my store manager is blind to their mistakes. Also the scheduling and availability isn't taken seriously, and I'm constantly having to go over or under my deserved hours."
good,"- A typical day at work was fun for me but seemed to be a chore for most others."
good,"In Starbucks, it's more to just remembering the beverage routines and customer connection. Its about giving out 100% to the customers and our partners. It gets busy when we have drive Thru and cafe waiting for their drinks. Making at least one Frappuccino can be frustrating. I learned on how to up-sale my foods, keep an area clean, help train my team, and multitask with making beverages. The workplace is tough but as long as you know what your doing, you'll be fine in the work culture. My most enjoyable part is connecting with my customers because they have some great stories to tell. Knowing them personally is one thing but remembering their names and drinks builds the friendships promise."
good,*I have learned a lot about this field of work. It is not easy to face and serve customer on daily basis. But when you love and enjoy what you're doing it is nothing. All the work is worth it.
good,"A great group of people working through busy days. Very fast paced, exciting environment. But overall extremely draining work environment. At the end of the day, you always have to say YES and make sure the customer is happy despite how wrong and rude they can be. Very good experience and teaches exceptional customer service skills, but not a job for everyone or at least not long term wise."
good,Fun environment with employees and I enjoyed the discounts and perks. The pay was decent for my first job. Management could have been better. I would recommend.
good,"Management allowed the G&A staff and salaries get largely over weighted. To satisfy the investors they promised to reduce G&A $300M over 3 years. This came at the expense of several hundred positions being laid off."
good,"Kendinizi geliştirebileceğiniz bir çalışma ortamına sahip, içerden terfiye öncelik veren fakat operasyon (mağaza) kısmında eğitimi düşük yöneticilere sahip bir şirket"
good,"I like the job when giving the tools I need"
good,"Starbucks was fun, energetic, and fast paced work environment. lots of opportunities for product knowledge and management advancement. management was always helpful and willing to train and give detailed direction to excellent customer satisfaction."
good,Loved making drinks but if your store is a drive through you will not have any time to interact with customers for it will be very busy. Most annoying part was people calling out and manager always trying to get you to cover shifts but that is with most jobs! If you can't handle a super fast paced job where you are required to memorize a lot of recipes it isn't for you.
good,"A typical work day would be early risers, afternoon students and night time sweet toothed. Very fun, fast paced working experience to have had at Starbucks."
good,A typical day at work consisted of nonstop rush hours and high demand for customer satisfaction. Cleaning tasks are expected to be completed all day long and knowledge of every order must be engrained. It can be very culturally diverse with not so reliable or flexible management depending on location.
good,"It is a very stressful job. Performance perfection is a must. Being able to multitask is a must. Personally, I believe that corporate does not understand the full responsibilities that they are placing on their baristas."
good,"Quick fast-paced environment, but low hourly pay. Very strict dress code policy at that time. Very low salary yearly increase. My coworkers were amazing though."
good,"Starbucks was a fun place to work with a great background culture, and the high anxiety and stress at times didn't bother me. My co-workers were eccentric and enjoyable to be around."
good,"Its a great high school/ college job. However if you are trying to provide for a family than you better get another job lined up. Love the atmosphere but the pay is not enough,"
good,"It started out fine. But as the years go on, the glamour fades away. You're understaffed, overworked, and underpaid. It not for the team I worked with, I'd have quit long ago."
good,"The customer is always right, which is understandable to an extent, but to work for a company that allows customers to yell at you and belittle you, only for them to be rewarded is frustrating. The location I worked at was also very exclusive. It felt impossible to do or say anything right in my coworkers eyes"
good,"Working at Starbucks is a wonderful entrance into the workforce. Keep it to 1-2 years, at the most. For those trying to make a decent living, it is a lot of stressful, fast-paced work for very little pay. Yes, Starbucks is one of the few companies that offers benefits to minimum wage employees, which is terrific! The company is definitely heading in a progressive and socioeconomically-conscious direction. However, bi-weekly earnings aren't sufficient!!! And while I was working there (this would have been 2010-2013), 32hrs/week was considered full-time--and there's a reason for this. This job kicks your ""hind-quarters"" (thanks for the 'inappropriate language' note, Indeed)! It's a lot of work for not very much pay...it leaves you exhausted after every shift...you spend your free days trying to recuperate. Additionally, Starbucks customers can be some of the nicest people you've ever met, or they can be some of the worst. Management is likely to take the customer's side over yours, the hired employee, if there is a discrepancy. Again, it is a great job for starters--it will teach you teamwork, professional and personal responsibility, people skills, and most importantly, it will teach you the lesson that hard work doesn't always equal quality pay. Don't work for Starbucks if you're wanting to live comfortably and pursue other goals. Only work for Starbucks if you want some food/customer service experience for beefing up a beginner's resume."
good,I personally did not enjoy working at Starbucks though I don't believe it really had much to do with corporate management but more to do with the store manager at the time who I personally felt took advantage of his authority and never gave much positive feedback to his employees.
good,i have learned from this company how to give a excellent costumer service in any circumstances and how to be a good strong team  player. Hardest thing is very busy.
good,"very fast paced and enjoyed when working with the right people"
good,"Constant customer interaction "
good,I do not wish to leave a review for my working experience at Starbucks . This is not what I signed up for and it’s actually becoming quite a nuisance and a waste of my time .
good,Starbucks Coffee Comany is a good companty to work for. Depends on the Managment and area managment and the store but overall it is a good experiance. Making a difference in peoples days is what made me want to join.
good,"As long as you're nice, the customers are nice. Make drinks correctly the first time, and see customers off with a smile and you'll be set. End of story."
good,I enjoyed working with the staff. Fast paced at times. Enjoyed dealing with the customers. Pay could have been better. Overall i enjoyed my time working with this company.
good,"what better summary review than that one? Worst experience ever, the guy was a liar and crazy. It was very sad for me to leave because my co-workers were nice and i was learning a lot, however with people like that managing a department it is simply disgusting. "
good,"theres different positions.Someone is on bar(making drinks),another on register, another warming up stuff, and another who is helping with restocking items while helping out other members with anything they need.You have different times when you'll get the ""rush"".Most stores make people take their 30min lunch first then 2 10min breaks sometimes later depending on how busy it is.through out the whole time cleaning is a must,morning people have duties that need to be done before night crew comes in and vice versa."
good,"Other companies will hire you solely based upon the fact that you worked at Starbucks because the training and culture is invaluable. You will learn how to hustle and multitask very well. The management (District Managers and Store Managers) need much more training in how to be great leaders, verses how to write a schedule and follow playbook. This job is very stressful and demanding. You will also make life long friends here."
good,"I loved most of my coworkers as they taught me everything I know about being a barista. We dealt with some bad customers and were required to work weekends and holidays. But the job itself, making drinks, was fun and easy to learn. They offer a flexible schedule if you're in school, have another job, or a parent. Pay is low but you can get health insurance, free spotify, and other benefits after 90 days of employment."
good,Low level employees are more valued and get more chances to correct mistakes than higher level employees. Benefits are available to any position within the company.
good,"Starbucks was a fantastic first job. The starting pay was good, the atmosphere was warm, and it got me out of the habit of just coming home after school, doing my homework, and nothing else. Aside from all that, it still got to be too much after a couple years when I started my first year at Community College."
good,"I am a very hardworking and productive person, and like to get the job done and working at Starbucks made me use my abilities while serving customers."
good,Management needs to improve in order for employee turnover to decrease. Baristas and supervisors don't get enough compensation for how much work they put into their jobs.
good,"Ultimately I feel like my years at starbucks have shown me time and time again that the culture of the baristas can be excellent, but demanding work hours, inflexible schedules, opportunities for difficult managers to thrive/coerce their employees to miss breaks for sales targets ultimately tends to aggravate. If you're looking for a relaxing opportunity to make coffee and get to know the clientele, location matters more than anything."
good,I enjoyed working there. Its a fun job and a good learning experience but due to careless and unorganized management the job falls flat on the satisfaction scale.
good,Really fun job at first but in the long term does burn you out. Customers can range from extremely nice to the worst people of life and when it gets busy best believe everybody expects their drink out first regardless of who's in front of them. Management wasnt very stable we constantly had a new manager after only a few months.
good,It is a decent second job because they open really early and you leave by 10 a.m. Fast paced in the mornings but if you can handle stress then you will be fine. There are a lot of adults working there.
good,"Disclaimer: I only know my district, and this company does vary drastically by district."
good,"Good job for students, training takes a few weeks, once training is complete you are independent to work with customers and are able to learn on your own."
good,not a bad place to work - worked remote which helped the work life balance. many hours spent in meetings. I would go back if the pay was right. The culture is changing.
good,It was a great fun energetic place to work at employee was awesome is a fast place to work for when you're inside the airport getting up every morning making sure you be there by 4:30 so people can have that good old fresh old espresso will coffee.
good,"Working at Starbucks you are exposed to all of the areas population. From plain black coffee drinkers to those with complicated orders, you get to witness how people interact and how they respond. At times, the job can be stressful, but is usually quite laid back. The manager or shift on schedule, really sets the atmosphere for how the day will go and some are simply easier to work with than others. Working with the customers can be rewarding, but at times is borderline abusive."
good,High paced and stressful. Customers get crazy about their drinks. Threaten your life because you didn't hear them mumble their drink into their phone kind of crazy.
good,"Can work shifting Monday -Sunday"
good,"Working at Starbucks has it's perks, but it is certainly not easy. The job itself is not hard, but some customers can make it really difficult. I enjoyed my coworkers and the culture at Starbucks, but between opening at 4:30am and dealing with people in the early hours before their coffee... it can be rough."
good,"Very fast paced stressful environment and always something new to learn. Not for someone who can’t handle stress and chaos. But if you can, it’s not a bad job they help pay for school"
good,It is not the same company that it was even five years ago.  Things are changing rapidly without time for a lasting effect to show.  The employees are not treated the same.  It is clear that everyone is replaceable. The team environment and the people you work with are typically the main reasons that people stay around and then a few for specific benefits.
good,if you need a job its pretty easy overall. i would recommend it just for that. during my time there things were a little bit strict but since then i heard it relaxed a little
good,Overall I enjoyed my time at Starbucks but most of the time the managers dont care about the needs of their employees. Other than that i have no complaints
good,"My starbucks location never properly trained me to work. For example, I didn't know how to make basic drinks, I didn't know how to properly clean, and I didn't know how to efficiently open and close a store. This was mostly due to my manager not caring, and then she would get mad at me. However, I still enjoyed the work space and I enjoyed the benefits I received."
good,"Starbucks is a face paced work environment. With the company's products always in high demand, you can expect to always be moving especially during peak hours. In this job I learned:"
good,"Fun place to work and interact with customers. When District Management follows its mission statement, the environment is phenomenal. When District  management fails to follow its mission statement the work environment suffers."
good,It's a great first job and definitely not the worst place to work however over time it can ware you down and the constant change of personel and company standards makes it difficult to keep up
good,Starbucks taught me a lot about what a service job entails. I was able to learn affective customer service skills including interaction and what customers expect. Learned How to efficiently and affectively make drinks as well as
good,Starbucks is a great company to work for however it can be a busy high stress environment for some people so I would not recommend it for everyone.  Its is a good way to get customer service experience.
good,"Can get extremely busy and you must have good work ethic to keep up. The manager and employees are fun to work with, and if they have good work ethic, makes a good team"
good,"A typical day for me at Starbucks begins with checking in with my manager about the weekly goings on, and being up dated on what is required of me. I also touch base with the previous shift on duty to see whee we are at with our daily tasks, breaks, etc. I spent the first several hours doing nothing but cleaning, running breaks, and focusing on the needs of my customers. I eventually begin pulling pastries, organizing the back room, which includes putting away any product left from the daily order. I count inventory and submit at the end of the day. I am also responsible for cash handling such as tills, safe, and change orders. All the while maintaining a clean and organized, work space conducive to a positive and productive work place environment."
good,"Every Starbucks there is a difference in environment .,but it is easy to transfers pick up hours. Though not as easy to get coverage or get intervention on anything dealing with management."
good,"The workplace was extremely stressful and cut throat. Fast paced, extremely competitive and not much room for error or growth. Customer demands had to be met, even if unreasonable."
good,I personally felt Starbucks is a good stepping stool for those with no job experience. I learned a lot about people of different cultures and perfected my customer service skills.
good,"If you love coffee and interacting with different types of people, Starbucks is the best job to be... The only challenge here is the low starting salary but everything else is ok."
good,Starbucks tries to make the job enticing for the younger workforce by providing lots of benefits but is unable to provide ample reason for any employee to stay in the long term.
good,"Although the days at work were stressful, having a supportive team and work environment always made it better. The hardest part about the job would be rude and disrespectful customers, but that can be at any job. The most enjoyable part would be handing customers their drinks and how, even though it is just a cup of coffee, it can make their entire day a better day."
good,"I love the actual work at the on-campus Starbucks, but the Chartwells management is what ultimately drove me away. I have not been impressed with the lack of promotion (above supervisor), the amount of work/pay balance, and, the employee turnover rate is pretty high (due in part to student workers) which means shifts are consistently short-staffed."
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work at for first-time job finders or entry-level people looking into building their customer service experience.  Work can be stressful however if you have a solid team , work goes back quick and fun"
good,This particular location had a high volume of customers. Fun staff and culture. Days would often be stressful due to the customers and the amount of drinks that had to be made.
good,"If you're able to keep up with multiple rushes of lines consistently busy, its worth a challenge. If your use to sitting at a desk at a job, this isn't the right job. A lot of tiredness, standing 6/12 hours a day shifts."
good,Starbucks work environment has become too relaxed. There was nothing wrong with having and enforcing the previous dress code. More responsible management.
good,I found this job to be great at the beginning but eventually took over my life as I was too open to helping out. I think it would have been better as a part time job.
good,"A fast paced work environment. I love coffee and I loved the company before I started working there. But I was thrown into this position, and I quickly moved up. Great place to learn about coffee, fast paced and depending on location great place for advancement."
good,"The Store I worked at was a high volume store so we were almost always busy. The most enjoyable part of working there was always getting to know new people and interacting with them. I would say management wasn't the best there doing the time I worked their we had at least 15 staff members leave or move to other stores, and we went through 3 managers. The reason I left was because of hours being severely cut from an average of 30 hrs per week down to 10 hrs."
good,"The work was extremely fast paced with corporate bearing down on you to work faster. The customers were very entitled and it seemed like corporate encouraged it, giving out gift cards like they were candy when there was any complaint, regardless of the validity of complaint."
good,"A typical day at work consists of taking orders, exchanging cash, making drinks, and cleaning. Rising up into even lower management is very competitive and not compensated well."
good,rahat çalışma ortamı var fakat iş saatleri çok dengesiz
good,I have skin issues and starbucks was not good for me because of the constant hand washing and cleaning of items. Starbucks was really fast paced and monotonous.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Starbucks, I learned a lot, such a  fast paced place, great customers, great coffee, great perks, free drinks, free coffee, and 50% off other items."
good,"Usually stressful, I learned how to make coffee. Management was not good with scheduling. Fun to work at with the right coworkers. Supervisors get blamed for everything. The most enjoyable part was the people that I worked with and the great customers."
good,"It's a good place to work if you are a student. Flexible weekend schedule. A great place to learn basic customer service experience."
good,typical work day is very long and as is the work week. Their leadership style is off the mark. They tend to focus on the point that everything is critical therefore priorities get confused.
good,There were many times where situations could have been handled in a much more appropriate manner. Buuttt it wasn't the worst job I have had so there is that.
good,numbers mean everything to some managers. it's all about speed and not about the contact which they tell everyone it is. customers are rude and tips are bad.
good,"Working for Starbucks for 4+ years, I learned and developed skills that I didn't know I had and it was thanks to the flexibility and support I had. no matter where I transferred to, I was able to work, and go to school which was great. At the same time, it was a constant struggle when it came to affording rent, bills, groceries, and other living expenses. Starbucks doesn't pay a lot, and that is one of the reasons why the turnover rates are really high."
good,"I was constantly stressed, tired, and overworked. Customers are redic and the company lets them get away with anything and everything. If there was more barista support it would be a great place to work. Baristas are so busy and tired that they dont want to train new workers because they can barely stay afloat as is. So it seems like they donʻt like the new baristas but they are just tired."
good,"Starbucks is a good company if you don't mind physical work and talking to people. It is physically demanding and can be emotionally demanding too. The job will teach you the basics of teamwork and workplace ethics, and gives great benefits to the partners. Corporate however can't seem to decide what they'd like to focus on: providing excellent service or competing with fast food restaurants."
good,"stressful job but days fly by and can sometimes be fun. Starbucks was a stressful environment that would generally be understandable, however the amount of stress of the job was not worth it due to the low level of pay they provided. Also, very few hours are available as I sought 30-35 hours a week yet worked 19-21 hours. With that said - they do provide wonderful benefits to those who need it and my most recent manager was wonderful. There was loads of drama, as with any work place, but most of my coworkers were very kind people"
good,"at the time, the manager over my district was horrible. she rarely promoted from within and really seemed to have it out for the stores on the other side of the bridge- which is where my store was located. "
good,"Starbucks was a stressful environment that would generally be understandable, however the amount of stress of the job was not worth it due to the low level of pay they provided.

With that said - they do provide wonderful benefits to those who need it and my most recent manager was wonderful. There was loads of drama, as with any work place, but most of my coworkers were very kind people."
good,I had previously transferred to a different store after 2 years. I loved my coworkers at my last store but I had an awful store manager. I changed stores and I hated my coworkers and didn't feel like I fit in at all.
good,"I've been working for Starbucks for almost a year now. Starting off I will say the ""corporate company"" as a whole is wonderful and welcoming. However at my store in my district in general is quite a purgatory nightmare. Advancement opportunities are used as a weapon to force hard working employees to work even harder, as if 40+ hours a week in a part time position isnt enough. Health codes are broken and ignored. Management is glorified new hires with the idea of ""bottom up"" coaching methods, which allows the idea of coaching your boss if they dont hold standard properly. Sadly most dont know that this comes at a severe cost of retaliation. The competition is cut throat, the only hope of advancement is to work abhorrent hours and buttering yourself up to the store manager (SM).  Well, that and stepping on the heads of your fellow partners. Everyone will attack you for everything you slip up on. Common complaints include but are not limited to: ""You're steaming that wrong, just move ill do it. Get off bar if you cant keep up"" and  ""You arent smiling enough. At least look happy to be here"". The pay isnt horrible, its not exactly livable either. Most baristas in my store have 2 and some 3 jobs. I wont share exact numbers but, I was hire in Oct. 2017, a female barista that had approximately 1.4 years experience over me when I was hired made about a dollar less than me. From then to now we have received 2 raises and that barista still makes less than me. I understand that companies raise hire rates. It is just something to consider that Starbucks as a company doesnt raise wage caps"
good,"Too much to handle sometimes but you get free coffee and food and tips.  I would work at one without a drive through, it's would be less stressful and more worth minimum wage."
good,"The people there and my manager were generally fine to work for. But I was at University at the time and striking the balance was difficult all things considered. The early morning shifts were so early as well, if you're happy getting up at 4.30/5.00am then fair enough but it wasn't for me."
good,"Personally I feel like I'm not paid enough to deal with what I deal with, but I don't hate my job. It's just not enough to live on without trying to work 40+ hours."
good,"People who work there are very nice, respected and friendly. "
good,"I worked at Starbucks over the summer after I had graduated high school, just before moving off to college. Management and staff were decent. Several of the shifts were a little self-righteous, but I survived."
good,"I consider most food service positions to be the same as in treat the  customer with respect and efficient service, carry out tasks quickly and correctly, and arrive to work early or on time.I take every job I have seriously no matter what responsibilities or tasks I am given."
good,"Starbucks cares a lot about their customers. This is a good thing, although they tend to put their partners wellbeing below their customer. The job is long hours and hard work with little to no recognition and very little pay."
good,"This was my first time working for a casino. This Starbucks is not a corporate location, so naturally being owned by the casino means very expensive coffee. There were a lot of tourists and even locals that constantly are upset about the pricing, not taking the Starbucks app, birthday rewards, etc. The GM there does not care about the employees and is a major reason why there is such a high turnover."
good,"There was no communication between shift supervisors which made closing difficult, most responsibilities were put on specific people and the manager was aware but did not do much to help."
good,"The flexibility Starbucks offers is the best benefit. Most managers are willing to work with you on scheduling according to your needs/preferences. The hourly pay rate is low compared to most other jobs, even within the food service industry. You will likely be paid minimum wage or slightly above. I highly recommend taking advantage of the other benefits Starbucks offers though. Tuition reimbursement for Arizona State University online, good healthcare options, good 401k matching, yearly stock awards, discounts with a bunch of different companies through their perks website. Not to mention the free coffee! So, not an ideal option for someone needing that paycheck to be bigger, but great for someone who needs some extra cash flow and wants good benefits."
good,great coffee overly priced. which everybody should know that by now. how ever i really enjoyed working with the people that was at my location awesome awesome people
good,"Working for Starbucks is slightly more stressful than one would think. While it is an enjoyable workplace as a shift supervisor you do many duties one would do as a store manager. The company focusses primarily on its customers and customer connections which personally has created some amazing friendships for me."
good,regardless of how exciting it may look; rest assure that this job requires a lot of physical labor. This job has a high demand for fast paced individuals.
good,"The job is not bad at all! You get to meet and work with some wonderful people. Though I will say that management is poor at most locations I have been to. Often times, managers are content sitting in the back of house despite being on the schedule to work in the front. It makes baristas jobs more difficult and stressful than need be."
good,"I had some good opportunities for developing skills and experience. As a barista, I would work with a friendly team to make drink orders, and I would constantly provide communications in an efficient manner. "
good,Starting with the company was amazing. I met so many new people. It allowed me to make someones day with just a cup of coffee and a smile. I felt fulfilled at the end of the work day.
good,"I started at a  just cafe store and around six months in transfered to a drive-thru. While I worked at the Cafe only store, I fell in love with the company and was so happy. After transferring I was miserable, overworked and underpayed, I went from a store that cared how their employees felt to a store which ""didn't have the time"" to care about us."
good,"fast paced and somewhat rewarding, customers are not always great and most times your co-workers are the same. The only rewarding part of the job was making the drinks but most time the management only has their favorites work on the drinks even when they're slow"
good,"What I appreciate most about Starbucks, besides the coffee knowledge and people, are the benefits and the flexibility with schedules and hiring. I really do believe that Starbucks baristas and shift supervisors need to get paid a lot more than what they have to offer. It's a multi-million dollar company with their baristas and shift supervisors breaking their backs every day, working for their managers and in customer service. It is very demanding and stressful, but it is definitely a good experience to have, especially in growth and developing relationships as well."
good,Enjoyable workplace and friendly atmosphere. Fast pace on weekends. Flexible hours. Customers are nice and fun to talk to through out the day. Nice job for college students.
good,"great environment.....i enjoyed getting to know people who i both worked with as well as served."
good,"Its a good place to work. Great while in school, flexible with schedules. Pay is minimum wage but easy to move up in company if motivated. I highly suggest working for Starbucks."
good,"Unfortunately, it was a stressful experience. I met a lot of great people though. At times there was not enough coverage and I was doing almost everything a manager was without the pay."
good,"Working for Starbucks for so long taught me the dynamics of the work life. From entry level up to managerial positions, from cash handling policies and procedures, and the work world is an endless possibilities of things that can go right or wrong in some cases. At the end of the day our work is our life and adjusting accordingly and respectfully, an awareness of this helps achieve balance throughout. Developing professional interpersonal relationships is important to success in the workplace environment. I have used these philosophies in other work environments and it has a positive outcomes and for all these intricate characteristics, I thank Starbucks."
good,"I worked at a Starubucks in Kroger. Some coworkers were difficult to get along with and it can sometimes feel like no one cares or wants to help with the job at hand. However, I like working when we are busy. I love making coffee and having that one customer that makes your entire day when you are able to help them or they were just a nice person to interact with."
good,"Starbucks is a very stressful work environment, but that's to be expected. I believe for the amount of work and time that's required of the job, employees should be compensated much more. Waking up at grueling hours and being required to work faster than physically possible are just a few of the drawbacks. As time went on management definitely went downhill. Managers SHOULD NOT be hired from outside of the company. There's just way too much to learn and managers should have a firm understanding of the basics before holding such a high position."
good,"Its been a really long time but it was cool. I would apply at one that not inside a safeway, I think it would be a lot better that way.  you cant get tips"
good,"Working at Starbucks in Manhattan, NY was a very fast pace and demanding work environment all at the same time. Besides loving the smell of ground beans and enjoying a hot cup of coffee every morning, Starbuck provides a very fun and safe work place for all of their associates. Starbucks was very employee friendly and provided many benefits for employees that wanted to go to college and continue working."
good,"I worked here a few years ago and I know much has changed, so I can't imagine that my day at work would be the same as current employees. The job was beneficial to have while attending college due to the flexible hours."
good,"On a typical day at Starbucks I handle cash, perform inventory counts, give amazing customer service and also perform a fair amount of cleaning. I also make drinks and connections with customers. It's enjoyable for me to do all of these things, however I feel as though it's time for me to find something new."
good,"Good company for advancement, but more and more cut throat as you work your way up. Always fun and fast paced, rarely a dull moment and the weekly tips were nice."
good,"I worked at several locations over the 3 years I was employed for Sbux. "
good,"I enjoyed the work environment. I worked at the Starbucks that was on my college campus, and we were always busy. It was the only start bucks in town, so it would be jam packed all hours of the day and night."
good,I didn’t mind working there. The job itself wasn’t hard to grasp and I enjoyed the fast paced environment. It wasn’t always busy though and the company of my coworkers was fun.
good,"- Starbucks does offer you quite a few benefits such as Insurance plans, dental care, and stock investments."
good,"LOT of creative ideas TO LEARN AND OFFER TO CUSTOMERS AND COLLEAGUES."
good,"the job is not meant for people to stay forever, it is a great place to begin and move on. the day to day job is customer service so it is pretty simple"
good,"It was hard work but i learned all about coffee. everyone was stressed out there and not making enough, even the manager there. The customers could be mean."
good,"- partners are easy to communicate with"
good,"It's kind of stressful at first and you definitely need thick skin because you're working in an airport where everyone's nerves are on edge, but the people you meet and work with make the job worth it."
good,"Relations with co-workers were dependent on character and seniority within the company. Management was inconsistent and poorly managed. The growth ability was slow at best and was also dependent on seniority capabilities. A typical day work was varied on day. The most enjoyable aspect about the job was regular customers who were welcoming, nice and willing to get to know you without disregard and the hardest were customers of the opposite nature and the inconsistent policy changes that did not match on-floor performance between customer and barista interactions."
good,"The job itself is super easy once you get the hang of it. The management cares about their employees, and it feels like a family. There is occasionally the random coworker that has a bad day and is in a bad mood because of it, but for the most part, it's a fun place to work."
good,I personally didn't like working at Starbucks. But that doesn't mean its not a good fit for someone else. My manager was great! I just didn't really care for my less enthusiastic coworkers.
good,"I really enjoyed my coworkers, but the customers can be very mean, they are always short staffed, I felt overworked and under-appreciated, but I enjoyed getting tips, and free coffee."
good,"I worked at 5 different locations throughout my 10 years of working for the company, and each location was different. I would recommend scouting out a good store first if you're thinking of applying. Sit in the lobby for an hour and watch how the baristas act, and even talk to them a little - ask them how they like working there. If they really hate it, you'll be able to tell.  It can be very stressful at times though, at any store, especially if you're a supervisor. There is an insane amount of tasks to do amongst already serving the insane amount of customers. The company seems to be perpetually understaffed, but that is common in many different retail companies. I think the only way you could possibly do everything you're supposed to is if you have very strong management, which unfortunately I never did. Also, pro tip - find a location with a good tip rate (usually in a nicer area)."
good,"It was a great place to build work experience as a young adult but the management at my particular store was not good. We had managers that didn't get along, always understaffed, overworked to the point where I got muscle inflammation in my arms. Was never encouraged to move  up. Instead outside hires were brought supervise store."
good,"I resigned from this company instead of transferring down to Portland where I was moving, because with the changes Kroger has made in the Fred Meyer Company, the moral of the employees has dropped and the turn-over rate has risen. "
good,"Having conversations with regulars is a plus and helps me de-stress a little. We deal with A LOT of complicated people. Overall we work as a team, Although,its pretty stressful when someone is slacking. Management overall needs help."
good,"Poor management, entertaining job itself. There is alot of things to remember on the job, its important to ask questions and gain clarity. People are often rude to baristas and you are to be nothing but polite at all times."
good,Unlike many others I didn't dislike working for Starbucks. Working morning shifts got easier once I got used to the wake-up time and you know what to expect every day that you go in.
good,"If you are an undergraduate major looking for work, then Starbucks is the place for you. The company will provide you with the practical skills needed for whatever field you should so choose to enter. What is more is that the company has a partnership with ASU which will help cut the cost of tuition."
good,"Mondays - Thursdays,  Was always a slow day so only a few people on the floor . The manager and two baristas, one for bar and one for register.Friday-Sunday , Was extremely busy work days , atleast 5 people was working sometimes 6 . 2 on bar , 2 on register , 1 to stock everything and the manager . we got through atleast 200-300 people them days."
good,"the average day of work was enjoyable, however at my location it felt like a political battle between the manager and the supervisors who didn't respect him. "
good,"It's a nice place to work if you're in school and just need some hours, but definitely not for a single person with one income. For what they expect of their baristas, I personally don't think they pay enough, especially if you work at a drive-thru store, which is very stressful and demanding. It's a fun place to work if you have cool co-workers, and their training is very consistent and thorough. Management is spotty at best. Even though they offer health insurance, it was still not affordable for me. Free schooling is a nice perk if you can make it work, but I think they should do away with that and just pay people more."
good,Buen trabajo para estudiantes buen ambiente te regalan cafes en tus break
good,"the team member that i worked with were the ones that i trained with and i so miss them thats what made working there enjoyable, plus to meet new people everday was great, the training was fun i loved learning new drinks and how to make them."
good,"I worked for starbucks for 4 years and my boss kept promoting and hiring women exclusively until they got reported. I wasn't promoted till after this to help balance the workforce. I enjoyed the job, I looked forward to going in, but I did not when they were working. It stressed the other partners out just by there presence in the building, and I personally don't think that's a positive managerial sign."
good,"可以學習不同的咖啡知識"
good,I got fired by a new manager I never met before due to me having a mental crisis. I wasn't aloud to explain myself. I was so sad because I just started the college achievement plan. I felt let down to be honest.
good,Clean and clean and clean is all you do when you have no costumers. Everyone i worked with was always stressing out when we had a line of customers. Mostly because of the outrageous standers corporate sets for you and the stores.
good,"very busy, the company could do a better job of promoting partners internally. Rockling market was a great customer base but the district and regional manager just satisfactory."
good,"Typically, a work day would include cash handling, customer care, and cleaning. From this, I learned how to properly communicate with all kinds of people including customers and coworkers.  Management was always lacking as Starbucks does not hire managers with education or much experience."
good,"The location I worked at wasn't too bad but couldn't say its the best place either. Its all about unity, the quality of training, the location of a store, the foot traffic of customers, etc."
good,"Fun, friendly environment to work in, very fast paced and target driven. Good training and room for development. Good support from senior members of staff. Can be long days"
good,"very fast paced.  consistanly changing and evolving.  rules, promotions and managers change a lot. store manager can make or break a team.  had experienced both great and horrible store managers."
good,Needed the money for a few months. Great employees and manager. The customers weren't very pleasant and the pay wasn't great but if you need a job...fill in the blank.
good,"Business goals flip-flop from customer engagement and speed of service every quarter, so be prepared to receive and follow-through with conflicting directives from upper management. "
good,"Generally an easy job but difficult to progress. "
good,"It’s not a bad first job, I mean the job just was not for me because I didn’t enjoy the atmosphere, but hey I still did it and I was really really good at it!!"
good,Starbucks was a very productive and fun work place. I loved most of the people that I worked with there. I also learned a lot of new things each day that I worked.
good,"It was a fun place to work, but it felt like i was always working and never making any money.  Lots of short shifts that just about weren't worth the effort of going to work.  My supervisors also looked like they were working really hard and hardly getting paid more than the minimum that I was getting."
good,"At Starbucks, work was very laid back for the most part. Even though we had a hospital and a high school right down the street, it wouldn't get too busy. My coworkers were lovely people and I enjoyed working with just about every person there. The only thing I did not like one bit was my district manager. She would constantly put on a fake smile and whenever she would need to talk to an employee, she would only ever tell them what they were doing wrong. She let me go for being less than five minutes late to a shift that I notified my shift lead about."
good,"The days went by quickly and theres always something to do. You get to meet knew people on a regular basis and see regulars and build relationships with lots of the people you meet while on the job. Examples I have for what I have learned are lots about responsibility, handling situations (good and bad), making sure to remember people and there orders because it makes the customers happy to know they are remembered and we pay attention to their needs. The managements had its good and bad days. The hardest as well as the most enjoyable part about the job I would say is having to say goodbye to your regulars because you build relationships with most of the people you meet and its emotional when you don't get to see them anymore and change can be hard but exiting at the same time because it helps you grow and become better."
good,You have to be a fast paced worker and also quick at problem solving. Free drinks and food are cool though. I worked in a café store so it really was not all that busy just during the summer and part of winter with new holiday drinks. Great first job for anyone fresh out of high school. Flexible schedule if you are in school.
good,It was very stressful and had a manager that would yell at employees on the floor. All I ever did was open and it got exhausting and took a toll on my body mentally and physically
good,I like the job but they don’t pay good hours. Not full time jobs would recommend this for high schooler or college only. For family need a job this is not recommended if you have a lot bills to pay or house to pay.
good,"Its a good company to work for while you are in school. Time has changed since it has become a corporate entity. Working part time, you still get benefits which is very helpful."
good,Don't really think the company is all about the partners anymore. Wages need to increase. Training diffenently needs to be rethought again. Giving a new partners only 3 days worth of training is just a waste of time once they are on the floor. They have developed no skills to be put on their own after only 3 days.
good,"As long as you work hard and apply yourself, it's a good job. Management was a bit lackluster and I've heard this about stores other than mine as well. There is a lot of stress involved with the job and that can make people snap sometimes, making the work environment toxic at times."
good,"Starbucks is a good company. It has moved more into a fast food place, trying to emulate McDonalds, while also maintaining its unique personal mystique."
good,Decent place to work to get through school. The shift managers were fun. Its a good place to work and pass the time if you like working with your hands and fast pace during rush.
good,"management only wants full time, not good for part time students. benefits were expensive, but we had free visits for medical no co pay. Understaffed work place and only had two workers at busy hours."
good,"Was a great job while in school, flexible hours lots of free coffee. Nice people and meeting different people everyday.  Great job for college student."
good,Busy fast paced but after working at official coffee roasters I learned the proper way to prepare coffee. Starbucks was a started job into the field of coffee
good,"If you're in school full time and just need money, Starbucks is good for that. But when you have bills and need it to pay rent, its really bad for it. They do not listen when you say you want more hours. They are greedy with money and for the hard work you put into there sometimes really isn't worth it but bills.... so"
good,"Starbucks has great benefits but too low of a salary, in some cities hours are not guaranteed, training is not always followed through with, working conditions can be very high stress"
good,"Generally, Starbucks was a fun place to work but its definitely high intensity and very busy most of the time. There are slower stores, but mine was really busy because it was off of a highway. So, as long as you're well trained and can handle pressure, working at Starbucks should be pretty great"
good,"As a barista, I would manage orders, memorize drinks with customizations, kept things clean and organized as well as took care of the till every night before close. I cleaned my entire location within reasonable time, as well as loading up everything regarding supplies and prepped for the people in the morning. I often had to have personified drinks out in less than one minute per drink on average."
good,"underpaid, not a viable full time job. I wanted more hours, but was not granted more hours even if I was below 40. The shift supervisors varied in how strict they were, so it was a hard place to work."
good,starbucks is so much fun. you will have  great time. take the job and dont look back. you will make so many new friends and learn many things. and dont forget free coffee
good,"I enjoyed working for Starbucks Canada and loved the partners that I was able to work with. However, we were always understaffed and it was a busy store. Management was also poor in boosting store morale but the store partners were great at working as a team."
good,"I had a lot of fun when I first started working at Starbucks but after 4 years I've personally seen the moral fall so far. Partners are spread thin, there is no repercussions for late/ no call no show partners. One thing that really irks me about the company is the way they treat customers like children. If a customer cries and screams about policies that we were told to enforce instead of backing us up they are given a $25 dollar gift card and told that they are completely right no matter what. Partners are treated pretty well but it seems to be going downhill. Shift supervisors are not paid enough for working so much and dealing with all that they do."
good,"Starbucks is a decent place to work if you are deeply passionate about it. If not, you will burn out quickly. I do not recommend it as a first job or a part-time job during school. Every single one of my 20+ year-old coworkers smoked and suffered from depression. Nobody enjoyed their shifts. It really sucks your soul. Starbucks is a fast food restaurant with no fast food infrastructure that results in a high turnover rate and miserable employees. However, the pay is decent and so are the benefits like free Spotify, stocks, and free coffee."
good,"Every day at this particular Starbucks is a busy one, depending on the flight schedule. Being in the airport, not everyone can access the Starbucks inside the terminal unless they're flying or an employee. I've learned to become patient with frustrating customers since most of the people flying are business people. It is a nice, friendly environment despite this. The most enjoyable part would have to be the ability to be able to see the airplanes take off from the large window installed in the Starbucks."
good,"Started an awesome job with a somewhat temperamental manager. Terrible turnover rate as the manager clearly did not know how to treat or connect with people. Manager was forced to hire more and more incompetent people resulting in a serious downturn in quality in service, eventually became impossible to maintain a productive workplace."
good,I recall learning a lot about people in my time here. I learned about coffee and how to work in a team. I learned how to detail clean and make delicious drinks.
good,Enjoyed working at Starbucks and learning about coffee. Provided lots of opportunities for increasing knowledge and skills. Fast paced but lots of caffeine available.
good,"Dependent on location, it can be very hard to move into an assistant manager role and even longer into a manager role. The company really cares about its employees overall and has a ton of great benefits including free drinks your whole shift. 1 free food item per shift, free college if you don’t already hold a degree and much much more."
good,Its job. like any other job you come into work. and work your butt off. its not a job for lazy people lots of work is required and a happy personality  at all times to serve the awesome customers.
good,Very  busy  shop  in  city centre  time  passed  quickly  friendly  staff and  flexible  working  hours  made this  a  pleasant  place  to  work  and  the  coffee was  very  good.
good,"The store manager roll takes a lot out of you. The time and effort to run a company standard store is not worth the pay. They need to make sure when hiring new store managers that they are trained by corporate trainers or by district managers, not struggling store managers."
good,"It really depends on location and management; our store is understaffed which is stressful but if you’re lucky and you get a well managed store, it’s better that way."
good,Starbucks was great until I moved to the Sacramento area. The managers in Sacramento don't seem to care about the craft or being friendly to their costumers.
good,"1. Typical day at work :"
good,"I have met and worked with some incredible people here.  The fast paced environment can be very stressful but it helps you to bond with your coworkers.  Unfortunately, the company primarily hires on the outside for its managers so I only had a few good ones, most were not very good and a few were downright incompetent."
good,"I had a lot of fun working at starbucks. However, I did not make that much money, I had to have another job to be able to pay my bills. Also my manager was not accommodating and ultimately was the reason i left."
good,"Fast paced work environment"
good,I enjoyed my time at Starbucks. Did a lot of things I didn't know I could do. I gained experience in alot of areas that were new to me. I got to compete in competitions.
good,"I had a very positive experience with Starbucks while working in Boston. However, when I transferred to Pittsburgh there was poor management and I was discriminated as well."
good,I worked for Starbucks inside of Kroger it was okay the Starbucks managers were not the best to work with. It was an easy going job I got along well with my coworkers.
good,"fun and fast paced work environment. I started as a superviser and worked at a few locations, and the people I worked with were always amazing. I have missed my co workers the most, and a lot of customers! was a great experience to learn how to multitask, use time management and work quickly and efficiently to provide exceptional beverages to all customers. it has shaped me into being a hardworking, loyal, team leader who is qualified for many different kinds of work."
good,it was a good place to work. i learnt alot about my self and fast service. cutomers were always a pleasure and i got into learning routines. i found over all that it was an okay experience
good,"I enjoyed working at starbucks, but it could also get very stressful due to its very demanding speed. It would get very busy at starbucks and it was non stop."
good,The friendships of the employees you work with makes the job more of a family which i really enjoyed. Efficiency and customer service is a huge part of Starbucks and i like that. It is a great place to work when it comes to wanting to be on your feet all day.
good,"Lindo ambiente laboral, exigente, la paga es poca."
good,"Las horas extras eran pan de cada día, se aprende a catar cafés y a prepararlos bien. El ambiente era en general bueno, aunque el salario dejaba mucho que desear. En teoría las horas extras se pagaban mejor, pero en la practica, te pagaban lo mismo que las normales."
good,"A typical day at work is full of interactions with very interesting people from all backgrounds, age ranges etc."
good,"The work is harder than you would expect if you're working mornings, but really the deciding factor is your manager. If you've got a bad manager you're just going to hate working for Starbucks."
good,"But it demands to much work from the workers, you will always leave the store tired"
good,"I love Starbucks and all it stands for. I use to really love the culture but recently the culture is changing. We are called Partners at Starbucks. They use to really focus on the Partners and the customer not just being a transaction. However, the focus has been more on getting customers through the Drive-Thru. They say we should be focused on customers but it is difficult when things are constantly changing, new and more complicated beverages are being introduced and labor constraints on training new hires. For Store Managers work/life balance is a joke. Especially when your district manager wants you on a call every day no matter if you are off or not."
good,"Benefits are grate and can be of grate worth to the employee, but it seems on a district level management has major problems that need to be addressed."
good,"I liked working at Starbucks when I did because I was able to work a lot during the summer but also slow down during the school year.  For an entry level job, it was quite adequate, especially for someone at a young age."
good,It’s fun meeting a lot of new people and the environment is fun it’s just you don’t get a lot of hours and not a steady schedule. You do get tips every week
good,"It depends on the manager that is responsible for the store. The more organized they are, the better the work environment. However, the more disorganized they are, anything that can go wrong, will."
good,Its an alright place to work if you need a part time job. Be ready to work early and for you schedule to be erratic. You will always smell like milk if you work as a barista.
good,This is an entry-level job for individuals starting out.  Very slow to no advancement opportunity although a lot of talk about it.  There is a great deal of turn over with staff and management.  No one can live off the pay if you have real bills.  Great job if you are looking for a part-time or a summer job with good perks.
good,"this job was okay, it was not stressful. good and bad people as customers. pretty regular for a customer service job. the people i worked with were great!"
good,"I enjoyed working at Hyvee Starbucks, it was a good place for me to jump into at the time, and has been what I needed, a good stepping stone that I can move on from and pursue a job related to my degree."
good,We had a unique fun store. Great people good vibes. Its your standard hospitality/customer service job. You had your good days and you had your bad...
good,"I enjoyed the partners that I worked with, they were all motivating, and had great personalities when It came to how busy we were all the time at the Franklin Square, NY location. "
good,I worked for a tempory employment agency at the time. I remember it being hard work but it paid every week and paid decent wages for me at the tiume. It was decent.
good,It's fun if you can catch on quickly. But if you are a slow learner I don't think I would recommend it. The customers can be interesting and fun if you engage them.
good,"You dont feel you worked 8 hours a day as you get so busy, I learned multitasking, stress management and better customer service skills. The hardest part of the job is when its crazy busy and you are short of people which happens often. The most enjoyable part of job is connecting with the customer, making them feel connected and also the smile on their face when we make their drink right."
good,"I's a very fast pace working environment. You have to be on your toes, especially in the mornings.The job itself I loved, the management played favorites and treated people they didn't click with right away like they didn't matter. You will go home smelling  like coffee."
good,It can be exciting working here but also stressful. Dips in labor and scheduling can be unpredictable. Management is hit or miss depending on location. Drive thru locations push speed of service but customer connections and cleanliness were very important. Initiatives and store goals would be launched without any followup.
good,It was what I needed it to be. Able to pick up shifts or switch around easily. I had the ability to work more hours than I was scheduled for if needed.
good,I could only work a very small portion of time which made it hard to learn and understand what to do. I would recommend working as much as you can to start.
good,"I enjoyed working at Starbucks with my co-workers. The customers were usually very easy-going, as well as great conversations. Our regular customers were always fun. Unfortunately, my manager was not very patient or willing to work fairly. She could often be dramatic and biased."
good,"Working at Starbucks for two years has definitely opened my eyes to the various workplaces and their environments which evidently vary depending on the industry. Being a part of this company meant constantly thriving in a fast-paced environment, meeting customer needs with a smile, and multi-tasking in accordance with time-management. A typical day here involved my daily duties provided by my supervisor (i.e. cleaning, maintenance, and other health priorities) while attending to the customers and assuring that every moment of connection is perfect for them. It also involved greeting regular customers, anticipating their needs, and meeting their criteria day after day - thus forming friendly relationships and daily anticipated conversations. The hardest part of the job might have been working under certain management as he/she was very hypocritical and rarely seemed to care about his/her employees."
good,I enjoyed working for Starbucks and the interaction with the customers and employees that I worked with...great training and a very professional environment.
good,Starbucks is a fast pace work enviorment with regular customers and great tips as well as benefits. however the managment isnt too great. Pay rate is low as well.
good,My personal experience it was a lot like high school rather than a professional work environment at the location in which i was employed. I do feel like overall it is an excellent company to work for under the right store management.
good,"it is a good workplace and the shifts are good too, the management handle things well and the hardest part was the early starts, the most enjoyable part was customer interaction."
good,"Fun and interesting co workers, poor management. Bad pay. Learned a lot of good customer service techniques. Very good starter job. They give stocks to employees depending on their length of employment."
good,I enjoyed working here as a part time job. I like the company's standards. They provided alot of help to student and help worm around your schedule. Good part time job overall. For some experience.
good,"Everything you've heard about Starbucks customers is true. Sometimes they were the best part of your day and sometimes they were the worst part of it. But that's customer service."
good,It is a good job if you are looking for part time work or you are a student. There were times when it was stressful due to lack of employees schedule.
good,"A typical day working at Starbuck in Harris Teeter for me was walking into the building at 5:00 AM, cleaning and prepping for two hours until the customers came in at 7:00. Then I'd make coffee and frapuccinos for people who would claim that it was wrong, despite me following a very precise step-by-step process."
good,"Customers can be very rude. You need to know all the drinks by memory. Have to work at a very fast pace, especially in the morning. Have to be able to get along with coworkers."
good,"While Starbucks wasn't a bad place to work, it is very fast paced and sometimes very stressful. The management and shift supervisors are very efficient while being kind at the same time."
good,"The interesting thing about working for starbucks is that it's not really verse at coffee. Once you visit actual coffee shops, you see the type of people starbucks tries to reach out to."
good,"Great place to work at overall, the partners are cool. The amount of tasks that you're asked to do when working at starbucks is a little over the top and not really work $14, but you do get tips! Overall, still a great place to work."
good,"It was a nice job as a teenager being that it was one of my first jobs. It was quick paced and involved waking up early. However, the atmosphere and people were a delight to work with."
good,the coworkers are pretty compatable they work as a team the hardest part was when they are busy and short of help although busy time is fun time time goes by fast when store is busyer
good,management was good at the start but once they replaced the original manager everything went downhill from there. The upper management cared less about the well being of the employees and and the values they promised to enforce and uphold. The location where I worked went from being the best in town to the worst 2 managers and a few short months later. If you're at the right location then Starbucks is a great company to work for. They hire some great people and it's an opportunity to build great relationships with coworkers and customers alike. Although in my personal experience moving up isn't necessarily the easiest thing to do if thats what you're looking for. On top of everything they try annoyingly too hard to be aesthetically pleasing and fall short on beverage quality and taste.
good,"As a manager, I feel like my work/life balance was not even there. Staffing hours allowed dwindling over time resulting in exhausted workers. The culture in the company is strong as ever and they really do take care of you as far as benefits are concerned."
good,"With the new company policy to allow homeless, drug addicts, and anyone else access to the bathrooms and the cafe it has become a nightmare job. Would not recommend."
good,Very fast paced to shifts would go quick. Management at the location I was at really struggled. We went through 3 managers while I worked there. Most of the employees worked well together and were willing to switch shifts around.
good,"I think that starbucks is a great company to start at, depending on the shop you work, you can make great friends and meet interesting people. I will say that this job will get old quick, but it is bearable and anyone can do it. I think that a special few can make a great career with this company and others will either use this as a gateway in to the coffee industry, or learn to apply the work ethic in other areas."
good,Good job for those just getting into the work force or those looking to slow their careers down. Benefits and 401 are the main reason to join or stick with the company.
good,Great discounts. Great management. Fast paced. Long hours on feet. Short breaks. Not enough money. Have to work more hours to get benefits. Nice interaction with customer.
good,"Typical day at work is pretty relaxed vibes, there are higher volume time than others of course, people want coffee in the morning and mid day. In between you have time to stock and clean and sample out thing items as well as keep the coffee brewing! Everything smells great and looks great every day. The customers can be complicated but most are pretty patient. Thanks for the experience!"
good,"- Good culture"
good,"My experience may be different than most. I was hired to run highest volume store in city. It was extremely dirty and infested with bugs. I was told to continue operating under clear health code violations and since it was my first real time in food industry I was shocked. Very busy and worked over 50 hours every week. The pay was great, but I like to have a balance and working here with a location open from 3:30 am till 11:00 pm at night it didn't happen. I also had unreasonable management I have very high expectations, but my direct supervisor had unrealistic expectations."
good,"Depending on your location and if it's a drive through it can change the dynamics a lot. We were a drive thru and were very busy so it actually got to be somewhat stressful at times, if you have a manager you connect with it will make or break it."
good,"Very hands on and physically demanding with usually rewarding work places experiences. Compensation is not ideal, but there are some fantastic managers."
good,"not many hours, not always promises kept. lots of waste there. "
good,The typical day at work is very routine and you will get faster as the longer you work at it. However the company as a whole has made some changes that drain any ambition from the workplace.
good,It’s a good way lace to work if you are just starting out. Be prepared to work hard and learn a lot within the first few weeks. The management is okay.
good,The tips were split with everyone on shift. The pace is fast so your always busy and the lingo is a little confusing when you first start. It not bad to make extra cash.
good,This job is great for younger generations to get their foot in the door and learn about public service.  Starbucks consistently understaffs and raises expectations with out raises.  Typically there is only enough room to grow as far as a supervisor.
good,"We worked way more than we should with the minimum wage. Although the workers are nice it can be a very stressful place to work. Since the place I work on campus, we don't receive the same benefits the corporate Starbucks baristas have."
good,"I knew some of the other baristas prior to taking the job so that made an easy transition initially. However, due to the nature in which corporations conduct business and handle employees, I couldn't make the schedule they required of me agree with my other responsibilities as a mother."
good,"My first manager was amazing, but after about 8 months of my working there, she relocated to Denver. The manager who replaced her was pretty terrible. Overall, I covered shifts in a few different stores and the management differed greatly. The baristas and shift managers tended to be great and made it a fun place to work. It was very fast-paced and the customers were frequently rude."
good,Holds reasonably true to the image but there is definitely still a reasonable amount of turnover and the typical problems of most service industry companies are still there such as employees not showing up for shifts causing staff shortages. Busy periods are incredibly busy and the focus on speed at the drive through is bordering on causing quality and service issues.
good,I learned all the basic coffee skills. They did help me become a good barista but that came after I left and worked on a real espresso machine. Management was poor. The hardest part was when the person before me didn't restock things that had ran out.
good,Management is key to having a nice running store. A frantic disorganized manager will reflect upon its store and Baristas. I had a terrible experience with mine back in 2012.
good,it all depends on the manager. the manager who hired me was amazing but when we got a  new manager everything went downhill... we were understaffed and overworked.
good,A good job if you are a college student and it's the ideal job for someone who is a lover coffee. Nice atmosphere and full of challenges not hard to over come
good,"if your looking for a job, this is a cool place to start or stay if you find this is the place for you.  can be extramly overwhelming at times and customers can drain your life. but theres personals growth within you along the way."
good,"It was okay, but the management always changed and employee turnover rate was high. Do not recommend the starbucks in the Pitt airport. Long hours, with little to no support"
good,"."
good,"Starbucks is very busy at almost all times, i learned a lot about helping others out and how people act towards employees. the amount of disrespect you have to take is baffling, but i learned to be okay with it. the management was terrible, but most of the staff were pretty nice.the hardest part of the job was the heat inside the store while working non stop, but the most enjoyable part of the job was actually making perfect drinks for people and seeing them love it."
good,"Best thing is benefits are available. I enjoyed working there, but found it stressful because my hours varied and at times I had less then 20 hours a week which would effect my insurance."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks consists of showing up and clocking in exactly at the right time down to the minute, then you stick to the routine until you clock out. There are many rules, and the majority deem to be ways to waste time and avoid giving customers their food and drinks in the most efficient way. If management was slightly looser with their strictly enforced, supposed-to-be-perfect rules, then there would be less complaints about the notoriously long and dreadful Starbucks line. The management is also highly critical in the most non-constructive ways, which leaves the baristas and shift leads in a negative mood. This ends up contradicting the whole Starbucks Connection, if the management does not attend to the teams needs first."
good,This was the most enjoyable job that I have ever had as it was focused around making and drinking coffee. The staff was fun and the management made you feel important to the business.
good,The hardest part of the job is dealing with mean customers and learning recipes and how to use the computer system. The best part is getting to know the nice regulars.
good,worked there for 3 years. Loved the people I worked with and had a lot of fun to boot. It taught me a lot about myself and I am grateful for the experience.
good,"Had a turnover in management and was with out a permanent manager in 3 months"
good,I learned how to make drinks. it was fun because the customers were nice and I was able to see my friends since it was inside a supermarket. I would recommend this job.
good,"Starbucks is one of those companies that you will like your coworkers and local management, but the company policy can make your life a little difficult. The customer culture has led to some extreme examples of customer entitlement and worker devaluation."
good,"The best aspect about working for Target/Starbucks was easily being able to create good relationships with my coworkers as well as getting to know interesting, regular guests. Fast-paced environment and management allowed for easy and welcoming work flow."
good,"Although I enjoyed my time working at Starbucks, I did not like my manager and he made it clear he did not like me. In my opinion, that shed a negative light on my experience working for the coffee company but I still love their drinks."
good,You get free coffees during your shift and 1 free food item per shift. The job is incredibly stressful which makes the extremely low pay not worthwhile.
good,"buen ambiente de trabajo, en el que es primordial, el trabajo en equipo."
good,"really easy to learn all drink process' "
good,A very good starter job with some opportunity to advance if you wish. I enjoyed my time at Starbucks because I could be creative with drinks and I am still good friends with some of my customers to this day!
good,"Provides flexible benefits such as non-taxable allowance, free parking and car plan/allowance but provides less appreciation on work achievements unless you are working for operations department. Owners tend to micro manage also providing limited freehand on decision making."
good,"enjoyed making drinks for customers"
good,Expect to work hard and deal with customers but not be paid much. The life of a barista doesn't compensate much. You'll hey weekly tips but it is based off the hours you're given.
good,decent company to work for but full of drama and back talking brats. Through the customers I learned a lot of patience and a lot of fun stories to talk about
good,"The job is simple yet hard to get. people who work with you are very collaborative. you will meet fun and interesting people. management can change a lot in a year actually making the work environment very iffy,"
good,"As manager of the Starbucks located in a Target, I received corporate training and was given a lot of encouragement and support while I learned how to run the store."
good,The cutesy coffee shop motif associated with Starbucks is just superficial. Starbucks is trending hard towards typical fast-food business model which dashes prospective employees assumptions of the work environment because it deviates so far from the image Starbucks tried to portray in the media. It's not 2002 anymore.
good,"Workplace is fast paced and stressful at times, which is most definitely the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job is the co workers."
good,Just hope you're with Good people. I've worked at several stores and experienced both the best and the worst. It's nice that there's multiple locations and you can work anywhere. Just make sure you get along with your co-workers.
good,"This job is ideal for a student, because it is not enough hours. company offers great benefits (kaiser). free drinks and weekly coffee. Poor management, not enough pay."
good,"I have worked for Starbucks for 5 years and have witnessed many changes within the company. Some good and some bad. Overall I have been able to excel in my customer service skills, sales techniques, and overall appreciation for the craft of coffee. However, in the 3 years of being a supervisor, there have been many alterations made to the job description with little pay increase to coincide. Starbucks in known for great benefits, but that is because they fail to shed light on the unethical side of their company. Rising into management is very wishy-washy with Starbucks. They are willing to hire outside management versus promoting and hiring from within the company. "
good,"Everyone's experience is different. The management is poor, but you find amazing coworkers through the struggle. Honestly, if the management were to change and those that worked hard were promoted within, the kiosk could really have a chance."
good,"Great team, not very good management. "
good,When workers are paid a living wage then perhaps this will be a fine place to work. The stores I've worked at have had wonderful partners and customers but I know that there are more poorly run stores out there.
good,"Exciting, great place to work. The interactions I get to have with customers are amazing, you have your regulars and those who are just stopping through town. But when there are barely any workers to cover shifts things can get really stressful."
good,"I can see what Starbucks is trying to do, but they are failing at it. The corporate communication to me as I worked was about ""being a place between home and work"" and ""creating a welcoming atmosphere"" ...no matter what. Yet, we continually had to battle policy changes, additions to an already staggering menu, and an uphill battle against the ever-present CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT."
good,"Starbuck have internatinal culture and they give alot of things like health benifits and overtime pay. "
good,"A typical day at work consisted of preparing the store for the day, such as restocking followed by the morning rush then our routine cleaning procedure of the store and all equipment."
good,"Starbucks has a strict training guideline, yet offer very few resources in terms of labor budget to fully execute its core education.  SM are pressed to cut labor, yet train new hires to be amazing associates with shorthanded shifts; this is unrealistic and unfair for the team as it is typically not the SM that conducts the training, but the associates themselves.  If you plan on working here, I recommend knowing how to communicate with your SM, and from there be brutally honest with the training program; was it efficient? sufficient? thorough? rushed?  If you don't communicate, they will hold you accountable without hesitation."
good,"Unless you desire to move up in management, it is good place to get where you need to go if you need to make extra cash. The work is easy but the environment due to demand and sometimes lack of organization can be stressful. This is my experience with the store (s) I worked at, not just one in particular. I have heard it varies from store to store. As an employee in all my stores I made as many positive changes as I could but because it is a corporate company you can only do so much unless you are management."
good,Fun place to work but can be tedious and overwhelming because there are so many rules.  Shift leaders were nice but many times their positions made them act like they had too much power.
good,"A great start for anyone 16-24, but requires a lot of patience and multi tasking skill. Overall, it's not so bad, but it's hard to do for a long time."
good,"Starbucks is a fine place ... to spend very little time. The company still sells itself - exceptionally hard - to ""partners"" in an attempt to retain talent, but management is very much hit-or-miss, which makes the overall experience that much more spotty. When employed, there can be a tendency to be swept into the cultural black hole that is being a ""Partner,"" but the camaraderie between coworkers is every bit a coping mechanism - we generally stick together, if only because it's so difficult to show the challenges of the company to outsiders. That said, the camaraderie is indeed a plus, and the public interaction can be as enjoyable as one allows. I'd certainly recommend the job as a temporary or (very) part time experience, but if seeking a career, despite what the company would have you believe, seek elsewhere."
good,"I worked for Starbucks in a licensed store."
good,"very hard job"
good,Working there it wasn’t like it was really bad job it was just interfering with my other job. Plus I moved cities and didn’t want to have to start again at a different site
good,"Admittedly, while I love Starbucks coffee, I do not look back at my days there with much fondness. I loved the people I worked with and there was a certain amount of camaraderie built from the poor management, agonizing hours, and general stress that came from being the busiest store in the district and also the most under-staffed. As someone fresh out of college, I looked at it as having a job first and foremost, but the stress became too much, particularly for the absolutely abysmal pay that would not have covered room rent if I hadn't been living at home at the time. There was never a shortage of work to do from the first minute on the clock to the last and even worse when you had a slew of no-call-no-show employees, management that were ill-equipped to step in and help, and oftentimes no more than two individuals to run a busy drive-thru store. There was no PTO accrued until one full year of full-time employment and, let's be honest, starting work at four in the morning is agonizing and mostly unnecessary. The hardest part of working here had to be balancing everything the job expected of you and covering for plenty of other people at the same time. I enjoyed talking to customers and learning about them and working at Starbucks taught me a great deal about being a human being and genuinely polite. Some days absolutely sucked but it was never enough to make me think it was okay to treat someone the same way I had been treated. All of my coworkers were in much the same boat but working with them was truly the most enjoyable experience, from keeping spirits high and having"
good,i would like to say the starbuck eniviorment was great as fair as pay and hour schedualing i can say i had a very bad manger that didnt do what was needed until to late
good,"It was okay for a part time job, anything else isnt really worth all the stress. Also, they had me close one night and open the next morning which was very stressful and I didnt get enough sleep. Also, not every person is trained correctly so there is a lot of miscommunication"
good,Did not enjoy the management at my store and the culture was hard to work in. I loved what I did and the customers were the best part. Starbucks gave me an experience that I could base my career on.
good,Its my first barista experience. I really like and enjoy it. However working hours not regular and not enough in the week and this is the most disturbing point for me. I believe that the most important thing is to be satisfied and happy in working place with regular salary!.
good,You were always on your feet and always busy but the coworkers made it fun. The learning curve is steep at first but practicing over and over is the best way to learn all you have to know.
good,"company offer discount  to employees. Employee turnover is high, you are not guarantee to work your schedule shift, you get sent home if store is not bussy."
good,Enjoyed working here for the short period. Truly enjoyed my manager and the opportunity to excel every day. It was a very fast paced environment and truly pushed me to my limits every day
good,Working at Starbucks had its good and bad days. for me management was extremely poor and i was targeted along with other employees which resulted in loss of job. I just ended in a bad store. other than that the job itself is quick paced and can be a great first time job it pays extremely well and has great health benefits as well as complimentary drinks and food! Also great experience working as a team.Customers can go both ways at times can be extremely rude or can be a great bonding experience all around.
good,"The best part of the job is also the most difficult and frustrating - working as part of a team. It's nice to have the shared experience, but it is as challenging as any job to address and overcome conflict and negative attitudes, when you have to work quickly and efficiently with people in a confined space. Some days are great and you get a good flow with your coworkers, some days are miserable. Some customers are kind and gracious, some are abusive and horrible, most are pretty neutral."
good,"The people I worked with were great. Fun and very friendly, but not the job for me. Very fast paced which helps the time pass, and there is always something to keep you busy."
good,Starbucks has a great culture. You will have to work hard at starbucks. this is not a place where you will get away with not working. get ready to do everything.
good,"discounted food, didnt like happy hour as you cant get treated very badly, early start early finish good location, close to home ok place to work on the whole"
good,"Working during rush is great if you like working under pressure.  A lot of the shifts, should not be shifts.  There are many great store managers but because of the work staff, the good workers will be singled out and stuck with workers that do not pull there wait.  There are many empty promises of advancement because of the district manager(at least in my area of operation). Store managers do there best to reward hard workers. Overall, great college job but difficult for a non student to get hours."
good,I met new people everyday and most days was fun with my regulars that knew me personally. I enjoyed making my drinks and every season was always something new. Always a opportunity to learn and move up.
good,"I absolutely loved my partners while I was working at Starbucks.  The corporation as a whole did not care about their employees.  While they offer great benefits, the lack of support on the floor and the amount of work required for this job meant everyone had to do the work of 3 people and I don't believe they compensated well enough for that."
good,"The management tends to be biased whichever location you choose and the management that is considered higher, as in the district managers up to the higher tiers, seem to have a disconnect with the staff. It's disappointing to see the management take their frustrations out on their workers."
good,"I really enjoyed my training and my coworkers were very nice. However, I felt that the Lead on duty would sometimes misinterpret my trying to understand as not wanting to be working."
good,"The location I work at was well known to be one of the worst, but that was apparently due to the manager. The people were fantastic, and working was always fun and I was constantly learning and enjoying myself even with the few unpleasant customers. Then management changed and so did everything, people unfit for the job were hired and our manager was unhelpful and cut everyones hours. Eventually she quit too and now we have a new manager who seems to be very nice, but most of the older people have quit because of the changes and work is no longer as fun as it once was, and I still have very few hours even though I've stated the minimum I need. I'm still going to stay if I get a new job, but it won't be my primary source of income."
good,Nice place to work great benefits alot of communtiy work invloved also a place where you can have a chance to grow in your career. only downside you will constantly smell like coffee
good,Being a barista is more difficult than it looks. Especially if you are working in a busy location. It can be very stressful to focus on the person ordering while moving the line.
good,"If you love coffee this is job for you can learn so much.You can meat so many great people."
good,Being a barista was fine but shift managing was a nightmare because the store manager I was under was awful. When management is terrible everything else is terrible.
good,"I genuinely enjoyed working at this location, it was decently busy every day. The customers are usually in a rush but never rushed enough to be rude. There is always always something to keep everyone who is working busy. However there are a few very blatant issues having to do specifically with who was willing to do everything they needed to do and which managers were easily and readily available. A few of the managers are noticeably better at handling and being appropriate with the employees than others."
good,Excellent company culture of inclusiveness
good,"Variant hours so hard to have a social life. Can move upwards in career but not often available, unless someone higher up leaves. Working in a close team so you do build close relationships with everyone, you may not always get along but you need to work through it. Manager is amazing, goes above and beyond to ensure you're happy there."
good,"over all summary its great working here you will learn a lot,friendly staffs,nice store high technology machines for making coffee,amazing customers.very delicious pastry."
good,"Enjoy working, short working period, meal provided, healthy panel provided"
good,"Launched Starbucks at that particular Meijer, Learned Starbucks products and lingo. Made lasting friendships that I have to this day. Was close to home"
good,"I enjoyed working for Starbucks for the few years I did. I know I wouldn't enjoy it now, its become so sales focused and so many costumers are feelings uncared for."
good,"Starbucks was my first ""real"" job when I was a sophomore in High School. I would recommend it as a good starting place for someone to enter the world of customer service. That's not to say there isn't room for growth and possible career potential for those that are interested. I learned things working at Starbucks that have stayed with me and still use today."
good,"The people were picky at times but after awhile you get used to it and they respect you more once you start to see them more often. Some of the best coworkers ever there, but management was ridiculous. Everything was out of control, constantly ran out of things causing customers to be upset. To top it all off as soon as you would mention these issues to my manager she would get all defensive and do nothing to improve it. Coworkers always called off with no repercussions and if you could do so much for my boss but she would do nothing back."
good,"As empresas era muito boa, profissional e didática"
good,"Starbucks has many great things to offer as a company.  Some of the awesomeness is the benefits.  The health insurance, 401k, stock sharing, free coffee/tea, and discounts are all amazing!!!  Time off is hard to get approved.  When it comes to vacation, as the manager, it is up to you to make sure your store has another manager covering and sometimes, your peers are too overwhelmed to help out.  District Managers give very little direction and help in running the business.  They pretty much come to your store and tell you what you are doing wrong and that it needs to be fixed.    As a Store Manager, there is little work/life balance.  It all rests on you.  There are hourly supervisors that are supposed to be your frontline leadership, however, the company gives them little to no authority!  This makes it challenging for those supervisors to be taken seriously as leaders.  "
good,I love my job and I have always wanted to work here. Benefits are great. All depends on manager for how the store will run (good/bad). Also the location.
good,Starbucks is very energetic and fun place to work at. Partners are very friendly and care each other. There are ups and downs but overall it's pretty good place to work.
good,"Opportunities to move up from no skill to management if you work hard. The job is not easy, the customers are difficult and it is very fast paced work, but the teams are fun, and the job itself is not difficult once you get the hang of all the recipes and the flow of a day. Moving up is worth it, but managers (the good ones) work really hard and don't get paid quite enough, and are always on call. Beyond being a store manager, the chances to move up are slim, because being a district manager is not a common position (1 DM for 13-15 stores) and the security of the job means no one leaves. Baristas and Shift Supervisors seem to have the most fun of the job. Uniform is easy. Free coffee and food for employees, also free online education once eligible. Benefits available for employees that work more than 20 hrs per week. And in the end, it's just coffee."
good,There are always going to be different management styles and that is something I experienced where I worked. The company is great and very thorough but the team I worked with needed a change.
good,"I've worked at three Starbucks locations and all three have had different pros and cons. "
good,"I made coffee, made sure the shop always looked presentable. made sure all my customers left happy and satisfied with my service. I met people from all around the world."
good,"A wall of text is something that is frowned upon in most, actually virtually all Internet societies, including forums, chat boards, and Uncyclopedia. You s"
good,"I love Starbucks, however, it's a different story being behind the counter. In the 6 months I was there, there were at least 3 different managers that rolled through the store. The other staff was friendly and helpful. Good discounts for employees, but low pay for such a fast-paced, stressful environment."
good,"During my 13 year career within Starbucks, the culture of the company changed dramatically, It went from an employee driven company where our concerns were heard to a company in which you were just a number and easily replaced. They would constantly implement new policies and procedures which worked in the stores they were tested, but on a much larger scale constantly failed."
good,A great environment to build on multitasking skills.  it was extremely competitive and the team work was inspiring.  The management was not as developed in new locations
good,"-Hardly enough time ot complete tasks within specified time"
good,"If you get a good Store Manager and District Manager, you're golden. However, a lot of management isn't good. A lot of the District Managers are rude, pushy and out of touch, and a lot of store managers are bullied by the DM so they get desperate and do sketchy things, and expect their staff to do the same. The pay is low, but the benefits are pretty decent for a job like this. The company culture is technically great, but not a lot of that trickles down to the baristas and supervisors. Good for a job through high-school and college but I'd never do it full-time. Too stressful and the quality of drinks and food have gone down over the years."
good,"An immersive and happy going place to work aside from rushes, sales, and customer service. It is a beneficial company to be integrated into with schooling as well as 401k and stock benefits."
good,"Work is pretty repetitious, no challenges except for demanding customers, thus being the hardest part of the job. Enjoyable part of the job is that it's easy going, and free drinks before and after work, as well as within breaks."
good,The management and staff were very nice. Most of the regular customers were pretty nice as well. But there were so many customers that came in every day and demanded the moon.
good,"it was very fast paced"
good,"Starbucks is a great first job to have. They provide incredible benefits to their partners, including health insurance, 401k, tuition reimbursement, and even free stock! However, the downside is that, depending on the store, the job can be very stressful and even depressing. While you make invaluable friendships and learn a lot, morale is often low due to high expectations from the company, demanding customers, poor management, and unimpressive pay for the work. Getting promoted does not pay very well and it's rare to see someone climb from barista to store manager."
good,You must be able to take individual orders because each drink is going to be completely different. The workplace is inclusive and team orientated and filled with many great regular customers!
good,"Being there for almost 5 years, there were some great benefits to take advantage of; The 401k options, the health benefits, and the job overall was not that awful. But you were not paid well, even with tenure, as well, if you were short staffed, you could be in for a long night."
good,"Very fast pace productive and energetic environment"
good,Fast paced upbeat hi energy very diverse  different every shift very flexible schedule  good at allowing last minute accommodations family friendly and the foods good
good,"Le management n'est pas optimal néanmoins, l'équipe fait son maximum pour répondre aux demandes des clients et des chiffres. "
good,"People live in their cubes, do their jobs, and go home.  There is not alot of innovation or any incentive to do so.  Innovation is contracted out to the consultants you'll see in the office.."
good,I love working at Starbucks. We make a good amount of money for a first job. I learned so much when it comes to preparing our drinks and meeting customers. Our Management needs some work though. The hardest part of our job is the ever-changing schedule. Nothing ever stays the same and I get put on the schedule at times that I've listed as NOT AVAILABLE.
good,"While Starbucks is a good company to work with, the grocery store that owned it I felt made some moments stressful. The pay is decent but the work is hard. Managers made complaints towards baristas schedules though it couldn't be helped because they are in school. Other stations seemed to not take kindly to baristas and our equipment and supplies were not treated with respect. While I enjoyed many of my regular customers and other baristas, there is a somewhat hostile air that is hard to ignore and I feel like more of a burden than a part of the company."
good,I enjoyed working at Starbucks because I was working alongside a roommate. Nobody liked the manager at the time. The man was two-faced towards his employees.
good,Good place to work with benefits and is flexible with scheduling and you get tips. And meet some cool people and work with some cool people and learn a lot
good,Learn the various drink ingredients and process. Meet and greet customers. Mark the products with an expiration date to ensure freshness. Exert professionalism to all co-workers and customers.
good,"mucho el trabajo diario por poco sueldo. Se aprende mucho sobre cafés y orígenes de los mismos. difícil era trabajar a contrarreloj en los horarios punta, y lograr que el cliente se fuera con buena impresión y con ganas de volver mientras se realizaban las tareas de limpieza."
good,"Very fun place to work. Wages are very low though, not really up to cost-of-living standards in the slightest. "
good,nice environment staff can be fun at times a lot of favoritism. customers can be great at times but a bit bipolar its fun you meet a lot of good and funny people
good,Its a great job and it is easy to catch on to. The customers will get to you if you do not know how to control your temper I would not recommend this job for you.
good,"Starbucks overall, wasn't too bad of a place to get started. My coworker s always knew how to make a work environment enjoyable and I love the energy that comes with the work."
good,"If you like fast paced work, with lots of available hours, this is the job for you. There is room for advancement and lots of benefits, but you get mistreated by customers on a daily basis with little to no help from upper management. You get to make daily connections with customers but the downfall will always be the lack of support from management and entitlement from customers."
good,"I absolutely enjoyed my job at Panera, however the poor management is what lead me into quitting. For an example, my dad passed away the same year I began working at Panera and right after my dad passed away the store I was working at went through a management change, and the new manager tried to punish me for the time lost due to my dad dying."
good,it was a great work environment and we all ha fun while working there but it was a war trying to get enough hours to make it worth working there at all.
good,"I would highly recommend this job to anyone who loves to socialize with people, and has good communication skills. This job is meant for someone who does not get mad easily and has patience."
good,"Making coffee all day long for pretentious people that spend $8/day on a cup of coffee. I would not recommend working here to anyone, except those that I love."
good,"Quick paced, have to be a quick leaner.You're on your feet for six to eight hours a day. The most enjoyable part is the teamwork between everyone, and the hardest is when someone's having a bad day."
good,Trying to balance this supervising position with college life was rough. The management team I was under expected was not understanding of my class schedule at all.
good,"You come on shift, and it’s kind of as the customer demands and stuff. There’s a long line, you can be jumping in and rotating somebody off bar or jumping on the cash register – maybe just doing whatever’s needed in the moment. If it’s a fairly slow day, you could just be walking in, maybe help getting the store restocked, set up for the next rush. Go in with a big personality and have fun with it. I think that’s really what the corporation looks for."
good,"This job is great for students and is a fun way to make friends and broaden customer service experience. While I enjoyed most of this work environment, sometimes there were conflicts between the treatment of the management towards the employees. Some issues with scheduling, but usually worked out in real time. Overall, a good place to work, if you enjoy customer interaction and can withstand long periods of standing and hours on foot."
good,Starbucks is a great place for Teen/ College age persons to start out making decent money with flexible hours. Some of the best lessons in work and life were learned and my best friends of my life were made at starbucks.
good,"A Prendi coisa nova,é um ótimos lugares,me adapto rápido,aprendo rápido..."
good,"Typically the morning shifts have a ""rush"" which falls between seven and nine am. During this rush the store serves its highest number of patrons whether in the lobby or the drive thru. Management is usually in the BOH making next weeks schedule while the shift supervisor deploys and ensures operational efficiency. As a shift supervisor I learned great customer services skills. I also learned great inventory, time, and partner management skills as well. The company culture varies from store to store because all training and development is different at various locations. The hardest part of the job is delivering the desired transaction/profit numbers when  you are short or understaffed. The most enjoyable part of the job are the connections you make with other partners or regular customers."
good,too much work too little pay. they expected us to do way too much while putting the customers first. i should not have to clean that much and only get paid minimum wage.
good,Overall the company provides a proper fit to society and has well mannered customer service but overall i do not view my skill set in this job field unless i am in dire need of money.
good,A typical data Starbucks is very fast paced and busy. We have a strong team environment and try to create a fun work place while handing the large amount of customers we get on a daily.
good,Great place to learn customer service skills. Fun and friendly environment. Great place for students or people who are passionate about coffee. many opportunities to move up in the company.
good,It was a solid experience. they look out for their own back when i worked there. i left because schultz left and the company focus shifted from looking out for their own to looking to make a profit. its a shame.
good,i worked here for 4 years and it was a positive environment. i got to work with a lot of fun people and drink free coffee. they offer the best benefits
good,"Busy work but not enough pay."
good,A typical starbucks morning was hectic very quick paced and dirty and relied heavily on teamwork. However through that I learned to work in a team more than I ever have.
good,I loved working at Starbucks until a few really bad Managers.  They were promoting all the wrong people. And too few people to live up to the standards or keep anyonr sane.
good,"Manager was super condescending and controlling. If you aren’t friends with anyone upper management then forget being promoted. Coffee knowledge was fantastic otherwise, and felt that if management was different I would’ve been more successful."
good,"its okay working here, not very high pay or advancement opportunities.Looking for a different job but taking this job hard to be serious about due to  pay shortness."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks requires the patience of a saint, the speed of a cheetah, and the endurance of a mountain. In this kind of job, management can wax and wane like the moon. There will be time of peace and times of chaos, depending on the strength of a manager and their team."
good,"Fun workplace culture, hard work, poor pay. Lots of cleaning, fast paced environment, little down time. Delivering customer service 24/7 and serving high quality drinks and beverages."
good,"I worked at Starbucks for four years. When I first started working, there were rumors of hours and shifts being cut to make up for lack of sales. In those four years, I saw a continuous cut in available labor hours despite increases in sales. These cuts were subtle at first, but 20 hours were pulled per week in my last year. Our sales were increasing, customer numbers were good, but they still kept cutting hours. I can write an essay on why, but long story short, profit margin is and always will take precedent over workers' health and sanity in every industry, everywhere."
good,"I enjoyed the fast, friendly, and creative atmosphere that Starbucks created for the team. I learned how to manage time and tasks well to ensure that the team was equipped for the rush."
good,"good benefits"
good,starbucks got me started on my carrier as a barista. cant say i enjoyed working there but it gave me the skills to move on to more enjoyable jobs in the field
good,"Tolerable work environment. Amazing customers depending what time of day. Loyal, and sometimes patient. Poor management but great baristas, and correct drinks."
good,"Although management is not the greatest, the employees and regular customers makes work fun. Benefits are great so make sure to take advantage of them!"
good,"It is a great company to work for, it needs to provide more growth opportunities with a positive mindset. It was hard to see store managers not have a healthy work life balance and it caused store environment to be stressful. The company has shifted more towards money and less about the people who work with love and passion. I love this company but some leadership do not represent the brand as Seattle would wish they would."
good,"You will undergo extremely rough situations and standards. Causing a lot of anxiety and unnecessary stress. Benefits are great, but only would recomend for that. Work environment is not a good one."
good,"this job was great when I first started and the crew of girls were close. I made great money, enjoyed engaging with the regulars and had fun making the drinks. The workplace changed as soon as certain managers were fired and new people were hired. We had to follow Starbucks and Target guidelines so there was no balance. We would get yelled at some days for dress code or having a drink behind the counter where some days the managers were fine with things."
good,If you’re looking for something that you need to pay all of your bills Starbucks is not the place for you. I’ve been working here a little over 3 years now and there’s a lot of different things you can do. It is very competitive and very fast paced sometimes it’s hard to keep up so if you’re looking for something chill this is not the place for you.
good,"The benefits that Starbucks offers are numerous and exceptional in their own right. The insurance itself is paid by the employee at greatly discounted prices. However, the stores that I worked in each had their own downfalls often related to lack of training in very key aspects of day to day work."
good,"As the day starts we would go threw a meeting to get us all caught up on the day and the pervious day, with any problems or issues, then we would stretch and put on our ppe. To follow we would go out onto the floor to our pick mods and/or out pallets and start palletizing our product or picking the product in certain locations. There would be a 3 hour rotation threwout your shift, one would be a light rotation the other a heavy one, and you would alternate for the 4 rotations. then after 2 you would have a half hour lunch fallowed by another kick off to be informed about how the night was going and to see what our amounts of picks are, and to stretch out again. To hit the floor for the last two times, then to have the last half hour to clean up and go home."
good,"It was a busy coffee shop, especially in the morning there was a long customer line. We have to take order and do cashier quickly , and deliver as soon as possible. It was inside lobby after TSA."
good,I am slightly annoyed that I have to give a summary of a job that I quit because the management made it unbearable to do my job.  Customer service is soul sucking work don't ever do it if you can humanly manage.
good,"Good culture, good job, not worth the amount of customer interactions for the pay. They offer benefits that make up for the low pay, but if you don't intend to use them then find a job with a better salary."
good,Starbucks had a great culture about it. I adore coffee and loved to learn about it and it's different cultures. I also loved my coworkers and their teamwork.
good,bad management and bad people skills.Loved the people but management made it hard for me to enjoy a day at work. other then that the customers always cameback for me
good,"a place you have to always smile, stay on top of your position. if you love coffee youre at the right place, theres so many varieties of flavors to choose from"
good,"Even in a management or supervisor role, the staff doesn't get paid nearly enough for what they are doing. The benefits are great, but without the proper compensation, are entirely unaffordable. I would only recommend this as a part time job for a high school or maybe an entry-level college student."
good,You get to learn new skills. The management could be improved. The wages are nothing special. The hours are close to none and they pick favorites. The benefits are good though and workers become life long friends.
good,"Starbucks has a great mission, public agenda, and coffee.  But, they're so unstructured!  They talk about simplifying things for the store partners in one month, and then in the next month they're pushing complicated new products and processes out with minimal testing to see if it'll work.  I understand that they're in the tough spot of performing for shareholders while still providing a great place to work for their partners, but a lot of the culture feels very forced and fake.  Their huge saving grace with me is the benefits.  I think the pay is poor and I don't know how people afford to live in Seattle AND afford to work there, but the benefits are incredible.  My wife and I were able to take advantage of fertility benefits and I was looking forward to the new Paternity Leave they put in place, but I got laid off instead.  My manager spent next to zero time with me 1-on-1 and they have terrible systems and processes in place for development and growth.  However, much like my headline says... it depends on what team you end up on."
good,"This is a good job for a seasonal or part time unless you work overtime. Management wasn't too bad, busy hours were hard due to being short handed a lot."
good,Customer service is a must. It would be to your advantage to come in with a great attitude so that it could be passed on to the customer in order to create a great experience.
good,It ok working here you gain great experience.coffee discount and food items. One coffee bag or tea mark out flexible with your schedule. Meet great ppl
good,Fun work place with great benefits but long hrs and no real training environment its kind of here you go sink or swim. This was extremely disheartening as it seemed like a good opportunity for growth but after 8 months I realized that there were few to no opportunities unless you are willing to move
good,"working here was a great experience. this could have been a better experience if there was better management. I am optimistic that starbucks has a great mission, I just hope one day they live up to that standard."
good,Starbucks had a lot of positive impact. It was very fast paced and fun. the only thing I would state against it is the uniformity and the stressful pace.
good,"It could've been better.  Management was really lax and didn't hold people accountable for their requirements especially the new recruits that were poorly trained. Store manager was kind and great but she let the team get away with murder cause she didn't feel comfortable writing people up so after a while the environment became stressful where as you had to pick up after everyone. Starbucks itself is pretty great though, great benefits, flexible hours especially for those going to school."
good,"It was a fun environment to work in and I meet a lot of cool people. I had poor management with I believe may have ruined my experience. But the job itself was fun, the customers were just often rude and a lot of co workers didn't understand how to deescalate a situation."
good,"The hours hours available to work were good for me because eI am also a full-time student, but the company is more concerned about their profits than they are about partner or customer experience. Very rarely did I get the number of hours I wanted to work per week, most shifts are short so they don't have to give you a lunch, and they do not value partner-customer relationships, and would rather rush people through than create an experience with them."
good,The job itself was alright. If I had worked a stand alone store it would have been different but Target really likes to make you work in multiple departments so it made working Starbucks stressful.
good,Great company that can improve by providing a better salary to its employees. Usually a rush on a daily basis and usually always a different schedule.
good,"If you stay in Starbucks you will most likely stay in the same position for 2 to maybe 4 years with out a competitive salary.  The most rewarding aspect of this job is that people you get to work with.  There are some customers that make the job truly rewarding as well, but they are few and far between, depending on the market you are working in.  Great starter job, but not a long lasting career unledd something changes."
good,I would like to become a shift manager and move up in the company however I currently need a higher paying job with steady hours. Starbucks is an amazing company to work for and it’s hard for me to want to leave but there are a few issues in my specific store.
good,"Ambiente agradável, desafiador e propício ao aprendizado."
good,It is a good company. The culture is very soft and people are allowed to get away with a lot. There is not consistency on how they hold leadership accountable and it is sad.
good,"I have worked at two locations. One was relaxed, and individual focus vs team focus balanced. I loved the culture. My current location is the complete opposite. The culture is stressful and numbers-oriented. Find a team you mesh well with and stick with it!"
good,"good fun place fun pace to work friendly customers, great co workers .Was able to gain new experience learn thing about coffee  that I never imagined had a lot of fun"
good,"Starbucks pays decently and provides good benefits for fast food. However, at the end of the day, its still fast food. There's little room for advancement, hard to eek out a living even when you're working 40 hours a week and the management cant range from great to terrible."
good,"Starbucks tries to take care of their partners with all the benefits they offer like health care, stock benefits, retirement, and college tuition at ASU. Hourly wages could honestly be better but aren't terrible. The number hours per week is the most common issue because you cannot survive off of parttime wages. The biggest issue with working for Starbucks is upper management. Store Managers and District Managers get little to no support for things going on within their stores. They get generic feedback from managers who are in their stores maybe 1 time a year at very most. All stores are judged the same even though store needs vary store by store."
good,"Very fast pace and high energy workplace. The company promotes a team atmosphere and it can be like a family. However, training for new baristas is not what it used to be. Great access to benefits for part time employees. The stores are often open from before dawn until after 10pm, some stores much later. So keep the schedule in mind."
good,"Working at Starbucks was pretty good at times. Just like working in food service anywhere it was quite annoying at times. Especially considering the area I worked in was filled with privilege, entitled customers that took coffee a lot more serious than most you'd be around on your average Tuesday but whatever."
good,"As one of Starbuck's ""partners"", I worked hard to keep up with long lines and overcompensate for weak co-workers.  The culture is very superficial and profit maximization is the only thing that really matters."
good,While it's a fun place to work there was no room for growth. Same stuff just a different day . Management had it's favorites . HR  door was always closed.
good,If staff and management are good it’s very enjoyable. Depends on each store. Unpaid breaks but free drinks and free coffee each week. Customers can be rude and hours can be long.
good,"If you're a young adult in school or pursing other aspirations, Starbucks is a great company to both grow at a person and make some money and meet new people. It's a great place to work while still figuring out your life."
good,"Its an ok place to work if your looking for a paycheck, definitely nor for advancment or competitive pay. Managers are usually laid back but customers can be a pain somethins Good luck!"
good,for the most part starbucks is a great company but you never stop moving. if you not making drinks you scrubing floors or doing a ton of dishes. this is not a relaxed job.
good,"Fast-paced environment. Diversity among staff. Awesome benefits, easy to maintain. Repetitive days. ""Standards/Policies"" constantly inconsistent among stores and districts."
good,"Nice working environment, "
good,"-  A company that invests in you but in certain markets has too much talent to move forward in market.  "
good,"Working at starbucks has not been that bad. The pay is decent, and my coworkers have been friendly. Every once in a while there is a customer that treats you poorly."
good,"If you're starting out there, you will most likely be on cash/drive thru at the beginning. For me, there was nice really time to get used to making drinks. It was usually always busy. The closing is pretty rough. The free drinks and food was pretty great though."
good,"Overall, decent job. Great flexible hours, proper work breaks. Nice co-workers. Knowledge of all the food and beverage."
good,"Starbucks offers great benefits, if you are able to take advantage of them. It is constantly a busy and fast paced environment. Management needs improvement. Even on the worst days, its the people who make it worth staying at starbucks, not the pay."
good,Good position for people not looking to make too much money and need a flexible schedule. If you work hard you can work hard to make a little more money.
good,Fun but stressful. Not paid well enough for what you are doing every day. High stress environment with fun people to work with. Management is poor and product is hard to keep. Need to learn how to stock for high capacity stores.
good,"Starbucks was a fast-paced environment. Everyday at work was spent moving around the store, cleaning, preparing beverages and food, stocking different items. I learned how to better work with others who I didn't necessarily get along with and be a better leader. Management was good, they did their best to give us the schedules that worked best for our lives. Workplace culture was good, sometimes stressful. The hardest part of the job were the days we were under or short staffed. The best part of my job was interacting with customers and making their day better."
good,"proyecto personal, fui ejecutor y administrador de la misma."
good,"I love the current management. Very flexible scheduling, great as a second job or parents hours. Hardest part of the job is learning everything. If you are slow pick up the pace or move out."
good,I loved most of my time working with Starbucks. Under good management it's one of the best jobs I've ever had. When it's not great management it's hard.
good,"I loved working here, playbook was in FULL EFFECT! learned more about starbucks here and the culture vs corporate! loved my co workers and the music is very upbeat and funky."
good,"Straightforward corporate-run food/coffee place. Good job for college-age people to get by on, probably doesn't pay enough for someone really trying to make money."
good,"great company to work for, great to job to build customer service experience. Great job to build team work skills as well because in this environment team work is a necessity."
good,This job was a good job overall to me. It was supposed to be a stepping stone for me and I ended up staying longer than intended. It seems that it is the case for most everyone I worked with.
good,"A typical day at work was mostly fun and upbeat. I learned a lot there about handling stress, and dealing with all kinds of different customers. I made friends there that will last a life time, half of the time work didnt feel like work and it was absolutely wonderful. The management on the other hand was not so good. I always felt like my boss had mine and other baristas back when there was issues or conflict and that was never the case. There was a lot of confidentiality being thrown around barista to barista from the manager and it was a lot of personal things. Management never helped their team on the floor when struggling and so forth. The hardest part would be the actual job itself for keeping up with a high demand of quality drinks in a very fast paced time while connecting with customers all at the same time. The most enjoyable part was the coworkers. They made work feel like it was just a little party and  no matter how hard the job got, we were all going down together, it was a beautiful team with great connections."
good,"Must be self- motivating."
good,"While Starbucks isn't really something I'd want to do for the rest of my life, it is a decent place to start out when you are just coming into the workforce and you're trying to get on your feet as a new adult. The pay is okay, and a lot of the people I met when I worked there were very helpful in teaching me how to work in the job setting."
good,A good company with good culture & work environment. there is a lot to learn about the food retail operations. much recommended to begin your career with.
good,"Starbucks is great in terms of flexibility for people that are still in school and have weird availabilities. I have had many managers, some great and some terrible so management can be very hit or miss."
good,I was responsible for 14 stores in downtown Boston. I was in stores 5 days a week check on product quality and overall execution. The hours were very good and the benefits were excellent
good,"Starbucks is a good place to learn humility and how to work hard. They have many seasonal specials that will keep you busy, so it requires you to work fast."
good,"Fun, quick-paced, balanced (depending on who your teammates are). We rarely ever get complaints. Hardest part would be when a partner doesn't communicate that they'll be late, calling out, ""no call, no shows""."
good,Starbucks is a good college job if you are looking for a flexible schedule and pocket money. The atmosphere is well oriented to help partners acclimate to a team environment.
good,"During my time here, the management were very friendly, approachable and happy to take on employees with little to no barista training. Whilst they were usually too busy to train me in coffee making, they were able to begin showing me how to record and handle stock intake."
good,The hardest part of the job was that we were not trained properly before being put on the floor to face the customers. The staff turnover was high.The shift pattern was inflexible.
good,"學到很多但工時長經常OT,工作環境清潔因為基本上都是自己和其他Barista(咖啡調配員)清潔,清潔工作很多但工資卻未如理想,但很充實"
good,"Starbucks is well known around the world, so there is an appeal working for such a big brand. An experience working for Starbucks does depend on each individual store. In my case my colleagues were brilliant to work with, and it was a brilliant working environment."
good,"Fast paced, a lot of tasks and running around. Can become disorderly and chaotic during rush. But we create personal experiences with customers and get to grow socially."
good,"Flexible hours, great staff, fun environment. Great company to work for, best for students who need flexible hours. Not ideal for long term career, unless retail is your passion."
good,"it nice to communicate with customers, it feels like it is not just making coffee but making friends. Partners were very nice to me too"
good,"Very corporate feel. All stores are very consistent, working in a few of them through training & meetings was definitely well organized. Expectations of sales of team were set a little high & would effect team morale at some point and upset customers at points because some of their standard targets are unrealistic for management to hit. Training program was intensive & great someone could do the online training & easily start right away with a good idea of their job. "
good,"Very fast pace, lots of customer interaction, lots of customer service, must be good at multi-tasking, must be good with around and with coworkers in close proximity"
good,"I was in charge of opening the store every morning by 4:30am, plus getting the food and products ready for the next day, I was in charge of 300 to open the store, then when my shift was over I had to walk threw the airport with 300 plus in my bag"
good,"opening really early,smelling coffee,setting up for the day. Getting someone you get up that early and open with you is very hard. But i learned,if you show a positive attitude the will too."
good,It's a good place to work at if you want to be busy on your feet. Management is wonderful very understanding and work with you. Baristas are super nice . Great environment
good,"I would say it really depends on which location you work at, but because it is a popular part time job for high school and freshman university students, you should be prepared to work in that type of environment. I have worked with at least three people who have a ""superiority complex"" even though we get paid the same wage, and have the same title. Apparently working 2 months longer than someone gives you the right to boss them around. It is absolutely ridiculous. Again, this may be different with location, as my location was actually ranked as the worst in terms of customer service in the region."
good,"the customers are the only problem areas i ever experienced. the business used to not focus so much on a fast food type mentality. The drive through has destroyed the handcrafted experience and is at odds with their policy of creating a genuinely positive customer experience. How do you have time when you're constantly expected to be fast, and friendly all the while educating every guest that comes into the store about a product their ignorant of?"
good,Very fun I loved the bar. Wish they paid more I would of stayed. I worked at the airport t very fast pace always short staffed but the crew knew how to make the best out of it. I always had fund
good,"Amazing place to work if you find the right fit, but the one and only thing I totally disliked was the low checks I would receive. Beside that, a ton of great perks I want in my lifetime."
good,"If you have the right team on the floor it can be the most fun, rewarding job ever. If you constantly get people who did not like the job and wanted to be lazy, it was not much fun at all because you have to pick up their slack."
good,I have learned about customer service and services that provide and enjoyed to work with others and know well and understanding about task and work and been through lots of consequences and manage it well and having a team work .
good,"Se aprende bastante pero es muy cansados , hay que estar todo el dia en movimiento"
good,"very friendly atmosphere, the relationship between barista and the everyday customers is was kept me going while working there. I am a chef so seeing another side of the industry was very beneficial to me."
good,"Needed more of a professional touch, too lax about being on time, work ethic and attitude. Promotions varied wildly and followed no set guidelines, Not enough dedication tot he job to reflect better on the work floor. Easy enough job, great working with customers, no real challenge after you've learned all relevant recipes and codes."
good,"Angry co-worker and job was extremely stressful.  However, the health insurance is great and cash tips are nice.  Some insane/creepy/rude managers, but this is par for the course in the food industry.  Overall, I don't think Starbucks is a terrible company, but I would not recommend working there full-time."
good,No comment at this time. Everyone has their own experience working for the Starbucks company. It's a great place it just has its ups and downs realistically.
good,Starbucks is a good job with good benefits and good hours. The major problem with them is that there is very little mobility and ability to move up in the company. They tend to hire outside management.
good,"Starbucks offers competitive benefits but low and stagnant wages.  Starbucks tends to hire people that get along well together, making for an enjoyable work environment.  The most difficult part of the job was the need to work to exacting specifications in a quick and efficient  manner."
good,Good fast paced enviorment but doesnt allow for genuine connecting to customers. Will work you to the bone and stress sale window times. Starbucks is just a fast food job with a different look.
good,"Overall a good work experience. Didn't work that well with school schedule. Very nice for people who like a fast-paced job. Also a nice place to stick around, regulars will recognize and appreciate you."
good,"I like working for starbucks, they give you great benefits and opportunity's for advancement in the company.i believe the pay should be higher and you should have a set schedule"
good,"The people that work at Starbucks are hard to deal with and the overall job atmosphere is tedious and stressful. However the job does have fantastic benefits, especially for part time employees."
good,The workplace is always high energy with plenty new and old customers walking thru the doors. Building connections with the regular customers was a big deal and allowed for more sales.
good,"Starbucks, in general, is a positive environment to work within. I believe in their mission and committment to partners, the environment, tuition reimbursement, focus on customer service, and quality. I enjoyed my time with Starbucks and I am thankful to them for the seven years I spent at the company. I learned a great deal about coffee quality, the internal workings of a large corporation, and how a company can remain true to their values while still maintaining profitability."
good,Shifts bring life problems to work. Job and culture is amazing.pay is great. Serving customers is the best part. Dress code is good. Job advancement isnt that great.
good,"Starbucks was like a little family, good colleagues, good enviroment with them, fun workplace, qickly job."
good,"great costumer service, starbucks helps you develop costumer service, it helps you by challenging you to work with many people at the same time in pick hours"
good,"Starbucks doesn't serve an excellent cup of coffee, but it's a great way to get into the coffee industry. If you are eager to genuinely learn about coffee, however, Starbucks is not the place; this can make working there a bit frustrating for somebody who want to move beyond the automatization of Starbucks."
good,"Good for high school students, but not enough income to live off for an adult with bills to pay. Opportunity to advance but it takes too long starting from the bottom."
good,"Starbucks is a fun place to work... when it is adequately staffed. My store is a high volume DT/cafe store which requires at least six people on the floor to cover morning peak. However, difficult communications with my manager that are not getting resolved is ultimately convincing me that it is time to leave the company."
good,on your toes constantly but you get to meet a lot of interesting people. you get to build a good rapport with customers and managers(well at least mine) were cool
good,"Over the several years I have been employed with Starbucks there have been constant turnover with our management from manager, director to VP levels. This has created silos within the teams creating poor communications, and team environment."
good,"The employees are great to work with.  It can be busy, but once training is completed it becomes easier.  Also, memorizing each drink recipe gets easier with time."
good,"I came to work here because I love the environment and culture of the company.  I knew I could get benefits as a part timer and I needed the flexibility of hours in order to finish my degree. I became a supervisor after I graduated.  The days and nights are long, but the people are great.  Holidays and peak times are extremely busy and stressful.  The recipes and tasks can be a lot to remember but it happens.  I have worked with some really awesome baristas that have made those shifts fly by for me, but more importantly for the customers.  I had amazing support from a terrific manager when I needed it personally and professionally.  The barista life is not for the faint of heart, the lazy, the loners, or the passive.  Being a Starbucks partner demands 100% participation and initiation, a sense of urgency, and compassion.  Some days are down right awful but others are more fun than should be permitted in the work place.  The pay does not reflect the effort or worth of the employee, especially for supervisors that do a majority of the heavy lifting.  The benefits package is nice, but you can find yourself ineligible at any moment without notice."
good,"Fast paced, can be stressful for new employees as all drinks have to be memorized at work since no ingredient guide is provided to figure them out independently. Clicky work atmosphere."
good,"I worked for Starbucks for roughly a year and a half and during that time the culture shifted a lot. I started out absolutely loving all my coworkers because they were all such high quality people, but then management changed. This is what I'm confused about. Our next manager was someone who was a new hire and knew absolutely nothing about Starbucks standards or anything because she didn't work her way up. She was terrible. Then our next manager was okay but kept hiring really trashy and honestly kinda ghetto people. The overall environment changed between coworkers and customers. It was time to move on."
good,"Empresa que te brinda facilidad de desarrollo y de las mejores en relación sueldo-horarios. Sin embargo a lo largo de los años ha ido perdiendo esa frescura que caracteriza a la marca y por desgracia muchas veces han crecido personas que no tienen ni un mínimo de profesionalismo y por lo tanto desde el ambiente laboral hasta las actividades directas con el cliente han decaído impresionantemente, lamentable por la empresa, por eso han tenido tantas bajas tan solo en el último año."
good,"I did enjoy my time working at Starbucks, but the work environment was usually very stressful and chaotic.  It was very hard to grow with the company, but they did offer good benefits."
good,"A typical day as a Barista included helping customers with transactions, hand crafting beverages, and maintaining store cleanliness. Taught me how to work under pressure. The worst part was having to stand on my feet for such long periods of time. The workplace culture was my favorite part because it was so fun and upbeat."
good,"Starbucks makes everything very difficult. They have some what good benefits but very low pay.Its standards are high, WAY TO HIGH               ddddddddd n"
good,They made me feel like i've been working there for years and fit right in.Also the environment was very comfortable and fast paced due to the location being at a college.
good,"this place was very friendly to work for, but the job security wasn't stable, you can b temp for the place for a year or more and still wouldn't get hire."
good,"Fun place to work. Once competent it's good. only beneficial when full time benefit wise. loved the rushes"
good,it was an okay job. only problem is once the new manager got hired i had to leave because they were NOT willing to work around my school and that was not okay
good,"It is hard to maintain enough hours at this job since so many new people have been hired.  As spotlighted in the news, Starbucks has come under fire for shortstaffing stores.  We are all begging for hours at this point"
good,I worked 4 hour shifts as the closer for their starbucks and loved it. i wish personal family issues would have let me stayed with the job i loved. My supervisor was amazingly kind seet and my coworkers alwayshelped me out while iwas learning new drink recipes.
good,You get a lot of free coffee. Benefits are better at other companies but you can find a good group to grow with. Company cares a great deal about sourcing and their employees.
good,You get a lot of free coffee. Benefits are better at other companies but you can find a good group to grow with. Company cares a great deal about sourcing and their employees.
good,Be careful about the team you are on as well as the manager you have. I would advise all that are new in their career to speak up if needed and leave the position if it is not the right fit.
good,"Starbucks was a fun job experience. It taught me how to work as a team and as a individual. Showed me that you aren't always just another person trying to make a living, but that we are a family and that we care for each other. Knowing that you had fun while working, you will want to go back the next day and the day after!"
good,It was an easy job just to maintain my area clean and pack coffee on the boxes to get them ready for shipping for the others to do the labeling on it.
good,"co worker were all nice but there's a lot of job to do. there's no stable schedule and they will put you back to back schedule most of the time. Supervisor is not doing anything, she's always missing specially the busy times."
good,As a barista I was responsible for accommodating to the customers in any way possible. I prepared specialty drinks as well as prepared food all while maintaining a positive attitude towards all patrons who entered the café.
good,I liked working at starbucks but you had to do a lot more work than you got paid for. its a very quick paced high energy job. it really wasn't my favorite place to work.
good,Would clean and stock to prepare for shift and incoming rushes. Prepare food and beverages in a timely and friendly manner. Learned inventory and online duties using outlook. Trained new and old team member on upcoming drinks/food promotional products.
good,"Benefits aside, this company has room for improvement when it comes to the quality of people it brings on. Alternatively, that makes it a great job for people with little experience and aspirations to move forward. But the majority of people they hire, or promote far beyond the level of leadership displayed, are sorely lacking in any true initiative or leadership ability. And once a bad seed is placed too high above rest of the pot, it infects the rest of the batch and turns an entire store into somewhere customers don't enjoy going to."
good,"Barista and Shift Supervisors, great place to work. Managers pick up all the slack to make it that way.  Goals with the company often change and rarely lead to a good work/ life balance for them.  District Managers and above set performance goals that are not realistic for individual stores regardless of performance in other ""important"" areas."
good,"I worked in two completely different districts.   The two districts were adjacent to each other but the management was night and day.   One district promoted helping each other and working together while the other embodied the attitude of ""do what I say."""
good,"Very difficult to balance work and life, work bleeds into every aspect, paid fairly for work itself but not for the amount of extra time and energy that go into the job"
good,"Over the years of working for Starbucks I have worked at 3 different stores. The first two stores I worked for had an amazing team and amazing management, myself joining the management team at the second store. Upon transferring to the 3rd store I had a completely different experience. The team is still amazing, however the lead management person hasn't provided the best experience."
good,"Basic pay, fine for a entry level job for college students. Not a career. Sometimes working can be busy or slow, and customers can be really picky on what they want to order."
good,"Starbucks comes with great benefits for partners; however, it can get a little crazy inside the workplace. I worked here for almost three years and had to leave because of poor management. My previous boss ran his whole team out because of his poor skills. Work was unorganized and became stressful."
good,"A typical day consists of non stop drink making in a timely manner while still putting effort into every beverage. I learned sequencing and how to work under pressure, inventory, the ins and outs of customer service and satisfaction, and management skills. The management in my experience was very poor. The manager acted like a normal employee and acted without specific responsibilities. He pushed his job onto the general employees and did not show up for his normal shift hours. The hardest part was running the kiosk alone, sometimes for up to three hours. The most enjoyable part of the job is customer satisfaction."
good,"Being a barista is super fun, but if you are out of high school, enjoy being supervised and told what to do by high schoolers who have extracurricular activities, but still manage to get promoted to supervising."
good,"I didn't work at Starbucks long enough to be able to give a proper review. I definitely was unable to grasp working on the hot and cold bar, too many drinks to remember as well as steaming milk is seriously a skill. I was fortunate to have a great manager and team that tried their best to help me but I was still unable to feel confident enough to be a barista"
good,"Very hard to balance, but you get easily adjusted. Customer service can be a pain but there's always more appreciative customers. Its a interesting work experience to gain."
good,Nice laid back company to work for giving great customer service to each customer and you actually build a relationship with some of the people along the way.
good,"An experience in itself. Enjoyed making daily connections with customers as well co-workers. After being with the company for 2 years, it was time for me to leave."
good,"Starbucks Is a fast-base place, I love the energy and the proficiency that we have on the floor all the time! "
good,"Typically a fun time if you enjoy making coffee and being surrounded by fun coworkers. Overall a great place if you want to work with coffee, tea and customer service."
good,"I worked at a Starbucks inside of a Target, so I'm sure it's different from a full Starbucks.  It was hectic and I worked by myself for a lot of my shifts and being shorthanded on staff.  I blame management.  I came in at a time where a new manager was hired and then they were constantly on vacation during my time there.  I only worked there for a summer so I didn't get a chance to see if it would get better.  Pay was nice and I definitely got enough hours."
good,"Working for Starbucks has some really nice perks for working there, however trying to support yourself off a Starbucks would be considered difficult especially during the winter moths."
good,"I met a lot of interesting coworkers and customers over the three years that i was with this company. The job itself was not hard, as I had helpful coworkers that were willing to help me learn the ins and outs. I also learned that lots of people take their coffee very seriously and you have to be very patient  to deal with some people."
good,I enjoyed my coworkers and my supervisors. I did feel that promotions were given based on seniority rather than a person's skill and potential. But overall it is a busy and great place to work.
good,"Worked very easy shifts usually 6 hours."
good,"Be prepared to handle cranky customers. Everything is quick paced, and can be stressful when the customer adds a last min adjustment. Other than that everything else is good. You should always plan ahead."
good,It depends on which one you work at there are great pros about the job they are suppose to work with you and your schedule but the one I worked at they didn't want to and people always wanted things for free nobody get written up for there wrong so they contune to do wrong
good,"Poor work/life balance. Customer service is enjoyable, interacting with customers is very rewarding. Not being able to support staff causes doubts in management."
good,"If you enjoy working with bunch of teenagers or college kids with drama, this place would be a nice place to work. Pay is not great, but the benefits are great - cheap health insurance, stock options, weekly coffee mark outs, employee discounts, etc.."
good,Hit or miss depending on your management. Extremely corporate environment. Lots of room to move up if you follow the rules but not much room to be creative.
good,Management was the overall reason I left. I'm sure other Starbucks aren't the same but the manager was lazy and made everyone complete his own task so he could leave early.
good,Starbucks was a good place to work for and they took care of their employees. However in every store I worked in there was always horrible employee politics.
good,"Starbucks is extremely fast paced, followed by a lot of multitasking, and the focus is always the customers. It really has taught me how to work under pressure, and multitask, in different areas. It also has taught me the importance of customer service, and giving them a great experience every time.  But it can get so stressful and exhausting, that it becomes dreadful on occasion."
good,"I work there for 4 years. It takes time to master how to make the drinks, once you get it, it's on! If you need a part time job while in school, this is the best  job for you, management suck! once they don't like you, they will/can get you fired in a heartbeat."
good,Good place  just started working just met the manager so far can't wait to learn more things about the job company and workers .i always wanted to work at a real Starbucks because I work at one in the movie theater so taking on this challenge would be great
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the customer connections. The hardest part of the job is making sure every customers order is correct down to a T.
good,"it''s okay I really don't like it, its stressful, and the people really don't actt like they caree about you or how you feel, some people that I work with I like they are nice it's just the mangers."
good,"Starbucks does its best to make a wage job look like fun. As en employee you get free coffee during your shift. You also get a free pound of coffee (partner markout) per week! That's huge if you are a college student living off of caffeine. If you stay there for more than 5 years you get stock options. "
good,"The job was fairly stressful at times, but luckily the latest manager and coworkers were very easy  and friendly to work with. Overall the company fostered a good work environment."
good,A typical day would vary each day but I was mainly get to work and work on bar till my shift was over. I learned how to be fast and making drinks while still making them presentable and taste great. I cant say  it was the hard just very fast paced. The most enjoyable was all the great people I got to serve and whould complement  my drinks I like to see the customer leave happy .
good,it is a good place to work during semester breaks and also able to get a deeper understanding in the art of coffee making. it is a great way to get exposed to people with colorful personalities
good,"I worked for Starbucks for 7 years, I was on track to be management, then I got a better job. Best decision I ever made was to leave Starbucks. "
good,I enjoy working at Starbucks because it is a fun filled environment with a great team behind it! Good if you enjoy being on your feet and meeting new people!
good,"I LOVED working for Starbucks.  I worked in two different markets and managed 6 different stores. Leadership in NY market was amazing and respectful. They really embrace the company culture in NY."
good,Company was OK to work for but they were undependable on scheduling( They would schedule you for a shift and then change it on the day of the shift). Also the hours were restricted would like at least 30 hours a week.
good,Was a fun company to work at. The only issue was the hours and management. I loved working there but I was one of the only employees that showed up which meant I had to work crazy long and draining hours. Besides that it was a very fun job
good,"Nice job for school kids and older people that just want something to do. I'm not a big fan of coffee ,just needed extra money to help cover graduation fees."
good,"If you can multitask this is the job for you. Selling and making coffee while maintaining a positive demeanor is a must. And you'll need to check your pride at the door, there will be toilet cleaning and if your shift lead remembers, there will be ice machine sanitizing."
good,A place that offers a lot of great  benefits but can be a challenge to work in for a long time. Customers can be demanding and the success of the store depends on knowledgeable and effective management.
good,"A Starbucks foi minha primeira experiência com atendimento direto com clientes, então tive alguns aprendizados na empresa. Foi um trabalho corrido, o horário de fechamento era um pouco tarde, o que foi o motivo decisivo da minha saída, porém os colegas de trabalho eram ótimos, o que tornava o ambiente mais agradável."
good,"Typical day includes connecting with many customers and leading employees. "
good,"worked at the one that opened at carowinds amusement park. Management definitely needs improvement, the environment and culture there was definitely bad 4 days out of the week. They love to keep you overtime to do work because co-workers and/or management (supervisors and manager) refused to do any work during the day."
good,"fast paced environment. when i worked there, benefits were offered to part time employees. very helpful to a full time student. ......................"
good,Great place to work but we were always understaffed due to the irresponsible management. Tried to get a hold of the district manager plenty of times to complaint but was always ignored.
good,The easiest part of working at Starbucks is being able to interact with the customers and employees in a special way. We treat everyone like family and have a tight bond. The hardest part of working at Starbucks are the long hours and sometimes stressful work.
good,"Management in all three Starbucks wasn't the best. I had one good manager and her manager made her quit because of how bad it can be. It's easy to grow and move up in the company but it's a lot of hard work. It's more that just coffee it's cleaning on your hands and knees, being yelled at, people threatening you,  but I've also had customers buy me stuff and treat me very well, it's a love hate relationship."
good,While when i started working for this company it was amazing by the end it was awful the management was the worst they did not care bout the employees and  had no Idea how to manage a group of people.
good,"Being a barista for Starbucks is great as a part-time job, but would absolutely not recommend it as full-time. Although fun at times, this job is demanding and often understaffed."
good,"Starbucks was my part-time job during studies. It is a good organisation to work for, you get introduced to new beverages every season which is great to gain new skills."
good,"A typical day would be to come in get everything set up and serve customers as they come in. I've learned to multitask very well and my communication skills are amazing. The hardest part of the job was having no help when the lines were really long. The best part of the job is talking to the customers, especially the regulars."
good,"Sometimes people can get a little interesting, and all of drama that can arise from doing the same thing every day can be a little much. I only wish they paid more."
good,What I enjoyed most about working at Starbucks was the company stability and the safe and positive work place culture. Everyday was something new.I enjoyed the relationships I build with customers and being able to start each customers day.
good,Great benefits for part-time emploee.  I worked here through school and was great to be able to work late hours while I went to school during the day.  Very flexible for my changing schedule.
good,"- Long hours"
good,"The ability to connect with both customers and partners is unlike any other work experience. However, management seems to often be pushing down hard, causing a ripple effect that stresses out store managers, shift managers, and baristas at times."
good,The most important part of this position is how well you get along with your co workers and management. The customers come and go so fast in a shift and the stress level is extremely high. If you are not working as a team there is no organization on the floor.
good,"Benefits are great, very flexible scheduling, fun and happy place to work."
good,It was cool working at Starbucks you'll learn that they're are different kinds of coffee the differences between them and how to make them. Also there will always be a lot of dishes to wash even though all the customers take their cups with them.
good,i got to the chance to get out my comfort zone and talk to a lot of customer usually by asking them how's their day going the team was great we love working with each other because of the relationship we built.
good,The company promotes positivity throughout the chain. Its a great place to work and you'll meet some pretty amazing people here. Benefits are the main reason partners stay with the company. Customers can be a little cruel and sometimes forget their purchase was a coffee.
good,"starbucks as a whole is a very good company with lots of benefits and good work ethic. unfortunatly, the specific location i was at was less than satisfactory, under new management that refused to fix previous issues and only caused new ones"
good,It can be fun. Some people were nice others were not. some customers were finicky. somne were not. I got annoyed with the job after a while. target starbucks was not fun.
good,Fun and productive workplace. Be responsible for orders and stock checks. Maintain cleanliness of store. Maintain good customer relationship at all times
good,"Great place to work, especially if you are just entering the work force. Hours worked well for me. I looked forward the each day being different and meeting new people."
good,"Because the store is small everyone does everything. You run cash, you make the drinks, you clean everything. You learn a lot about customer service because almost all problems that may arise must be dealt with yourself. The hardest part of the job is no the work, but the customer being such a wild card. You never know what they want and how to fix a problem. It's never a simple solution, but the longer you do it the better you get and solving any problems."
good,"The hardest part of working for Starbucks, is dealing with angry customers and trying to make the drinks perfect to customer's liking. It is very fast pace, but it has good benefits. The manager was very unprofessional and really need more training on how to treat her staff and customers. Thank you"
good,"Good job for a student in college. Fast paced and cut throat. There is a lot to remember, which is a bit of a challenge. You also deal with a lot of personalities throughout the day so communication skills are a must."
good,"Work is easy enough, but the hours were not available. Good co-workers. Easy enought to learn the recipes, with recipe cards available to you. Good training time, gives you enough experience to work both the register and the drink station."
good,"Starbucks was probably my favorite place I've ever worked. Fun environment, benefits, free coffee, and breaks. The advancement opportunity was almost none and the pay wasn't very good. Great for highschoolers or people with other obligations"
good,It's a great place to work. If you are looking for part time or full time jobs you can always find a flexible schedule that meets your work - life balance.
good,"This a good place to work because the colleagues are very friendly and help you when you need. "
good,"I want to start off by putting emphasis on the fact that if you work at Starbucks you will not be making a good amount of money. You'll be expected to have world class knowledge of coffees if you're a supervisor without any set time to train or learn any of the information they expect from you. Depending on the location, work place safety and health code standards can be regularly put aside.There are many scheduling and training errors which force employees such as myself to be left alone on the floor for hours to tend to cash and make beverages. I was expected to lift heavy metal patio fixtures and boxes daily , and constantly had to settle discrepancies with money that went unresolved even though amounts missing would total over 100$ cash. The only real benefit would be that it is very difficult for you to be fired from Starbucks, they give many chances and you can meet many people there who are awesome. Anyone I've talked to that has quit said that they stayed for the people and the regulars that came into the store."
good,"Not great, not horrible. You can not be lazy to work here, you must be ready to work if your location is in a busy neighborhood during rush hours. If you can manage the workload, you will become very well-rounded and able to work anywhere and handle the pressure."
good,Starbucks was a very fun job. I loved my crew and all my regular customers. I got the know my customers on a personal basis.. When I saw them in line I would already have thier drinks ready for them.
good,It's a busy workday everyday of the week. With little time to prepare for your in-store rush. I learned how to organize my work and time better. I also learned more about how to deal with more than personality at once. I also gained more patience dealing with customers and  staff members. The most enjoyable thing about the job are the perks that come along with it and meeting interesting people from all ovee the world. . .
good,"They're way too strict on things that dont matter to the MAIN manager, They Overwhelm you w/ work that other employees who have had more experience are supposed to be doing"
good,"it was a fun place to work, and meet new people. Management was not knowledgeable in their job which made it difficult to do my job and it seemed as though itwas more about gossiping than work."
good,"Overall, my experience while working at Starbucks was a good one.  I simply did not enjoy the environment where my store was located. I experienced a lot of unfairness and racist customers, which was the hardest part about the job. Other than that, it is a great company with many benefits."
good,"A license starbucks and a company operated starbucks are pretty much two completely different stores. License stores get the discounts and benefits of starbucks, but a company operated starbucks gets only what the confidential company offers."
good,"liked the company, Don't like the staff."
good,"I mostly enjoyed my time at Starbucks, but the management was atrocious. When I started we did not even have a store manager for three months. After the fact, we went through 2 different managers in a six month period. The pay was terrible and the hours were long. The road to advancement was not easy either."
good,"Any other Starbucks would be fine, but the airport ones have twice the demand for beverages and time restraints. No perks to working in an airport at all. Highly would recommend never working in one!"
good,"i used to work in Starbucks in the Trafford Centre."
good,it was a lot of fun working here as a barista and training new staff on the espresso bar and cash register. in the late 1990's I asked my boss the manager at the time if she would share with me my stock options. She would also put it at last priority and i never got my chance to buy stock. bummer now.
good,The job position as a barista is fun and interesting but the pay is too low for the quality and quantity of work. Staff of Starbucks show next level service compared to other fast food establishments and should be payed as such.
good,"Either on drive thru, Till or Cash depending on the day."
good,"Good in all station I work good team member all encourage Batista to take new chanlage to work ."
good,"He aprendido a administrar un negocio y lograr objetivos claros de negocio, así como también a liderar grupos de trabajo en pos de esos objetivos. El ambiente es muy agradable, en donde uno puede dar su opinión constantemente."
good,"its just alright, nothing special. just like any other customer service/fast food experience. They do offer health care and schooling through the university of phoenix"
good,"Great culture from monthly coffee connects to partner open forums, community month of service, etc.. Generally work life balance is pretty good in most areas outside of finance."
good,Handling and making drinks for customers. Promoting different drinks and items for sale in the store. Learned to make complex drinks and memorizing combinations. Fun and free work culture
good,"Very fast pace job, but giving the starbucks customers a great experience and making them smile is the main goal and is very rewarding. I learned how to work with others effectively while moving at such a fast rate in the work environment."
good,Working as a Starbucks Barista was a fun-filled exciting job. You deal with different types of customers and learn new things everyday. However; making coffee is not what I want to do for the rest of my life.
good,"The company itself is fantastic. Management and politics within the company however are awful. I miss my job and the customers, but I do not miss the stress involved with dealing with corrupt managers and politics within the company."
good,"Baseado na experiência que eu tive."
good,"The people and the culture are top notch.  Although, the nature of the retail dynamic is one that challenges partners looking for ownership and accountability."
good,"A typical day at work, to do the cash, make the drinks and clean."
good,"Great for benefits, awful for pay.  the work is really tough if you are a full time employee.  It's a non-living type of wage.  There arent a lot of positions for growth."
good,"I love working with people who have become close and personal friends, it is like a family. Team work is essential this environment. The hardest part of my day is dealing with customers that I can not make happy no matter how much I try. Some people will just not be happy no matter the effort you put in to make it right. There is a new challenge every day and I love it."
good,"Starbucks on ETSU's campus gave me a lot of resources and opportunities to meet a spectrum of individuals. Starbucks was operated by Aramark at the time and was not well staffed, but I enjoyed the work I did."
good,"Hit the ground running, Employees are considered partners not employees which is a nice term to view value to an individual. Daily work is fun and fast. The people you become to know as family and smiles are contagious. The value the company has and the mission statement are sought too and believed. Management is not all that great and the chain of command is easily overlooked and broken. The hardest part of the job is being able to work under extreme high stress while continuing to work effectively and efficiently for the customers along with the team. The most enjoyable part is making someone's day with a warm smile and a fresh cup of coffee along the way"
good,"Starbucks was a very busy work place always had to stay alert on my toes and moving. Constantly busy and sometimes exciting.Management was horrible and there wasnt any order to the company,"
good,Its pretty good but it can get overwhelming. Good pay plus paid vacation. Sometimes there's no teamwork and you still have to get the job done. Management can be a annoying at times. They run you like a dog over the smallest stuff.
good,Overall fast paced. Sink or swim mentality. Overall Friendly but you must have an open communication with management in order to accomplish anything. Definitely huge on  email communication .
good,Working at Starbucks was another good experience. The drinks are simple to make and the layout of the store is easy to get around.  A select few employees at the Starbucks in the Target however were lazy. The management at the time was slow to take care of any issues occurring in our small workplace too.
good,"Starbucks is one of the biggest company when it comes to coffee. One thing i've noticed about is that Starbucks is not only known as a coffee shop, but when we heard word starbucks, the first the that pops in my mind is SATISFACTION, EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE, PERFECT ENVIRONMENT For everyone. And they also has a good benefits for partners"
good,"La empresa cuenta con un muy grato ambiente laboral lo que hace muy fácil aprender lo necesario, el problema es el sueldo que tenemos ya que para todas las cosas que debemos hacer en tienda es muy poco lo que pagan"
good,"Lo mejor de Starbucks es el ambiente de trabajo, por lejos. El compañerismo se siente desde el primer día, y todos hacen lo posible por que sea cómodo, agradable y fácil de llevar. Quizá los horarios de colación sean pésimos, y los turnos desordenados, pero en general  es muy agradable."
good,"Good people and fun place to work at, but management position does not worth the salary and it is a very stressful position. Overall the upper management does not have any courage to tell their executives the problem employees are facing. All they want to hear how great the company is, just another corporation."
good,Starbucks is definitely a relaxed atmosphere. It leaves room to move up with in the company but seems to be more of a transition job for high school and college students. Upside of working at Starbucks is the delicious free coffee!!
good,"Overall I would say Starbucks is a great place to work. They have been flexible with my work schedule, provided low cost health insurance, and have even given me free money in the form of Starbucks stock. That being said I would also say that at the store level Starbucks could do a better job at creating a job/life balance. Many partners work 4-5.75 hour shifts 5 days a week. Hours are always in short supply. Regardless of availability partners looking for extra hours often work 5-7 days a week which could end up being 10 or more days in a row. Also schedule is done 3 weeks in advance so planing ahead is big."
good,The required work on delivering legendary customer service is tough to achieve because you need to consider accuracy in making giving quality product but at the same time you speed up because speed becomes a factor to achieving a store goal.
good,"It was fun making drinks for customers, being able to be creative with mine & making off the wall mixtures.  It was fast paced, which at times was overwhelming.  But, I managed!"
good,you work various shifts.  If your willing to work other departments you can learn a lot.  The managers are very approachable.
good,"Starbucks is what I have called a great ""in between"" job. It has amazing benefits, even if you only work part time (20 hours a week). However, full time is only considered 32 hours. So if you are looking for a 40 hour work week, Starbucks is not the place to look. Also, each Starbucks store is entirely different in terms of business and stress level. So make sure that you find a store that suits your needs in terms of stress levels you can handle."
good,"never a slow time, some really great customers. Never enough hours to keep the lines down. Stressful during any time of the day but most of the partners are fun."
good,It's a pretty steady job. But being attached to the Target is ridiculous. Got forbid if you leave a little late. The girls at this particular store are good. And they make shifts available in Target if you do not have enough hours.
good,"Bon apprentissage, en terme d´efficacité, de rapidité et de service personnalisé des clients."
good,"Half the time we were left alone on a rush and sometimes we would call managers over for help and some would never come over to assist us. I learned how to multi task in a fast pace environment. I worked with some a amazing people, we actually became really good friends that we started to hangout outside of work."
good,"favoritism, policy, and standing on the shoulders of those who actually work are the biggest issues. only stayed as long as i did for the coworkers and customers."
good,"Star bucks in general ( at a private location ) is a very good environment."
good,Excellent learning environment great work place great mannagement huge workplace culture background hardest part was learning how  to make all the drinks while multitasking
good,"Trabalho com muito contacto ao público de diferentes nacionalidades."
good,"Starbucks is a very interesting company. There is a lot to learn and memorize, but once you get the hang of it all, certain tasks are incredibly easy. Be prepared for heavy customer service at peak times."
good,The job is pretty flexible but some expectations are a bit unreasonable I think. I like working with all my co workers and have a great manager boss but feel she is under constant pressure to push sales sometimes that are unreasonable. Not much break offered. only 10 minutes and a 30 min lunch in an 8 hour day. Not time for sitting.
good,The workplace is nice and the money isn't bad just long 12 hour shifts but great benefits and nice people to work with. I perform maintenance of all types and have learned a lot of new skills.
good,I loved working for Starbucks. They are passionate about their products and the company as a whole. I thoroughly enjoyed my time with the company and the people i worked with became life long friends.
good,"There's always something to do or someone to interact with here, making drinks is fun and so is talking with the regular customers you come to know in the mall"
good,I loved it!!!!! The only reason I left is because I had my son and I didnt want to travel back and forth being a single mom.  There is so much room for advancement in this company  this has to be the most honest company I can say I have worked for
good,"Starbucks was a great place to work because no matter where you worked or transferred, anywhere in the country, all the training was the same. Finding the flow with the team was consistent because of this. Very well organized company that let you feel connected with everyone."
good,On a typical work day I would greet and help customers. I was also responsible for keeping areas clean and sanitized. Customer service was a major factor. Working for Starbucks taught me a lot about customer service and making things for the perfect experience. Seeing the smiles on the customers' faces was the most enjoyable as well as working with my team members.
good,"My biggest factor for taking the offer from Starbucks was the product that they were building. The Starbucks mobile app is a huge player in the loyalty program app world. "
good,Good part time job for when you're in school and such. Deals with very rude customers who need there coffee. Gets stressful day in and day out. Creativity is needed when making drinks. Enjoy the challenges of tough or complicated drinks. Very confusing when first learning how to make everything.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Starbucks, but left one year to focus on my school work. I learned very valuable customer service skills from my employment at Starbucks."
good,"Multicultural workplace environment, not many opportunities to grow in the company unless you have free availability"
good,"As a previous barista for CBTL. Coming to work at Starbucks was a big let down. Though they do give you several opportunity to move up, they offer health benefits and schooling. I have a passion for truly delicious coffee. Not a drive through that cares more about the time you make than the cup of coffee itself. The flavor of the coffee, to me is gross. I had a hard time working for an assembly line. Though no problem with the company or the location I worked at itself."
good,I have learned a lot about coffee since working at Starbucks. I like being able to build a relationship with my customers and coworkers while doing something I love
good,"fun place to work while in college, allowed me to meet many people I went to school with and network.  Fun to learn how to make drinks"
good,"Working at Starbucks required a lot of promotion and customer connection. However, this allowed me to comfortably connect with customers on a personal basis, while maintaining a professional appearance. It also improved my high pressured working ability and sought out ideas to improve efficiency while working. Management was all over the place. In working for a bit over a year, I have worked under 4 store managers. So, building a manager to employee relationship had it difficulties."
good,I am always stocking everything in the store such as snacks and cups and napkins. I am on the register from time to time. I also make drinks and make customers feel welcomed. The most hardest part about working there is the fact that it gets slow and very boring after a while. the most enjoyable part would be the people and the working environment.
good,Vons was a great first job but I would not stay here too long considering there is not much room for advancement. Overall Vons was a great stepping stool into the working world.
good,"This job is nice and flexible so I can still work full time, while going to graduate school full time as well. I've gained leadership and coaching skills from this job."
good,if fast paced work environment. great people. decent pay. requires great memory skills and a love for interacting with people. must be able to work on your own
good,"I enjoyed the job for the most part. I loved the culture and atmosphere, and it was one of the driving forces that led me to apply for the job. However, like any other job. The initial allure fades with time. By the time I had cut ties with them, I was as they say, ""over it."""
good,"Fast-paced"
good,"N/A  Every Target is different, mine on the other hand has poor management. More so the store manager. Other than that, expect the usual for people to act childish"
good,"Handcrafted beverages to customers liking. I learned to provide service to one customer at a time. Management was okay. they didn't schedule enough people during very busy times. It's very hard to do everything by yourself with no help and a very long line of customers. Co-workers were great when they were there to help. The hardest part of the job was trying to close by myself with still a long line of customers, taking orders and making drinks. sometimes 6 drinks per order. Then making the customers in line wait while I completed making the drinks for the first customer. The best thing about the job was getting to know the customers. Knowing what they are going to order before they order it."
good,"If you work for Starbucks, you live, eat and sleep Starbucks. No matter what store location, the culture is very modern, very millennial, and with that will be guaranteed some drama (just from your co-workers). The company itself is very clean and professional. You get good training and it is fun to work there. Good experience for anyone needs/wants the entry level fast food environment on their resume without working at McDonalds."
good,"Management at the District Level leaves much to be desired. The only time that you interact with them is when someone is in trouble (which seems to be all of the time). Our society of litigation is alive and prominent within this company as there are a lot of liberals who are vocal about their views and try to force them on others. Also, I don't know about other districts, but the ""good ol' boy"" network is alive and well in this area."
good,"Provide excellent customer service to sell the Starbuck’s brand"
good,"If you're searching for a minimal skill job, this is one of the best options. Pay is average but the benefits are great. The culture is good. Must be smart and move fast."
good,"Everyday it is a challenge, some customers are complicated but the ability to satisfy there need is what makes the difference between a good barista and a bad one. The communication between partners and the management is not the best but we still get the job done. Me personally focus on giving the best service to the customers and forget about the rest. As long as the customer is happy I know I did my job right, my goal isn't to be the managers favorite employee, my job is to make the costumers day a better day one drink at a time."
good,Typical day is preparing beverages for new and regular customers. I learned how to multi task and how to converse to a diverse crowd. Co'workers were not the greatest but hey you can't be content at every work place. I enjoyed the customers the most!
good,"Starbucks as a coorperation is awesome just make sure the team mates are team players. Nobody likes to work with rude people, or unorganized management."
good,"Overall, Starbucks is a very good company to work for. The hours are flexible, and work/life balance is important to management. It's one of the few companies that I have heard of that provides benefits for its part time employees (after working at the company for a certain amount of time). It is a very fast-paced and, at times, stressful job, but there are definitely peaks during the day. So the stress is short lived. Most customers are pleasant, many of them come to Starbucks everyday so they know what to expect."
good,Great benefits and flexibility in work hours.  Good for anyone going to school or working another job.  Management is pretty terrible and advancement is not worth it.  Standards are not upheld because those who are promoted don't care. If you care a lot of about what you do and have a great work ethic you will struggle here.  If you are young and don't really care then it seems to be the place for you. Also you have to be able to tolerate being treated like garbage by customers.
good,"when my original manager left for maternity all the rules where broken and the replacement ended up eventually making us all hate each other."
good,The training was so fun and very informative. Great management team that worked with All kinds of schedules. Motivation team meeting and informative notices in changes. I enjoyed my time at Starbucks. I left due to wanting something that paid more.
good,"Great part time job but not much advancement. Fast paced, liked getting to know regular customers. Sometimes other employees didn't take their job seriously but I did.. Good manager. Hardest job I please all customers as some had different likes on beverages."
good,"Personally, corporate isn't the best style of company for me, but that being said, Starbucks is consistent and teaches how to follow in depth procedures accordingly. A very good platform to learn and start from."
good,I worked there collectively for about 4 years. everytime it was fun to work there. The only flip side of the job is the people. but that is everywhere.
good,"As a whole, the company is amazing to work for, however when at a store level sometimes management can be absolutely atrocious. Starbucks does amazing by it's partners and has been nothing but a light in my life. I'd recommend the company to anyone, though there is always the risk of being hired at a store that doesn't know how to manage."
good,The work atmosphere is great to interact with people. A typical day at the job helping make someones day through a smile and a cup of coffee goes a long way.
good,"During my time at Starbucks there were multiple store owners.  The Starbucks was actually under the command of the BX (the shopping mall on military installations.) Store managers came and went due to the level of inconsistency at the administrative tier.  The leadership was more concerned with quantity of staff rather than quality of staff.  Multiple employees throughout my time were late to their shifts repeatedly, and faced no penalties or form of punishment.  Being punctual is important to the success of businesses, and the lack of punctuality in this business is why it is now suffering monetarily."
good,"If you can handle the pressure set on you by the seniors, and are capable of learning quickly from mistakes, work life will be very easy. The most enjoyable is the bonds that can be made with not just the staff but also the customers you interact with. Since its an airport, you get to meet so many different types of people. And the things you can learn from them, you can take with you, wherever you go."
good,It was a very rewarding job with many perks. I experienced a new atmosphere and learned many new skills. I enjoyed the job but the management was terrible and was the reasoning for my resignation.
good,"Have a positive relationship with your co-workers"
good,A fine entry level position.  Great for high school students and full-time college students.  The management does good work keeping the store running well.
good,"Starbucks used to be a great company to work for. But as of late, the standards and expectations are on the rise while we labor is cut and we are meant to do the work of 2-3 people at once. It feels impossible. One of the more frustrating things is the fact that tenured partners' wages have been ""bumped to the new minimum"" so that people that are just hired or just been promoted are all making the same amount of money. A new supervisor that has been promoted is making the same amount as one that has been doing the exact same position for 3 years. Morale is at an all time low all around."
good,"This is a fast-paced working environment, which can be fun and enjoyable if the management is up to par. The atmosphere is mostly relaxed and social, although sometimes it can be stressful during peak hours. There are not many full-time positions outside of management and hours can be sporadic at times."
good,"If you are a student looking for a part-time job, this is a good option for you. Although it was tiring, it teaches you about work life balance. I didn't mind it."
good,Typical day included opening at 5AM and never stop moving moving until end of shift. Very rude customers so thick skin is needed. Pay is not enough for what you have to deal with.
good,Lots of hard work required. Fast paced environment with fun and interesting co workers. Hours have been cut back though so it can be hard to get 40 hours per week
good,Required to find ways to work with ambiguity and solve problems before they happen.  Lots of travel to manufacturing sites and support equipment startups.
good,"Most of my co-workers are awesome. However the summer was awful due to intentional understaffed shifts which caused misery for both customers and employees alike. Due to this, I've noticed customers become less personable and more aggressive about their orders and no one enjoys that."
good,"I had long wanted employment that would be skilled and simple. I found that at the Starbuck's Roasting Plant.  However, the constant fear of every employee and staff member made the job entirely difficult to maintain."
good,Great benefits for part time employees.  That is the best thing about this company. Management could use some work.  Hardest part of the job is keeping up with the pace.
good,cok yoğun bir çalışma temposu vardi iş çok yorucuydu ama eğlenceliydi
good,"this another school in many ways , even though they do not pay very well and sometimes you can get frustrated with the manager and the amount of work you have to do ."
good,Maintains a calm demeanor during periods of high volume or unusual events to keep store operating to standard and to set a positive example for the shift team.  Anticipates customer and store needs by constantly evaluating environment  and customers for cues.  Communicates information to manager so that the team can respond as necessary to create the Third Place environment during each shift.  Assists with new partner training by positively reinforcing successful  performance and giving respectful and encouraging coaching as needed.
good,"Muito serviço pra pouca remuneração, demora pra subir de cargo devido a preferências pessoais e não profissional. Deficte de funcionários dentre outros."
good,"The benefits are pretty good - free pound of coffee once a week, get one food item a day and free drinks while working. I hear the insurance is pretty good, but I do not have it.  My biggest concern is the rate of pay, which depends on where you live. The company just gave big raises to all employees in the US. I found out that all of my baristas at my store are all now at the same base pay, regardless of effort or experience. I have been with the company for over two years and it feels like they went down the drain. Prepare to feel undervalued."
good,"I enjoyed working with my team and getting to talk to people."
good,"The people you work with are the best part of the job, another perk is getting to know the regular customers, building relationships with people that you would not have met otherwise. However, there are always difficult customers that do make the job less enjoyable."
good,"Very good place to work. Even somtimes may work overtime or under pressure, but the people are very helpful and kind. The work environment are safe and silent."
good,"Due to a revolving door in management, this store was veryunorganzied and lacked morale. Experienced staff were frequently forced to pick up the slack."
good,"I worked at Starbucks for 4 months through Aramark. I was an Aramark employee for 5 years. I learned a great deal about food and customer service. The lack of management sometimes called for me to play more of a leadership role. I had a great relationship with my coworkers and sometimes acted as a Supervisor. The hardest part of the job was the morale with the workers. Many times, the workers, myself included, felt over worked and underpaid. The most enjoyable part of the job was building life long friendships with my coworkers while making customers happy."
good,productive and fun workplace most days. It can be a stressful job. requires a lot of attention to details and multi-tasking. Some expectations are unrealistic from management but overall the management is good.
good,"Starbucks Coffee company is your standard corporate employer. The application process is impersonal, training is standard, and customer service is key. If you are not a coffee lover, then there won't be much incentive to increase performance other than pay."
good,"A pretty fun place to work, free drinks on the clock was a huge plus. Co-workers are great people and will assist you when it's busy so you won't be overloaded with drinks."
good,"Horarios flexibles y aleatorios en cada semana, pero respetando el horario de clases."
good,"When I stared my job at Starbucks, I enjoyed the management and all that I worked around. The pace was fast, but it was wonderful because of the environment I worked under. As the days went on, the company stared cutting labor and staffing very short, making it hard to make up if a partner needs to call our for reasons involving sickness or family emergencies."
good,"they offer great benefits and high salary for a retail/food service company, but the work life balance isn't great. Some costumer connections lead to life long friendships."
good,"This wasn't my first position, but it has been my favorite so far. The amount of people fluctuates all the time, since we're in Target, but there's always something to do to keep you busy. Being here has taught me how to prioritize tasks, be flexible in any situation, and that you attitude can change others. Also, that it's not always easy to work with someone that you don't see eye-to-eye with, but it's possible. The hardest part of the job is when you're alone and have a long, steady flow of people. The best part is when you're in that situation with someone that you work well with or the regular guests that come in."
good,"Had lots of fun working here till they took the coffee shop enviorment away an made it more of a fast food type pace ,but overall I had fun with my fellow co-workers while it lasted"
good,My coworkers where unfriendly with me made me feel like and outsider and were not welcoming. There didn't help me or train me yelled at me and made me feel depressed. Made me do their work make there drinks when they were messing around. Cleaned the whole store 4 hours before they closed then would yell at me about it being dirty. I am very disappointed in this company mainly because they lied about being a family they were more like trash.
good,it was fun and demanding. I had to undertake daily tasks hat would allow me to deepen my experience. The hardest part of the job was doing tasks that i was no suitable doing such as taking the bins out and cleaning the toilets.
good,helped with stocking and cleaning up after customers and cleaning windows and doing the dishes and sometimes the let me be cash and i took  out the garbage
good,I loved working with the customers and being able to create drinks just for them. Though there was a problem with the self-centered manager. Great job for a college student.
good,"the job just drags, there are always schedule conflicts, managerial conflicts, and the employees are never excited. the customers are allowed to treat you badly which is a drag."
good,"A typical day at work is very fast paced, always on your toes. You get to talk to interact with customers. I learned a lot about coffee. Co workers were friendly. The hardest part of the job is moving around when you find a position you really perform well in. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting free coffee and test tasting new coffee."
good,"Good company to work for. Busy environment and customer service experience. Flexible hours and scheduling too. You gain experience with food safety, ordering product, and customer service."
good,Getting to know and talk to the customers is the best part of the job and making drinks that customers customize is fun also
good,"Management is either great or not, it depends on where you work. Several of the cafe-only stores were filled with really great baristas and managers alike- however drive-thru stores there were impossible expectations/goals, which put a lot of pressure on management. Over the last few years there have been major cuts being made to hours, making baristas do the job of many rather than have the right amount of coverage to deal with excessive lines either in cafe or drive. My favorite part of any job is the customers. The hardest part is finding what is actually ""standard"" to Starbucks. Every store will tell you differently and there is no manual for it."
good,"This was my first job which I got while attending college. Most of the time, I love being a barista at Starbucks. My manager and coworkers truly became friends and made the job enjoyable, no matter how terrible the day may have gone. There are times of high stress based on customer volume and different promotions. The hardest part of the job is dealing with a large volume of people with not enough workers and fixing experiences for dissatisfied/rude customers. The best part of being a barista is building relationships with coworkers and customers and making beverages! Countless times, I've had an awful day turned around by someone telling me their drink tastes amazing or that I'm their favorite barista to have working at the bar."
good,"Relatively the same set of tasks to accomplish each day which became very easy to repeat. I got very good at knowing what needed to be done and for what time. I was thorough, efficient and always supported my team. Management always wanted results without always supplying  us with the tools to achieve these goals. Team morale was quite low and so work ethic was also low. I learned to be a good leader and to support my team where management could not by training new hires and coaching other baristas."
good,Its a cool job. especially those who are just getting done with high school. I highly recommend for a first starter job. Its fast pace job that has you constantly moving.
good,not feeling it! too busy too much work not enough pay... smh the typical low paying job stuff you will be working with people who have masters degrees and are disgruntled that they have to mop  they wanna squeeze the life out of you with this slave job.
good,"A typical day in Starbucks can vary from extremely peaceful in the morning to extremely hectic during rush hour. Besides the rush, the environment always seem to feel welcoming because of certain customers and the workers. The hardest part of the job is being able to get to a customer as fast as possible with out making them feel that they are rushed. The most enjoyable part is hearing feedback from customers."
good,"I enjoyed while I worked at this location, however I was left alone many times, I was trained well and I left to better my personal self."
good,Starbucks has allowed me to grow as a person and the people I have met thru this job have been a huge influence. I am thankful for all the things I have learned there. I would say at this moment in time it has been hard to stay satisfied with being there due to some lack of appreciation.
good,"It's ok so far. Grouchy customers if you don't understand what they want when you're new, or when they don't know what THEY want. Good manager, Good coworkers. Some days you work till 11p-12p then have to get up at 5a-7a to start again. Get good shoes."
good,"Fun work environment with great coworkers but management lacked in communication and understanding of employees"
good,we don't get paid enough for what we have to put up with from customers and management is a joke. they have no clue what they are doing and we are the ones who have to suffer.
good,Towards the end of my career at Starbucks they started understaffing the evening crew to where we only had two people running the whole store.  Since one of these two people is a manager it really comes down to one person running the inside and the drive through.  I believe this is type of understaffing is happening at many Starbucks not just the location I work at.  On the other hand when I started this job I was very to shy & to myself and it has shown me how to be more open to new people.  My co-workers for the most part are all also college students so we all got along very easily.  The most enjoyable part of the job would probably be seeing the regular customers that came in frequently knowing that I can brighten up their day a little bit with a simple cup of coffee
good,"See above it says"" it's just a job"" it was short assignment nothing else. they brought us all lunch which was the highlight of the day"
good,One thing I've come to learn while working at Starbucks is that this job takes TONS of getting used to and patience!
good,Its a great place to work at the management are really nice. It can be busy at times but the people you work with make it go by smoothly.
good,"Good company to work for, for the most part. It's minimum wage which is not great but I always have fun at work. I get to meet new people every day."
good,"good benefits, and good start pay.  you also get free coffe once a week, and free lunch.  workers are friendly, and customers can be pretty cool."
good,great benefits and great way to learn customer service skills. Interact with different people every day and is a good place to learn about everything from drinks to the people you serve every day.
good,the stores ive worked in have had have had good people to work with and good customers although every store is different just make sure you find the right store for you that has strong supportive partners otherwise the fun is scarce
good,I enjoyed working here during the summers and holidays. I wouldn't want to make it into a career though. I didn't see much opportunity for promotions and the managers seemed set in their ways.
good,"This was my first job and as far as first jobs go, it was about average, pay was min. wage, hours were consistent and decent, and there was not too much to complain about."
good,I love working here its just they don't pay enough. They hire people even though they cut everyone else's hours. I make $8.75 and I cant live on that .
good,"The people are the best part about this business. it's a job that requires a lot of physical labor and overall you will be under appreciated for going above and beyond. In the past few years they have taken away labor hours (less people same amount of work needs to get done) and they took away our personal days and bonuses. we also used to get two raises a year. Now we only get one and a free pastry every shift. "
good,No room for advancement. Co-workers were mostly young girls and the store manager was the worst with gossiping. It was an easy job to do though it was face paced and regular customers were great.
good,"A typical day was prepering a perfect cup of coffee and any other orders, taking transaction, counting money, cleaning tables, floors, windows, bathrooms, unpacking supplies (morning deliveries), turning on/off the alarm, prepering an envelope with money for security, checking products expiration dates and their quantity, allocating shift duties."
good,As a part time job for someone going to school this is a great place to work. I did not love the support I received as a manager but enjoyed my coworkers a lot.
good,"bonne entente global, bon esprit d'équipe voir même un esprit de famille"
good,"This job was a productive and busy work environment where I made drinks, and worked the cash register. I learned how to count money, interact with people, and be productive throughout each day. The hardest part of this job was standing on my feet all day but since it stayed so busy, time went by and I learned how to stay very busy. The job as a whole was enjoyable because I learned to interact with all types of people, I was able to manage time affectively, and also enjoy my job."
good,"good job, doesn't pay enough though, extremely early hours, learned how to make coffee and manage people, got free food and drinks"
good,"I love this company, they have given me opportunities to explore my potential. The lack of support from upper management is the problem, if you take initiative and are a self motivating goal setter with little to no guidance, this is a great company for you. Work/life balance is not achievable but the work that you do and the people that you work with can make it all worth it. Fast paced environment, can be a great place with a good team and a lot of fun! The benefits they offer at part time are amazing, full health coverage with 100% tuition reimbursement and free food/coffee during shifts, 401k with stock options at all positions!"
good,Starbucks is a great place to work. You learn a lot from the company and it's a pretty stress free environment. They care about your schedule a lot and school is important to them.
good,Needs better training implementation and follow up procedures. the benefits are great. But the core values and commitments to the partners could be better within the stores.
good,Fast paced but fun. You learn how to interact with customers and how to provide good customer service. Easy job too do and it's enjoyable.
good,"Starbucks is a good company to work for. The benefits for part time employees are tops.  Unfortunately the pay, opportunity for advancement is not on par with the other benefits.  Seem to hire a lot of outside people for jobs that could and should be filled internally. There is always something to do. Very little down time. Could be a pro or con."
good,"i liked working here i would've loved it if they had more hours the soups was really fun and a new thing for me i enjoyed making the soups,salads, and sandwiches"
good,Made to feel as if a member of a team instead of just another employee. Employee atmosphere was great. Everyone seemed to enjoy their jobs with the company.
good,"Enjoyed working for Starbucks, the main complication was the location, as it was far and transit is my best commute.  The store hours also complicated things as they closed very few hours after school closes. Despite the complications, the work had taught me lots about dependability, punctuality and personality."
good,"- chance to hone customer service skills"
good,"I was usually making coffee, cleaning and re-stocking the fridge. Lots of running around when there is a big line but overall fun to work at."
good,"Fast paced environment, constantly interacting with costumers, ensuring every drink is being handed out in a timely manner and made up to the costumers standard. Constantly cleaning equipment and storage areas to keep up with safety regulations. All of us had to work together as a team to make sure the store was being kept up and costumer satisfaction was perfection."
good,"Had a very good experience working there, specially because it was a new chanllenge for me to learn how to make all the drinks, which are plenty of them, but i learned them very quick."
good,Great working environment but not enough pay.  The minimum wage is the standard pay for this work. Advancement is also limited
good,left due to poor management but the company was fun to work for while it lasted. was never properly trained WHICH MADE WORK DIFFICULT
good,I'm a big fan of the working environment. When you are working with the right team a lot of good work gets done. I really recommend working here.
good,"We play a big role as a Barista. We're doing all around chores starting from taking our responsibility to our projects, cash handlings, doing coffees, cleaning tables, sending deliveries to another stores and assisting the customers. I learned how to worked under pressure and be multi-tasking at the same time. I am lucky with my co-workers because they are very helpful and fun to be with. The hardest part of my job is to to work for long hours of duty per day. And also we need to study almost every single day regardless of any reason. The most enjoyable part is to mingle with other baristas especially if you are borrowed partner from another stores."
good,"drinks are awesome"
good,Es una marca de la cual uno se apasiona donde el clima laboral es muy bueno
good,"Who doesn't like starbucks? It is a great company, great people, good connections. I really do want to move up but sadly it seems hard to when it is based on availability and not skills."
good,"I've been working for Starbucks for going on five years now. I am currently working at my fourth full time store but have had the pleasure of working at many different locations temporarily. Working at a place like Starbucks has so many ups and downs it feels like an 8 hour roller coaster ride. With the right group of people and the right store it is a blast. The days can fly by and you can have a day at work without feeling like you've worked much at all. On the other hand, if you end up working with difficult people it can feel like a full week's worth of shifts in one day. The hardest part of the job can be finding the time to get all of the management work done while covering for people who don't show up to work. The most enjoyable part of the job for me is the customers. My regulars who come in day after day and take the time to learn about my life. As a people person I love the idea of getting to work to make someone's day better. That and the free coffee and drinks while you work."
good,"I learned a lot from the company. "
good,My daily agenda for a sales associate is interacting with customers and keeping them informed on the latest trends. Meeting new people and working at the cashiers desk was the best part of the day.
good,"Days can be busy or slow, depending on the time of day. "
good,"My day consisted of making beverages, maintaining all espresso machinery and I was also responsible for the all around cleanliness of the store while maintaining great customer service. It's a great place for a strong foundation in multitasking and staying quick on your feet."
good,"The pace is very slow at Ulta, but it was fun working with make up. The company does not have much together, and their customer service is horrible. They are always getting stolen from because they don't give each store enough hours to properly staff during the work day."
good,they seem to like the younger crowd as barista's but with the right supervisor that likes a good age range of employees it is a good place to work
good,A typical day at starbucks was to prepare for opening. I learned how to make many different drinks as well as custom drinks for certain customers. Management and co workers were great. Hardest part of the of the job was at first learning how to make the many different drinks and then after just keeping the line small. Most enjoyable part was tasting and making samples for customers.
good,"great part time job to cover benefits, very rushed atmosphere.  Care more about the bottom line numbers being pushed through a hectic drive through than customer service efforts."
good,"Working with a diverse and friendly group was very rewarding, as well as fulfilling the needs of our customers.  Starbucks is committed to providing legendary customer service and exceeding all expectations, something I was glad to do."
good,Working at starbucks is great if you are a college student in need of benefits or really anyone who who is in need of decent extra cash. How you feel about the job is soely based on your managment and how busy you are. I dont suggest for most people to go to a drive thru store if they dont like being busy.
good,A massive leader in the fast food and customer service industry like McDonald's is a good start to get acquainted with working.
good,Fast Paced hectic environment with decent benefits good corporate support.  Training in coffee and tea knowledge well done and with passion.
good,"over all it was an alright job, i think everyone was alright, it just wasn't for me, i guess. i guess i should have known they all we're going to be high energy... we got free drinks whenever we wanted"
good,"High stress job with 100+ customers per hour during the morning. While the benefits are good, the pay is not. Starbucks culture revolves a lot on how long you have been there so they tend to not be so nice on new people."
good,"I learned how to handle difficult situations, but you don't feel safe working there because they are firing people for no reasons"
good,"Provided great customer service with a customers come first attitude, i cleaned up minor things like the bathroom, eating area, and staff area."
good,"I enjoy my time for the most part, though I do not get paid enough and I get shorted on hours every single week. The markouts are a nice perk but it seems like compensation for not having a wage you can live off of."
good,"Excelente empresa para laborar.excelentes conocimientos y muy buenas amistades y conocidos se logran conocer,"
good,"A starbucks is a to-go starbucks is a starbucks inside of a Target is inside of a King Soopers. Customers appreciate the consistency, but as a worker, if you've burned your creativity aspect of life and enjoy the diplomatic acceptance of newness this is for you. It does, however, encourage quickness and accuracy - knowing the next step, which is ideal for progression to another level culinary experiences. If you have the time, it's worth the lesson."
good,"Extremely high volume licensed location at the Louisville International Airport. Shifts are less than ideal, between 4am and 12pm or 12pm and 8pm, leaving difficulty balancing work and life."
good,"An okay job. Business fluctuates depending on number  of flights because it was in the airport. At very busy times, such as during holidays, job could get stressful, but as long as you had a solid crew it would be fine. Some of management is okay, some are not. The customers are the hardest part of the job because their orders can be difficult. They are real particular about their drink and tend to become very frustrated if not made right. The most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers, because they were fun, and great to work with."
good,"It's pretty typical.  I had a good boss and fun coworkers, so that made the job fun and the day pass quickly.  But, early-morning shifts can be challenging, and they're a downer for balancing schedules.  Being a barista at Starbucks is a good first or entry-level job - plenty to learn, very goal-oriented, challenging physically and mentally (mostly in good ways, unless the pace gets overwhelming which it can depending on the Starbucks location)."
good,"A day at work can be a little bit busy but besides that, teamwork cooperation is awesome and what i learned at starbuck was how to make different type of smoothies and learning how to make use of the cashier."
good,"i have worked at multiple stores and have always enjoyed the employee atmosphere. they treat their employees well, although i feel its easier to be a pawn in the corporation than want to move up and be successful if you are happy going to work everyday and doing your job great but if you want to further yourself through starbucks i have been met by many walls and feel that the company has let down the employees that are actually trying hard, and want to be there"
good,"Starbucks taught me a lot about customer service, how to work in a fast-paced environment, and how to teach others once you have been trained yourself."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the people.  There is a warm culture of genuinely caring about the well being of partners.  Refreshing environment."
good,"When you get work with a bunch of co-workers that take pride in their own work and store, it's a great job to have. When management isn't strong and co-workers no longer care it's easily the most frustrating job ever. Especially at high volume stores! I have worked on and off for this company because it's a very easy job do. If anyone intends to do this job either promote yourself or make it short and sweet."
good,"a lot of work not really worth the pay. i have no problem working hard, as long as i am getting paid what i deserve for the work that i do."
good,this job required a lot of multitasking and you will stand for long durations while making drinks for customers and taking orders.
good,Used to love working here. Was a place to have fun with people who are like family. Lately it's all about the money and sales which is great for a business but when you work your people into the ground with no appreciation not so much. Managers are able to get a away with murder as long as their sales are meet and DM's look down on anybody that is a supervisor or lower. Training is a joke and warm bodies are being hired not people with any sort of want to work or do a job right. No incentives. The people can be great. Meet a lot of good people. Very High turn over.
good,I've enjoyed working in this company because it gave me opportunity to grow and pass my knowledge on to new starters. It's very busy and stressful environment but I've learnt how to deal with any kind of situations with calm head. very supportive management is doing their best to help you develope and find your role in the store.
good,Good at giving breaks and providing their staffs options to grow. Only if you end up working with a good manager who is willing to help you develop and advance in your career
good,"nice place to work for. teaches you a lot. customers can be good or bad."
good,Great place to start off working at.  Sales techniques taught that will stick for a life time.  Managers actually tried to help you in any way.
good,I enjoyed working there but they were on a transition of managers and things started falling apart for them. it was A starbucks inside of a Safeway and safeway wasnt doing there part in the management.
good,"The workplace seem peace. Enjoyable in terms of serving friendly and warm customers. But the place is always crowded and the baristas need to do things in a fast pace. In the end, i felt quite stress. But slowly adapting with the situation of having crowd."
good,"A day at Starbucks starts as soon as you wake up, if you were like me you woke up at 3:00am to be at work by 4:00am to do prep work and opening the store by 4:30am to take customers who wake up very early to commute to work. My store in particular had an average 30 customers around this time until about 6:30am when things began to speed up and our customer flow went from just those 30 to 45 every half an hour. We were a particularly fast store with plenty of fellow partners to make sure we didn't drown in a sea of customers. We were able to work efficiently and experienced very little work flow problems such as stepping on each other while trying to acquire things for customers. We were a very tight knit store and everyone was like family. We all hung out after work because a lot of us had moved away from our hometowns and away from our families so I felt that gave us a bit more incentive to share in camaraderie. In the mornings before we opened and when we had little customer flow we would work and talk at the same time. You can imagine how fast the time went when you're enjoying yourself at work, it's quite refreshing. I'd have to say that my store in the heart of Houston, Texas was one of the friendliest and most efficiently run stores I have ever worked at. I have worked at two other locations since."
good,"Pay isn't great but the company has a lot to offer in terms of training, promoting, funding for education, etc. Did not enjoy working super early/late."
good,I enjoy Starbucks but I have been here for a good period of time and I am ready to use my skills I have learned as a Supervisor/ Manager. I have recently graduated from school for a career I'm extremely excited to get started in that I am ready to move on.
good,I enjoyed learning to mix espresso beverages and selling pastries and other foods. I liked the environment and the delicious smell of espresso.
good,"This job started off as something I was doing part time in high school. Although it was fun at times, it became stressful because of the other priorities in my life and the constant changing of my schedule. Here is where I learned to really interact with the public and how to deal with them. I also gained experience in marketing, management. I made lots of relationships with co-workers and customer and don't regret the experience at all. Just not my cup of coffee."
good,At one point in time my hours we cut due to the hire of new partners. I felt as tho the ones who were there first should et more hours.
good,"Fun place to work where partners became good friends. All about the customer experience and creating a second  home feel for every customer. For a company that stresses that they ""love"" there employees, I felt we were neglected and asked too much of without considering store differences. Within a year's time we had to add about 4 BIG new things to our store with little time to adapt before a new one came in. "
good,Fun place to work with supportive co-workers. We all worked as a team and had goals to work up to. One of the goals was to get a number of cars through the drive-thru and as a team we made it to 65 cars one morning. It was a great achievement and we all looked forward to days like that.
good,A fun place to work temporarily. A great place to make connections with the community. The management needed improvement.
good,Working at Starbucks company was a fun experience. Everyone was friendly and very accomodating. Everyone taught me stuff to learn and helped me adjust with the environment. Customers were also very friendly and very grateful for our services.
good,Being a partner of starbucks has taught me how to work not only in a team but within a company. starting off as a barista and working my way up to a supervisor role has brought some positivity to my work ethic and the job I do.
good,the time that iv worked for Starbucks it was trial and error. the experience is all i wanted at the end of the day. the  management wasn't all that great. The way the kiosk was kept was not up  tto companies standard but i tried to maintain them.
good,Although i loved the people i worked with the pay and work did not add up at all! I have always enjoyed pleasing customers but like i said the pay just did not add up
good,"clock in, go to your shift lead see where you were going to be working that day, we all had stations. go to your station relieve your partner and begin work. Management was horrible, unorganized, unprofessional. Co-workers were great everyone got along and helped when it was needed. Hardest part of the job was standing around when there was literally nothing to do because you were so far ahead of time. I love working with people, being to see them everyday and make them smile or hear about something new they wanted to tell you. You made recurring customers. You learned who they are from what they eat and drink."
good,"Its wholly dependent on who you work with. From my time there I enjoyed it, but there would always be an un-enjoyable customer or rough day."
good,"Starbucks focuses primarily on barista experience and not manager experience. Upper management does not care if managers work almost double the hours of a FT position, despite Starbucks advertising otherwise."
good,Everyday at work was just making  drinks & helping customers. I loved the relationships i had with my co-workers but most of the customers were rude and in a rush
good,"Starbucks is a place to work as a student or to start building your experience. Once you learn everything at Starbucks, theres no more advancement."
good,"The customers make this job great. Though the staff turnouver has been quite high, often during quiet times it is a nice and relaxed atmosphere.  The quality of the job very much depends on the store manager."
good,Good culture...upper management is lacking structure.  The company as a whole needs to be reorganized. The people on the work floor are great and the culture is outstanding.
good,Creative environment that thrives on structure. The recipes are the backbone of the business and are required to be executed with perfection unless customer asks otherwise.
good,"Make sure that coffee brewing equipment is cleaned, sanitized and maintained properly on a constant basis. Educated customers about the history of each coffee blend when inquired"
good,Fun place to work that is challenging and allows for growth as a manager. Great opportunity to engage with employees and the community.
good,"The job in itself was an alright job. They can overwork you, but benefits are good. Don't hope for full-time though. Don't hope for advancements either."
good,"Great for you if you're in high school, or a part time college student. The growth with the company is slow. Once you start growing with company, then it's worth staying for. I love my customers, they are what make Starbucks, The management isn't too good, but that may just be at my store. My partners at my store was amazing, overall it is an okay job."
good,"The job is quite easy but at the same time required attention. I learned how to face in front of a customer, always remember to smile and be kind. The management is young so he understands the needs of everyone and if you do your job properly nobody complain your work. My co-workers are around my age and I can say we are a big group. We come from all different countries (Italy, Spain, Lithuania, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Pakistan etc.) and that's really important to socialize and know new habits. The hardest part of the job is the closing-shift because you have to clean everything because all has to be ready and clean properly for the following day but I can say sometimes the hardest thing is understand the needs of every customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you finish and you see all the shop clean and ready for the following day and finally socialize with your daily colleagues."
good,I truly enjoyed working at Starbucks. It was a very fun and energetic atmosphere and unfortunitly I had to quit beause I moved. At times i could be really stressful and the customers were the most demanding out of previous jobs i had.
good,"Very unorganized, never enough staff on duty, very high volume of stress for a normal person, doesn't tend to employees needs."
good,"Une entreprise Nord Américaine qui vise toujours aller plus loin. Starbucks pousse les employés à avoir de la persévérance et à vouloir toujours plus. J'étais dans le meilleur Starbucks de la ville de Montréal donc il fallait être efficace pour ne pas perdre sa place. Les opportunités de développements étaient très bonnes mais tout dépendait des plans pour l'avenir de chacun. Le personnel de cette entreprise est en constant changement, car la plupart des employés ce sont des étudiants. C'est une grande entreprise donc l'aspect de plus difficile de ma poste c'est qu'elle vise surtout la vente et elle vise beaucoup moins la qualité de vie et les conditions de travail des employés. Mais l'aspect agréable c'était le service à la clientèle, ce qui est ma passion."
good,"It's enjoyable talking with customers and making them happy with their orders knowing you've made it correctly. I am learning how to manage my time better because working at Starbucks is all about timing. "
good,"I enjoyed working at Starbucks but my old manager decided to reinvent me and change everything. Overall I loved Starbucks and my co-workers, and what Starbucks had to offer."
good,I definitely enjoyed working for Starbucks. I loved that it was fast paced and always had work to do. I had great coworkers and we worked as a great team. The hardest part was when we ran out of inventory and the customers would be displeased but I always tried to find an alternative and it was a great challenge.
good,"once in work, it became a very fast past and friendly environment. my co workers was very high in energy and so was the customer. great work environment."
good,"Being primarily involved in culinary, I feel that starbucks was a nice place to be employed. The preparation of the coffee helped me to hone a different skill in the culinary field such as the art of beverage making."
good,"Building the connection between the company and customers"
good,"Fast pace during peaks for this job, easy to learn drinks combo after practice on job. Most staff is friendly and a younger crowd"
good,"Prepare or serve hot or cold beverages, such as coffee, espresso drinks, blended coffees, or teas.Clean or sanitize work areas, utensils, or equipment. Clean service or seating areas.Check temperatures of freezers, refrigerators, or heating equipment to ensure proper functioning. Describe menu items to customers or suggest products that might appeal to them."
good,"Day would be constantly busy, most workers would get placed in the same positions for months and not able to grow in any other aspect of the job. I learned more time management skills as well as multi tasking. Management was fair, most of the shift managers were very skilled and able to close and open stores successfully. Coworkers were nice people, made the job pleasant. Hardest part was the stress. Enjoyable part was making the drinks and working the drive through."
good,"Fast paced work flow, a lot of team effort to execute orders. Learned to work efficiently and but urgently in high stress situations."
good,"the company stands for great things, but i hate the fact that they no longer welcome guns into their facilities. "
good,"No day is the same. "
good,"the day consists mainly of doing small repetitive tasks until your shift ends. not often do you learn something new nor do you feel productive. The best thing about the job is the customers, good or bad. Customers are the sole reason for having a job here, you have the ability to make their day better and that causes a sense of satisfaction."
good,"During my time at Starbucks it evolved from an emerging to a mature brand.   Great people and great business culture.  Mostly an operations focused company,"
good,"Só pecam pelo pouco treinamento dado para o grau de cobrança.Num geral,boa empresa."
good,come in open up stock the food  make coffees and meet new people everyday. the workers r very helpful and management are always the to answer and questions u have.
good,You'll meet great co workers and you'll learn business operations and  inventory management. Great place to work to learn basics and customer services.
good,"Loved working with the community and working in a fast paced environment. I had regular's come in who wanted me, and only me to make their drinks. I had a great rapport with my customers."
good,This is a great place to work if you need a flexible schedule to go to school or if you like to work during a specific time of day
good,Huge brand power but supply chain is still evolving with constantly changing strategies and conflicting priorities.  Overall company culture did not extend to the same degree to supply chain organization.
good,"I open at 5:30 am, get the store stocked with food and coffee, and prepare for the morning rush.Most enjoyable part is interaction with the customers and the hardest part is staying on the same page with co-workers."
good,At starbucks i learned great customer service skills. I operated a cash register daily which was neat considering all the new technology they have today. My co-worker i loved her to death we got along very well. The most enjoyable part of my job was satisfaction of my customers when they told me i made there day
good,"Daily Fast pace environment"
good,"Starbucks is a wonderful company, who tends to care deeply about their staff from a higher up level. They provide excellent benefits, perks, and hours. From the level of a shift or barista, the immediate management never seems to fully grasp their store, and tends to over look the needs of their staff."
good,"Management and supervisors were great, however I did not feel safe at the location of the store and experienced some negativity from other employees."
good,"Waking up early, making coffee, helping cusotmers. Hardest part of my job cleaning bathrooms, the most enjoyable part of my job is seeing the smiles on my customers faces when i deliver them with the best drink ever made."
good,This is an on campus job at BGSU where students can purchase drinks with their meal plans so there is always a very long line and the employees are pushed to make drinks as quickly and accurately as possible while still providing the customers a positive experience.
good,"I enjoyed this job when I first started at the company, but over the course of several months, I realized I was not going to advance in the company at all, despite all the hard work and effort I was putting in. The pay is terrible, even if you leave and come back to the company with experience, they pay you like you've never worked there before. Not worth it with how much you are on your feet and how fast-paced it can be. Some people love it, but it was not the job for me."
good,"The business is very slow at this particular location, therefore, there is not a lot to do on an average day. A lot of time is spent standing around gossiping about other coworkers. When the work pace has picked up a  little more it is enjoyable. The customers are pretty plesant for the most part."
good,I enjoyed working at Starbucks during high school. It was easy on hours and were very flexable on the hours. Management was alright never really listened to emploies on ideas to help and improve the work place and inviorment
good,"I enjoy working at Starbucks, it taught me a lot about interpersonal communications and multitasking. The most enjoyable part of the job was making customers smile and laugh. Although the management was terrible and unprofessional. It was a good first job while in school."
good,"A very relaxed work environment and easy to assimilate into the job. Would be perfect for a college student, due to the flexible hours, if it provided better monetary compensation."
good,"Starbucks offers great benefits, with food and beverage perks while on the clock, as well as a weekly take home coffee benefits. The scheduling is flexible with day, and evening shifts available. This position is based on an hourly wage and hours earned each week depend on company labor allowance which is directive of company weekly, monthly, quarterly sales. The most enjoyable part of the position is serving the customers with a quality product and to begin each day with a smile to motive each and every person to know and feel appreciated and to be provided with excellent qualify service."
good,"Many skills at this job were useful not only in the workplace, but in every day life. I truly believe that this company has a vision for its parters, to achieve greatness in every aspect of their lives. Working through challenges that this company faced in every day life taught me to be a more patient, and kind person in general."
good,"I learned how to multitask, how to create a environment that thrives on giving great customer service and how to connect with all my customers most enjoyable part of the job was having conversations with my regular customers and seeing there face light up"
good,typical day consists of working hard to make customers happy. learned what its like to be a barista.the management is great and so are my co-workers.
good,Good place to work with a strong foundation and forward thinking for the future. Outstanding respect to our military personnel and families to make sure they can be hired into the Starbucks family.
good,"It is a Starbucks in the big box retailer Target. It was like have two corporate juggernauts for an employer. The shifts were a little hard to get used to, because Target wanted you to work different shifts during the week."
good,"Très bonne vie d'entreprise,rythme intensif,relation avec le client,culte de l'excellence,esprit d'équipe."
good,"Clean then check dates,then do dishes,make drinks,help customers,refill all supplies,sweep and clean tables,write customers name on cup then serve."
good,"Working here has provided with me with a lot of benefits. It's taught me how to be swifter while moving & learning to better manage my time. Having said that, there can be some inconsistency with management, i.e. if you're not ""in"" with the right people, you may not get very good hours or undesirable shifts. "
good,It was my first experience at LAX. Very busy environment learned a lot of new drinks  I didnt know they had. I learned a secret menu at their store. Also encountered a lot of different kinds of people.
good,Good company to work for while you are attending school. Fast pace and the time goes by fast if busy. Was exhausting to stand all day.
good,Good company to work for while in school. Has good benefits and stock options which is a plus. Certain stores are great to work at. Depends on the customer base and the employees.
good,Starbucks offers excellent benefits but very low pay.  The emphasis on the customer is a valuable trait I will carry with me for the rest of my life.  Your experience of Starbucks will depend on the manager.  Some managers are excellent and flexible others are disrespectful and loathsome.  You can transfer after six months so if you find yourself in a bad store or district leave ASAP! scheduling
good,Starbucks is a fun job for someone in school or starting out in the job force..i have been working there for four years now and i have built good relationship in both management as well with customers. every week we get a free markout and every day we get a free food item of our choice.

good,"Busy mornings and mid-day."
good,"Typical day of work revolves around coffee. A day would consist of making customers beverages and insuring the customers needs as well as possible. It also consists of daily cleaning tasks to create a clean and inviting atmosphere. "
good,J'aime travailler à Starbucks mais j'ai besoin d'un travail plus payant et plus d'heures de travail.
good,"I loved my job working as a barista, i loved making coffee, the customers were always fun to talk to and interesting, i love fast paced work environments. I also worked at Charleys Steakery and loved to cook and make Philly cheese steaks, that job was pretty interesting too...you'd be surprised what hungry people talk about. :) I always most likely get along with all my co-workers, the haardest part of my job was...there really wasn't one."
good,"I had a great time working for Starbucks, I made a lot of friends throughout the years. I was fortunate enough to work at every store downtown and learned a lot."
good,Partners are the best part and sometimes the hardest part too.
good,"Managers are not nice. They never helped me out when i was by myself working in that store and i tried to call many times for help, and they just showed up after 20 mins ( which mostly people are gone that time)"
good,Great place to work but must me up the the task when it comes to a fast pace work place.
good,"Like any retail job, a career at Starbucks starts with the thought of ""hey, this isn't actually that bad"". Depending what cafe you work in, you can float on that cloud of caffeine-induced illusion for anywhere up to a year. Unfortunately for most, disillusionment comes the minute a customer calls your manager to complain because you put twelve ice cubes in his drink instead of eight, like he asked. For me, that minute was on my first day. Since then, I endured four years of burns, verbal abuse, and pointless policy changes, but I stayed. The truth is, the good customers outnumber the bad ones, your co-workers become your second family, and most importantly, you get A LOT of free coffee. You also learn a lot of valuable skills, like how many frozen bananas it takes to break a blender and recognizing that look in someone's eye when they're about to take the lid off their hot beverage and throw it at you because you forgot to give them their croissant. Bodily harm aside, I'd rate my experience more on the positive side of things, but only because I'm still a student and I don't have to support myself on such a small wage."
good,"I have learned a lot about patience, teamwork, and stress management at this job. It is a fun work environment ands the days usually go by pretty fast. It's nice to be able to keep busy and to work together as a team with fellow employees. While I enjoy working here, I have difficulty making enough money to get by, as I anticipated bigger raises and more opportunities to move up in the company."
good,"Starbucks offers its employees a wider range of benefits than most corporations offer employees at the bottom level. Hours can be inconsistent, and actual experience is dependent on which store you work at and what your manager and coworkers are like. Better than a lot of places but still leaves much to be desired."
good,"This job is hectic. It's very hard to maintain a balance between work and study because I work 15 hours per week and I usually take 18 credit hours per semester. I learned making a lot of drinks. My boss is very kind and understanding in the sense that she allows me to take breaks whenever I want if I tell her before a week. Co-workers are friendly and I like talking to them when there are no customers around. The hardest part of the job comes into effect when there is a long queue due to which, we need to be as fast as possible. The most enjoyable part of the job is that I am free to not work during exams."
good,A typical day at work for me was to come in and make sure everyone the task they were assigned and that things were running smooth.  Working i learn how to be a cashier and provide great costumer service.  I was promoted within 2months of me being hired and held the Assistant Store manager position.  My co workers knew how the work so i did'nt have to ask much of them because they already knew what was expected of them.
good,"It was fun when it was fast past. I have learned how to order supplies, create a deposit and change order. My co-workers are very nice and great people."
good,"Starbuck is a very demanding physical job. That requires, skills, patience and knowledge."
good,"need to be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week when you're a store manager. Typical work week is 50-60 hours a week, but I did learn time management skills.  Other managers were very self involved and out for themselves.  Hardest part of the job was to navigate ways to appease upper management when their boss wasn't happy with their performance"
good,"It  a nice place to work if you want to meet people.  You learn how to deal with people in a regular basis.  Since there are High turn over rate a new manager comes in every 1 to 2 years.  Very stressful environment.  The hardest part of the job is trying to please customers, and make drinks as quick as possible in peak hours and seasonal.  The best part of this job is that you get 5 free drinks during your shift."
good,Always have something to do.. I learned how to be a self starter so I wouldn't get behind in my work..
good,"Company has changed since 2010. Less flexibility for students, etc. Left before policy changes were announced so maybe things got better."
good,"Difficile de tenir le rythme dans le plus gros Starbucks de Lyon, et en alternance c'est pire."
good,"This company is a great place for part time retail Baristas because they get benefits.  Every office is different.  The middle manager of my department was an ego-maniac.  Its decent pay for people out of college and they stressed work life balance.  You learn to work with an ERP.  You can't move around as easily as you like.  Its challenging to try to move to another department.  It may be easier to move to the corporate headquarters in your current position. "
good,This was my post high school job while trying to make a few dollars in college. I worked with a lot of fun people but soon decided to go Air Force and left on good terms.
good,"Being a store manager is a lot of hard work.The Houston market has seen a lot of turnover from baristas on up, and it is very hard to get promoted in this market."
good,"5am - open store - check all inventory and prepare for the day"
good,the job was inside offices. the best part was that the customers become like good friends.
good,"The job culture at Starbucks is very fun. Working in the city specifically, gives Starbucks partners the ability to network and work together. My peers were amazing and I build some really strong networking relationships. I was able to learn from some great leaders both at the store level and higher up. They offer many ways for their employees to network and get to know each other."
good,"It is not the job that you will only making coffee.  In everyday you need to handle any situations that can happen while you are working. For instance, dealing with customers need, complaint and shoplifting."
good,"Starbucks is a great company. The partners are very creative and unique. Management is capable, but it not always in touch with the partners."
good,learn how to deal with coworkers that was the hardest part of the job.
good,"If you love coffee and socializing, this is a great place to work."
good,"My days would consist of checking the clock in times of employees and running payroll, constantly checking e-mails from corporate and district manager, making sure employees showed up for their shift and or get it covered if they are sick, the customers were enjoyable to catch up with and chat about their days,great employees to work with."
good,They sure know what they are doing...in so many ways.  Very strict adherence to practices and policies required.
good,"Great people to work with. Supervisors knowledge is adequate for product and regulations  but not always great when it comes to staff."
good,"While the job had its perks, such as store discounts, it was far more stressful than a part-time job should be. The store was right next to a high school in a very busy area, so my coworkers and I had to play catch-up most of the time. Because of the corporate company's regulations on labor spending, much of the time the store felt understaffed."
good,"The work environment was very fast-paced and physically demanding, while still offering the opportunity to genuinely connect with both customers and coworkers on a daily basis. I loved that I was able to constantly learn and work to improve myself and my work environment with effective feedback from coworkers. I gained knowledge and experience in inventory management, cash handling, customer retention, and peer coaching. Inconsistent management was a problem at the time of my resignation, but I was still able to gain valuable interpersonal skills as a result."
good,"I truly enjoyed working with this company.  I was a fast paced coffee slinging machine!  Loved my customers and my partners and all the free coffee.  The health insurance was great and the structure of the overall company made sense, most of the time.  For fun I was voted as that fasted barista on bar from my other partners, I took pride in this!  Unfortunately, that meant I was always on bar & with an already achy back constant repetitive lifting of the milk jugs left me unable to walk by the end of my shift.  There is a rotation that is suppose to be followed, but speed is more important, I guess."
good,"Good people to work with. Management could be better, out of my professional career it's probably the most unprofessional management I've ever worked under, which was a huge difference for me compared to what I'm used too. Pay is average, benefits are awesome...which is why so many people stay with Starbucks. Work is somewhat easy, the stress level can be quite chaotic, could be better if had better management. Overall it's an average job, I will again say the benefits are really good."
good,"Starbucks is hectic and tricky and can be very stressful. Add to that people that are late to work and not caffeinated. I was in charge of the sales floor and back of house for all three shifts on various days. This includes store set up and tear down, money handling and deposits, partner breaks and store cleanliness. The most important thing about working at Starbucks was being a happy, perky, energetic person with a ""can do"" attitude. I learned how to be a positive problem solver. Most co-workers were great but some were not. Some had to be highly supervised or they wouldn't work at all. I could be difficult to positively motivate some of the younger baristas to do the job that they were being paid for and as an Assistant Manager I did not have the authority to do anything about it but take it to the manager. I loved meeting new people and getting to know the community that I lived in."
good,The staffs were nice. I learned quickly by having some of the best supervisors in Starbucks.
good,"Le développement de carrière difficile "
good,"Always excelled in all that I did, and worked in a fast and timely manner."
good,"Typically day, I would clean working areas and equipment, present coffee and answer questions about menu items, check with customers to ensure that they are enjoying their meals, and inform customers of daily specials. The work environment is actually a pretty good work environment. The co-worker are very fun to be with."
good,Early mornings and low wage made paying bills difficult. High turnover.
good,"Taking reservations"
good,"perfect for students"
good,"Magré le travail et le potentiel de cette fonction, les avis négatifs l'emportent sur le positif. "
good,"Not Satisfied with management training program.  Unorganized and not supportive for ""new baristas"".  Culture is falsely advertised."
good,"Its always fun making coffee"
good,"opened a new store and it was crazy"
good,"Work hard while making it interesting building customer relationships and reaching sales goals and other goals needed to maximize efficiency within the store."
good,Working at Starbucks has changed my perspective of customer service. On a day-to-day basis I witness myself and my co-workers deal with some of the most obnoxious customers and yet still press on through the day treating the remaining ones with nothing but the upmost respect. The values that Starbucks builds its team on make it flow and come together completely. My co-workers are my family. I work in such a close knit store and I believe that when it comes down to it that alone sets us up for success. We have the ability to notice each others weakness and help one another balance out. The hardest part of the job sometimes especially during closing shifts is time management. Making sure everything is shut down in a timely manner without inconveniencing anyone can be difficult at times. The most enjoyable part would be seeing our regulars and serving them and putting that smile on their face.
good,"A warehouse worker’s job tends to vary somewhat depending on the specifics of the warehouse and what is stocked or processed there, but this person’s primary tasks usually have to do with selecting, organizing, and processing merchandise. He or she may be responsible for filling orders, for instance, which often requires finding items from bulk storage, sorting them, and then preparing them for shipment or delivery. This person may also be in charge of keeping warehouse merchandise organized. Operating heavy machinery like forklifts is usually part of the job, but understanding computer databases and electronic ordering systems can be just as important in many cases."
good,"This isn't a job for lazy people. It's very fast and intensive. It's not only physically, but also mentally draining."
good,Constant communication with District partners and strong ability to manage a workplace with a wide variety of ages and personalities. Will succeed on the bottom line with strong business acumen and the ability to forecast customer business while training and coaching on how to provide customer service in a busy environment.
good,"a typical day of work for me is getting to work before time to transition from previous shift supervisor. Assign workers where needed. organize and prioritize store. Maintain customer contact while delegating staff, and keeping them motivated."
good,"I was both a shift manager and a barista. I worked at two different stores. How much you enjoy your job greatly depends on your manager. Your district managers and customers can also play a role. It is a fun job if you are looking to get by while pursuing another job. I would never suggest to move up in the company. There is a lot of gossip/drama that goes on. It is also extremely stressful. I personally never desired to go that route; however, I know many people who have. It definitely takes a certain person to go that route."
good,"this is a fun part time job for the summer, not really a job you want to stay in for a long time but you will make some good friendships"
good,This place isn't the greatest. Coffee is not anything special. Its all about a  the customers and how cooperation decide to run things. Co-workers can make or break the job. I am still fairly new to it.
good,Jobs varied from cashiering to making drinks. Lots of work and short in staff
good,"Working at Starbucks was fun at times and exhausting at others. I worked the morning shift so my days started pretty early. I was one of the best Baristas on my shift so I worked the bar a lot. It was very fast paced. I learned a lot about coffee, where it comes from and how its made. I also learned a lot about team leadership and guidance. My manager was awesome and would often times jump in the work line and help us out when it got super busy. Most of my co-workers were a blast. We were all hyped up on caffeine and joking around with each other when there was down time. The hardest part of the job was not getting fatigued when the line just kept coming and having to drag the big heavy floor mats outside to scrub them. The most enjoyable part of the job was connecting with regulars and being able to brighten someones day."
good,"Great as a part time job, good benefits"
good,Starbucks pride themselves on having that extra factor. I did teach me a lot when working there. Great people skills and I did most of my supervisor training there. It's a great company to work for if you enjoy being busy and on your feet all day
good,"A typical day at work would start with clocking in of course, and then finding the shift manager to see where I was going to be working at. Whether it was going to be the bar (making drinks), drive thru DTR or DTO (Drive thru ring up or drive thru order), Or in the front ringing up. From then on depending where he or she put me, that is what my job for the day was, along with some other small cleaning duties. At Starbucks I learned how to make the drinks, all the recipes, how to operate certain machinery and how to go about doing proper customer service. The management was like any other company just managed and did their job. My co workers for the most part were very hard working and spent time wisely getting what they needed to done. The hardest part of the job was dealing with unhappy customers but at the end of the day everything worked out, and the customer is always right. The most enjoyable part of the job was the free caffeine and making new friends!"
good,Loved learning to make the drinks and serving the customers and getting to know them.
good,A very fast paced work enviorment that allowed me to use my managerial skills to full effect.
good,Working at Starbucks entailed preparing and distributing food and beverages to customers on a daily basis.  The duty of handling cash transactions makes the position of Barista seem more desirable.  Maintaining a friendly work atmosphere is a must or coworkers may feel neglected.
good,"The work itself was fun co-workers are great! If you closed it included every cleaning task needed for the store. The work load balance was not even when it came to separate shifts. They are not compassionate when it comes to their workers lives and situations, Its all about a quick buck, But the benefits are amazing with the company. The district manager is not the best that is for sure I feel as though they could definitely step up and do better of job."
good,"In my experience, Starbucks is a great company to work with, the benefits are outstanding and the people that work here are great."
good,Loved this job. Making coffee and putting a smile on your customers faces early in the morning is the best!
good,"good place to work, but its repetitive, not given enough responsibilities to prove myself"
good,"I got to meet alot of new people , but the job itself was not for me, very little hours, and confined workspace"
good,"It wasn't stimulating, but where it lacked stimulation it made up for it in redundancy."
good,The best part of this job was all the free coffee you could drink
good,"A typical day at work consisted of me hearing ""I WANT MY COFFEE!"""
good,"Overall, I made very close relationships with my co-workers at this job. We developed great friendships and even have spent time with one another outside of the work environment. This helped us because in emergencies or times when one of us couldn't work, we could rely faithfully on our co-workers as a team. At Starbucks, the majority of my day consisted of making drinks for customers- seasonal and non-seasonal. Aside from that, I assisted customers frequently with their needs and questions. Before my shifts ended, I was required to clean up the kiosk and prepare for the next worker's shift."
good,It's a good place to work and the partners are generally good to work with as well.
good,"An experience for anyone at Starbucks, customer or employee, always varies. I learned the importance of keeping the customer satisfied through the correction of beverages ordered and individually specific orders. The hardest part of the job, at times, was the amount of business on any given day. I enjoyed working the opening shifts because it allowed me the opportunity at a different perspective of the job as a whole."
good,"A typical day at work depends heavily upon management and the individuals present. A challenging job, but extremely pleasant if those around you are focused and dedicated to ensuring all things are cleaned, maintained, and stocked. Customers can be rude, however, if you keep a cool head, and are knowledgeable and professional, almost any situation can be diffused and resolved quickly and quietly. Interesting variety of goods and merchandise to have access to discounts for."
good,"* Providing excellent customer service."
good,"Whereas the environment was poor for the employees and the management of the shop very unprofessional and a bad listener, I enjoyed working for Starbucks as I experienced a good example of customer service focussing and personnalised assistance."
good,It was fun making coffee and Starbucks is very cultured.  You can't go far on this salary though.
good,I would supervise employees on my shift. I trained new hires. I made drinks and served customers.
good,"My typical day as a Senior Barista includes ensuring proper maintenance of all coffee machines and inventories, maintaining a clean and organized work space for resources and product as required, clean or sanitize work areas, utensils, equipment, and seating areas, check temperatures of freezers, refrigerators, or heating equipment to ensure proper functioning, preparing hand crafted hot and cold beverages, and providing excellent customer service."
good,"It was an amazing learning experience to have worked here!"
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with customers and getting to know them."
good,I was make sandwiches yogurt snacks tracks and a lot of other stuff.
good,"greeting customers, taking orders, preparing orders, worked with fun people I enjoyed being there"
good,started out in atlanta it was great moved to chino and my manager was very inexperienced
good,A typical day consists of brewing coffee constantly and making drinks on the hot and cold bar in the correct order in which they are received and getting them out to the customer in a timely manner. Co-workers are what make the job enjoyable and fun. The hardest part of the job is interacting with hundreds of different people a day and making sure every order is correct.
good,"I would make coffee drinks and other drinks for customer, maintain cleanliness of store front and back, stock supplies, close down shop."
good,"Working for starbucks is difficult. I would recommend it to young career minded people, but I find it increasingly more difficult to survive on what they pay for a professional Barista."
good,"Working at Starbucks is like getting a whole new family. The people, including customers, are great. Typically you would make customers coffee or special drinks. Heat up some breakfast or lunch sandwiches and engage in small talk with some normal customers."
good,"great benefits, many smart coworkers, free coffee and cheap parking"
good,"I worked at one of the busiest Starbucks in the state, and every day was booming for business.  There was never a boring moment, but my fellow coworkers kept things relaxed and fun.  I left this job once I got my tutoring job, which I'm still at."
good,On a typical day at work I begin by doing several of the same tasks.  I first check daily emails for any updates that may be necessary for my department or the store.  Depending on which day of the week I go to the back room and count product and order the necessary items to be fully stocked.  I may print off team members availability so that I can write the next week's schedule.  Then I would head to my department to maintain freshness of goods while serving guests of the store.  Prepare any items needed for the next day.  Follow daily cleaning logs to maintain a safe environment.  Delegate current weeks tasks to team members.  Coach any team member who may need assistance in an area.  Drive guest surveys by updating team members with new product info or department changes.
good,Fijne collegiale sfeer met veel persoonlijke aandacht voor je ontwikkeling.
good,"Great college job, fun atmosphere and usually friendly people. You do often have to deal with customers who are just going to make you want to give up on humanity. Management will try to get you to work harder with no raise by dangling imaginary promotions, but as long as you don't fall for it it's OK. Regular customers become almost like family and with a good team the job is cake. God help you if you mess up someone;s drink though."
good,"Enjoyed working with the other girls. Flexible schedule, fun job to perform, great coffee infused conversations with guests."
good,good management easy to mingle with but some co workers not good
good,"only worked there 2 week so i didnt really get the oppurtunity to take note of these questions , and the starbucks isnt there anymore"
good,Great boss and great co-workers.  I loved everything about this place.
good,"Very fast paced environment, great place to learn about culture and people"
good,"Management is not good at all, but got a lot of hours, breaks were short sometimes none at all."
good,Constant interaction with customers in a retail environment.
good,"The best thing about Starbucks would be the friends you can make and the fact that you can make someone's day simply by making a cup of coffee. Its amazing. I love that when I get to work I have people there that make it enjoyable and my customers will want to be close to you. It is very rewarding to know that your customers smile when they see you and that you are part of their lives in a positive way. Every job has its downs, but that's why you look to the ups instead."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks feels very stressful due to the amount of customers we get and the lack of proper labor management. "
good,"A typical day at work involved opening the store, stocking the display cases and preparing several drinks, like coffee, iced coffee, teas for sale during the day. Typical days would also include closing the store, mopping the floors and cleaning and also going through eco-sure tests for cleanliness of the store. I learned how thorough the ecosure cleanliness standard for starbucks can be. I also learned a great deal about such a wonderful business model. Management at starbucks was terrible. They would maintain standards and protocol for operating the store that were both illegal and impossible to meet. For example, store close was not to happen before an hour or so of actual store close, but theoretically if you didn't begin your store close process at least 4 hours before store close, you would never finish in time and starbucks would complain for having to pay extra hours of labor. Also, management would coerce you to sign out of work shortly after the store closed then continue working so as to save the company money.  The hardest part of the job was making sure each customer got their customized drink before they were waiting in a long line too long. the most enjoyable part of the job was conversing with customers as we made their drink. We used to say that starbucks baristas were more like therapists to their customers who got so involved in their personal lives. The most important part of starbucks' business model is connecting with the customer and providing an experience that is more personal and friendly than the competition. For those who excel in customer service,"
good,"a typical day at starbucks starts with a delicious coffee.  we welcome our customers as though they are our friends, being we know them as neighbors we run into at the store, when we are out to dinner or enjoying our extracurricular activities.  I have learned to work in close quarters with a group of coworkers each fulfilling their role .Management has changed dramatically over the past few years we are macromanaging to the point, well it is not a good point, there is much insecurity at every level and the wellbeing of the partners is no longer the responsibility of our individual district. the hardest part of the job is the new system they are trying to implement and the most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the customers we see every day and being able to exchange daily activities and have the friendships we share through our daily encounters of life"
good,I worked at the Starbucks located at the Tulsa International Airport so you can imagine how cranky people are there. It was a very fast pace job and there was always something to do which I enjoyed I like staying busy but working there and going to school full time was a lot to handle.
good,it was lot of fun and experience in the customer service plus it help my communication skills
good,"lots of work to do with not a lot of pay. always new people, learned a lot about how to deal with everything that"
good,"A typical day at work started at 5am and ended at 3pm, i would open the store count registers handled money deposits and store orders while also providing customer service."
good,"Overall Starbucks is a great place to work if you like a 9-5 job that is pretty comfortable. The culture here is one of being very risk-averse, so if you like to push the boundaries and are a very creative person, Starbucks may not be for you. Co-workers are friendly and the company takes care of their employees."
good,I got to work with good people. It was a good job to have in high school.
good,"great people, fast past environment. Customers are nice to an extent and repetitive work"
good,"●	Maintain professional, calm demeanor during periods of high volume and unforeseen events "
good,"Your start work at 6 in the morning and your day doesnt end till 4, people tend to be a little on edge without their coffee but being able to interact with them and make something thats gonna make their whole day better is a wonderful feeling"
good,The management wasn't the best which made the employees lack.
good,"Starbucks is OK but the pace is very hectic. "
good,A typical day at work would be going in checking emails and key points/updates for the week. After answering any emails working a little of schedules and time punches for the week. Then sometimes even work on forecasting for 3 weeks in advance. Then when needed I would help out on the floor as a barista to ensure that play calls are being made right and customers are getting taken care of. There are also days that full orders have to be put in or they have to be received and put away.
good,Fast paced. Great customers. Wonderful company. Politically charged.
good,"Oversee daily operations of the caf?, inventory, cash flow, daily reports and goal setting."
good,"A typical day at work would include making sure the store front and back are clean, talking to and serving smiles to my guests, and making sure everyone leaves knowing they received the best possible service i could give.  Ive learned quite a few things working with people in this job and its patrons.  Ive learned that you must treat everyone with the same respect that you would want to be treated.  My co-workers for the most part are a very fun and lively group of people.  There is not a day that I don't leave with a smile on my face.  The hardest part of this job and I hate to say it I guess would be dealing with people who bring there personal problems to work and take it out on their co-workers.  The most enjoyable part would be the coffee."
good,working at starbucks is a good experience just not a good long term job money wise.
good,I usually just make beverages throughout my entire shift. I learned how to make Starbucks beverages and how to prepare different kinds of coffee.
good,"-Hardworking, fast pace working environment and a lot of cleaning and maintenance."
good,Average customer service job - not in an area I was interested in.
good,"I started out in Seattle where Starbucks is an amazing experience.  After moving my work site to Southern California I discovered there is a huge gap in experiencing the CEO's vision.  I found, by comparison that the stores in California were not as clean as in Seattle.  I found the drinks were being made faster but at the cost of quality.  They simply put speed before quality, and the customers don't know, because they haven't been north.  At the district manager level I found a no care attitude toward product and that they didn't show employees any safety in job security, simply creating security breaches in money handling and other security issues.  One store I worked for was comping their friends with free drinks in the 40 to 50 thousand dollar per year range and nobody cared, so they could increase their tip jar value.  If that had happened in Seattle, a police officer would have been there at point of termination, but in California, it just rolled on, to everybody's knowledge, and to everybody's absence of mind."
good,"Fast pace, food preperation."
good,Maintaining a safe and clean work environment. Taking customer orders and making drinks. Communicating effectively and presenting excellent customer service.
good,"Good retail food position"
good,"Starbucks seems like a great company, when they are trying to sell it to you. After you have worked there its a different vision. Now this is not about ALL Starbucks, just the ones in the area I have worked at. "
good,"•Provided friendly and attentive customer service"
good,Loved the store location was very happy to drive to work everyday and see my regualr customers.
good,"Pay is not as great but, if you work at a good location you get great tips.  Management is always changing so there is no need to try and get comfortable with each manager.  Like all places, some customers are great and others just need a little more coffee than others."
good,The job at hand requires great communication and excellent interpersonal skills to not get easily frustrated.
good,wasn't at the job too long it did work with my school schedule
good,"The benefit program is awesome but the pay is low, and management should all be retrained. Its supposed to be a great place to grow within the company, but there are times where no matter how hard you work and show initiative the growing process can be a no go."
good,"Everyday you will learn a lot of things working in starbucks..How many people everyday you will encounter, different kind of nationality different kind of attitude..But its really enjoyable"
good,"It was an experience, but just not the place for me. I wouldn't recommend anyone to work for this company."
good,"Starbucks was a fun place to work but the place was run poorly and there was favoritism among the managers, supervisors and employees and that is one thing that bothered me the most. Poor training, I had to learn my position along the way and it took me almost 3 months to learn everything and to correct my mistakes that I had been taught wrong in the beginning."
good,The company has great benefits.  Employees are given full benefits at 20 hrs per week.  However the pay is not that great and job demands off hours work.
good,I feel as though I am ready to take the next step in my journey in life for growth.
good,"Being A Barista, is one of the job that i was so confused and having my hard time to cope of with this job but of course the essence of keeping your self studying on your job gives you knowledge! that's what ive gain here because being a barista you have to become a walking recipe card, you have to memorized the syrup needed in a drink,to give customers satisfaction with their order,management in starbucks are all cool they playing their role like a team too.same with the co-workers,hardest part for me is those time that i was in my first two weeks memorizing those syrups per drinks but i thank god i cope of it and i can serve and give conversation with the our customer and having them back looking for me.."
good,Learning about different coffees and mixtures was fun. Would have liked to continued working there with out restrictions.
good,It all depends on the location and how you work. But at the end of the day it's nothing special.
good,"you now have to work a full year before accruing vacation time, that vacation time then starts at your 2nd year, a year and a half you only have 12 hours, is that supposed to be work life balance. advancing there is few and far between, you work your butt off for 10$hr with 1.20 per hour in tips, please, try and live off of a $550 paycheck especially if you have kids, a car payment, school to pay for, etc. I guess if you work in corporate you might be able to make it, if you don't get fired for a bs reason. my experience was soured by a bad manager in a bad district manager"
good,"This place is hard work, never underestimate a barista and you'll deal with some of the most arrogant people you will ever meet in your lifetime."
good,"fast paced, high demand environment. worked in the one of the most prestigious Starbucks in Los Angeles. team work. "
good,It was an okay place to work. I had to leave because I moved too far away. The staff was nice and the supervisor was nice. 
good,"overall, i enjoyed the job i was just sad that i had to leave Salisbury , NC which also included leave one of the best jobs iIve ever had."
good,"Starbucks offers great training, fun team environments, and high standards for the employees. However, it is difficult to work your way up through the company and definitely acts like a corporate powerhouse. "
good,Go to I hate Starbucks.com and it will tell you all you need to know
good,"I think that my company has some management issues. Overall, a good company to work for"
good,"It's fun and rewarding at times. I have learnt how to manage stressful situations, and get on really well with all my co-workers."
good,"At my store, Starbucks is a great place for customers to get a great cup of coffee in a relaxing atmosphere. However, it is very poorly managed behind the counter. Scheduling conflicts with most of the employees are often overlooked, employees do not get along well and the situation is not addressed and some of the standards required by the state and the company addressing cleanliness seem to be lack. However when it comes to customer service, the team is spot-on. "
good,I made coffee. Had some really good customers that would come in everyday and they made the day complete.
good,"It depends on the company's needs. Sometimes I spend 5 hours and sometimes 12 hours at job. In the morning I check the temperature of the fridges, check the delivery and set up the store for opening. I also count the whole outer safe. After opening the job I go to the office to do the food order. Then I am with my partners on the floor. I decide what position and duties to give to particular people. I encourage them to upsell and offer new products to customers. I monitor the temperature of the frides every four hours. At about 10 am I count the whole safe and deposit the money."
good,"washed dishes, made drinks, cleaned the guest dinner, stocked produce and products, took orders and smiled"
good,Work was fast paced and hectic at times. The regular customers were the best part.
good,"Lots of drinks to serve every day with plenty of customer interaction.  I learned how to effectively manage my co-workers and motivate them to get the job done correctly and in a timely fashion.  The management was not as good as I had originally hoped, but that did not deter my ambition or work ethic.  The hardest part of my job there was the process of learning how to manage, but I learn quickly, so it soon became easy.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to interact with the customers and employees concurrently in order to cater to a relaxed, casual environment and provide an excellent customer experience.  "
good,"Working in a coffee shop has its ticks. You are one of the first faces they see when they come to work and get their coffee so you make their day, so it can be tricky. Then spilling extremely hot coffee on yourself, every five mins at least"
good,"Definitely advanced quickly in this corporation. Reasonable hours, great for going to school or need something to be more flexible."
good,"Truthfully, for the amount of work required, there is no reason to not just become a full server and gain an easy 50% boost to your net income. I've had a manager laugh at me over the phone for calling out sick with a 105 fever from a lung infection. Still, they're flexible with your schedule, making them a great choice for full-time students."
good,"I've worked for Starbucks on and off for years."
good,"Its an ok place to work .the reason why i really kept this job is because I can at any point of time go on vacation or something like that with short notice . Which is really good for me because i travel a lot. "
good,"There were no typical days at Starbucks each day was different depending on customer, partners and adminstrative tasks.  I learned the food business and how to serve over 400 customer in a store period of time.  My direct manager did not have the same passion as the corporations. Things were not explained in a consistent mannor and many times details were left out which resutled in failure. The message was also not consistent from one manager to another. The hardest part of this job was the time limiations.  As a manager you had only 4 hours to complete all adminstrative task for the entire 40 hour week no overtime was allowed or non-completion of task.  I enjoyed the customers, partners, the company, the fast paced business and working at Starbucks."
good,Enjoying time with the customers makes the job fun.Teamwork is the key.
good,"Starbucks is alwys a on the move company. Always changing and trying to better themselves. however so many rule changes contiually add to frustration for some. Things never hold any consistancy. If you're able to work around that, the job is beyond suitable."
good,"Learned how to make drinks, Customer service, working the cash register, loading gift cards, working with my co-workers was fun I enjoyed it, we helped each other when needed, we also had to stock cups , lids, make coffee, tea, open , close, also work in the gift shop when needed."
good,One of the better companies out there to work for! The company has very high standards for food/bev quality and cleanliness.
good,Hours very difficult to retain. Advancement is completely dependent on your relationship with one person: the store manager. Great coworkers. Absolutely a great temporary place to work.
good,High paced environment where multitasking is key. It is the type of job that you need to be able to do multiple tasks on top of providing quality customer service and keeping cleanliness on high quality
good,"The typical day at Starbucks involves runs the full spectrum from fast paced and stressful, to slow and boring and everything in between, depending on the customers. Some days its the greatest job you can have, other days you will have people yelling at you and cussing you out because the person in front of them took too long to figure out what they wanted. I learned how to handle customers who used employees as a whipping boy, i learned how to intuit customers needs and the importance of small actions. Management is hit or miss. I went through several managers, some great, some horrible. The ones willing to listen to their employees were usually the best and customer service blossomed under their leadership. The hardest part of the job was dealing with people who just wanted to be angry at someone and nothing will change that. The most enjoyable part of the job is the good customer interactions where you can make someone happy by fixing a simple problem or brighten their day with a laugh."
good,"I worked for Starbucks located on my college campus. It was fun, my work schedule worked around class schedule. If I had an exam I would tell them in advance and more times than not, someone would cover my shift. I liked my job, I got to interact with so many different people and I did have fun. Though it was stressful at times, especially during promotions and midterm and finals week, I did like my co-workers and it made work a lot easier."
good,Worked the 4am shift till 830am. Early morning shift in the Drive Thru. Loved my clients! And Loved the idea I could still work and go to school with an intership.
good,"I am privileged to have gained a great amount of customer service, personal growth and many employment oppurtunities throughout my employment history. The past few years of working at Starbucks have helped me learn more about myself and the power of positive thinking within a stressful, fast paced environment. The highlight of my day always revolved around customer interraction and spreading cheer while helping customers start their day in a positive way."
good,a typical day would start with reveiwing store and stocking for the day. preping food and espresso machine. take orders and make coffee. work register. clean
good,learned a lot about coffee and the basis of great customer service
good,het werk was erg leuk. ik ben zelf erg geintreseert in de koffie wereld. heb er veel geleerd over koffie. Het leuke aan Starbucks is dat er veel internationale collega's zijn. en dus veel van hun kan leren.
good,"I would show up for my shift on time. Go clock in, get on the floor and start preparing for the day. I would set up da iced teas, brewed coffee, set up the pastrie case, stock up the condiment stand, make sure all displays are properly showing,markout all out of date items and put new items in correct order for use. Assign to a register and start greeting customers and taking orders. I would aslo be on bar which is called a ""Barista"" and start preparing hot/cold drinks in a fast and freindly manner. I would do this for my whole shift than at the end of my shift i would make sure that my area of work is fully stocked and cleaned for the next barista to take position."
good,The days at work are fine really busy or really dead.Ive learned plenty of things like how to make drinks customer service.I have networked and made plenty of friends that Im friends with till this day. The management I have no comment they are doing their job. the hardest part of the job if you work in the morning when everyone has to go to work.
good,"No two stores are the same, diffrent strokes for diffrent folks ! You make you experience"
good,"A typical day to work included getting up at 4am, going to work at 5am, being bombarded by customer complaints and demands for 8 hours, and dealing with unreasonable and uncaring management. The only reason I've stayed for so long is because of my coworkers and the promise from management that I would be developed and trained for advancement -- which never happened. Maybe I was just hired into a poorly managed store. It was a good high school job given that it's flexible, but the wage is too low to live on."
good,always on the go never a dull moment.. working drive thru is a bit hard to get use to but then you cando it.
good,"Working at starbucks did not fit into the my stereotype of a coffee shop. It was fast paced and most of it didn't have to do with making coffee. It involved cleaning, warming up sandwiches, mopping, dishes, customer service, and one position in the store was making coffee. I rarely ever got to be on the espresso machine and the management didn't properly train me either. It was a bad experience, but the company itself has awesome benefits."
good,"I worked at starbucks as a part time barista and then became a shift lead supervisor. I enjoyed working with people who had a passion for what they did and enjoyed interacting with the customers. There is a lot of work involved working for starbucks. The daily tasks range from paperwork filled out for corporate to washing dish's, making product, fixing the machines, deligating cleaning tasks and so on. The day is filled with things to do and I enjoyed the rush of the business. I enjoyed working for starbucks and getting to know my customers as friends."
good,Fun place to work! I loved meeting new people. The things that l learned at this company is how to mix and make drinks. The hardest part about the job was dealing with difficult costumers.
good,"This Starbucks was not an actual store. It was a kiosk in one of the university's buildings so the staff was actually employed by the university. The kiosk is incredibly small but we manage to fill orders at a rapid pace. We often have lines out the door with people patiently waiting to order and receive their beverage. The managers, although pleasant and fun, are not the best I have encountered. They never arrive to work on time, they yell at employees in front of customers, they grab food with their bare hands, and they chat on the side when the kiosk is swamped. However, it is because of this that I have learned so much. I am able to work quickly and cleanly, all while maintaining a smile and carrying on a conversation with the customers. I have been told that I am the bubbliest barista and that I'm clearly passionate about the hospitality industry. I can operate both the cash register and the espresso bar. I typically arrive at 6:30am to open the kiosk (set up the pastries, brew the coffee, etc) and begin service at 7:30am. I work for a few hours until I have class. My favorite part of the job is meeting new people, learning their drinks, and providing excellent customer service. I love to see a happy customer."
good,"stock counter, cashier, make drinks, free food, a goood high school job"
good,"hours were good, pay was great. really didnt enjoy it there but it paid the bills"
good,"I desired to stay at this job. I had received many compliments and co-workers as well as employees a like you complimented me. However I was a seasonal worker. Although I desired to stay, they decided instead to keep a rude worker that mainly played on her phone and harassed workers and customers."
good,"Work starts early, such as 5:30am in the weekdays, to prepare the store and serve customers that are on their way to work. Work environment is fun and you get a lot of face to face interaction. You get to harness you communication skills, intra and interpersonal skills and solving problems."
good,"Depending on what time I go in I, set up the store by counting money and putting partners in there postions and doing the inventory.Go in always knowing there is not a slow moment in the day. Meeting new costumers and always helping costumers with any questions and condensers. Throughout the day Im always sending partners on breaks and myself, either making drinks or cleaning,dealing wih costumers. I count out to the next supervisor, clean anything that needs to be clean help any costumers who need help before clocking off."
good,"on a typical day i did the washing up, cleaning tables and interacting with custimers. I enjoyed interacting with others and learning more about the buisness and the differant roles in the workplace."
good,"Worked at a busy store, customer service is bases of work. Co-workers are good people and hard workers. Hard work and strange hours."
good,A typical day at work was for me to work by myself from 4pm to 8pm.
good,"I enjoyed meeting amiable customers and talking with them. Some managers are genuine, kind people who care about their employees. Others can go off on power-trips and alienate those around them greatly."
good,"It's not a bad place to work, all the people are friendly and you learn really quickly how everything works."
good,I absolutely love the work environment and my fellow employees but it is impossible to be a full time employee due to the high labor and the amount of individuals that get hired when not in need. I am ready to step up to a full time job with experiences in which I can provide my skills.
good,-A typical day at work consisted of socializing with customers while getting tasks done and making drinks.
good,"Working at Starbucks is just like any other workplace all except the people you work with. The employees are really nice, cool people who get along with anyone who is a team player."
good,Starbucks is a great place o work for. Many benefits come with the job.
good,"Served all customers with the utmost integrity and friendly service possible. Even though it is a fast paced job, friendly customer service needs to remain the priority."
good,"Making coffee, constant communication with customers, food preparation, handling cash register, cleaning services."
good,"Starbucks was a fun job that kept you moving and involved with the community. I learned how to multitask and be very efficient. Our customers were the best. Some would bring us plate lunches when we worked holidays. There was definitely a feeling of belonging. I had great co-workers who had great work ethic. I loved my job so much it was hard to go home. What killed the dream for me was when the company started closing all the stores and changing the culture, that I felt, made the company successful to begin with. It went from being the best job I ever had to the most stressful one. I watched co-workers that had been with company for 5 years are more start to leave. Eventually, I gave in as well and moved on."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the customers, everyday working at the register i meet different types of customers."
good,"the work environment meeting people is great ut the management and demands are unorganized,no benefits"
good,Starbucks is a great place to work if you are in school. Like most customer service jobs it tends to be stressful at times. It is fast-paced and you are always moving.
good,Good people to work with but managment often changed. Good relationship developed between employees and lower management. Rarely had consistancey with upper management.
good,"The most enjoyable part of working here was the freedom to be yourself and express oneself. Working here took a lot of composure when dealing with high-volume traffic of customers. A typical day included an extensive amount of cleaning and, of course, cash handling and drink preparation. Here I learned how to keep my composure a little too well, and how to multi-task with a multitude of different tasks to finish before my shift was over. I also learned the importance of inventory management."
good,"I worked the graveyard shift for support. Nothing too exciting, very quiet during the evenings. Minimal interaction with other employees. Supervisors were nice but overly helpful. If you enjoy working independently on a computer and phone all day, its perfect for you. Once in a while got treats in the mornings. Parking was easy for the late shift but terrible for anyone coming in mid morning."
good,The beginning of the day was always busy and the afternoon time also. I learned what a Barista is. Management could of been better. Huge language barrier with the employees. Training employees was difficult. I enjoyed caring to the needs of the cumstomers.
good,i loved working for starbucks dtw but some of the managers were just rude and always seemed mad
good,My experiance here was for the most part positive. It teaches you paitnece and good customer skills. It also improve your multi-tasking skills.
good,"Depending on the day and shift you may have time for a break, however there is no private area for employees. Management varies from store to store. Co-workers vary from hardworking to lazy and one has to adapt and learn what motivates people. The hardest part of the job is both lazy co-workers and rude customers, though both are not the norm. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with fun people, serving thankful customers, and learning about all the coffees and how to make all the combinations of drinks. This company knows how to make learning fun."
good,great job opportunity. the company is a good one but the work environment is high in stress and demands.
good,"Early mornings with a fast paced enviroment, coffee experience and customer service skills are always being challenged daily."
good,supervising 3-4 employees in busy airport location. Maintain corporate guidelines and inventory. Serve food and beverages to airline customers and personnel. Charged with banking cash registers for employees.
good,Supervised employees in a high volume store with drive thru. I learned how to do deposits and order inventory. The manager made empty promises and did not provide me opportunities for advancement. The co-workers are lazy 18-25 year olds who work slow and complain a lot. The hardest part was knowing I was not making enough money to compensate the work I did. The most enjoyable part was making the customers days better.
good,I worked for this company on weekends during my summers in high school. It was a quiet job but I enjoyed it very much.
good,"I loved Starbucks, but the wages are not sufficient. The company treats the staff well and trains them well. It was fast-paced and fun, but I could make more money as a labourer than a supervisor."
good,A great work enviornment for someone starting out in life. Left to continue my education.
good,"i loved working here. It was fast paced and fun. Free coffee is a great plus. Also, if you worked there there were great benefits at other companies."
good,Management was horrible. Fun environment. Best part of the job was working with all the different people on a day to day basis and serving them quickly to brighten their day in any way you could.
good,"working for starbucks was a very fun and faced paced environment. because it was very demanding job the management always seemed to be in a bad mood, if you have the right team put together the workplace is a very wonderful place to work."
good,It gets busy. Be prepared. As an opener you will prep the store for the entire day while serving customers.
good,"The best part of the job was the interaction with customers and with several co-workers, and of course the really good benefits"
good,No support from the company. I enjoy my customers but the support has to be meet adequately to remain a good work center.
good,"The promise of benefits and consistent hours does not hold up from one store to another. Managers and District Managers frequently use hourly ""partners"" to cover for their own mistakes."
good,"Providing food service in an extremely fast-paced, high-stress environment."
good,"When I first worked there I didn't get taught how to make drinks, and people were getting mad at me for things I never got trained on. Eventually I taught myself bar and ended to getting more hours. Over time new hires still weren't trained properly and a lot of the people there became unreliable. Now most people don't want to be there."
good,"The management wasn't too great. I felt as though I was being neglected when it came to my ideas of personal experience of success to my shift leader on a daily bases. I was then lead to believe that my manager at the time was suffering greatly, causing me to pick up extra duties along with managerial duties as well. I was not given a raise when I was working full-time hours when I was technically part-time. My peers, on the other hand, were extremely supportive and kept the slow days entertaining. If management has changed for the better then the reviews would be 5 stars rather than 3."
good,"Great coworkers and regulars but only problem is hours. Not many people at my location have received hours higher than 20 at my store, even some of the shift supervisors pick up shifts at different stores to make money. Management is absolutely terrible and expects us to talk to every single customer even when clear they do not wish to speak (I was once forced to converse with a customer as my manager asked me to talk tthem even though it was clear they did not want to talk, long story short they told me toimd my own business.) Hourse are hoorible yet hired a new person last week and when asked about hours picking up she replied with ""iffi see you putting in more effort I'll think about it"" I have on multiple occasions worked double shifts when asked even though I had a four hour gap between them when she has told me to suck it up because she can't afford to pay me between the shift to just work the whole time. Have overheard her talk to district manager about her getting a bigger bonus this year because she cut costs around the store and she does so by stopping brewing coffee at 6pm and me and other baristas face the backlash of this when they complain how we have to do a pour over for them when it is a coffee house."
good,good company to get some work experience but don’t recommend as a long term job as it’s very stressful and demanding. team managers can really dictate how enjoyable work there can be.
good,"I overall enjoyed my job at Starbucks.  It can get hectic from the fast paced environment, but overall you are there to enhance people’s daily lives and Starbucks fosters that ability."
good,"The team and customers make the experience worthwhile. And the benefits are a bonus too. "
good,"Barely enough management to ensure standards are met so more senior baristas are required to enforce, train, and act as managers while being paid the same as a new hire. Shift supervisors aren’t paid enough to care about doing the extra work when the store manager is off doing damage control for other stores because of the lack of management across the board."
good,"Generally seems to be a good business and decent job which cares about its employees, however my particular store has given me more negative than positive experiences"
good,Great staff honestly. The baristas work hard and try their best to give out best customer service in such a difficult neighborhood. Management could be better.
good,It was a pretty fun place to work. It was pretty easy and the people were very nice. I liked the free drinks and didn’t need much notice on getting time off.
good,"At Starbucks you need to be responsible and well paced. The environment and customers can be to much to handle at times, but that’s where your role and job comes in. Building that bond with customers, and making there’re day better."
good,"Most days are busy and you're always on the move, whether it be keeping the store clean, making drinks, taking orders or preparing the food. The people you work with are very important as you need a cooperative environment with good communication skills to succeed."
good,"j'ai beaucoup aimé car ce travail a été très enrichissant ."
good,"i enjoyed myself of working here. but it really need good physical condition while working on starbucks. as a barista, i think the sallary is quite a good enough."
good,"The experience you will have working at Starbucks will likely differ from store to store, but the one that I worked at had a manager who was extremely passive aggressive and if you don't fit in with the store's culture, you will be shunned (literally)."
good,Good to work for good hours just the pay needs to increase. I think that if they increased the pay overall the partners would be happier. Overall the benefits are good enough to keep a job.
good,"La empresa tiene buenos valores, el detalle es que te topas con mucha gente injusta, abusiva y poco preparada para liderear."
good,Under staffed but hardly any hours a lot of schedule issues small a lot of miscommunication constant schedule changes no breaks I worked in one within a Kroger not sure how real Starbucks are.
good,"Starbucks once was a place people desired to work and were proud of being from there.  My opinion is biased because I was laid off but the layoff process was poorly executed and more unpleasant than it should have been. While I was there senior management either didn't have a clear vision for the company or did not choose to cascade that view downward throughout the company. In its favor, the benefits are generous though the pay is not particularly competitive. The most important takeaway from working at Starbucks was the people I worked with who I found valuable and supportive."
good,"Starbucks doesn't emphasize coffee, but customer service. Their main goal is to make customers enjoy themselves so they come back, but this often feels at the expense of the employees. The people they hire are often personable and good to work with, but many shifts feel understaffed for the demand, or employees aren't motivated to work hard, so it feels like you're often behind. But this does vary store-to-store, manager-to-manager. The benefits and employee discount make it desirable as far as near-minimum wage jobs go."
good,"This job does require to communicate with all customers. It is important to be social. This job does tend to be challenging, depending on the area to work with, but have to deal with some 3rd place situations like homeless people or any  disturbed behavior."
good,high stress work environment but typically good teamwork between coworkers. opportunity for growth in the company is there but the pay does not increase as much as it should. near impossible to support oneself off of this job
good,"While working at starbucks I learned the management can make your break your job and the enjoyment of it. In my case I quit because if the really tight restrictionson breaks, and upper management being unreasonable when I did everything in my power to adhere to their rules."
good,"Love starbucks as a company, they offer great benefits and focus on their customer connections. They take care of their employees in many different ways that other business do not offer."
good,There’s a lot of work to be done all the time. The learning process is tough and it’s a make it or break it for some people. The stress and anxiety of this job can make it a bit difficult to work
good,"This is great if you’re just getting out there and starting fresh, it’s a smaller space so is drama from seeing the same people and being so close, the management was never good, I worked at a few stores and every one was a bit of a issue, the district leaders are currently changing management tactics so a lot of store managers are moving and leaving the company. It is very high stress so Please keep that in mind if you have troubles with stress already"
good,"Corporate does not support their partners the way they claim, but fellow baristas and shift supervisors are there to support you , face challenges, and meet goals"
good,"I enjoyed the job itself and many of the people I worked with. However, the management was very unprofessional and was hard to talk to about work matters"
good,"Working at Starbucks is a great starter job. However, unless you qualify for and find an open position in a supervisor/management role you work you will work with college age kids who are still developing their life skills and it can be frustrating for some. The majority of the job is on your feet, back and forth walking, and quite redundant as most food service can be. The hardest part of the job, personally, was maintaining a peppy attitude in a dramatic, petty environment."
good,"Work culture varies from each shop and a bad management team can easily break your experience. The perks were good but the pay is minimum wage. There is a chance for internal promotion, but the actual job itself can be very stressful too."
good,"I liked working at Starbucks however our management was bad and we were always understaffed. I worked at a Starbucks in Meijer before going to a different one and It was fun. The store was smaller and easier to manage, we only had 2 working at a time (3 on weekends). I got paid 11 an hour there, however, at the other Starbucks in franklin I only got paid 9. This Starbucks was always busy and our manager didn't hire enough people so we were always short."
good,"It's a nice place to work because it gave me flexible hours."
good,"It's alright, coworkers are nice but management is...well, management. There's always going to be problems they're not willing to listen to or address.  Coworkers are generally amazing though, and customers aren't as bad as you'd assume for the most part"
good,"So far, it's just okay. Salary and benefits are great. Shifts are often understaffed and the levels of stress are very palpable even for customers .Some of the stores I have trained in do not come close to acceptable cleanliness levels."
good,This is a okay job if you are in school and need quick money. They do work around your school schedule. Benefits are great. The people I work with is great.
good,"i think Starbucks is a good experience for students, to developed their skills, to make friends and pay their bills. if they are interested people can grow in the company"
good,"Starbucks gives their employees great benefits like health care, stock, sick time/paid vacation, and free drinks. However, you have to bust your butt every day. My location's manager started hiring incompetent people that I had to up slack for, so I had to do my job plus theirs. It is a team effort which is great if everyone pulls their weight. It is a stressful environment, and if you cannot handle the stress and be fast paced, then do not work here. Overall, working there was sufficient and I finally decided to leave because of poor management and it caused too much stress. However, if it is your only source of income aka you do not have another job or school to attend at the same time, it is not a bad job because if you are able to put 100% into the shift then go home and relax, it is easier to decompress from the craziness."
good,"Like a lot of jobs the people you work with are a big factor in determining whether or not you have a positive/negative work experience. In the beginning I enjoyed working at Starbucks, as much as you can expect to enjoy a job that is. Then slowly but surely the people that made waking up at 4 am and going to work bearable left one by one, only to be replaced with people who were all work, no play. I strongly believe that you can do a job well while still managing to interact with coworkers/customers. The new supervisors coming in were too worried about the numbers, I found that I was no longer able to talk to coworkers when the rush ended.. I was constantly expected to be doing something, even after running around for 3 hours straight making drinks or taking orders. I could no longer chat with regulars who I usually looked forward to talking to. People in general, management and customers alike need to realize that not everything needs to be done in 5 seconds. Can we please as an American society take notes from European countries and slow the f down so working at a place like Starbucks isn't miserable. The job itself could be great and I like Starbucks as a company overall. They offer benefits which is rare for a fast food like environment that pays a little over minimum wage. It's the bad management and entitled, impatient customers who ruin the job. With the right people it's a completely different experience than the one I explained. Overall I learned a lot and for that I am grateful."
good,"Many partners at Starbucks have to deal with rude customers about every other car. However, your crew will mostly laugh it off. When it comes to scheduling, sometimes we're very understaffed, or way too overstaffed. There was never a shift where I didn't laugh wholeheartedly with my partners or leaving feeling as if I accomplished nothing. The hardest part of the job is definitely learning all the drinks and mastering bar. The easiest part of the job would be working the front counter and handling transactions, as long as you pay attention to the order and type it in correctly."
good,"Although there are many great benefits that come with working for this business the people that work there aren’t that friendly, their kind of stuck up & judgmental. the manager was welcoming at first but what manager isn’t. overall"
good,"It's not the place it used to be. Pay is not competitive, culture is great, but has been a stagnant place for at least a year. It's just a job anymore, not something to aspire to."
good,My coworkers kind of sucked but the job isn't terrible but it also wasn't my favorite. They have short shifts and that is cool but if you work in  a drive thru the shifts are typically longer and people are mean before and sometimes after their coffee. I think the pay should be a little higher but they probably raised it since I worked there. It was 8.68 a hour.
good,They expect you to do the work for 3 people at once. I worked there a year and still couldn't go as fast as they wanted me to. Ever work the drive thru somewhere? isn't it the most annoying thing when someone gets on the headset and starts taking an order that's not theirs to take??! Imagine that all dang day. Too many try hards.
good,Wont work here again due to being underpaid for the amount you have to deal with on a daily basis. Constantly have something to do with little to no down time. Managers are alright except anyone can do the job and they often have the wrong person in charge.
good,They expected us to know how to craft all the drinks within 2 days and wouldn’t let me take any notes on the process to making each drink. Management would yell at you over taking too long or not knowing how to do stuff. My trainer was terrible and was constantly telling me “this is what you’re supposed to do but this is what I do”. Overall hated working there. However I go there as a customer constantly and it is amazing. The staff are really nice and have even memorized my order.
good,Work here for 3 years and I loved it. From when I started to when I finished it was amazing. I met and worked with  lot of amazing people. I started at a new york starbucks and transferred to one in florida
good,"A good part time Job,but a very stressful full time job. "
good,"Starbucks was a stressful, yet fun environment. My experience with my manager was a bit bothersome, but the staff was awesome. The workload itself is not too difficult, with the most bothersome part being difficult customers."
good,"I worked at Starbucks for a few months and I felt that the atmosphere was friendly, there was a lot of communication between the staff and customer.However, it is fast-paced and stressful as i had to handle a lot of orders while trying to remember the recipes. I feel that I was underpaid considering the hours I worked and the work load."
good,"You will make lots of friends here, and overall enjoy those you work with.  Starbucks for sure has a culture of bringing in the right people.  However, they DO NOT pay what you should make.  The amount of work you will do, for such a low wage is laughable.  However, many people stay there for the college, and overall good experience with coworkers.  It is really fun to be with a good group of people. "
good,"En general buena experiencia, aprendes mucho, hay seguimiento a  tu crecimiento, las prestaciones son buenas, hay desarrollo y oportunidad de crecimiento,"
good,Great experience working at starbucks. Met great people. Miss my favorite customers. Miss my staff. Miss leading them. Good company to work for. Good opportunity
good,The people I got to work with at Starbucks were some of the best I have ever met. The work environment was open and friendly at all times. There were growth opportunities yet Starbucks does not honor outside experience as they honor internal.
good,"Starbucks is a good first Job for someone who is barely starting to get experience, To get customer service experience. It can be very nerve wracking by always having to be positive to customers. But it’s all  about getting used too."
good,"if you like fast paced environment and lots of shifts then this is the place for you, Starbucks is a very fast paced environment with lots of interaction with customers and coffee!"
good,Fun to work there but costumers treat you like garbage and you aren't paid enough. As a shift manager I wasn't given enough power to do anything to help my employees and the higher ups never listen.
good,"It can be rewarding, but it is stressful and hard to maintain work-life balance as a store manager. District Managers are a key role in making your life better and inspiring you. Without that, it can be very difficult. The grind is real at this company."
good,"The job was a great learning experience, and a great stepping stone for those who need more customer service skills. Starbucks offers scholarships for students who would like to continue their education."
good,"As a barista, you will enjoy the environment as you meet different people every single day and you actually make friends with them along the way. The nature of making coffee, too is an amazing experience."
good,"I learned a lot about what it meant to be a team player and a valued employee. IN order to thrive at Starbucks, you need to give it you all; however, this means you can get taken advantage of sometimes, which made a healthy work life balance hard for me to manage"
good,"Somewhere you may want to work starting off your working career, as a teenager . Decent environment and customers . Fast paced and need to be able to learn quickly ,"
good,"It started off as a very fun but STRESSFUL job  and it stayed stressful... the management was a mess when I first started working there and got a bit better then right at the end before I left we got a terrible supervisor, but of course it’s different for everyone. Still I wouldn’t suggest starbucks if you get anxiety/ if you can’t multitask/ if you don’t like getting Yelled at by ppl.. lol you need thick skin"
good,"J'ai beaucoup appris au sein de la franchise Starbucks dans laquelle j'ai travaillé, esprit d'équipe et enthousiasme étaient présents. "
good,"Minimum wage job with minimum wage work. You only need to work 20 hours a week to get benefits though. They offer tuition, company stock, free coffee beans and free drinks and food on shifts."
good,"I got promoted to shift manager and it’s not what I thought, too many responsibilities and underpaid for all that work. I would have been better off staying a barista but being a shift manager looks good on a resume. It’s a good transitional job and you gain skills in management. I have stuck it out for a year and let’s see how long I last since I’m unhappy. I don’t like how Starbucks pushes the idea of being a store manager onto people, most of us don’t want to make this a career."
good,It's a nice little kiosk. Girls who work there are nice. Customers are usually sweet. Management could use a little work. Training wasn't very good. I Don't have a schedule I like.
good,"Very stressful. Rude customers. Hopefully you have a good manager/ District manager. But in large, its worth slaving away if they are paying for your tuition."
good,besides my personal issues with management it is a wonderful job. all like minded coworkers and delightful regulars that kept the job exciting. the do also have wonderful benifits.
good,"i had drunk kids to deal with daily i had kids that didn't like their job and i was the guy picking up the slack for everyone , the other managers would purposely overlook things that needed to be done because they knew i needed my job the most enjoyable part of the job was creating different coffee blends to try"
good,"It was always fast paced and usually always busy, there is a good atmosphere as its mainly students and young people that work there who are all quite similar. Mostly good customer base and management was okay but it was stressful and had a poor work life balance."
good,Learned how to make some drinks and to learn people name and drinks and how to keep a conversation with them with out having trouble and try new skills
good,It truly depends on your Starbucks location and management. My first location was smaller + had better management. My second had the worst management - condescending and not accommodating even when it came to finals week for school. You do a lot for barely above minimum wage. The only plus side was free drinks during/after your shift. Many baristas get burnt out or will eventually. This is suitable for high schoolers or college students with not so hectic of a schedule.
good,"I really only worked there for a few months until I was able to find another job. It had its perks for sure- getting to make new drinks, learning about coffee and its origins, but it also got very mundane very quickly. Every so often you'd  get an off the wall order but most of the time you were just making frappuchinos for 4 hours straight. Overall it was fine for part time temporary work but thats about it."
good,"Poste très polyvalent, culture d'entreprise atypique"
good,This company helped me build and sharpen amazing work ethics and skills. It’s a very stressful and overwhelming company to work for that CERTAINLY  underpays their employees. With the right state of mind and will to learn this job will be fun only because of your team. The rules are very hard to follow since it caters so much to the customer always being right.
good,"Opportunities for advancement are abundant if you know the right people. If you are in ""the club"" things may be great. If not, you will likely be stuck in a cycle of ""development opportunities"" in lateral roles with virtually no increase in compensation while you wait for your preferred job opportunity. Managers are very ""relationship-driven"" and ability to be successful in the job is not as big of a factor as they make it seem. Social branding seems to be more important than the quality of work."
good,"Starbucks used to be a great company that was truly driven by their mission statement. It is nothing more now, than a blanket cover for making more money off the false relationships of baristas and customers. The company is riddled with lack of proper management and little to no care for the condition of the baristas. Their cookie cutter polices are not tailored to each store and fail to make customer service efficient and and of high quality. The company is so micromanaged you can not solve problems that arise in a logical manner and you are punished for the outcome even while following the policy to the letter. "
good,Not paid enough for the amount of stress that is put on partners. Shifts are often chaotic and disorganized with a lack of accountability. Often feels like partners are not valued.
good,"I enjoyed the work and customer service aspect, but my overall experience was not terrific. The management was biased and I fell through the cracks and was not given the equal opportunities that my coworkers had to progress in the company."
good,When it was busy it was very fast paced. I enjoyed my job but the job did not provide enough of an income to support my family. They did try very hard to accommodate the school schedules of their college student employees.
good,Starbucks was my first job and I while I was there it had its ups and downs. Towards the end of my career their it was definitely continuing downward.
good,A typical day at work flies by as a result of the constant string of customers. If it's a slow day there's never something that doesn't need to be cleaned or restocked. The hardest part of the job is finding the most effective routine that one can follow everyday to assure things go smoothly. The most enjoyable part of the day is making a customers day with their favorite drink.
good,I did not enjoy starbucks after a month. The pay was alright but not enough to afford for living. A lot of people such as employees came and go like got hired... Then quit. Most people didn't seem to enjoy working there. It's not the Managers fault because he was trying to keep everything together. The assistant manager wasn't doing their job.
good,"A typical day at Starbucks consists of either starting at 5:30 am for opening  or starting around 1:30/2 for a closing shift. Middle shifts usually start around 8-10 am. Management is great for the most, supervisors are great and help baristas with everything. I've heard many great things about the different managers too."
good,"When I started my manager was amazing, so much so he got an opportunity to move up. This left a void to fill, luckily we were self-managing along side our shifts. unfortunately we then got a terrible manager that was hardly ever at work, she was soon let go"
good,It was a means to an end. The environment was what you'd expect from a food industry position. There were flexible hours if needed with advanced notice.
good,"very flexible and all the coffee you can handle.  "
good,Unfair pay makes working not worth the trouble. You are subject to raises on your managers discretion who often look to make the store profits look better than what makes the environment healthy.
good,"Starbucks gives your routine and helps you develop the notions of getting things done fast, including things like learning, couching, leading, and sales. The production of a great team is via the selection process of each manger."
good,"There's alot to say about Starbucks. The wage is alright for the amount of work involved, and there are alot of benefits to take advantage of. However, there is almost 0% chance of moving up in the company if you live in a smaller area, with already dedicated Managers. The customer base can be downright rude and entitled"
good,Ever spoken to someone who's usually quite friendly but happened to be in a bad mood because they haven't had their coffee yet? That is the description of every Starbucks customer. Completely relatable but where there's 40 of them staring at you it really takes a toll.
good,"If you work only as a barista Starbucks is an amazing place to work, the job will become second nature and the team aspect is so fun. However, if you have a bad leader (which I have had a few) it becomes a different place entirely."
good,This was my first job and I will never go back. You were treated poorly on a daily basis by customers. Management was all over the place and is switched out constantly.
good,"Working at Starbucks was a lot of customer service and good memory. I learned how to keep the customer happy and how to make their visit better every time. Memorizing drinks is the hardest part aside from sequencing but as soon as you figure out how to sequence properly everything falls into place. Ideal job for a student due to early hours and laid back breaks, perfect place to work on homework."
good,"Several things happened that I wasn't happy about. Situations should have been handled better, and too many managers were hooking up with the other employees. It was still an ok place to work."
good,After a new manager join the teams things changed which caused me to leave the company and look for a better opportunity which can provide a better outlook on customer service and care.
good,"Really strict usually when it comes to dress codes. Managers are always on track, Easy to train new employees. Fun to work but lack of benefits. I wish they had more to offer"
good,"the store manager was the worst person I ever work with, the regional manager was amazing, the day by day is not heavy, the personal change a lot, I enjoy it but the store manager was a headache on 52 st store"
good,"Good company. Is a good job for students, mothers, and those looking for steady work.Good people and good management. Would recommend to friends and family."
good,"feel like a robot, fake culture, training is far too short for an external store manager hire. there were no less than 37 manuals to learn. mostly good hires though"
good,"I worked for the large Starbucks in Down Town Disney. I learned everything from running the register to  warming food. The one thing they did not tell us how little social life we would have and they also didn't really tell us that we would have a somewhat stable schedule. I understand that hours are based on our availability, but I would think it would be somewhat consistent."
good,"Worked at Starbucks for 3 years and saw a lot of people come and go. Lots of learning in the moment and repetition. Great place for benefits, discounts, and ASU online degree program."
good,"Overall not a bad place to work. Good for someone just starting out and could be a good company to advance in if you have the proper drive for it. A lot of good people tend to work for starbucks so you can make some good friends there too, but beware the company does have a rather high turn around rate."
good,"Fast-paced, fun and well-rounded job for an entry level; Lots of flexible skills to be earned; The downside is job also comes with a lot of expectations with little pay for the partners."
good,"Very welcoming place to work. Depending on your store manager, it can be a place of structure and fun to work or it can be a stressful mess. Some areas the customers are terrible, like at Montique. The Older crowd aren't as friendly along with some random angry business people. And being understaffed, it's just a part of the culture at this point. Very, very stressful. When I used to work there, I felt like Starbucks started to lose its old culture. Yes they are forever changing but it only puts more stress on the workers and it just becomes a lot. You get paid great hourly but the thing is, you won't get the hours. My paychecks used to be very unstable for a full-time person. They seems to always talk about cutting back hours. If you're a student, great hrs but full-time? Don't waste your time"
good,"Starbucks can be an incredible place to work but ONLY with the right manager and staff. When I began my manager was amazing and I loved my job. When that manager moved up in the company and was replaced the two following managers were terrible and I hated my job vehemently. Make sure that you respect and feel comfortable with your manager and believe they will respect and protect you, or else your experience will be terrible."
good,"I  had several managers who did not treat me as a manager should, were highly unprofessional and downright mean at points.When I was hired I was told I would get at least 30 hours a week, and then struggled to get 20, which made it impossible for me to pay my bills.The stress of working there was not worth the wage they paid."
good,"Not Paid amazingly But Definitely A Good first job. Can be overtly fast paced in the morning, many of those that work there will be there forever. Free college through ASU."
good,"It’s a fast paced work environment. The money is ok if you get the hours. The benefits are really good and can come in very handy, especially for school."
good,Store always gives updates every month so you must study ALWAYS in order to be knowledgeable and ready for unexpected events but there is a good chance for salary increase for every year depends on the performances in the whole year.
good,"It was extremely stressful in my opinion and overall not the job I was looking for. I got along with my coworkers, but not the managers. The job wasn’t what I was told it was going to be."
good,"I worked for Starbucks during my college years and enjoyed the community feels while working there. However, as Starbucks began to grow into a fast food place instead of a coffee shop. Seattle pressures store managers extremely hard. Leading to a negative work environment because this pressure is then placed on shift supervisors and baristas."
good,"Great benefits and flexibility, but simply not enough compensation for the amount of knowledge, hard work and stress that comes with working there. My manager and co workers were great, but Starbucks is a very wasteful company and I would feel much better working for a local company."
good,"Starbucks can be a great company to work for. they give free spotify, pretty flexible with schedules, insurance discounts(after 3 months). One of the hard things working here is the treatment from customers and upper management who only care about no complaints and the bottom line. employees are not paid a fair wage for the work they do and the treatment they are expected to uphold."
good,"•	Supervise a crew of 15+, maintain a well-run store."
good,"My biggest complaint about Starbucks is feeling like the company is more concerned about PR and public perception than my safety and wellness. In my 9 years with the company, I have worked in multiple locations in three different states on both coasts, but have really struggled in my current location in San Francisco, CA. Many corporate policies I do not believe adequately take into account the impact they will have on my well being or my ability to serve my customers."
good,I worked here throughout college. My manager was very willing to help work around my school schedule even when changing schedules every semester. If you are looking for a good school job Starbucks will be a good fit for you.
good,"It's a lot of challenges to start with because of all the details, but it's not a hard job in general. "
good,Been a manager for over 2 years and the company taught me a lot of things that I could transfer to my future jobs. It does not pay great however it is very rewarding as most of the times customers are great. Would recommend!
good,"While there are certain common characteristics, the barista life is highly impacted by the store they work at: cafe and/or drive through, how busy the store gets, quality of management and shift supervisors, etc."
good,typical day was cleaning for the first half then helping out where i could when i could with making coffee or stocking fridges. Last half of the day was taking orders and making coffee
good,"I learnt a lot here and developed myself. However, I feel it was very money-focused with pressure on management who were really negative to staff. They wanted us to do many things to help the company but never gave us any incentives, it was quite negative if it had not been for the customers and the people I worked with. I also had a bad experience with management in which I had a skill needed work on which after a month I was told by supervisors that I had improved greatly however other management refused to see this despite some hardly supervising me. I would advise if you do work here don't spend long, it's good but not if you want to work somewhere for long."
good,The job is a great starting position. It is great for high school and college students. It is possible to make it a career. They provide benefits and retirement.
good,"I have worked at four different Starbucks locations. My first and second store, the manager was amazing and the team dynamic was always positive. At the third location, the store was a mess. My manager was fired within a month and they hired an unqualified replacement. I loved my co-workers and enjoyed work, but it was not managed well. My forth store, the manager only allows herself to have time off and doesn't understand that others also deserve a work life balance."
good,Starbucks is a fun place to work when you get the hours you were promised but do not count on those hours. Training for new employees is rather intense and you are expected to know all of the drinks by the end of the two week training period.
good,"Starbucks provides training for every new baristas. They would learn about the basic history of coffee and the company, modern coffee culture and how to make drinks that are in the menu. However, I would not recommend to anyone who wants to develop a career in the coffee industry."
good,"Like any other place, the customers are always hit or miss but the job wasn't terrible. Would work there again. Good employee discounts and the workload is easy to be really good at"
good,"I've worked at several different locations.  Your mileage varies based on your team and how you fit into it.  I've worked at tight knit locations with a good manager, and these made me think I'd be with the company for life.  I've worked for terrible managers with distrusting and distant employees.  That is why my resume is on indeed."
good,"I love being a barista. I enjoy the customer interaction. I enjoy ensuring that my beverages are above standard. I take pride in my work and how hard I work. But with the constant stress of the company wanting us to have 35-40 second drive-times while trying to make a customer connection, and while making every drink to standard puts a lot of pressure on the baristas and managers. I work at a drive through and cafe store which can be stressful."
good,"i've learned a lot about customer service and making the moment right. "
good,this was years ago but it was cool . learned how to have patience and how to exceed a customers expectations . made sure my customers got  exactly what they wanted. memorized our regulars drinks and had them ready for them at cashier before they even paid for it.
good,Buen ambiente laboral día a día a excepción de los puntos peak donde todo se volvía tenso.
good,fun workplace and safe environment to work at. My manager is amazing and connects with every employee and many customers. it is a fast environment to work in but rewarding.
good,"The corporation has lofty ideals in employee treatment and expectation customer service, quality products and service. Often, stores are too understaffed to meet the standards. "
good,The pay isn’t worth the stress and effort long term but overall it’s a simple job. It’s paycheck to paycheck living if you’re trying to pay bills but it’s a great job to pass the time and it’s a fantastic first job. Part time employees get full time benefits. Management could definitely be better though.
good,"Honestly, I feel like if you apply to work at Starbucks, you have a little bit of an idea of what to expect, but I'm not sure if anyone is ever fully prepared for the realities of this job."
good,"While it was a good to get in to food and coffee, it was not something I would want to make a career out of. With early mornings and a strong handed corporate attitude, it is hard to have any creativity in the workplace."
good,"My time at Starbucks I would say was a time that I learned a lot about cooperate business, and really enjoyed meeting new people. Starbucks was a social outsetting to meet and greet new people who all enjoy one thing that was some delicious fresh made coffee made to your likings."
good,"I really enjoyed this company for 14 years recently got type 1 diabetes and was on a final write up and got let go , this company provides great benefits and very flexible with school and busy students."
good,"In short, my experience at Starbucks was stressful and unproductive. The management did not handle the workload and they promoted too easily. A fun place to work at times, but when it came to being a serious business there would be numerous issues from the staff  preventing that."
good,"Starbucks is a good first job. I grew out of Starbucks pretty quickly, but overall Starbucks is a good first job. I did not like my manager at Starbucks, which I rare because I haven’t had much trouble liking managers since. She had a difficult management style and was a little prejudiced. I did not particularly like the working environment she cultivated. Morning and night crew generally did not like each other and there was always some kind of turmoil between the two. I would work at Starbucks again under a different manager. The one I had was just difficult."
good,"The job is great if you're a student, besides that I wouldn't recommend it. The customers are toxic at times, although regulars are the exact opposite of that and you'll have some really great interactions. Also, if you have a great crew, then it's all worth it. I've met some awesome people at my store."
good,"It was really tough to maintain a work/life balance because of the hours worked switching between morning and evening regularly. "
good,This job was quit a challenge but it taught me so much patience and commitment because off all the tasks I was given. My favorite part by far was getting the chance to learn the position of drive thru. I definitely would recommend this job for anyone that likes coffee and has an extremely flexible schedule.
good,"While it wasn't the worst place to work, the drama from coworkers and rude customers really made it an accomplishment to leave Starbucks. The insurance provided, however, was amazing. Health insurance was one of the biggest reasons I stayed as long as I did."
good,"You will burn out quick, management is awful, The partners are what make your job worth it. Benefits are awesome and also your regular customers are pretty cool!"
good,"So you would only find out your shifts for a week the Friday of the week before so it was difficult to make plans. When you get there you don't know what you will be doing that day. The hardest job was bussing - this required you to bring all the cups, plates trays and rubbish from the large seating area on your own and clean the tables as you go, you could often not get through the entire room in one go. you were also required to rinse and clean all the cups, plates and trays as well as take them all out to the bar and make sure that all they trays were dried before hand and ensure the condiment bar was stocked (which alone could take 30 min) and make sure the milk was changed and toilets were checked on a timer, and sort out the rubbish into various things that can be re-cyled or not and take the rubbish out. when you were in this role you were often the one customers would come to for spillages etc. Its too much for one person. Other roles include being on till and working with someone in that role, making drinks and heating food.  If you were on start or close you had to help set up for the day or clean after closing. Training was awful! The only I was actually formally trained to do was clean the toilets and the bussing routine. everything else was ""you'll pick it up as you go"". The only thing that I can say that was true for was till and finding out where everything was on the console. Management was so-so. The Manager was good and friendly. The assistant manager singled me out and often reprimanded me for very minor things and not understanding how some things work as"
good,"I so love Starbucks, I enjoy conversations and making coffee. I feel that recently, I am becoming less supported from my superior with labor and resources."
good,"Starbucks is a very fast paced environment, and requires a lot of multitasking, teamwork, patience, and a positive attitude.  The benefits are unmatched in this industry.  Health and life insurance, paid tuition at Arizona University Online, free Spotify premium, access to thousands of employee discounts, and free food and coffee are just a few. Unfortunately, restrictions on labor have caused a lot of long-time and loyal employees to seek employment elsewhere.  Pressure to out-perform previous sales while providing less labor often makes Starbucks employees feel as if they were set up to fail, overworked, and burnt out. I've reached out to my general and regional managers about my concerns, but I have yet to see any positive changes."
good,"Fast paced morning and late afternoons, usually slow at the end of the night. I learned more about customer service and how to better get along with my coworkers. Also furthering my knowledge in a corporate business. The manager was a little too childish at times. The hardest part of the job was dealing with coworkers who didn't want to be there so they wouldn't do their job efficiently. The most fun part was making new friends with my coworkers and being able to spend so much time with them."
good,Great place to meet like minded people but has poor training and upper management is very restrictive on stores regardless of whether they have worked in a store or not. Each time you think you have a new drink memorized they decide to come out with four completely new ones
good,they don't pay a living wage for the area I live in. Good benefits though. Work is stressful but it is fun to be on an energetic team. I might have stayed longer if I could afford it
good,I was an Assistant Store Manager that was over seeing a store due to the Manager leaving with out notice. I had to develop a few external management. I didn't think a had place to grow in the company. So I left.
good,This job is one of the better jobs for low income. You get benefits but you'll need some hours to pay for other things since it takes from your paycheck.
good,"Starbucks isn't for the faint of heart. It's fast paced and high volume, at least my location was. Great resume builder. Go in with a plan or you'll find yourself feeling stuck, which isn't healthy for you. Take advantage of all of the resources this company offers."
good,"I have worked at Starbucks for 3 years now, and they have been very helpful with my schedule for school and life. Definitely a good idea to set up an availability form otherwise your shifts will be all over the place. The benefits are good. Opportunity for raises every year are nothing to write home about, and it is sort of on you to remind your manager to give you a raise every once and a while."
good,Working at Starbucks was a fun time and enjoyed most of the people I worked with and under. There were some periods where work place politics would become very disruptive but in general management was eventually able to reach a corrective action each occurence.
good,"Mostly a fun atmosphere because of co workers attitudes. However, some scheduling issues would hurt the rest of the team if we were not fully staffed during peak hours. This caused a bit of stress to many working there at times."
good,met great partners yet management was weak lost a lot of great baristas a lot of favoritism so moving up is nearly impossible I was there for 3 years made it clear I wanted to go up since I was already running the floor instead they would hire outside management benefits are good but not worth all the slack your pick up from weak peers.
good,"I've learned many things at Starbucks including basic human connections, giving someone their ""third place"", customer connections and feelings, extremely great customer service and much more. It is a fast paced work place with tons of people all around you, so you have to be a people person. The management isn't the greatest but shes new to the position as well. The hardest part is being 100% every day and showing up to work with a positive attitude when things go wrong. I loved my regulars and connecting with different people throughout the day and I made amazing friendships from this job."
good,"Starbucks is amazing. The culture they’ve created is unmatched. But, customers have become savvy to what The Company will do for them and they’ve become greedy and aggressive. Partners have to deal with these customers every day and don’t get paid enough. The unrelenting standards for cleanliness can’t be met in a high volume store with the labor provided. Pair that with the  amount of people inside Starbucks who are not actually buying anything, and you have a very difficult situation to manage. Partners regularly callout for personal reasons or illness and there is little that can be done with the new sick time policy. If someone calls out, the manager is responsible for getting shift coverage or working. Prepare to work harder than you ever have before without enough people to do the work. Prepare to get phone calls on your days off, text messages in the middle of the night and to always be available. There is no work/life balance and no mention of that being important to managers. Prepare to be on the floor 75% of the time and be everything to everyone. Prepare to clean bathrooms, pick up trash outside and sweep the parking lot. Prepare to train 20+ employees 6-7 times a year on all of the different promotions, beverages and policy changes. Smile all day, every day and be responsible for the employees who don’t. Hire people who want to do all of the above for less than $10/hr."
good,Everyone loves a chill out spot with access to their favorite beverages and some internet! Starbucks is a great place to work for a first job as it was for me!
good,I'm not going to speak bad about Starbucks. It's generally a good company. The new CEO is taking the company in a different direction. The company is driven by stock price now.
good,"It was an abusive relationship with management. I was a supervisor. For $1 more an hour, I would be asked to do many extra tasks. Inventory, supervision, cash management and every little thing that hit us unexpectedly. Our manager received all the praise when he or she wouldn’t do much. Glad I’m gone!!!"
good,"Good place to work, sometimes the personnel can be extra and trying to find someone to cover your shift can be difficult. Management is also hit or miss demanding in the state/ region/ area ."
good,The manager played favorites. A few of her good friends worked in store. She would give them more hours even though they weren’t great workers. She also would under staff in a busy drive thru store. It was not a fun experience.
good,"Although it could get stressful, it was a convenient job and was not hard. I enjoyed the friendliness of all my coworkers and we always worked as a team."
good,I loved working there but I need higher pay  the manager is very nice all the barista get along flexible hours but it’s a low pay for a high school student living on their own
good,The culture brought by this company is outstanding. It helps a person to reach its self goals that will also benefit the company's growth. This is a way to holding both sides accountable for results.
good,I worked for Starbucks for a year I liked the fast paced aspect of the job. The hours were consistent and I had a flexible schedule. The management was great had no complaints!
good,work is stressful. management could crack down harder. partners call out constantly. don't get paid enough for the work you do. great advancement opporunities
good,Starbuck baristas have a fast paced non stop physically demanding job.. making drinks and helping customers who are in a rush so make sure you are fast and accurate... fellow partners and even customers are so nice but it does get hairy . I am thankful I stuck with it cause it was difficult at first. My manager was fair and nice..tips are low and the hourly is low but if you take advantage of college tuition reimbursement for their specified online university than its worth it. Great training in most stores
good,"Had a wonderful time working in a fast paced environment with GREAT clientele. At the time,was under terrible management which destroyed my experience"
good,"I had trouble getting more than 15-16 hours a week on average, even when I was one more of the more experienced employees at the store by the time I left."
good,i loved it! great place to work and meet new life long friends.  hardest part was getting used to waking up for ealry morning shifts but it was a great reward seeing a smile on my customers faces when I hadd there drinks ready
good,this position and company was ok. they could benefit from trying managers on how to coach their employees rather than just termination. although some employees deserve to be written out. i believe understanding between levels in the operations needs to happen.
good,"A pesar de tener horarios flexibles, la paga es excesivamente baja."
good,"Cuando recién comenze a laboral en la empresa esta solía preocuparse más por lo trabajos tenían un sentido de humanidad más marcado, ahora se preocupan más. Por cuidar sus números y se le da mucho el. Preferistismo al. Cliente aunque esté llegue a humillar al empleado."
good,Balancing multiple priorities with minimal time. Introducing  new business platforms while still implementing others. Leadership not always aligned on assigned work.
good,"Depending on which location you work at, Starbucks can be a hectic place to work at. I found this to be because of the high volume of customers and work duties that continuously increased."
good,"A day at Starbucks can be hectic and a little crazy. Your attitude and your coworkers are what get you through the day."
good,"Starbucks is a good company to work for if you are fresh in or out of high school or college. You learn many basics about crafting drinks, providing great customer service as well as develop teamwork with your team. However, Starbucks can be detrimental to your energy if you have a Manager who does not care, teammates who care for themselves and an overall team dynamic that is not close or together. Overall, I have enjoyed my time here and have learned much about myself and business."
good,"The company is great, the mission,and the motives are all things I believe in, yet somehow in a majority of stores those basic things are lost. Not a lot of Compassion for employees who fall on rough times or people in general. The hardest part is being forced to kick out homeless people even when they make a purchase. Which was ultimately why I left the company. It just did not sit well with me"
good,"It's a very fast paced, stressful job. If you're coming in with no previous barista experience you have a lot to learn in a short period of time. Also, Starbucks is big on customer connecting so the more outgoing, bubbly you are the better you'll fit in."
good,"On a typical day at work, you walk in to Starbucks and you get greeted with a smile and a hello. My favorite part of this job is helping people out pick what they want to drink if they've never been here before. Lots of things I learned from working at Starbucks is how to work in an orderly fashion, to be fast yet still elegant in coffee making, and how to deal with some of the rudest people out there. The management at Starbucks is not very good, while at my store we had someone who was an amazing store manager, the people above her aren't the best people. These people focus on making money, and making money only. They don't care about the Barista's or the customers and how they are doing. The hardest part of my job was learning the product, but the easiest part of the job is selling it to others."
good,Youll barely learn anything from the training (just the basics). You get thrown into the fire but you get help. It takes awhile to be an okay Barista.
good,"a typical day at starbucks is customers running and screaming at you and having to go extremly  fast paced and get your butt yelled at all day long "
good,It is a fun place to work but unfortunately the company is more worried about making money than it does it employees. Also in my 3 years there I have had 7 managers.
good,The hours can be grueling. Need a strong leadership team to pull through.Best part is working with the other employees. The worst part is the inconsistent schedule.
good,"This job was very stressful in the sense that it was very fast paced and demanded accuracy. As long as one is knowledgable about the recipes for the many different drinks offered, it was a good job."
good,"Starbucks was fast-paced. Co workers were great, but management needed improvement. Schedule was inconsistent. Manager did not know how to properly delegate."
good,"Overall, it was an okay place to work but I couldn’t stand how controlled and structured everything was. One example- I was working drive thru and was waiting on one drink. The line was super long and the barista was making another beverage while the one I needed was just sitting there next to her. I took 2 steps over and grabbed it, gave it to the customer and wished them a good day. No big deal right? Apparently not. I got coached on “overstepping my bounds” and staying in my assigned position. In all my other jobs, being proactive, looking around for things that need to be done, helping your coworkers, and making the experience quicker and better for the customer are all encouraged habits. That was not the case for me at Starbucks."
good,"Most of management was fair and agreeable to work with. One manager was not the most pleasant to work with. Most of coworkers were friendly. It was a good job, but my experience at a previous employer convinced me I would be happier to go back there."
good,"Working at Starbucks for a few years now, I have progressed from barista to management. The Starbucks culture has changed dramatically over my time with the company - not all necessarily good. That being said it's great wages for baristas & SSVs, and very welcoming to anyone who applies for a job there."
good,"They people I work with are the best part of the job they make the time go by. We have some regulars that make our day amazing, we try to make the Starbucks like their second home."
good,"Working for Starbucks for as long as I have 6yrs as an LGBT advocate has been quite amazing.However, upper management hires not within company..Big FAIL!"
good,"Working at Starbucks, I’ve learned great customer service in such a fast paced environment. I enjoy my coworkers, but struggle with my management because I want more hours and more opportunities for advancement."
good,"Los dias eran agradables, rotativos, pero muy estresantes cuando se llenaba el local, tenías que estar pendiente en todo momento de todas las tareas que se realizaban, lo que más me gustó fue que se aprendía mucho y que generalmente la gente con que trabajas son agradables."
good,Fun but very stressful lost of pressure from corporate for certain numbers. I don't believe you can make quality coffee in the time limit they want it is not set up well.
good,"Starbucks was a great place to get my feet wet in the working world. I was able to learn a good amount of skills that i have taken with me as i have moved forward. Customer service, work ethic, and dealing with management are just a couple examples."
good,"A typical day at the location I worked for would be walking into undone cleaning tasks and chaos regarding shifts. Management was not up to a business level, many employees were not professional in language and behavior. I learned patience and self control when dealing with customers. The hardest part of the job for me was finishing things in time to close while still being active on the floor."
good,"When working at Starbucks I would never find anyone who was willing to stay at our store.  The Hours were beneficial and the journey to work was never an issue for me. My issues with Starbucks was, I was never made to feel like one of the team, being there for 6 months no matter how many times I would push the need for personal training, time was never found to properly train me. While the new staff were already being hired and trained further past the level I was at. I felt forgotten by my higher members of staff. This was most likely not helped through the fact that during my time there, I saw a constant shift in higher staff, with a constant rotation of shift managers coming and leaving. With the store manager changing on 3 occasions during my time there. A sense of security and belonging was something I never found."
good,"Teaches and gives you the opportunity to develop a lot of good skills, including teamwork and customer service. In terms of coffee, the automation process deprives you of much of the learning that would be necessary at more hands-on coffee shops, but with practice and effort, ex starbucks partners can amke great overall employees."
good,"I learned how to perform well in high-stress situations. I was not a fan of the management at my location and that is my reason for leaving. Work days were hit or miss, sometimes we were up to our eyeballs in drink orders and other days we had nothing to do but clean."
good,Starbucks is a great place to work to strengthen your customer service skills and learn to provide great service. They have high standards that they hold everyone to for the most part.
good,I was in the second busiest store in a huge metroplex. Wasn't able to connect with customers. Worked long hours for little pay. Would have preferred a cafe instead of a cafe/drive-thru store.
good,"The job itself is very good when you look at all the benefits but it honestly depends on the store you are in, your partners, your store manager, and supervisors. Every store is going to have a different working environment based on the different personalities put together and different management styles. It is a friendly environment to connect with customers most of the time though."
good,"It's a good start up job, but it's definitely not a job I'd see myself having for long term. As a barista there will be a lot to do besides just preparing and serving drinks. Customers are very much ""customers"" it really is a team oriented job though. You have to get along with and rely on other baristas and managers to do well here. "
good,"It is unlikely you will rise up the coorporate ladder, but benefits are nice. Your partners become good friends, and management is either hit or miss."
good,"When it comes to benefit and incentive, sb is one of the good payer. And for the environment depende on the partners, manager. Some where the worst. For the management, they conflict everything for the updates."
good,Starbucks is a great company.  Unfortunately I was stuck with a poor manager who tainted my experience.  The benefits are great if you can stick with it for a few months.
good,"Working at starbucks was a good experience. It showed me good work ethic and allowed me to see what it takes to get a job you want. I had to keep calling and walking in to see  a manager in order to get  the job. They had great benefits and while it was stressful, I enjoyed working there for 3 years. it was a tough environment due to the stress corporate starbucks put on employees to take care of customers in ways that seemed impossible in certain circumstances. Overall it was a good job to start with and learn from."
good,"very fast paced environment at times. staff are great to work with! does require you to give up a lot of personal time: to cover shifts when people are ill, holiday work, first come when it comes to booking time off"
good,Management was not solid and made it difficult to enjoy the job. I enjoyed serving people and doing my best and i won partner of the quarter but management was still ridiculous.
good,"The management wasn't the best. Each time there was an issue, the managers did nothing to help/change the situation. I felt like I couldn't grow as a shift supervisor there."
good,"As a person who wants to genuinely help companies grow, I found it very frustrating to work for Starbucks sometimes. Very rarely does upper management care to listen to new ideas or strategies. It's rare for people to get properly disciplined (ie, written or verbal documentation) which creates an environment that is fun, but also an unprofessional one."
good,It was a seasonal job and when the season ended I was let go. All in all it was a good job but not nearly enough pay for me to do anything other than pay my car insurance. Otherwise the employees were friendly.
good,I don't think the job itself is bad but if you have a bad team or even an okay team this job will become dreadful. It can get busy and overwhelming quickly. Starbucks is a 1 level entry job with no experience required. I would recommend to those that want to learn how to work.
good,"starbucks was fun because some of the employees were pretty cool but the work is slow even with the fact that i worked at a pretty ""busy store"" just too slow for me and kind of boring at times."
good,probably one of the busiest locations in the state of Indiana. Rude customers. Was verbally assaulted several times.Was assigned to the same role evryday without being rotated between roles like the rest of my co workers.
good,"the job gets stressful at times but youcan manage getting the hand of it after a bit of time. you get to know a lot of people and their tastes, its fun more than half the time and everyone is great to get along with."
good,"When I began my time at Starbucks, the company was in a much better position than when I left it. Management at the time was efficient, employees knew their expectations, and all employees worked as a team. Nearing the end of my experience, we had a major issue of theft committed by a staff member. This major member of our team was immediately let go, and has not been properly replaced since. Working at this location, many baristas took it upon themselves to run the store and no proper, knowledgable management was ever put into action. Wait times were extreme, often passing the twenty minute mark in drive thru. Cleanliness was neglected, and there was no sense of a team - as everyone felt they were in charge, resulting on a lot of stepped  on toes. Understandably, costumers became extremely frustrated and greatly mistreated staff. Staff motivation has gone down, and the presentability of staff had been neglected by the company. It seems as if no one seems to care who is working, as long as someone is behind the counter. Management needs a complete reform and employees need to regain a passion for the company."
good,Customer's at Starbucks have no patience or chill.  It can make it very difficult to work for minimum wage. The easiest and most enjoyable activity is talking to drive-thru customers.
good,Overall a decent place to work.  The pay is kind of lacking but there are great benefits and perks to working with Starbucks.  Tuition assistance through ASU for example.
good,"The job has nice benefits like 401k and stock options. The job itself, I was not a fan of. The co-workers were very nice and chill but the management was not very good."
good,"Starbucks is a great job for the environment itself and the quality of the product. The job culture is unique and overall positive. The biggest downside is understaffed stores, overworked managers, and poor starting wages for what the job entails. Baristas have to learn and retain beverage recipes well and quickly. This job should not pay 9 dollars starting wage when it is mentally and physically demanding."
good,"My job was mostly crafting coffees, maintaining the cleanliness of the store but there were other benefits to working there. One of my unique (and more fun) roles in the store was store advertising and decorating the walls with temporary art and event headlines. Starbucks have also made the change to being more eco-friendly, offering coffee grounds as compost for locals, making a recycling program for the very popular Nespresso pods and reducing plastic overall. The staff were lovely, even when there would be disagreements, we would never leave the store without resolving any issues. The hardest part of the job was leaving it honestly, after two years of working there I had made many loyal friends and my Manager had been wonderful."
good,I have worked for the company for three years now and it is a great part time job with excellent benefits. It also is flexible when it comes to scheduling and vacation time.
good,"The environment is always busy, the people working there are always great, but issues always fall from management, specifically the district manager. "
good,It read great place to work.  Salary didn't meet my requirements. But awesome follow team members. Great management team where very professional and reasonable.
good,"The job is pretty busy but generally alright. My only complaint is they change things a lot - be it store layout, routines, food, or job expectations."
good,There were lots of pros and cons. It took a year to get insurance and another year and a half to get dental. we could make bonuses if we met standards. the crew ended up with was great but it took two years to get there. Our manager was never around so that made things difficult at times. I will try a regular Starbucks because they offer more. We often lost people to Stand alone Starbucks.
good,"I did not like my manager, she did a poor job taking care of the crew. But i do love working for starbucks as a whole. I enjoyed the face pace setting."
good,"Fun work environment if your 25-30 years old."
good,"I haven't been with the company for 3 yrs now. However, when I was there I was great at first. I loved my co workers, customers and manger. I'm not sure when tension started but it did come from upper management and trickled down. There was lots of opportunity to move up in the company. I went from barista, to trainer, then finally shift supervisor in 3yrs. I loved to ability to advance but it did come with what I felt was unnecessary stresses."
good,"For the most part working at Starbucks is a positive experience, keeping in mind we are all human discrepancies are bound to occur. Being a barista at Starbucks Is more than just crafting drinks you're part of a team. My experience is that some people just are not team players, which causes your job to be more stressful than it should be. I feel you should pick your store to work at carefully, and maybe go there a few times before to see how you're treated as a customer, That should be a good gauge of how you'll be treated as a partner."
good,"The best thing about Starbucks is, there is always something to do. A drink to be made, product to create, dishes to be washed. if you want a job with lots to learn and master this is a great place. Coworkers and management can really make or break this job. I have many ""shift leaders"" that I love working with because the vibe of the store is relaxed and fun. Everyone is still doing there work diligently but the music is a bit more fun and there are a few jokes spread from time to time. However there are some shift leads where the whole shift feels tense, at least in comparison. "
good,"I worked inside a Vons, so the experience is much different from a normal store. I had to make sure the kiosk was clean at all times. I had to legendary customer service, and work alone. The most enjoyable part was the people. Meeting new people from different places, was cool. Working alone was a double edge sword. Sometimes it was great and other times, you need help. If there a line you have to work quickly and efficiently as possible. You had to work under pressure, when things got busy."
good,"I love my customers and besides needing to provide for my children, my customers are the only reason I show up for work everyday. My manager has been hiring awful people lately and despite my best efforts to train them, they are horrible. They disrespect me when I am running the store and show no remorse for their wretched behavior. I am so tired of pouring myself into a job that doesn't appreciate me. My customers love me and come to my store just to see me."
good,Starbucks offers good benefits and flexible hours - good for those in school or with second jobs. The pay is on the lower side as the company pads hourly pay with store discounts and other benefits.
good,"this company tries its best to take care of all of its partners. in every way that includes that flexible schedules, health care, and other benefits. over all not a bad company to work for."
good,"Very repetitive. Work was easy enough, not too bad. The customers are what makes the job difficult, and the fact that management can be a little too demanding on certain things."
good,"Days were always extended due to call outs and always being understaffed. Stress was always through the roof, my store was one of the smallest locations but brought in the most revenue in the area. I did create livelong friends and I learned alot about myself and my abilities but i felt taken advantage of. I didn't feel like my needs were being heard or taken seriously and so that is why I ended up moving on."
good,The supervisor was very rude and felt like he was a bit racist will never want to work on 2nd shift there again as long as he is supervisor at that facility. Other than the supervisor the job is very straight forward and very easy. Alot of overtime which is very good. I liked the overtime and the people besides second shift supervisor are very nice and easy to work with.
good,My Starbucks was in a grocery store so many of the benefits were not applicable which was unfortunate. Stressful during peak hours but good for learning how to manage stress and rushes.
good,"Starbucks is a good place to get you on your feet. Wonderful benefits, okay-pay, and the people there are absolutely fantastic to work with. Making connections with customers has never been easier and encouraged compared to other places. I have never had such a positive experience with coworkers and customers ever before. It really was like a second family."
good,Starbucks is a wonderful company to work at if you know what you are looking for. A good job if you plan on not promoting or building a career. High stress from both customers and co-workers alike. Mangement varies from store to store. I learned and adapted to deal with customers in a pleasant and helpful way.
good,"It's not a horrible place to work, its heavily dependent on your store and your store manager because either can end up ruining your enjoyment of the job. The manager is the one that can do that the most seeing as they are the ones who control the store, lack of responsibility and care can kill the integrity of the store so fast its staggering. I'd be mindful of that but know you can change stores if need be, that's the nice thing about starbucks."
good,"A typical day at work often means having customers laughing with you, then switching to the next person who ends up screaming at you because you did something minutely off the norm. The coworkers can make or break this job for sure."
good,Overall I would not recommend this job unless you are looking to be overworked and underpaid. Management is disorganized and lacks time management and communication. Almost no opportunity to advance in the company at this location.
good,"You are asked to do daily routines but not get recognized for it, even when you perform better than other workers. Everyone is treated equally so there isn't much respect within workers."
good,Starbucks was a very exciting and fast-pace job. You meet a lot of people and every day is different. You earn tips every week. They work around your schedule. Hours are never guaranteed.
good,"It’s a stressful yet robust environment. If there is anything I’d say a little poor is the management. If you ARE looking for a part time job, however, this is your place."
good,Don't work here if you have mental health problems or a hard time dealing with a tremendous amount of stress. The customers are awful and the managers expect too much. Only here because of tuition reimbursement.
good,"If you're a young person in college (or training for a job) or if you're later in life and you want to fill your free time with easy, yet rapid, work then Starbucks is the place for you."
good,"This job is extremely demanding, provides no work life balance, and can be extremely taxing both physically and mentally. This job can be extremely rewarding, but can easily be unavoidably punishing."
good,"After working in the service industry for more than five years, the worst patrons I ever experienced was at Starbucks. Starbucks as created a pretentious culture where customers believe they are better than the employees and feel free to treat them with little to no respect. Despite popular belief, it is difficult to work your way up in Starbucks. The pay for the amount of work is also unbelievable. In a cafe store, with two baristas on hand, would have to run around to do everything the store needed while not earning anymore than a drive through store where a barista could focus on one job at a time. The culture within the employees is the only silver lining about working for the company."
good,"Great benefit package for 20 hr per week average. All inclusive reasonably priced medical, dental, vision, life. 401k, stock options, education reimbursement program too."
good,Depending on the store location it can be really busy or really slow and everyones experience working for the company is always different depending of why your working there.
good,"I was given little to no hours and the eviroment was so toxic. My manager didnt care to listen to what I had to say about false rumors being spread about mw ans continued to cut everyones hours. "
good,Great place to work if you want to get to know people in a community since everyone most often times is either going to want coffee or at least a cold refreshment. Holiday season is one of the best time of year to work at Starbucks !
good,"I used this job for extra income going through college. Overall had some nice perks like paid 15 minute breaks and free drinks, but still a minimal wage job. Turnover was on par with other part-time jobs. Co-workers are fake/basic and can get pretty annoying. Other than that I liked my time with Starbucks."
good,"At Starbucks, a typical work day was kind of slow considering we were pretty new. Our peak wasn't so difficult to handle. I learned how to put together drinks, balance personal/ work life, offer great customer service and learn other people's behaviors and any issues they had. Management at that store was very poor, they didn't find or try ways to accommodate or ensure safety for partners, compared to other stores I witnessed. They were preoccupied over the wrong things and would wrongly accuse partners. Mistreatment is just one way to put it. Culture at Starbucks isn't difficult to understand, even though we have our own lingo. Culture is what made Starbucks what it is and be loved and enjoyed by families and hard working people; who simply want a hot and tasty cup of coffee in the morning. The hardest part of the job was having to deal with someone else's mistakes and getting blamed for something you had nothing to do with. Although, in the very end, it was solved and made sure to not happen again. The absolute BEST part about working for Starbucks is the family you make and create along the way. Working there, coworkers aren't just coworkers. They later become friends, and suddenly they're family. These people are who you see every single day, who you learn something new about every time you work a shift together. Hoping you get the same people each time. Also making new partners feel welcomed, and the warmth we offered. Starbucks is Starbucks because of you and because of its partners, like me."
good,Staffing hours cut backs made for overworked employees. Implementing so many new protocols and items at the same time with not enough training made for chaos.
good,The brand itself is good and its fun to work as you meet different people. Although the career growth takes long time to be given despite of your hard work. Management are mostly looking into who they want rather than who gives works hard to give their best to the company and the brand.
good,the hardest part of the job was keeping the line order in place and dealing with angry customers. what I learned was to be patient and lose your temper when customers if they mess up on any order. The management was very organized. the most enjoyable part was seeing the customer satisfaction needs met employees qualifications.
good,Your day start by making coffee. You will be assigned as cashier or the one who makes coffee. The values created by the company is one of the best thing about it.
good,"There are a lot of great things about the company, but some locations (like mine) are fast-paced and impersonal. It can be fun under the right circumstances, but the repetitive motions eventually wear on the body and customer cruelty eventually wears on the mind."
good,"I've worked at Starbucks for a few years, and have been a barista, a trainer, and a shift supervisor. I've worked at a variety of different stores as well, and my experiences have been vastly different depending on location. If you're hired at a store in a good location, with a good manager and dedicated coworkers, it can be an amazing experience. I've had the chance to work with those who really take the company's mission to heart, which is infectious. You can learn quickly and truly build a passion for coffee and helping people. Unfortunately, my experience seems to be a one-off, because most of the other stores I've worked at have been terrible. Apathetic employees, dirty work environments, and customers who are so incredibly rude and demeaning that it makes it a struggle to want to show up after a while. They paid for my college with the SCAP, which was incredible, and I am forever grateful. Not enough people want it, though, and the company would be smart to pay its employees a livable wage. After a few years, the stress of inconsistent hours and entitled customers takes a toll."
good,Cool place to work if you are going to school and need a part time job. The majority of the customers are very rude and feel  entitled. Gotta have thick skin and be able to work in a fast environment!
good,"Fast pace depending on location."
good,"Depending on your manager and the volume your store does, the job is very different from store to store. That being said, the benefits were great at the expense of your pay."
good,"A busy, fast paced work environment with an excellent team work and support. Main focus on the customer service - being approachable, friendly and efficient."
good,"Can be a very fun enviroment depending on your store culture and team. you have to work well as a team to have a succesful store. Be prepared to be busy, and keeping a positive atitude will help get you through everyday. Multi tasking will be a skill you pick up very quickly. I really love working with my crew the hardest part is maintaing positivity even when your slammed."
good,"Mornings will always be buys for a couple hours and on school days, after school is chaotic. I've learned how to deal with unhappy customers and coworkers. It is not easy but it is not too hard to do the job correctly."
good,"tarbucks baristas perform several job duties and provide customer service. Baristas at Starbucks take orders and make coffee, tea, and other drinks to customer specifications. Starbucks baristas may also operate cash registers and credit card machines. Baristas may field customer complaints or questions, as well."
good,I started out loving my job but after multiple changes in management the work environment became toxic.  I had a real medical health issue that caused me to have problems being on time for opening shifts - I was put on probation AND given an accommodation - so the next time I made a mistake (a coworker misrepresented what happened) I was on probation and this manager didn't have to deal with my accommodation anymore. I got severance pay though.
good,"A typical day at Starbucks is unpredictable. From customer flow, to minor inconveniences, such as a broken brewer. However, as a team, we do our best to work together and set each other up for a successful day."
good,The job itself was okay. However the problem comes in with the customers and being poorly staffed. When its mid-morning rush its hectic. Imagine this your making drinks and suddenly 20 stickers come through all at once so they are touching the floor so you start the process of making 5 drinks at once then you've got 3 other people in your way trying to do your job for you. NO ONE listens when you scream at them to get off of your bar because theyre not actually helping and just getting in your way and slowing you down. Then while this is all going on your supervisor is yelling at you about drive thru times instead of making people stay out of your way. THEN the customers. Everyone knows Starbucks treats their customers like royalty. It really goes to their heads because the moment something is even minorly wrong its like they are dying. Example its the dead of a Pennsylvania winter and a customer is in the drive thru screaming in your headset about a pot hole the size of a bowl destroying their car when they drive around the drive thru bend at 1mph... So I guess that sums it up.
good,"My old management was very prying and asked too many personal question about my daily life. Customers were very sour just because of past workers messing up their drinks, management interrupted customer and I having conversations about their drink or their day."
good,"FOREVER UNDERSTAFFED,"
good,"helped me learn how to become a quick witted person, deal with customer relations, learn to work with a team of people, and so on."
good,"I found Starbucks as a company great to work for, but there was a lot of promises made but not followed through within the district I was in. Was hard to keep a flexible schedule"
good,"I enjoyed working at Starbucks for the bust environment. Made shifts go by quickly. However I felt advancement opportunity was only available for those that didn't have a family or other things of importance in their life. You either had to be dedicated to Starbucks completely to move up, or you were stuck where you were. The work life balance was difficult times."
good,"The staff turnover is quick for a reason. Once you learn all the drinks it’s an okay job, if you get on with your colleagues. However (as with any retail environment), each shift can be good or bad depending on the customers. The store I work in has not been meeting sales targets, despite the location having a decrease in footfall, so there is a lot of pressure on each team member to upsell."
good,"A typical work day will consist of lots of cleaning, prep work for the next work day and planning how much product will be sold in the upcoming week. At times it will be busy but there is always enough time to keep the place up to standard. You will always a partner with you to help with lines and help with everything else so you never have to go it alone."
good,"There is so much opportunity for advancement within the company until you get to the store manager level. Once you're at the store manager level it is extremely difficult to advance. They often put extreme pressure on you just get to the consideration stage. Overall, the management is excellent and they have invested the time to make me an excellent leader but will eventually have to leave for growth and development. I would love to stay at a company with such great ethics and culture but unless you live in a hub city for Starbucks, there are limited opportunities for advancement beyond the store management level."
good,"Shift managers not paid their worth, company gives incentives such as health care or 401k for part-time to offset low pay."
good,"I enjoyed working at starbucks. It wasnt until it came between a customer and their employee that i felt I wasnt being respected. As long as you find a store and an environment that works well with you, starbucks is a great place to work."
good,The work is pretty easy but very fast paced. They have a great company structure that is straight forward about what exactly your duties are but can sometimes be overwhelming based on how well staffed the store is. The benefits are awesome for part timers!
good,"worked early mornings, helped with morning prep for the opening of the store, maintain cleanliness throughout our beverage bar, helped customers with their orders and was in charger of the chase wrap."
good,It's an easy job but the company doesn't really care how overworked and crazy hours baristas are put through. There is a disconnect between corporate ideas and what is actually happening in a functioning store.
good,"Co workers and manager made working at Starbucks bearable . I wasnt able to get many of the benerfits because i didnt work enough hours, however, i wasnt able to go over 30 hours."
good,"A typical day with meetings or conferences starts with a coffee tasting among peers, leading them with your perceptions and something special about the coffee. Everyone becomes highly energized allowing for passion and ideas to start flowing. It's a very social culture. Partners (employees) are very proud of their history and accomplishments."
good,"I believe that Starbucks makes a great temporary job. The short term offers great benefits, but I would not consider it a long term job. This job is perfect for high school and college students who need a bit of extra income or just a lot of coffee."
good,"The job itself is actually really nice, as long as you can get along with your coworkers and you can handle a few stressful rushes throughout your day. However, management in the store I was in had a rather negative opinion of us for no apparent reason, and from what I've heard this is pretty common in a lot of other stores. For example, we've had a co-manager attempt to frame us for breaking rules that weren't actually being broken to get us written up. Not personally a fan of store management, but the Starbucks lead I worked with was fantastic, and has backed me up on multiple occasions. Overall, the job has its ups and downs but I'd still recommend it"
good,"This company is corporate, so they have no grey area with things or really any leniency. It's always what's best for business. They had a wonderful maternity leave program."
good,It treats employees less well since howard and values them less.  I think the company is trying to grow too fast.  I have been here forever and am just kind of staying because of the vacation time at this point
good,"Working for this company for over a decade now and have learned many useful tools to help me become the manager I hope to become one day. My schedule was open as it could be but was put primarily as an opener from 4am to 12:30pm 5 days a week. I would prefer to have a mid schedule but there is a favoritism at my store and no one wanted to work the early morning shifts. My favorite part about working for this company are the health benefits, 401K and stock options they  grant us."
good,"Fun to meet new people and learn about coffee."
good,This was my first job in 06' and haven't been back since 13' but I still think they deserve more money. I think I heard they relaxed with the ridiculous dress code policy from what I read.
good,"There is never a 'typical day' at Starbucks as you never know what will happen!  Much of the day is spent doing the same thing over and over, and it is a lot of cleaning.  The customers and the coworkers are the best part of the job!  Every day is an adventure, every day is a learning opportunity."
good,Can be stressful and fast paced where even a 5 hour shift is completely exhausting but they provide great benefits for their workers. Friendly employee's.
good,over all Starbucks has a good environment. I just truly wish they payed their employees what they were worth to be able to make it a life long job. I truly loved it there but unfortunately had some bad experiences with my last manager.
good,you learn various skills and knowledge regarding coffee beans and food industry. the hardest part about the job is that it requires heavy lifting and being in a tight space with other people.
good,"Not enough hour "
good,"Coworkers and supervisors were all lovely, but the sheer demands of the position were overwhelming and physically/emotionally detrimental. Workload and stress were comparable to previous high end food service positions, but nowhere near as lucrative."
good,"It's a good company to start working for but it was just a stepping stone to get where I am. They had a great workforce and guaranteed hours, essentially I found a better job in the city"
good,It’s a nice place to work at all the employees are nice and the customers there are nice but the pay is to low. Also it is very fast paced during rush hours.
good,"stressful at times"
good,Les salaires sont avantageux au niveaux gerant et plus haut mais tous on les meme avantages sociaux.
good,"I loved my team and management but it was a fast paced stressful place. Senior partners get paid the same as new hires. They like to say you get benefits like coffee or bean stock (which you can't access for years) but in reality those things don't pay my student loans and rent. For as hard as you work, you aren't compensated appropriately. Full-time is about 36 hours a week, overtime is almost never approved, even if you wanted to pick up a shift from coworker if it's too close to 40 hours you can't work it. If someone calls in sick, you're SOL and there is no repercussion for the person calling off even if they are obviously not sick."
good,"Not paid enough money for the work you put in. Good job for young people with no experience. If you're over 22 and need money for bills and living cost, starbucks isn't enough"
good,"Barista"
good,"It is ok but they have to do better managing store managers. Other than that it is a very fun environment to work in. Good people, good times, lots of memories."
good,"The culture has changed and has become a lot more cut throat. If you aren't operating at 100%, you're failing and could get written up and lose your job. Overall, the culture of the business is great. It has a lot of great things going on about it. My rotating set of manager did not provide a consistent work experience, hence we were always on edge and trying to adapt to new management's goals and metrics. Nothing was concrete for over a year and a half and it seemed that even senior management didn't know exactly what they were looking for or which direction to drive the company. Management also did not have your back on anything, whether you had documentation to back yourself up or not, you were thrown under the bus. A lot of that came from pressure from above DM level. Again, if you were not performing at 100% in any area, you weren't coached or redirected. You were written up and they started looking for ways to get rid of you. It's sad to leave a company that once had my full commitment to. But them's the brakes!"
good,Horarios flexibles y un par de buenos beneficios para estudiantes.
good,"Everyone wants the promotion at Starbucks and upper management has to be informed of you. If one store manager doesn't promote their partner, or talk them  up, and another store manager talks up another partner, the first partner gets looked over, even if they work hard and jump through all the hoops."
good,"I enjoyed my time with starbucks, the first four years were great. I don't know what happened though- after a while the district I was working in became dreadful. It was a popularity contest. I left the company because my store manager was inappropriate."
good,"Starbucks is a great company for people who enjoy working in a fast paced environment. Starbucks is also a great employer when it comes to working with your school or other work schedules, and health needs. "
good,"The best thing about Starbucks was my manager. She always made sure that my schedule fit with my school schedule and she was easy to get in contact with. Starbucks does make sure that they put good people in leadership positions. "
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work if you have the work ethic. Customer connections and making the moment right are the best parts of the job and really boil down to making a good customer experience, however the demands placed upon you by management, both at the store and district level, make making that connection difficult and sometimes impossible if you are also going to get the rest of your work done during your shift. All in all, your experience working for Starbucks will boil down to your fellow team and whether you all work together to and carry your own weight in terms of responsibility."
good,"I enjoyed a lot about working at Starbucks, but they treat their workers as though they’re replaceable, which, maybe they are. Management was wonderful, though, and the job is consistent work for someone who’s going through school."
good,Starbucks comes with lots of perks that come very handy to the young students that want to get their first experience in the work place. Starbucks has this amazing focus on costumer service which made me really appreciate good costumer service at other places. The management doesn't fall behind either. Talking to your manager about your schedule and what days and time works best for you is what really makes the difference fro any student. It is really a amazing first job to be in.
good,"As far as the work goes, Starbucks is a fun company to work for. It gives you a great sense of community with your fellow partners, and the euphoria of an entire DT team just owning a peak shift together is indescribable."
good,Every shift is fast paced and you learn something new everyday about managing a team and running the day effectively. As a shift supervisor you learn not only how to lead a team but also how the company works internally and how to keep the store stocked and functioning for a successful customer experience.
good,"Best for students going to college, they let you swap hours with fellow coworkers and at certain schools they help with education expenses. Some stores just tend to keep your hours low, there’s been times where my hours we’re at 12 per week and I literally couldn’t afford the job and went into debt."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks for me was morning rushes, which meant go, go, go which was great for a person like me with a lot of energy and a loud voice to pair it. "
good,"too stressful for the pay. do too much for too little. Was nice in the beginning, but customers are allowed to harass employees. should pay more than min. wage."
good,"I liked that there was always a task to be completed, it made the time go by faster. The customers could be demeaning at times, but the management and employees made up for that. The compensation consisted of hourly wage and tips. It's possible to move up in the company somewhat quickly. I generally had a positive work experience here; I had to move and I could not find a store to transfer to in time."
good,"a typical day at work was easy because there was no real thinking involved"
good,"I loved working here, it taught me a lot and was very flexible toward my family schedule. I moved up rather quickly with the company. I enjoyed the benefits that this company has given me"
good,"Busy during the peak hours."
good,"I used to love to there, but I spent so many years there, so I got tired about the everyday rutin, try to make some changes in my life, but maybe one day will return to work there as part time"
good,"It was a nice working environment , good benifits, employee friendly, they allow you to attend school and complete classes with a flexible schedule, environmentally friendly"
good,"Starbucks prides itself on its great benefits (they're pretty good) while paying baristas barely over minimum wage. Tips at my store are measly, not even covering gas money. Hours can be inconsistent, things can be very stressful. "
good,"More expected of us, less labor to get it done. Constantly understaffed and under pressure. Pay is not enough for the work needed. Tuition reimbursement is great."
good,fun and ever changing environment. Would recommend to anyone seeking employment with benefits. Wide range of cultures in the workplace and everyone is accepted
good,very flexible hours so very good for students to gain work experience. Very short hours working independently and good training. It is a little stressful at first because your getting used to remembering so much but it sticks with you.
good,It wasn't a bad job. I left because I was offered a better job that paid higher in my area and the manager didn't give me enough time to properly be trained.
good,Working at Starbucks taught me the value of following procedures to create consistent product quality for customers. Teamwork was essential for an efficient peak/rush hour - this included being willing to help out another barista but also vigilantly performing assigned duties.
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work. The drinks at Starbucks are great. The job is repetitive, which allows you to remember the menu easier. The job overall is easy and relaxed."
good,"This is a great company to work at for your first job, flexible hours, good benefits, and free drinks while you're working! Some days are more stressful than others, some days co-workers and customers will get on your nerves more than others, but overall it's not a bad job."
good,"I quit because after months of offering to stay late or come in early to clean I incountered a mouse and water bug within 2 weeks of each other. Cleaning wasn’t taken seriously by the store manger or the district manager, only when it was time for the health department to come."
good,personal defense can't be a thing. you must be a punching bag the customers have no manners for you at all. you take the hit & move on right? no. this is the 21st century people it isn't okay to talk to people or treat them like trash.
good,"Compared to other coffee shops, working at starbucks feels more like an assembly line - but that in turn does take some stress off when the expectation is to have a drink in the customer's hand within 30 seconds of it being ordered. Tips are also generally a lot less at Starbucks than local coffee shops. Benefits are great though. I've had great experiences with some managers and terrible ones with others."
good,"Decent first job, just don't get too attached. It's a bad place to get stuck. The raises are 1, 2 or 3% so you'll usually start wanting a little more compensation after being there awhile. Tips are taxed as well, and that hurts."
good,I learned to be a better supervisor. Learned a lot form one of my managers. There is a lack of responsibility coming from certain employees. Overall I enjoyed my time being there.
good,Very stressful/busy. May customers will get anoyed if they don’t receive there orders fast enough. You need to always give 100% and with a smile. Plus doing all that with an extremely low pay.
good,"Management is willing to work with scheduling needs. If everyone collaborates and follows their duties, things go smooth and everyone has fun and enjoys themselves. Days can be stressful especially with high customer demands while trying to manage a good window time. Making window time sounds good, but all the stress to keep it up is not worth it. The pay is not a suitable living wage in Anaheim/Southern California area. The people you work with are normally always down to earth and fun to work with."
good,"N/A"
good,"Most days are busy, with rushes during the morning and after school/work got out. Shifts ranges from 4 hours to full 8 hours, usually closer to 4. Customers are what you would expect in a customer service environment, ranging from polite and fun to chat with to absolutely demonic. Management is basically just the hand of corporate offices, enforcing the rules as uniformly as possible. Hardest part of the job is busy rushes with cowokers who may or may not be capable of helping. The job can be fun if you enjoy working on a line to make drinks."
good,Starbucks is a great part time job. It is a good job to have until you find your career. They work well with your schedule and give you virtually any day off that you want. If you put it in early enough.
good,"Starbucks requires much more than the average min wage job. The company is great if you are taking advantage of all benefits including free school. Otherwise, not worth it."
good,Not a bad place to work. made lots of friends and had great hours but not fun learning all the new complicated drinks they throw at you and the management at my location sucked.
good,"I would say startbucks is a fun place to work if you're prepared for a lot of work load. They had me working like a dog one weekn, then limitedly the next week. I wasn't displeased with the time off but the"
good,I currently work at the Starbucks in MGM National Harbor it can get extremely busy sometimes but nothing i cant handle. Management is just really unorganized and they dont allow you days that you request off even if you have PTO. They will cancel it without even letting you know. They also change your schedule sometimes without even telling you. The pay is great though.
good,"Worked there for over a year and watched numerous people get promoted who shouldn't have, watched people who should have been promoted being taken advantage of. Way too low of a wage for it to be a full time job."
good,"The people I worked with made the job a lot more fun. When I was a barista, I enjoyed coming to worked and often agreed to working more hours. I took pride in being promoted into a Shift Supervisor but it came with too many unrealistic responsibilities"
good,"Starbucks was a great place for me, as a 15-year old girl, to learn how to do a job right. Efficiency was drilled into me and I quickly became the fastest and most lovable barista in town. Thank you Starbucks, but pay your workers more because most of them are really grinding."
good,"There are good days and bad days, good customers and bad customers but overall it is a fast paced environment and very stressful. they assign task after task and expect you to be friendly to every single customer which is not an easy task."
good,"This job really depends on how your team is, its a great environment to work within if you have the right staff. Very fast pace and often dealing with very rude customers which you just have to grin and bare but that's retail for you. "
good,"While I appreciate some of Starbucks' culture and customer-centric attitude, employees are not paid nearly enough for the amount of hard work they do, and customers are rude and difficult more often than they are kind."
good,"I spent too long serving expensive coffee to over privileged people, who were mostly mean and looking for a free handout. the benefits were good, but the pay is unlivable unless you plan on living on your parents couch forever."
good,"The work itself was great: meet new people, learn about and drink good coffee, and earn some money. However, the fellow baristas are all usually stressed out adults and/or hormonal teenagers. The amount of drama and stress from fellow employees was unbearable. I worked at 5 different stores and it was all the same. If you EVER needed to have a shift covered you're out of luck. Either no one will respond to you asking them or can't since they're already working so you are forced to work that shift. Customers were mostly ok, but there were a few that went over the line and if you are a female you have to be caredful. There were multiple stories at all of the stores I worked at where male regulars would FOLLOW female baristas home, bother them about dates, or would get banned from the store for inappropriate behavior. If you can handle high amounts of stress with the associated drama and don't mind making minimum wage. Then absolutely go for it."
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for if you have other things going on. They are very willing to work with you on scheduling requests and time off. It is somewhat easy to find coverage for shifts considering you can ask other stores if anyone is available to work (and there are so many Starbucks around) "
good,"The best parts of working at Starbucks are that you can get full benefits as longs you average at least 20 hours per week. That's very ideal if you are a part-time freelancer that can't afford to pay for you're own health insurance. The scheduling is very flexible if you are barista (not so much if you are a shift supervisor). You just have to be firm about when you can work and make sure the manager can accommodate. For example, I needed a Monday-Thursday schedule. I asked my manager if this would be possible, and she agreed. I had a very consistent schedule ever since, and I could modify it as needed. Other great parts are the discounts and perks: free drinks, free and discounted food, free Spotify, free stock."
good,The Starbucks I work in is actually inside a grocery store.  That means that there are a lot of managers and not a lot of people to manage.   A typical day is actually pretty decent despite being alone for most of it.  Customers are generally pretty nice and keep everything light.  We were continuously understaffed but not because we didn't have enough people but because management wouldn't give us the hours to schedule people.  This causes a lot of unnecessary stress.  The hardest part of the job is probably dealing with all the drama.  The best part though is helping make peoples day a little brighter.
good,"As far as a ""day on the job,"" Starbucks is a great place to work. I loved the routine, the customers, the coffee, and the challenge of making that perfect drink. However, I personally had issues with disengaged management. I also found their promotion process to be very prohibitive. The process to promotion to shift leader could take several months, even for someone like me who had prior management experience. I also feel that the company itself is hypocritical. If Starbucks is so ""green,"" why is all of our food individually wrapped in plastic? I felt like I had to put on a facade to succeed in management at Starbucks, which is why I chose to go somewhere with a more organic and upfront approach."
good,"A typical day would have me work the register until someone left in charge of human resources and then I would hop on that until my shift was done. Every now and then when the lines were slow, I would also do some cold drinks on the bar."
good,Starbucks provides a great atmosphere for both  employees and costumers alike. If you are someone who wants to also trying to go to school and work Starbucks has a great collage plan and offers flexible schedules.
good,I have enjoyed my time at Starbucks and it was a very good experience for me. I have had the ability to make friends and long lasting friendships. The environment was fun and fast flowing.
good,"Mejor actitudes de puestos a cargo, por ejemplo, con los Dms."
good,"Great place to work, they work with your scheduling, and Their understanding of it.  Everyone is always willing to help. And teach you Starbucks. Only thing I can approve her time management runs the business."
good,"My time at Starbucks has shown me one thing, and that is the average shift is severely underpaid. I have been through countless assistant store manager and store manager changes. All through district managers trying to show their ""promise"". I can honestly say we get hit with all the stress and none of the glory. Qasa, health inspectors, fire marshals, angry customers, and more. We get it all, for a $1 raise... thats it. That is all I have to say."
good,"At first, the position at Starbucks was great; a welcoming, energetic environment that was interactive and enjoyable. This lasted several months into my employment. Unfortunately, we ran into issues with an outside-hire manager. Now, our staff expected difficulties but not on this level. The manager was incompetent and lacked the knowledge needed to run the store. Stressful situations induced by mismanagement became much too common and soon our long term staff, many who had several years given to the store, resigned so fast. By the time of my leaving well over a dozen long-term employees left. The entire issue was never fixed despite the staff continuously contacted those higher on the chain. This experience doesn't reflect all stores and managers, but the blatant neglect by the company left mine to be miserable overall."
good,"Great benefits. Health care, 401ks, stock options. Do not believe that hourly pay is beneficiary to those trying to make a living. Some days are better than others depending on the coworkers. Hardest part of the job is finding a balance between great customer service and trying to maintain a cordial working environment between co-workers. Sometimes it feels like a battleground to complete your tasks to keep a clean work environment and trying to appease your customers. Morning and night shifts tend to differ on how things should be run because of understaffing and the amount of work you are required to do. Management is dependent upon how well the manager is well equipped to handle all the responsibilities that they are required to do. Most enjoyable part of the job is the relationships you gain from your co-workers and your customers."
good,"It was a wonderful job when I first started and even wonderful when I started having children they work around your schedule which also helps with students. However trying to promote up or advance is very difficult without the right manager, I am just looking for a more career focused job otherwise I would never leave!"
good,Starbucks takes care of their workers above all else. but transferring is not easy so be picky about your store. I worked at a drive thru store and the stress levels are unbearable at peak times in the morning. it does however provide amazing benefits and they take care of the employees.
good,What I loved about this job was supporting two regional directors in San Diego County.  A typical day would come in and pull reporting for both regional directors.  Manage any or all events for upcoming promotions and planned for what I needed to make this a successful event.  The work culture was very diverse and loved the partners coming in and out of the office whether their working in the county or even out of state.  I always made sure they were set up for success and show them around.  I was also the acting manager for the physical location in San Diego.
good,It was fun and productive with new skills worked daily. It was a good environment and had friendly coworkers and people around :) I was able to develop my personal attributes and gain confidence on job and off job.
good,Starbucks was good experience for me because I connected with customers and I made new friends within the company. What I learned at Starbucks was you treat others how you want to be treated and you make them feel welcomed and at home.
good,"Working for Starbucks is both a blessing and a curse. I loved all the benefits we were offered, but it also felt like in order to give out those benefits, cuts were made to other areas. Hours available were cut and were inconsistent."
good,"The benefits and discounts are nice but the overall job culture is not ideal and the company does not value older employees in terms of pay scale. As a six-year employee, I make 50 cents more than a new employee due to a revision of raises and pay scale. The stress of constant understaffing for slightly above minimum wage pay makes the job hard to be proud of and often times frustrating, as we are not given support from the company despite many petitions and public forums about reform in the job roles and pay scale. As a full-time college student, I am thankful to at least have a job that works with my school schedule and offers 401k benefits, which is why I have stayed with the company until I graduate and can start a career."
good,Starbucks can be a great place to work if you take advantage of the benefits. If you are simply working there in order to make money it won't be the place for you.
good,"This is a fast-paced job. Great for someone looking to pay bills in school or just out, but not much more. Don't stay there too long, unless you want to be a manager. Everyone has a shelf-life and most overstay it."
good,i welcome people into the store. I make sure the drinks I make are correct and that I move quick. I also keep the store clean and count the safe and open and close the store.
good,"Shifts were usually short (about 5 hours) to prevent having to give employees breaks. Great if you don't like working, not great if you want to make money."
good,"i have fond memories of my time at Starbucks and would recommend that anyone that needs a flexible schedule, is good with customers, and enjoys coffee"
good,"Starbucks was a great ""in-between"" job for me while I tried to figure out what I wanted to do with my life. I only worked there for three months, but overall I can say I enjoyed it. You will have to deal with irate customers, but there's plenty of regulars who were always a pleasure to see. My co-workers were friendly and mostly pulled their weight. I was given room to make mistakes, especially as a new hire. The biggest downside was my store manager, who liked to cut corners to save money and did not get along with about half of the staff. A good transitional job, but not a good permanent one. The pay is too low and there's very little room for growth."
good,You will be dealing with a wide range of people. Working at Starbucks with a willing and positive attitude will help you develop skills in customer service along with working fast paced in a team oriented environment.
good,Not the best job ever but not the worst. If you have a good manager then its amazing but if you have a meh one then it's not fun at all. But you're able to move up fast.
good,"Starbucks is by no means a bad place to work as long as you understand its a temporary job. You need to have strong work ethic, learn fast, and deal with pressure if you want to enjoy your work here. Starbucks also provides plenty of volunteering opportunities which I really liked and nothing can beat free schooling through ASU."
good,"Es una empresa con la que puedes iniciar.Debe de ser mas facil el entrenamiento a la persona que desfrute de sus productos,sin embargo la organización en algunas ocasiones del día, por ejemplo  cuando muchos clientes entran o para las tareas que realizas para la limpieza del lugar podría mejorar."
good,"At first glance, the wages and benefits provided by Starbucks are great, particularly as compare to other retail food service jobs. However, as the Starbucks business model becomes more and more dependent on preparing and serving food along with drinks, mobile orders and drive-thrus, customer service and product quality are suffering dramatically. Employees are typically never doing less than three or four things at once and that  goes double or even triple for shift managers. The constant influx of mobile orders, which peak almost at exactly the same time cafe traffic peaks, leave baristas racing through an ever-lengthening queue of drink orders, partners working the front counter are dashing through customer orders and preparing as much food as a busy fast food restaurant with no kitchen staff or even a kitchen, just one or two warming ovens. Corporate's answer is to tell baristas to multi-task and move faster, without compromising customer relationships or product quality. The results are predictably underwhelming."
good,"The only thing I didn’t like about Starbucks was that I was not able to move up, career wise. Otherwise I cannot complain about anything else. I enjoyed working at Starbucks."
good,"being a partner there was great and gave me me a lot of insight to polish my skills. however, i felt a lack of respect when i came to partners of their request."
good,"The hardest part of the job is learning the drink recipes but after that the job is pretty simple. I was lucky because my store was filled with great partners who were willing to help me learned. My manager was a little scattered brained but after a while I got used to it. My favorite part of the job was getting to know the customers, especially when you would remember their drink order every time they came in. I loved the moment where a customer turns into a regular and a relationship is formed. When I left my store I had quite a few regulars stop by on my last day and hand me a cards, flowers and other little going away gifts."
good,"Very much liked this job until new management came changing hours & ways of working every day. I️ worked very hard for a long time and when the new management came, they began cutting my hard earned, much needed hours. I️ didn’t know how I️ would get through school and pay monthly for my new place."
good,"I enjoyed working at Starbucks, my coworkers were great and it wasn't a physically demanding job. I can say that management can vary from being amazing to absolutely horrible, it all depends on what store you work at. Your hours may vary at whatever store you work at which can be problematic if you need a set paycheck, but most full-time employees will get over 30 hours if you can get hired as a full-time employee."
good,"If you are a college student - working at starbucks might be your best bet. For the most part, getting free coffee and discounts are ideal for any student."
good,"After we got a new manager, our entire store went downhill, so everyone left. I'm sure most stores are not like this, but if you find one with a good manager, you'll have a great time."
good,The toughest part about this job is  the customers and the stress of making that starbucks experience for them. The pay doesn't match the amount of work required to make that happen but the team makes it worth it.
good,"Great company but it felt like no one was evaluating my manager who treated us like robots and yelled at us in front of customers. After I left because I couldn't handle it anymore, she was let go for high turnover. It just wasn't good for morale and I probably would have stayed if she had been let go sooner. I also worked in a really busy store, managing large teams of people and lines out the door for the majority of my shift, but I made the same amount as supervisors in slower stores and it didn't seem worth the high level of stress. We closed at 9 but wouldn't get out of work until almost 11 because it was so messy from such busy days. Other than that, I think the company benefits are great and I met some lovely people."
good,"The day at work is interesting and fun sometimes, I learned how to improve my Customer Service in english, the management was quite good. The Hardest part was how to make drinks during busy hours but the most enjoyable part is staying with customers and learning from them different things every day."
good,"Highly competitive, Quick Paced, Great Benefits. The manager can work with your schedule if you are studying too. After working a few months you also get a bonus if referred."
good,"Fast-paced environment, you pick up multitasking quickly."
good,"Amazing place to work. In a setting where the manager worked for the required 40 hours they are supposed to work, it is a great place for development."
good,I dealt with many rude and abrupt customers but its manageable. Just be ready to deal with customers and partners who will leave you in the dust. I had quite the issue when it came to that.
good,"Starbucks is customer satisfaction driven industry focused on quality product delivered to the masses. A typical day of work may consist of cleaning tasks, cashiering and preparation of food and beverages. Management is a hit or a miss as to whether your personality will meld with theirs and at times it seems like you are considered a worker bee and not a person. The hardest part of the job is dealing with irate/rude customers while the most enjoyable part of the job is the camaraderie of your fellow baristas."
good,Early bird gets the worm! fast paste and easy to grasp with the help received by other partners! Get to meet new exciting people and make coffee! Great atmosphere!
good,"For the benefits, you can't beat Starbucks. At the corporate level, they have an incredible mission and values, and I genuinely felt like the company wanted to take care of me. However, the managers at the store level that I have worked under have lacked empathy, played favorites, talked poorly about supervisors to other baristas, and over all did not live up to what Starbucks expected. Empty promises about promotions, inconsistent scheduling, outrageous pressure to not call out when you're sick. Don't try to do this job long term... I haven't met a single manager who isn't constantly stressed or frustrated with their job."
good,"a typical day at starbucks is full of fun during the down time, however, it can be very stressful, esp if not staffed properly.  Starbucks is cutting back on labor unfortunately. But if your great at multitasking, this job is for you!"
good,Chain of command can either enhance or demolish the work experience. Only issue ia having all management on the same page of quaility. Moat of the customer clientel where great the staff is amazing. You are able to complete your 40 houra at other stores. That is what i took advamtage of for awhile.
good,"Starbucks is good for a starter, get your feet wet and learn the way of the work world. They are also really good for someone who is trying to work through college, with their flexible schedule. They are not a forever company to work for. Do your time and move on."
good,"Opening up the store"
good,"Grâce au service de minimum 4h, cela reste abordable pour les étudiants, en début de journée ou en fin de journée notamment."
good,"The job is not terrible itself , but if you don't  have a solid manager and team it can be over bearing at times. I learned patience and how to work in a fast pace environment and for that I'm grateful. When you get to know certain people  they tend to be the people that brighten the day. I really enjoyed seeing my regulars."
good,"no comment from my time"
good,"I worked at Starbucks for about four years while I went to college. The people and connections I have made have been great and do not regret it at all. However, I usually worked the morning shift, meaning I usually had to be there at 4:30 in the morning. This worked well with my school schedule, but my grades started to drop due to exhaustion. Also, my social life suffered a little due to having to be in bed early. Ultimately, the job was great, for a part time job. I would never see myself continue to work unless it were a corporate position."
good,fun workplace to work at especially if you love engaging and connecting to other people and creating friends. lots of areas one person can grow and enhance their skills.
good,"The workload vs the pay is not equal. The people you work with is generally going to determine how long you will typically stay at Starbucks. I had an amazing team that I worked with and we worked very well together like a well-oiled machine. Everyone knew their role and what they needed to get the job done. It can get pretty hectic and the learning curve is not for everyone, but once you get a handle on the work flow, nothing really changes. Unfortunately this also means there really isn't any room for advancement. Great place if your availability lets you work extremely early in the morning for class or a second job. But I don't really see it as a permanent solution."
good,I developed many relationships through Starbucks while also developing leadership skills. I was able to learn in a fast pace environment without feeling stressed or overwhelmed.
good,"Starbucks provided a stable management structure, but not the training required to fill the roles. Strong family environment, and positive company propaganda system make working there an o.k. time if you are hourly- once you take a salary, however, expect work-life balance to slide decidedly toward work."
good,To work at Starbucks you can expect to work in a very fast paced environment while under a lot of stress. They pay higher than minimum wage but they do not pay enough for the job that they are asking you to do or the environment that you're in.
good,"My experience was very different than most.  The company treats it's employees fairly and there are a lot of perks. Unfortunately, my experience was challenged to a very store specific hazardous environment that was compounded by poor management."
good,"fast work paced, no actual structure"
good,"Working at Starbucks has it's ups and downs. The benefits are great, though in today's day and age the pay leaves much to be desired. You may meet some great people on your team."
good,"Starbucks offered me a chance to explore and challenge myself. Having my sister work as the company manager for another store, I got a lot of insight into the type of work my manager would be looking for. Starbucks values a strong work ethic. This keeps your motivations high as unsatisfactory employee actions do not go unnoticed and are occasionally reprimanded. I would say the Starbucks work environment set the standard for how I wanted to be perceived throughout any future work experiences. It may also be of note however, that I worked in a very high traffic, busy Manhattan store location."
good,"It's definitely not the worst place I've worked and the benefits are pretty good, but the scheduling can be stressful and the work is taxing at times. I do enjoy the job though."
good,"Overall, a fun place to work with a energetic ethos. The hardest part of the job is pleasing every customer and overcoming difficult complaints/ situations."
good,"Throughout my nearly 10 years working for Starbucks, I met and worked with hundreds of people. I have made lasting relationships, and grew greatly as a person. I had 5 managers in my time at Starbucks.  Each manager runs a store the way they want to, I had some great ones, and some not so great ones. Just choose wisely I guess."
good,"Even though Starbucks does a really great job of taking care of it's partners(employees), recently they began to make promises that I feel haven't been kept. Recognition is something they wanted to implement for everyone and we're encouraged to do so, however for tenured partners it's almost like our tenure is all that matters. In the past partners that made it to the 10 year mark received a plaque as recognition for their service to the company. Some of those partners that are making it to 10 consecutive years have either yet to receive theirs or are told it's lost. We're also told that we're going to be taken care of and for the most part we are. However the labor we expected to work with makes everyone feel like they're working like dogs and the genuine customer connection we're expected to have is simply being put on the back burner."
good,Starbucks was all about making sure we did everything we could for the customers but with a new change in management everything has changed. We've turned all our focus on getting drinks and food out of our drive through at the fastest time possible even if it means we sacrificed our customer connections and at times ignore certain customer needs. Starbucks is a good company but it is beginning to take on a corporation like attitude towards its customers and employees instead of its happy and caring attitude that it originally had.
good,"Starbucks was a very friendly environment for my fast-paced student life. I knew it would not be my forever job, but this job did help me develop initial skills that I would need later on. It is a lot more difficult than it looks. The hardest part of the job was working during morning rushes, when you are required to make lines of drinks for 2-3 hours on end. The work culture was very fun and I had great bones with my coworkers. I also enjoyed that I could fluctuate between either working early morning shifts or late night shifts, on days that I had college classes."
good,"Good apples, bad apples, apples from mars, you’ll get them all at Starbucks. Overall it was a fun place to work but definitely gotten too stressful.  Very stressful."
good,Typical of many customer service jobs with the exception of better than usual benefits for similar positions such as health insurance and college tuition to arizona state university online program
good,"The company has a good brand image, I was working as a barista, I enjoyed my work, I have learned many things at work interacting with customers, solving customer query & most important doing upselling, "
good,The company itself does not pay employees enough. Considering the amount of work baristas put in just to keep the store running they are underpaid. Benefits are okay but not enough to keep good workers from finding better job opportunities.
good,"•	Accepted Award for Partner of the month for excellent performance and teamwork"
good,"At my time at Starbucks, a little over a year, I had 4 managers. There was little consistency and it was hard to get employees to be on the same page about policies. If management doesn't like you, you will be pushed out. If you are getting pushed out there is at least a partner resource representative to keep it from happening."
good,"I work at a licensee store which is a bit different than corporate. For instance, there are no free drinks or food, tips, and health insurance outside of work hours. My manager is awful and we've had several workers quit because of her. Starbucks is a great first job that teaches you have to work in a team under pressure.  Its's quite variating since you're usually not on the same station two shifts in a row."
good,Starbucks is a great company. Management can sometimes kill your love for the job. Other than that Starbucks is a great job to have and you can network with a lot of people.
good,"Everything that makes you want to keep working at Starbucks is in the perks - free Spotify premium, a pound of coffee each week, free food and drinks during your shift, discounts, etc etc etc. But schedulings a nightmare. A minimum or maximum hours cannot be guaranteed. If you're sick, you're coming in. If you're injured, you're coming in. It wasn't fun."
good,"Although Starbucks creates a rigid corporate environment to work in the amount it is felt varies greatly from store to store, manager to manager. Similarly, some of the stores I worked in had management that encouraged partners in friendly human ways, and treated everyone equally. On the other hand the store I worked in last had a manager that spoke only in passive aggression while wielding write ups like a sword, pointed solely at those she did not get along with personally. The benefits and above minimum wage starting pay are wonderful, and the corporation as a whole seems to care greatly about treating its employees right. The only problem is that the environment created by the manager in each cafe can land anywhere between exceptional and truly toxic."
good,"Starbucks has a lovely atmosphere and usually incorporates a fun and eccentric crew to work with. Crew tended to have a strong turnaround time so keeping baristas was hard. Hardest part of the job was having to deal with being on call - Manager would give hours to older members of the crew. Most enjoyable part is the atmosphere, your crew, the customers who become your friends, and experiencing a fun culture of coffee."
good,"Over the years of working for Starbucks, I have noticed it is not a place for people who are looking to advance in their career. The company hires mainly outsiders for positions in management."
good,The place could’ve been more clean. The pay was ridiculous for the amount of hours they had us working. Management didn’t know how to run a Starbucks. (I worked for a Starbucks inside of a Kroger’s Market Place.)
good,When I first started at Starbucks I loved the role. It wasn't until about 6 months in I realized the culture they spew isn't necessarily followed in store management roles. I was stalked and harassed by a customer who was in turn arrested and charged with felony stalking. Starbucks did not support me throughout that entire process. (It lasted over a year.) They denied my request to be transferred to a different store for safety concerns. It wasn't until I brought it to higher level human resources was I finally transferred.
good,"I thought working in a coffee shop would be fun. It is not. The type of customers that come through are demanding and rude. While I have to say that the benefits at the company are nice, it doesn't change the fact that this is a labor intensive job with demanding and unforgiving customers with really bad pay. The partners are probably Starbuck's only saving grace."
good,"Starbucks boastfully offers a wide variety of benefits to their employees, or ""partners,"" but - in my experience - they did not make up for how much was asked in return. With everything being standardized at a corporate level, one's salary rarely reflects their performance in comparison to their coworkers and their value is treated invariably on a day-to-day basis."
good,The people are great once you get to know them and the store is fast-paced and without a lot of down time so you're never bored. You have to be ready.
good,En general Starbucks tiene un excelente ambiente laboral.
good,"early mornings, 40 hours weekly, always in rush sometimes i cannot seat down which is good i like busy work, Management i wasn't so good but u can do it."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks is to inspire the human spirit one cup at a time.  We all work together to make sure our customer gets their needs met in a timely and friendly manner.  Making sure we have the correct order and that is followed up with a quality drink.  Management is knowledgeable and runs the floor during peak times effectively.  The Starbucks culture is one that is diverse.  They encourage us to make customers and partners be recognized, be included, be appreciated, be supported and be delighted.  Hardest part of the job is how physically demanding.  Most enjoyable part of the job our seeing our customers daily."
good,fast paced. partner and customer oriented. values employees opinions and takes them into account when making decisions. would recommend this place to anyone for employment.
good,"Overseer's daily operations, scheduled breaks and lunches, operated the cash register, Maintained all cash deposits and bank drops. I also handled all customer complaints and concerns with the customer according policy"
good,"As a company, Starbucks is a decent employer. Health benefits are provided for only a minimum of 20 hours per week, which is nice. Discounts and free coffee are some of the incentives to work there. Learning to mesh as a team with various types of people on different shifts can be been challenging, but also rewarding. Many unique friendships and relationships have grown from this job. Community can be achieved, if your team is willing to make it happen. However, it can be exhausting dealing with customers constantly ebbing and flowing- all with various moods and sometimes the hours on your feet can take it all out of you. It can be extremely fast-paced and stressful, which is not ideal to everyone. I recommend supportive footwear, excellent diet, and any tools to keep your mood upbeat (essential oils, meditation, positive affirmations, prayer). Ultimately, like any job, it is what you make it and can be enjoyable if you enjoy the people working with you."
good,Great company that cares for its customers and baristas. Lots of great benefits and discounts. Very fast paced environment. Environment of each store is different depending on location.
good,"The most mental stress I have ever been under.  The manager understood that literally every employee was under excruciating stress and failed to do anything to combat it.  i stayed on as long as i did because of the great benefites, vision, 401k, dental, and all the discounts, 3 free drinks a day, weekly coffee beans for free, free daily meal."
good,"Starbucks implements a 70:30 rule when hiring store managers They out hire 70% of their store managers and only in hire 30%. I went through 3 different out hired store managers, and experienced a variety of problems. Due to never having to work the actual system, many simply did not understand company culture, values, brewing methods, etc. This led to lack of understanding, lack of support, and lack of growth. Supervisors work hard with their baristas to  attain sales goals, only to never receive acknowledgement from the company. Absentee store managers receive credit for attaining the goals, and receive bonuses that should be going to supervisors and baristas. While the personal aspect of having great peers, and occasional amazing customers, the company does not back up its lower management."
good,"When you go into work, you know the list of normal tasks that are to be done, throughout the course of the shift/day. So, it makes things nice.And what makes it go by well are the customers and your co-workers."
good,"Been working at Starbucks for over four years now, but I make the same hourly rate as any new baristas they hire. They changed the way they do raises two years ago and has been unfair since. Everyone gets the same raise regardless of their work ethic."
good,"Fun, fast-paced, high energy, positive team environment. Lots of pressure placed on operators and store managers. Inclusive and emotions oriented culture, always room to discuss ""how you feel"". Little time to connect with employee's, lots of responsibility placed on managers with little administrative time. Love seeing employee's develop and grow into leaders with confidence."
good,"Workplace environment is overall positive, coworkers are great. Very little support offered from management when problems arise. As a supervisor you are responsible for taking care of the store when the manager is away, provides a lot of learning opportunities."
good,"Fast-paced environment. Interesting and divers staff. Great benfits for those who need them. Easy to maintain. Repetitive days. ""Standards/Policies"" constantly inconsistent among stores and districts."
good,You show up. Get into your station. You'd  do that job. For those who need a very strict set of guidelines to do work this is a great job. There is no room for any critical thinking or problem solving though. Their way or the highway.
good,Things have changed in the 10 years since I've been there. Seems like there is a lot more to do and remember. Not sure I'd be able to manage working there now
good,"Overall, I made some great friends working at Starbucks. I didn't feel like I was compensated enough to wake up at 4AM and put in an eight hour work day especially compared to other local places offering 10+ an hour just for a part-time position and $13 for a full-time. I definitely learned efficiency through the morning rush, management could use some work, hardest part was getting time off and meeting my time availability."
good,"Hourly pay is not the greatest, but benefits make a big difference. Supporting yourself alone with just this job is very difficult. Benefits are great, however can not use tuition reimbursement making so little an hour and supporting myself. Very stressful emotionally as well as physically.  Have to have the right mindset."
good,A typical day starts early and gets busy quick. You need to be a morning person. Before you know it the day is over. Benefits are good but pay is on the low side.
good,"There are some things I like about Starbucks, flexible hours being one. Free pound of coffee a week. 30% discount. Good benefits. These things don't outweigh the stressful environment that is faced on a regular basis. It's a mentally exhausting place. If possible, find a store with great management who will listen to your creative and good ideas."
good,"Fast pace, can be very stressful at times, benefits, college reimbursement, partner discounts. It can be very challenging at times. Customer satisfaction expected."
good,"Starbucks is one of those places that you love to work at in the beginning, its new, fun, and you feel creative. The people you work with become family. In about a year though you hate it. Everyone becomes jaded from the customers constantly trying to pull one over you. Evil frapp happy hours, and buy 1 get 1 free Christmas lattes. It all wears on your belief that the world is a good place and Humans are good."
good,"Fun place to work. "
good,Only con is the management which makes job stability really pooor.  favoritism plays a role in work environments. Baristas have no voice higher position prey on lower like a high school movie
good,They didn’t train me properly. Made me feel slow and I like I didn’t know that I was doing. They just had me cash out for the drive thru. They didn’t care about the way they treated me or there employees.
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for with a huge heart. However, the hourly compensation for front line staff doesn’t offset the lack of coherent corporate strategy that directly impacts your work day."
good,"When the management is rude or acts like they don't care, then it makes me not want to work there. It is a relatively fun place to work, with great benefits, but if something goes a little wrong... everything goes wrong."
good,"My weekly schedule commonly consisted of a variety of work periods. I opened the store, closed the store and worked all other time slots at some point. My day involved making up different drink bases, keeping the store in clean condition, stocking merchandise and customer service."
good,"Where I specifically worked, I was only allowed about 15-20 every 2 weeks of work. Making $9 and hour and only getting about $200 every two weeks was unacceptable. Especially when you are asked to perform so many tasks within that time frame. They can afford better hour compensation. But were very selective an bias about who they wanted to work more hours. If you are new, your chances of working more than 2 days a week are slim. Very unacceptable and obviously hurts when you are trying to gain more experience and can't that way. Requesting for more hours gets you written up apparently."
good,"the company has poor management, haven't met a great one but other than that you learn alot about the origin the coffee and how to make delicious drinks and the customers."
good,"Job was very stressful at times. Super easy and became less challenging. Customers were very rude and ungrateful at times, but those that weren't made up for it. Each week my hours were all over the place so it was hard for me to make plans. Overall, it was a fun environment with decent pay"
good,"It never kept you ""bored"". you always would learn something new, if it be a drink, or a customers personality. It was very fast passed and provided a wonderful knowledge of Coffee, teas and the people who learned to love them"
good,"It was a very useful job in a time of transition for me. Starbucks was great, had wonderful benefits if you work there long enough. It was  a fast paced and routine job so once you got the paces down, you can excel at it."
good,"Sales, Marketing, Customer Service, making the perfect coffee for every customer every time. The people I worked with were very fun to work for. I liked the benefits I had at the time I worked there."
good,"The job is good for anyone who needs a job and is going to leave in the next year or two. The job is stressful with a lot of things to do in a small amount of time. The pay is fine for baristas but the shift supervisor pay is a joke for how much has to be done as a supervisor. The hours are so inconsistent, one week I have 32 hours the next week I have 40. Its hard to pay bills when your hours change so much each week."
good,"The experience of working for Starbucks varies greatly by location. Over the course of seven years, I worked at five different locations. Some were slow and easy-going, while others were busy and hectic. The cohesion of the team and camaraderie could be amazing and make the job very satisfying, but an ineffective manager could easily sour that experience."
good,"A good job if you make them stick to your schedule and do not plan to move up. Very stressful, long hours, underpaid for the amount of work required and number of rude customers you have to deal with. Not worth it to move up. Not enough coverage from other partners, and not enough coverage on the shifts."
good,"It was a unique experience, I came into the store as a shift supervisor. I was forced to transfer to another store even when it was a long drive for me and I felt that was unfair. I enjoyed my time as a supervisor but I felt that I did not get as much support from my manager. The morale of the store has dropped and does not give it the fun Starbucks atmosphere that is needed."
good,"There is always something to be doing. Whether it be cleaning, taking orders, or making drinks, there is never a dull moment. Although the Starbucks I worked for had managerial issues at the time, the staff and team as a whole was like a family. I enjoyed my time there."
good,"tuve conflictos con los partners,me tuve quw cambiar de full a part time orque era muy matador pero aprendi mucho"
good,"A big international company with great values. I spent an overall of 6 years with Starbucks and had opportunity to grow. They offer good benefits, stock options, and tuition reimbursement."
good,Overall working at Starbucks was fun especially getting to know your coworkers. It can be stressful at times (frappie hour) but at the end of the day its still fun. The benefits for employees are good.
good,"Typically working at a Starbucks in Kroger depending on how you deal with stress can be easy or hard. Being alone can be stressful when dealing with controlling how much product you have in stock, restocking product, dealing with customers (ringing them up while making their drinks and conversing with them) and repeating until all customers are gone. Also have to answer the phone if anyone calls and answer any and all questions they might have. When you have other baristas there it is a fairly easy job because each person has one task they will perform until told to do otherwise. I learned quickly whether it's hot or cold outside to always have a jacket with you anytime you worked, because you could be sent to the freezer to get the needed pastries. My manager usually helped me if I asked for it, but sometimes she would also step in to help anyone if she saw they were struggling. We all did that if we noticed, sometimes while off the clock. It's not a bad job for someone who is just stepping into the work world or someone who just needs a simple part time job for a little extra money. I did however enjoy making the drinks; learning what went int which drinks and how to make it and etc."
good,"Starbucks was a great place to work. The hours felt long, and it was very fast paced, so it's not for everyone. The pay is very low, but the benefits are amazing."
good,"Starbucks is an extremely fast paced environment. There is a lot of opportunity for advancement and benefits. Each store is different, so management can be a hit or miss, and the same goes for customers."
good,"The expectations of the shift supervisor role are very high and usually the store is under-staffed and although the customer demand is high, we are still coached and expected to manage labor, deliver the best customer service experience and provide high quality hand crafted beverages under a minimal wait time. I feel sometimes the expectations are seemingly unrealistic because the stress levels are very high especially for high volume stores.However, I enjoy the connection I have with my customers and it is my goal to delight them, inspire them and recognize my appreciation for them by encouraging and coaching my team to lead the same way."
good,the company is fine its self but the management is awful. they dont care about there employees and is very rude and un welcoming. they turned this great job into a horrible enviornment.
good,I like working there for the people and experiences. I learned a lot about making coffee and helping people in a fast pace. the hardest part is making drinks while doing other things at the same time. I Had a bad experience with management but overall I have great days at work.
good,Could be better. They don’t promise full time when I need it. I want to work my way up the latter but it’s impossible when they don’t schedule you any time.
good,"Although shift supervisors get paid only a little over minimum wage, with much responsibility, the job has given me many skills, from customer service to cash management and how to deal with very difficult situations. The management is different with every store manager but usually is overall good. The hardest part of the job is not being allowed to defend ones self when being treated horribly. The most enjoyable part of the job is the friendships that are made with coworkers and sometimes customers."
good,This is a great company. They treats employees as partners of the company. It has a good working environment that everyone will enjoy working at. Sufficient benefits for everyone.
good,I worked for starbucks for 3 years. I was promoted very quick. The job itself was exciting and fast pace and for the most part my coworkers were very helpful.
good,The job as a whole is great.  You meet really great customers and partners.  The downside that I have come across would be a lack of hours to staff the store.  Starbucks used to be a leader in pay for their partners but in the last few years that has disappeared and now it is very hard to get great people into the building and keeping them.  We can find them but once they find a job making more than what Starbucks wants to pay them then they quit.
good,"There is honestly not much to say about this job. It's a job. Everyone was hostile, the register system was outdated and difficult to use, and the customers were entitled."
good,"Cool, easy once you get it down, but they pressure you to do so much in one shift while other people just stand around. Have to be fast and if you are put on bar to make drinks then good luck."
good,"Good Job. Great Company. Just sucks that everyone doesn't live by the mission and values the company was build on. People know how to quote the words of the CEO, but not live it"
good,"I enjoy making customers happy and this was a great place to do that. I learned far too much about coffee beans. Management is a mix, many managers are friendly and awesome but there are some bad eggs in the bunch."
good,"Great culture. They really want employees to succeed."
good,"I learned to take control of your life. Starbucks has a lot to offer, such as experience and building the ability to interact with people (customers and teammates). Excellent ground builder."
good,Not a bad college job but people who work here take coffee too serious. Worked part time. Coworkers were great. Has pretty solid benefits for school and insurance.
good,"Every store is different , as a first job just trying to get out there its not really a good job especially while youre in school its good if your older"
good,Working for a licensed Starbucks is very frustrating at times because the store that the Starbucks kiosk is located in wants their employees to follow their rules and dress code and they often times contradict corporate Starbucks rules and regulations.
good,"The customer is always right is a standard they hold, however they take it to an extreme. The customer is always right and you cannot defend yourself when they complain."
good,"Sometimes it can seem like a fun and easy going job but when the rush comes it can feel extremely stressful, especially if you aren't able to handle yourself well in high pressured situations. The company itself is good, but at the same time with managers and district managers breathing down the store's figurative neck about drive times and pushing sales, it becomes an extremely stressful environment."
good,"A typical day at work is fast paced and continuously changing. When working with all different types of customers, it can be very rewarding and very frustrating. There are so many different job responsibilities in a day of work. It can include cleaning and scrubbing the store from top to bottom, or making food and drinks for customers, handling money exchange and selling items in the store, and managing inventory and store set up."
good,"The job satisfaction is going to depend a lot on your location & team.  It can be great. It can also be another corporation that doesn't look past numbers. This job is incredibly labour intensive. There is a lot of cleaning, constant movement, and very physically demanding. Baristas only make minimum wage. Shifts start at $13/hour (not enough if you ask me)."
good,"American company, like many others. they just worry about get the profit in the pocket. Very easy to get further up if you became a traitor to everyone else around you."
good,"Working for Starbucks was overall the best couple years of my life. Starbucks really supports its partners and provides enough resources to help you remain successful in life and with your career. Being in the store and remembering drink and learning new ones at the same time is definitively difficult but if you can get past that and  manage a fast pace environment with good humor and a nice smile this is the place for you! Customer connections are what really drive this company and overtime you begin to look forward to it as well, and can even gain really good life connections just by being yourself and remaining friendly."
good,The job placement was satisfactory for a part-time summer job. I quickly picked up key skills such as communication skills and putting customer care first.
good,"They are good at working with your schedule and provide flexible hours. They provide great benefits with full medical, dental, and vision. But they tend to hire really bad managers. in my experience all 5 that I have had in my time, only one was exceptionally good at her job. All others have been slackers, or dont like to work on the floor, mess up schedules, and dont take time to listen to employee concerns. They are just there for the paycheck and really dont care how their store actually operates. And if you liked to be yelled at by customers then this is perfect for you."
good,Had lots of fun there but too slow and not physically demanding enough most of the time i was bored and felt like i was wasting my trade skills i went to school for
good,"As a store manager you are basically a glorified supervisor.  Very little say in the operation.  District managers make all major decisions.  you order supplies and sell product.  they believe 80% of your time should be doing the work of an hourly barista and 20% managing."
good,"Although this company offers benefits to those who need them, I find myself working very hard for not enough pay. Many times there are not enough people working on the floor making you carry twice as much weight as you should. There is also no motive to work that hard, such as no extra pay."
good,"I’ve been exposed to different functions from being a Cash Register, trained in equipment maintenance, making high quality beverages quickly and efficiently. I also acquired the skill in Latte Art which is a good advantage for the industry. I gained valuable knowledge by observing my superiors on how they handle and deal with customers, solve customer complaints, recover and delight them."
good,"They sucked , management sucks only some barista do actual work some people suck , somepeople are just stupid beyond helping , the managers do not take into account their own barista and do not treat each other fairly"
good,As a college student this was a very good starting point into the work force. My manager at the time was very easy to work for. Like most places you get along with some people better than others.
good,"Well I work in Manhattan,NY in this on particular, for going on four years now, and I've been through 4 different managers as well as coworkers due to the workplace and how the managers treated us. I get a lot ""trained"" untrained baristas that comes from different stores in which they know how to ring up drinks properly in the system, don't know the proper cup sizes, which messes up my job position, as the barista/bartender, to fulfill the customers needs with what they want. Majority of the days, I'm getting yelled and screamed at by customers because the person(s) on the register doesn't know how to how to ring up the drinks or they missed something, which messes up the orders and slows down the process of getting the customer's in and out to go about their day. My store is always getting new managers as well as baristas due to the fact that the baristas can't deal with the way these managers act or because they realize it was more than they can handle. My store now has a NEW manager and he's planning to get rid of everyone and bring in all his friends. I'm the last one standing at this store (all my other coworkers either quit, got fired, or transferred) and I think this is going to be my last and final year working for this company due to the amount stress I've had to deal with. I've asked to get promoted and I always hear that I don't have what it takes to get promoted... If I don't have what it takes, how did I manage to put up with seeing different faces every other week, different managers, all the disrespect from new coworkers and customers, all the drinks I've had"
good,"My time with Starbucks has been amazing, learned new thing ,my team member was great to work with. The hole Starbucks experience was great needed more hours but overall i loved my time there."
good,"If the job were jus taking orders and making drinks it would be perfect, but corporate and store management sets unrealistic goals and blames baristas when they aren't me. Corporate policy also breeds entitled customers - I am experienced in customer service and was never allowed to be disrespected as much as I was here. The corporate policy of 'making the moment right' means that you can get in trouble for enforcing health and safety policies. I have been discouraged from filing incident reports with WorkSafe BC and calling for proper biohazard cleanup, and had a customer who was banned for sexually assaulting a barista be unbanned by upper management with an apology for the inconvenience to him. The baristas and shift supervisors I've worked with have been the best coworkers of my life, I enjoy the fast pace, and the benefits make Starbucks a great option for anyone who isn't covered by a parent or spouse's plan or has children, but be prepared to need to insulate yourself from the workplace culture."
good,"Highest growth company by category in the history of North American business.  Excellent benefits, very structured, can truly have a successful career if you are willing work hard and excel."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of working at the bar where I was either making drinks, working on register or drive-thru. Oftentimes, I was assigned to clean the floor, as well. I learned how to work in a food industry and interact with customers, as that was my first job. The hardest part of the job was making each drink to the customer's liking, as one little thing could change the overall flavor of the drink. The most enjoyable part of the job was making drinks, however, because I was able to do it at a fast pace and each drink followed a specific recipe, which I enjoyed learning."
good,time always flew by working nonstop busy work long lines of customers very hectic and running around left and right getting dirty with the drinks satisfying customer needs
good,"If you like people this is for you."
good,Overrall the being a barista can be tough at times one reason because when you first get trannied it's a lot going on around you but it is always fun because you meet new people from all over the world.
good,"Honestly, your personal experience depends relatively on the atmosphere which you work in and who your manager(s) are."
good,It's a very fast paced work environment and you must have a lot of patience in order to deal with the customers. You will receive people who are hungry and caffeine deficient so they are not the happiest group of people.
good,"Coworkers can be great, even immediate management."
good,"while I enjoyed being a starbucks partner and all the perks that come with wearing the green apron, the particular store i hired into was not that great. The team was very clique and the clopening hours can be brutal."
good,If you find yourself getting bored at home or in need of a job while a student it works. Completely possible to work the bare minimum so you can get healthcare benefits and that's good enough for most.
good,Lack of leadership support. No work life balance as manager. Store partners are upheld when wrong is done. No support for store managers. Management training rushed.
good,It's alright to work for them work there for 10 yrs would probably still be there luv what I did and the pay was good when you broke don't matter you picking up tips so it feels like you always stay with money in your pocket and it's a weekly check plus you get discounts from other companies over 150 at least free Spotify especially if you luv music such as myself overall it's pretty ok
good,"* Process business permit, sanitary permit, barangay business clearance and other certificate of store's. Facilitate Real property tax and secure tax declaration clearance of store's. dispatching Official receipt and authority to print of store's."
good,"challenging and fun environment. "
good,"Sometimes the job is too fun, not many boundaries between people. I've always really loved the job but recently a change in management has made my job unbearable."
good,Management doesn't really give any acknowledgment. Their partners the quarter is basically a popularity contest. Hours are never set. Ask too much of their workers.
good,"Overall I don't particularly like Starbucks Management, at least in my store and district. They never cooperated with my school schedule and I am a full-time student."
good,"On your feet for more than eight hours a day, become proficient in drink recipes and all other cafe procedures, register responsibility, best part of the job is getting to know and be a part of the customer's lives."
good,"-Great starting job"
good,"Starbucks was fun to work at and had great coworkers.  Requires a decent manager and supervisors or else your experience there will be less than satisfactory.  I was able to improve my communication skills and develop my skills thanks to my first manager at the store.  However, the manager that took over refused to do his job properly.  Lots of responsibilities and problems were left to the supervisors due to his laziness.  Store was a constant mess due to the manager refusing to clean/do his part/"
good,"Atendimento ao cliente,preparos de bebidas a base de cafe e degustação de café,maquina de Expresso e forno."
good,"Es buena empresa, depende del equipo gerencial de cada tienda."
good,Based on my experience. The working experience would depend largely on who you are working with. Beware of attitude issues. Be observant- go to a location as a customer and see how the team is working together.
good,"I learned how to always make the customer happy, would always be doing something in the down time like cleaning or stocking. The hardest part was being there at 4:30am and the most enjoyable was enteracting with customers."
good,The job is very stressful and you don't even get paid that much. Management is very inconsistent at this company. However scheduling is fairly flexible.
good,"A typical day at work is fast paced but fun, you get good breaks."
good,"Relaxte sfeer onderling, je bent blij om voor Starbucks te werken en dat is te zien aan de werkethiek."
good,"It's a great place to work if you're in school or have a second job. However if you want something full-time, don't bother unless you plan on becoming a shift. Shift lengths are usually 4-5 hours, and you're lucky if you get close to 30 hours a week."
good,"You are definitely a cog in the machine here, but they do take very good care of you. While clocking in at 3:30 AM every morning made me want to bite a shotgun, some people do genuinely excel with these hours and can truly reap the benefits that the company offers."
good,"It was a fun work environment and i really enjoyed my co-workers for the most part.  I enjoyed the pace and the chaotic nature of the job.  However lack of respect from the customers and management at my three of the four stores i worked at daily, along with the unstable hours and the inability to financially support myself, are a few reasons why i will not work there again.  However its a great job if you want part time work while still in school."
good,Great fast paced. Interaction with customers can be awesome especially the nicer ones.  Pretty simple work and easy tasks.  The fun part would be making the drinks and staying on task.  A little multitasking maybe needed but should be good
good,"The most enjoyable part of this job is getting to know the customers on a personal level and the people you work with. The hardest part is the amount of work corporate and management throws on night supervisors to get done while being understaffed and forced to cut hours. Depending on the location, management can be great, but they can also be completely unaware of what's going on. The culture is fantastic - getting to learn more about coffee and tea, educating customers on newer products."
good,"Flexible hours with multiple shift lengths so it was excellent work as a student, free food at end of day was another bonus. Room for advancement to shift-supervisor or assistant manager if desired. Learn how to make coffee and take home a box of tea or a pound (454g) from any Starbucks in the world once a week."
good,Management structure is the biggest down side. The most enjoyable part of the job was working along side with great team which makes it  fun and enjoyable. Learned a lot about customer service.
good,"extremely difficult labor, wasn't always paid on time."
good,Fun and challenging. Management is challenging and stressful but rewarding if you have the right leadership and team. Would recommend for Students.
good,It was a job I just needed to get through school with. The management is very strict but the other employees were kind and helpful. It's a good job for anyone fresh out of high school.
good,Starbucks is a great company to work for but not when trying to support a family. The work hours worked accordingly with my schedule but the pay was not enough.
good,"Starbucks requires a high quality customer experience which can be demanding out of you. The reward is good relationships and good benefits. Unfortunately, I was there for 3 years and found no room to climb the ladder, and you will find customers who are rude and management who don't care to defend their people"
good,"Loved working for Starbucks, the values that they hold, the relationships that you build. I will say that one of the Hardest parts of the job was Management, also the time it took for advancement within the company"
good,"Learn all the coffees, (about 100 of them). Clean, always smile, converse with clients,. hardest part of the job is having to learn all the coffees, most enjoyable is the benefits that come with the job."
good,Working at Starbucks was not bad at all its an environment where I was kept busy with there always being something to do. The things I didnt enjoy was the out of date equipment we had to use such as the old registers old credit card machines.
good,Fast paced environment with frequent change. The culture of the workplace was very great to be a part of because it was welcoming and engaging. Each day presented new challenges to overcome and each customer was an opportunity to hone skills like patience and interpersonal communications.
good,"Trabaje en una de las sucursales de ""alto flujo"" donde nos visitaban más de 1000 usuarios y que requerían que fueramos rapido, por lo cual aprendí a trabajar bajo presión pero era una presión agradable, ya que el equipo de trabajo y el ambiente que se generaba era agradable y muy afiatado lo que provocaba que el día pasara más rápido."
good,"Starbucks was always busy, especially with it being in Windsor and having a lot of tourists come into the store. "
good,Overall cool place to work at hours are unstable which is a con. Everyday work is okay with the right people but management is unconsistent and job security is uncertain.
good,"Make coffees, greet people, wash dishes, keep the peace during rushes. Busy work, handles cash, works around lots of chemicals in a small space. Work with interesting people."
good,I didn't mind working there but for the work and the pay it wasn't worth it. I felt out casted there. I wasn't a college student looking for money to have a good time. I am just an enlisted reservists making a living to support my family I just didn't fit. and they didn't get it.
good,"The work environment is very stressful and fast paced. You get yelled at by a lot of people, and the management isn't very experienced or nice. It's a good job on days where there isn't a lot of high traffic, but most days it is very stressful and not enjoyable for me."
good,Company is very good but cause of some chip people & there thining is very pathatic so i hav left.......if i got chance to re join Starbucks definitely i will do it....
good,"Best part of the job is the benefits and the hours are decent for food service industry. Typical day is there is never a typical day, its become  a very fast paced beverage service business a drastic change from the cafe experience its original was."
good,"This company culture is amazing, but if it is controlled by the wrong district manager it can be the worst experience of your life. I had to learn my job on my own. The first week on my manager training my Store and assistant Manger quit. Soon after all the other shift supervisors quit the store. I was held responsible for all operations in the store. The offered to move me to a better store full of better opportunities. This store is inside of a very busy mall. This store was infested with roaches, fruit flies and real flies.The mall was infested. Asa failed the store with a 71 percent and still kept the store open. The store manager was fired  and every employee except me and three more people transferred out during the holidays which is our busiest time of the year. The district manager doesn't care about anything else but saving her job. She left her partner hanging in that awful storm. That why I had to get out. I was so stressed out! She tries to point the blame on everyone except for the person who let that fire burn for that long, herself. Be aware! Think twice."
good,This is the first place where i worked in food and beverages company.I didnt like it much because of the store manager.He was not friendly and he was a bit bias through the employees.
good,My workplace is very fast paced due to its location inside the Orlando International Airport southwest airside. If you work in the morning hours be prepared to handle a high volume of customers.  Every shift you're assigned to a particular position within the store based on your strongest abilities.
good,If you are looking for a temporary job I recommend this place. Has lots of good people and great benefits but work life balance is compromising and management can be hard to communicate with.
good,bon ambiance d'équipe et très bon travail mais il n'y a pas de 35h.
good,"Starbucks is a good place to work, especially for food service. The products are good and a good Barista will make a good latte or cappuccino. Being a Barista is pretty fun."
good,"I worked there as a Barista and a Shift Supervisor for over a year. Training is poor and right afterwards they throw you into the fray. The lower management is often helpful but the upper management such as the Store managers I've had are completely incompetent at best. They tend to do outside hires for that position and almost every one has no managing skills, people skills, or anything in between. Co-workers are either great, patient and nice or super clique-ish and hostile to new people and/or change. You are eligible for benefits even as part time which is nice, however you must maintain an average of 21ish ours a week to keep it. With that said, Store managers tend to only schedule their favorites so many baristas cannot keep it. It feels like a re-branded version of fast food (coffee) most of the time. Customers are a mixed bag of amazing, patient, kind individuals, or terrible and entitled. Perhaps this was just my district."
good,"my only criticism of the starbucks partner experience is a lack of compensation and continuity between multiple/changing managers and upper management.  my experience has not led me to sufficient compensation for my untiring physical and intellectual abilities and connectivity with both customers and partners/team building. i have grown tremendously while working at starbucks and have met incredible, hardworking people who will be my friends for life, and i enjoy the company's stance on utilizing a corporation's size power to leverage positive changes in the world we live in."
good,"Being a barista is hard work - you are expected to quickly and efficiently make all kinds of drinks, sell and recommend products, clean the entire place from top to bottom, and make customers feel at home. All for just about a dollar above minimum wage."
good,I have worked for this company for almost a year. It is a very stressful job due to the district not letting us have appropriate labor each shift. This district is very hard to work for and I wouldn't advise applying in management. Being a barista isn't quite as hard but its pretty stressful to...lets just say there is a very high turn over.
good,"Learning drinks and applying the (general) recipe is pretty easy, the hours are flexible and accommodated my scheduling needs, my coworkers were fun to work with, management was easy going and fair."
good,"When it comes to flexibility in hours, this is the best place to work, if you are looking for fast growth in your career, then this is not for you. This company does have great 401k plan and great health insurance for part time employees, and good stock investments. Its a wonderful place to meet new people and have them become regulars, not always the best place to work with others, it gets really busy and sometimes floor coverage is not enough, but guess that can go with any retail job."
good,"Met customers’ needs by quickly and accurately filling their orders; intentionally sought opportunities to exceed their expectations whenever possible."
good,"If you have to choose between this company and something else, choose the something else.It can be fun, but most of the time it's not. Got alot of Supervisor experience though. With that being said, i've had enough, and it's time to move on."
good,"It was an enjoyable company to work for. Always put partners first. "
good,"Working at Starbucks definitely had its long term perks but unless it was the right fit for you, it isn't the best work environment."
good,customer are the worst opening sucks and co workers make you cry specially  if you are the new one to all this circus. and you have a apron that you cant really use there are stores where they are trying to give you a 4 hour shift per day so there is no way you cant reach your hours for any kind of benefits. And the managers dont know how to make drinks they keep hiring from outside instead of you getting considered for advancement
good,The workplace at Starbucks was a good and motivation environment with challenges that and goal that had to be achieve daily.
good,rotating at the cashiering and beverage making. giving customer service to guests. maintaining clean work stations and store.hardest part of the job is when its peak hours and there is a long line queue. the enjoying part of the job is you can make drinks and be able to talk to diverse people and moving paced work environment.
good,"A typical day at Starbucks is generally laid back with intermittent periods of high stress. Starbucks has given me the ability to keep a level head, despite everything going on around me. All the managers that I have interacted with (particularly mine) in my time at Starbucks seem to genuinely love their jobs and coming to work every day. They put all they have into making the store as welcoming an environment as they possibly can. One of the few issues I have with Starbucks, however, is it tends to attract very dramatic people. Some days it is worse than being in high school, which is honestly one of the most draining aspects of the job. The hardest part of the job is running the floor while down a partner, fortunately it has not been that much of an issue in my store recently, however at one point there was a partner who would call out two to three times per week and make it nearly impossible for the remaining partners on the floor to manage the rushes. The most enjoyable part of the job is honestly the people. The customers and partners who genuinely care about Starbucks. I've had some of the most enjoyable conversations in my life with customers at Starbucks over a cup of coffee."
good,"recruiting and developing the right team is critical to your success as a manager. This can prove to be very difficult to do when the starting wage is 8.75/hr. they do get benefits such as a free food item, coffee, insurance, 100%tuition reimbursement, but at the end of the day these don't pay the bills. The job can prove difficult when the company is very strict on meeting efficiency goals such as meeting labor goals and scheduling, when they use a formula to determine labor and forecasting but if your customer count is off there is now clear way to cut/add labor in the moment so you are left with guessing and if incorrect you can expect a long talk with your district manager. the cleaning standards are incredibly strict (a good thing) but if you are not constantly riding your team (unless of course you find those perfect candidates that happen to just want to work at starbucks for fun and they love coffee, which you do come across sometimes.) keep in mind you need to maintain a 60% turnover rate or lower so firing people or making people quit will count against you. as you are figuring out all the new promotions they are rolling out every few weeks the computers or network will likely crash on you wasting your time and making your day longer since everything you need to accomplish is done by computer. however if you find a good system are very disciplined to routines (i mean a routine for EVERYTHING) and you have mad interviewing/recruiting skills for low wage workers, than your store will be great and you will work  40-45 hours a week. if not than expect to work at least"
good,Its a great place to work but the company is vastly different from when I first began as a barista. It's attitude has shifted from being all about the employees and the customers to being all about the transcations and money. The hardest thing aobut wokring here is learning the trust is  not awarded to those who can handle it. People here work ruthlessly yet smile in in your face like they care. Location is the name of the game and depending on where you work you can either thrive or be taken down to the ground.
good,"In truth I wouldn't recommend working for the location I was employed at. "
good,Starbucks its a very cool and collective place to work . Its very fast pace and from time to time there's some breaks in between . However in the beginning may seem not like an easy job with all the drinks and different styles of making each one . But after a few weeks you'll get the hang of it . Its very easy .
good,"Empresa de grande porte, multinacional, com  constante inspiração sobre a cultura do café."
good,"Working at Starbucks was a great customer service experience in a fast paced environment. Though the flexible hours are a plus, they are also difficult to manage because you may be up early and/or going to sleep late."
good,too much presure in the store non friendly management recently changed people are not treated in good way in recent times
good,"Depending on the manager that you have, it can be a wonderful place to work but some of the management members have moved through the company too quickly and get overwhelmed with managing people."
good,"I've only been with Starbucks a couple of months now and I do enjoy it for the most part. I love greeting and having conversations with my customers and bringing a smile to their face with their favorite beverage and a good short talk (sometimes longer if its not busy)."
good,"Starbucks works hard to ensure that their partners are well taken care of, from healthcare to stock opportunities, and even within a daily shift.  It is important to maintain positivity throughout moments of chaos or struggle.  This is a fast-paced work environment that requires one to be agile and flexible in many roles and many times, simultaneously."
good,"Working for Starbucks was a high energy and stress setting. With the help of my co workers, however, we were able to keep the store flowing. Teamwork was a big factor. The customers could get a little rowdy but we kept it together."
good,"Starbucks is a great department in the Target store, team lead is amazing but higher front management lacks care for this department and is biased, and also inconsistent."
good,"Typical day at work depends on where you are ""deployed"" in the store. Cashiers will take orders and ring out customers, while marking cups. The person on the ""bar"" makes all of the drinks and hands them out. You meet alot of amazing people throughout the day, averaging about 40 customers server per hour. The environment between employees is amazing, the people I worked with are some of the best people i've met. When going to work you know you will be tired by the end of the day, but you will also leave work with a smile on your face."
good,"Whilst working for this multinational company I gained many skills. My communication between myself and the staff was great, as I was working with different nationalities. "
good,"When it comes to flexibility and benefits, it's hard to compare with Starbucks. I think that the overall structure of the company allows anybody to grow, that is if you desire a career with Starbucks. But if you'r a student or just need to supplement your income, Starbucks is not a bad choice."
good,I learned a great deal of Leadership skills and how to run a business. I was able to move up in the company fairly quickly due to desire and work ethic and management skills.
good,"Through out my years I always wanted to work at Starbucks, even when I was making good money at other positions. "
good,"As a barista, your job duties are basic.  Ability to use a point of sale system.  Cash handling procedure. Brewing coffee.  Learning how to hand craft all beverages.  Product knowledge.  Ability to converse with the general public in a professional and optimistic manner.  Adherence to sanitation policy.  "
good,"Now, this is not to say that other locations aside from mine are bad, too. The management team at my location can sometimes be demeaning, arrogant, and brash that can affect overall morale in the workplace."
good,"this place can be a great place to work or the bane of your existence, from what i can remember it doesn't pay a livable wage but they do offer great intensives.  this place should be used to go from school to your career.  i truely do not believe that starbucks gives enough for we the employees give to the community."
good,"great popular well known brand."
good,"Manager was an external hire whereas I worked my way up the ranks. Had better job knowledge, created and organised events to promote store. For example, coffee tasting, up selling new products, promoting and marketing Starbucks events, new food, coffee and merchandise. Ran the store five times a week. Lead my team to the best of my abilities. Enjoyed working for this company thoroughly had a fantastic team who were extremely enthusiastic."
good,"Health benefits are great and they offer a very flexible schedule. Coffee mark outs once a week, free food mark-outs per shift and unlimited caffeine, which is needed.."
good,"Good job for a accommodating a school schedule. They encourage school a lot so they seem to work around a stable school. If you need time off though it seemed a little harder. Wasn't able to really get time off unless it was months and months in advance or you have to get your shift covered which is like pulling teeth. On slow days they will send you home & on busy days they will ask if you can stay. Very fast paced environment, which was great and made the day go by quickly."
good,"I come into the office, hang myself up on the coat rack and set about exemplifying the level of professionalism demanded of the position. When the day is done, I pick myself up on the way out the door and live my life to the fullest. Win-win."
good,Good company but alot is expected of you. Always more work for the same money. If there is a need and you work hard you can be promoted quick only if they have a need. Some people will always get the run around.
good,Fun workplace with wonderful staff. Its all about making the customers happy and meeting their standards. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the customers smile and learning new ways to do things from my co-workers.
good,"Starbucks is definitely a stressful job, but also can be a fun place to work. Learning to make the different flavored coffee can get  stressful, but once you get the hang of it, everything in a work day will go smoothly."
good,"Avg day, running the floor, inventory, customer service, merchandising, coaching, training, fast paced and management."
good,"Starbucks is definitely the place to work if you are a peoples person or enjoy working customer service positions. Fast paced, but usually a fun environment where you get a chance to really connect with the customers, and build a rapport with them. The hardest part is making sure that every customer leaves satisfied, seeing how there are so many different options and combinations for them to choose from. The most pleasurable part is making all those connection, who for some, me included can lead to great long lasting friendships."
good,"Busy, high volume location, great co-workers, can be over whelming at times but can also be fun. Great learning experience, great benefits."
good,"I was really happy working as a barista.  I find bartending fun, and am very passionate about beer, it's what I'm currently pursuing.  After proving myself an extremely capable drink craftsman, I was promoted and changed locations.  The customer base at the new location was extremely hard to work with, in conjunction with poor staffing and a new store manager that wouldn't shift labor on the schedule to give me adequate coverage for the shifts I was to run.  Needless to say it was very stressful.  Additionally, I was locked into being the closing manager every single time I worked, which I tried to change, but was unable to due to other several other shift managers leaving."
good,A busy fast paced job with a lot to do. Fun and challenging always keeping me on my toes. Learned how to make hundereds of drinks for wonderful customers and maintain the store.
good,"O dia como barista é corrido e agitado, sempre muito cansativo e com clientes de narizes empinados. "
good,"A day at Starbucks starts the second you walk through the door. Customers know you by name and weather you are clocked in or not, they will start asking questions or telling you about their day. The management is constantly changing. In three years I had three different managers. The district managers are constantly changing as well. The partners at Starbucks is the best part. I have made life long friends by working there. The hardest part about working at Starbucks is dealing with the constant change in management and the fact that we open at 4am every morning."
good,"Management here was very shaky. Sometimes I loved her, sometimes we totally butted heads. Overall, most of the people I worked with were really nice, with a couple of exceptions."
good,"It's better to be a barista, supervising in very stressful if you cant handle it. Otherwise it good for going up in career ladder."
good,"My review on the company is sort of biased. I've loved the idea of working at Starbucks since I was 12-13. Of course, being that age, I couldn't necessarily work there. When I got a call back when I turned 16 I was honestly thrilled. Our manager at the time Vik, was great. He wrote me a personal development plan so the day I turned 18 if I was still with the company I would be shift manager or assistant manager. We currently have a new manager Kamilah and she isn't the most professional. She mostly just sits in the back room. So I'm leaving, which makes me sad but it is what it is. At the end of the day, Starbucks is a great company, but the management just isn't for me. Now it is understandable that you aren't going to always love your boss, but it became a very cliquey workplace and extremely unprofessional. I love the majority of my co-workers and it's a fun place to work. I just need to branch out."
good,The job ended with the manager writing up half of our staff and they quit. I quit the next day after I got wrote up for something that is not Starbucks standards was personal issues the manager was having at the time.
good,provided drinks to customers. I learned to be very efficient. The management was ok. My coworkers were ok. I found it difficult to be there for little pay. I enjoyed the different personalities of the customers.
good,"Shifts starting at 5am Monday-Friday, occasional Saturdays."
good,"a normal day would entail making drinks for customers and make sure the lobby was neat and stocked .  it was great to make someone's day, it wasn't just about coffee. the goal was to make everyone feel like a regular customer."
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for, but it's the customers that make it hard to enjoy sometimes. You most definitely have to have a sense of humor and a lot of patience to work at Starbucks."
good,"Close to home, could walk there, and get my daily exercise in. I love coffee so it was the perfect type of job. Closed early enough for me to take transit home at night."
good,We go through many customers in a day and most days are fairly similar. Delegating is very important to make sure things are getting done. Interacting with our regulars and seeing them on a daily basis is my favorite part of my job. Being a leader is important to me and I like leading my team to success.
good,"Days are scheduled minute by minute and you always have some task to complete which helps time go by. Learned  a lot about strategizing, marketing and sales, as well as working in a team environment. Most supervisors are going to be young unexperienced individuals that abuse the little authority they have to avoid the dirty tasks and delegate them out. Hardest part of the job is to keep a positive attitude as the customers are extremely demanding. The most enjoyable aspects are the perks such as benefits for part time, stock options, 401k, coffee mark-out, as well as some of the partners you work with."
good,"I enjoy working with the staff members however the store manager isn't professional and could work on there management skills. "
good,I'm not really sure if i would let anyone else i know work here. Maybe if the pay was better. All of the benefits don't pay my bills.
good,Great benefits and fun environment but not the best place to seek growth with a company.Good opportunities to learn about coffee and a chance to share the knowledge.
good,"Fast paced work environment with friendly co-workers. Very large turn-over rate, so there is a desperate need for organization, communication and motivation in the work place. Continued learning and improving my skills in multi-tasking, customer service and advancement to Supervisor and Management positions."
good,"best job to start off and pick, goes well and flexible with students."
good,Working for Starbucks has been a good experience overall. I grew a lot in the company and it's really a fun place to work in general. That being said the management is HORRIBLE and most managers (Store & District managers) are INCOMPETENT !!! also come customers have really no life and are super annoying and make their drinks super complicated for no reason and most the time they don't even know what they ordered.
good,It was a easy job. I learn very quick so I learned how to do every position in a month. The management was very unprofessional.
good,"Assembly line for coffee"
good,This job requires a lot of hard work and patience. I would recommend it for a high school student or someone trying to make a little extra money in college. I would NOT recommend it for someone trying to make a living (unless that person wants to grow with the company).
good,"I've worked for Starbucks for about 4 years and have gone through 6 managers, 2 were really good, 3 were terrible, and 1 was okay. The location I worked out was consistently understaffed, due to play book regulations...you are only given a certain amount of labor per transaction per half hour. This doesn't account for all the customers waiting in line in the lobby or drive thru, so when you have to make drinks and ring there is no way you will get your numbers up, so I feel like it is a broken system. On the other hand Starbucks pays better than most fast food chains, gives benefits, stocks, coffee, discounts, and other things to its employees. If you have the right coworkers and manager it is usually a fun place to work."
good,overall my time at Starbucks was fairly good. I had my good and bad days but my colleagues kept me going. I would do all different jobs that was on the rota such as work on the bar making the coffees to working on the till.
good,"I worked here right after I graduated high school, and it was good for a while. There's a large pressure to learn very quickly, which isn't bad, but you have to fight to be on the drink making station (the bar). If you don't, you'll be pushed to cashier and then you slowly forget how to make drinks and then you don't feel confident going back on the bar, so you slowly avoid it. At least that was my experience. Granted, I was 18 and not as confident as I am now. The assistant managers and shift leaders were pretty good, but the manager was only okay. I asked to take a leave for school, and work less hours, so they allowed me to do that, but then laid me off the second they could. No loyalty. I found out later after I was forced to leave that the manager was fired for embezzlement, which made me laugh, because she was the one who let me go. I knew there was something off about her when I met her."
good,"As a Shift Supervisor you are responsible for the cash tils on hand, deploying employees, managing customer complaints, and handling day to day tasks. The hardest part of the job was getting people in the right spots to succeed and also managing two different flows of traffic ( 1. The Lobby of store 2. The Drive Thru Line). The most enjoyable part of the job was the customer interaction."
good,"The job itself is generally fun and easy. There are the daily tasks of cleaning everything and making drinks ranging from the simple coffee, espresso, americano, or latte, to the diabetes inducing white mochas and caramel bomb fraps. Yes, sometimes you do find yourself watching a wonderful customer get a little bit larger day by day, until they one day tell you their doctor told them to quit whatever habit they recently picked up, that two a day, 24 oz., fat and sugar bomb."
good,"The job has you working over 50 hours a week, but putting on paper that its just 40. Its tough managing baristas around the age of 20, but the insurance benefits are great, and I have a decent 401K."
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for, but this particular location is a high-stress place. From what I understand, Starbucks elsewhere are not nearly as stressful as it was here."
good,"Great company to work for overall.  Was not a fan of the hiring of upper management from outside the company.  The hardest part of the job was taking disrespect from the customer base, as most of Starbuck's employees are very well educated."
good,Greet customers with a smile. Count/Handle money in a timely matter. Maintain a clean work environment. Prepare food and drinks for customers
good,"My work day normally started at 4:15 with me assisting in opening the store. Depending on mostly the weather the business varied, some days more busy than others. While working at Starbucks I learned how to make hand crafted lattes. I learned a lot about how coffee was discovered, what countries grow coffee and the different coffee roasts. My co-workers at Starbucks were very friendly and helpful throughout my training process and while working there over all. The management team was very understanding and appreciative of the staff, they made sure the staff and our needs were just as important as the customer we were serving. My manager neisy, was very organized and optimistic, she always had new ideas on how to make the customers enjoy coming to Starbucks. The most enjoyable part to working at Starbucks was interacting with the customers, learning their names and the usual's that they ordered day to day. I also enjoyed the pets that the customers would bring with them."
good,"horrible management, no organization, and poor communications with management about upcoming and on going shifts"
good,Starbucks is a job with great benefits for students looking for a part-time job. I have enjoyed my time and benefits at Starbucks but am ready to move on to a real career
good,"Typical day, welcome customers. Serve their beverages, warm up any pastries/breakfast. Clean countertops, tables, take out garbage, refill milks, supplies for beverage. Management is great. Learned a lot about different coffee and other beverages. Hardest part of job is learning the bar. Easiest part is making coffee. Co workers are very nice and friendly."
good,"Working as a barista trainer at Starbucks taught me patience since people learn differently and at their own speed. The hardest part of working at Starbucks as a barista trainer is that many times the training took place during the peak hours of the store so the lesson had to be cut short due to store being too busy and me having to defer from teaching. I loved however being able to make my own coffee and in that working at Starbucks, the company has a stock investment plan with Fidelity."
good,"Meetings and email make up too much of the day.  Managers need to do their work either very early or very late.  Built a great high performing demand planning team, so my job was so much easier."
good,"I'm having so much fun working at Starbucks right now. We are a very tight group of people who are also friends outside of work. Though sadly this job does not pay me well enough to be able to live like I would like to. I can barely afford an apartment and groceries. "
good,"A typical day at work includes working at the register, making drinks, interacting with coworkers and customers, cleaning the store thoroughly, and making customers feel welcomed and happy with their purchase. I've learned how to make the most effort in a short amount of time and I've learned the art of coffee. My coworkers are amazing and always supportive. The hardest part of the job is working when it is extremely busy and the most enjoyable part of this job is making people feel happy."
good,"It was a good part time job, definitely not something i would want to do fulltime unless i was desperate"
good,Would usually arrive at work by 5:30 am.  Didn't stop running for 6-8 hours.  Loved talking to customers and enjoyed making them feel special.
good,I loved always trying to figure out what customers looked for in their drinks and making up new things. There had been rush hours but most customers were nice. You may not get 40 hours unless you can take on hours. There are health benefits and paid time off but you would have to be there for a year first. The new management isn't very good.
good,"A typical day always includes at least a three hour window of high volume and fast paced environment. This allowed for time management skills to be sharpened and tested the ability of the supervisor to correctly deploy employees to their strengths. I learned many skills while performing this job including time management, cash handling, employee deployment, customer service, and many leadership responsibility. Interacting with customers and getting to know the ""regulars"" was the most enjoyable part of this job."
good,"Anticipating customer needs, responding to and resolving concerns and complaints, assessing store needs at a glance, anticipating task priority in relation to big picture, respectfully and in an encouraging manner providing suggestions to coworkers for enhanced job performance, maintain a comfortable and peaceful atmosphere for customers and coworkers, provide the very best in quality with each transaction as if it were the very first and the very most important, consistently demonstrate punctuality and faithfulness as an employee, coworker, and servant."
good,"As part of this company i have been inspired in many ways, from Partners to customers, they make your every day an amazing and unique experience."
good,"Able to meet new people and become friends with them. The hardest part of the job are the hours, we work a lot of hours."
good,"Within this job, a lot of requirements must be filled with us serving over 120 students within a two hour time period every other two hours, this job is very hectic. It is always busy working at Starbucks. I learned how to work well with co-workers and also work well with customers. I learned how to manage my time with different tasks. Also learned how to help other coworkers with any tasks they need or if they need any guidance."
good,"I worked at Starbucks as a shift supervisor for about 3 years. The day to day work was the same, but the environment you did it in changed hourly. As it turns out customers in a high end community get really aggressive when they are without coffee for an extended period of time. My biggest complaint boils down to the upper management just not caring about the little guys. The district managers were constantly harassing the employees during peak hours about pointless issues that compltely destroyed all forms of productivity. The hue of someones shirt was slightly off white, well we better send them home during the nine o'clock rush. That being said, as a full time employee, I enjoyed a wide variety of benefits. Including gratuity stocks, dental and health, eduction reimbursement, and others. Most managers I encountered were also incredibly understanding of school schedules making the company great for part time employees attending high school and post secondary."
good,"Great job while your getting through school. Management can be inconsistant and overall standards have gone down over the last several years. The dental, health and vision insurance is great and now they pay for your ASU education"
good,"A typical day at Starbucks consists of a great amount of multi-tasking. Taking orders while cleaning and stocking store. My co-workers all work together to make things work, although one of the hardest parts to deal with is when many co-workers stop working when business is slow and I remain on the floor continuing to work. One thing I do enjoy is the feeling of accomplishment when I have finished many task . I have learned how to  serve many different kinds of people and find exactly what they need."
good,"-Work hard in fast paced environment but free coffee. Early mornings and late nights in the same week on a regular basis"
good,"Working for Starbucks comes with a lot of perks, such as amazing health benefits, 401K, stock options, scholarships, and a long list of other perks. There are many, many different positions within the company and it can take you around the world, on someone else's dime ;) I've enjoyed my time with Starbucks, the free daily coffees helped, but I need to branch out, leave the Siren behind, and see what else life has to offer... and start paying for coffee again."
good,"Engaging customers and surpassing their needs, Taking orders and ringing up sales, Preparing and servings coffee and other drinks, Developing barista skills and helping train new hires, Maintaining the store environment and equipment, Re-stocking inventory and communicating store needs, Ensuring food safety standards are met and recommending product and process improvements within work environment and to customers."
good,"getting to know each and every customer on a one on one basis. I have learned how to deal, understand and problem solve within different situations. Management could have been a little more understanding and supportive of their employees. Made a lot of friends with my co-workers not every day was a rainbow. The hardest part for me was not having steady hours or should i say not knowing what your hours would be until it was too late. My customers such loving people and friendly as well."
good,Ive worked for the is company for 5 years and I will say when i first started I was so great full to have an job that overworked myself to do well with this position. In response I was met with shady management and lied to consistently about abilities to move up in the company. My coworkers and I were always close and the relied on me heavily because I was amazing at my job. I met really great customers and made lots of new friends.
good,I had the worst experience with working at Starbucks for work experience. Our role was to serve customers and take orders.However the new manager came in and ordered me to clean the toilets and he was constantly asking me to take over the jobs which the other people were meant to do. He took advantage of the group of people whom came for work experience and took us for free manual labor.
good,"Starbucks is always going to be a fast-paced and high demanding work environment. One should not think that working at Starbucks will be fun because he or she likes coffee. There are several responsibilities as a Barista at Starbucks, and one mistake can affect every coworker during the shift. Customers are very demanding and entitled, so being able to handle criticism and rudeness is a must. "
good,"At work I either work at the cash till or on the bar making drinks. I learned how to multitask a lot at Starbucks, as it gets very busy. My coworkers are very nice. The hardest part of the job was learning all the different codes for beverages and the best part is all the wonderful regulars that come in."
good,Lots of opportunities to create new challenges. Great mix of people on every team.
good,I enjoyed working for this company so much! Learned so many different things and always had new beverages to learn to make. Always met new people everyday. Never NOT busy! Time flew by everyday of work.
good,"Most people who work as baristas are good people. There is definitely a cutoff between wage employees and managers. Shift supervisors and baristas look out for each other, and assistant managers and managers look out for the company. Seems obvious but it is a dramatic split."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks starts off early in the morning and you don't stop moving until it's time to go home. I learned how behave in a fast paced environment, work on a team and the value of a diligent day of work. I loved all of my coworkers and everyone got along very well."
good,"Worked barista shift. Enjoyed making coffee and serving. "
good,Great starter job but lack of opporunity for growth. I had fun.
good,Starbucks  is a fantastic company to work for just not the stores in this market. The Management at some stores is entry level and often the Baristas know more than the store managers.
good,"Weekly markout of tea  or coffee product."
good,The only resaon for leaving the job was no growth opportunities and stagnancy injob profile.
good,The location that i currently work at is always busy and thats great i know plenty of the customers b name i know exactly what they want before they order it
good,"good benefits, but hard on scheduling. excellent benefits"
good,"I had been unemployed for nearly 2 years when I was hired at Starbucks. It was a great place to get my confidence up and there is room for advancement. I have learned how to coach new partners in everything from keeping up beverage routines to daily tasks. The hardest part of the job would be the rushes that come and go as they please, but after that's over, it's clear sailing. However, I'm now looking to further progress my skills in different ventures."
good,great place to work for and good benefits. they offered tuition reimbursements for college students
good,Maintain beverage quality and cleanliness at peak times. Constant interaction with partners and customers.
good,The job consisted of making drink and keeping the work area clean.  Often working shifts alone.  Dealing with customers and closing the shop.
good,"A job at Starbucks really differs store by store. I worked at three separate ones and had a different experience at each one. Co-workers were usually fun to work with and communicated with each other well. Management was good and bad. Sometimes felt as though the Manager was more concerned about how they looked to their boss rather than their employees and the impression they gave off to them and the public. "
good,I learned how to be a positive asset to the company by being a diligent worker. The hardest part of the job is not having a supportive manager when you are trying to move up in the company. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with people in a fun environment.
good,"First I make sure I am dressed in proper work attire and ready to work, then I clock in exactly at the time I am scheduled to work. I check the productivity of the earlier shift to see if I would need to make adjustments (send barista home/ call barista in). Now I make sure all stations are properly stocked and cleaned, and then see who needs a break. The next thing I go is start pre-closing task (Back ups for tomorrow, trash, floors etc.). Now I just handle all customers needs and connect with them until it is time to close.at closing time I delegate task to my baristas so all closing task are taken care of. I now count tills, safe, and Mark outs (expired goods) set the alarm and lock up"
good,"you take orders make drinks, you learn everything about coffee really fun place to work. Great coworkers. I love being able to connect with the costumers and also having a good relationship with my coworkers."
good,"People do not think of it as a career, therefore you see a lot of people come and go, and the environment isn't always the most professional. You must be a fast learner, and have to be on your toes constantly. "
good,"management ruins everything! make sure to pick a store that seems to have a great system. My store is all over the place and makes it very hard to do anything, even sleep."
good,"Great place to work while in school. Provides all hands on training and expectations. Hard to apply techniques into other fields, although management skills are applicable throughout lifetime."
good,"The location I work at is very busy throughout most of the morning and early afternoon, so its crucial to be prepared for the day. The customers are great, we know most of them since they come in every morning. When I was first hired I realized that a lot more goes into a typical shift than just brewing coffee. But my co- workers and manager were all quite welcoming and helpful. The hardest part of the job is honestly trying not to drink too much caffeine. I thoroughly enjoy getting to know everyone, customers and co-workers. Its nice to be able to build up a professional relationship with all involved."
good,"Very labor intensive job, great way to meet new people, great co-workers very understanding and helpful to others. "
good,"Worked evening shifts at the Vancouver airport. Learning curve was slow since some people don't like to train the new employees but once I had a grasp of the system it was productive and fun to work. "
good,Made custom drinks for guests and ensured great customer service.  Learned how to work in a fast pace environment. 
good,"co-workers are great, can be hectic at times but overall fun college job"
good,"I've worked at Starbucks for over five years, and it is a constantly changing work environment. Employees must always be adaptable and able to multitask. It's definitely a much tougher job than most people realize, but you form a bond with your coworkers that I haven't seen at any other job. The best part of working at Starbucks is knowing that you've made someone's day; remembering their drink before they even order it, or adding a personal touch to make their drink theirs. It makes it worth it."
good,Working with the public is always fun. There is sense of family behind bar that is wonderful. Upper management was almost non-existant. Trying to contact upper management was nearly impossible.
good,Management was relatively understanding
good,Good environment far as location but bad management team and no good works hours.
good,"If you are just out of college or entering the workforce, it may be worth your while. Coffee perks are nice."
good,very fast paced work environment
good,"It is a great work place to meet great employees. You'll have a love for coffee and tea as you grow. The management sure has changed a lot over the years and are being more strict on things. Though they offer the best benefits, the treatment of employees in my opinion just isn't that great. What I loved most was working with my team and making coffee. The toughest, to be honest was dealing with customers who just have to give a hard time."
good,Great company with a solid moral compass and passionate about coffee and serving customers. To many aquasitions to on board at the same time with out the proper resources. Work life balance is hard to strike. Great place to gain experience but you'll get burned out.
good,"Working at starbucks has been great. I have learned a lot there in my two and a half years. The co-workers at starbucks are always nice and helpful. The hardest part of the job is durning busy times keeping things stocked and the lobby looking nice, people tend to toss garbage on the floor and make a bit of a mess"
good,"The company has good core values, but they do not translate into actual day to day. District managers need to be more involved, and know what is actually happening in their stores."
good,"Fast Paced Environment, Good team, Developing people is a must, Regular Customers are the best thing that a Starbucks could have."
good,"Sbux is a great place to work part time. The atmosphere is upbeat, the customers are virtually all happy to see you in the morning."
good,"Ein abwechslungsreicher, interessanter Job, an dem man mit den unterschiedlichsten Kulturen zusammenkommt."
good,I worked for Starbucks between 2006 and 2007. I learned a lot about life working and paying bills. The problem was that our manager was inept. He was a bad leader and not very clear on too many occasions.
good,"My store was a drive-through and lobby store, very busy. Making a drink fast was more important than making it right."
good,"Making handcrafted drinks, interacting with customers, making a difference in someones day is a typical work day at Starbucks. Most enjoyable part of the day is meeting the different people that come through the Starbucks doors and seeing the familiar faces that come to you time and time again."
good,Starbucks corporation is a friendly workplace but very high volume and strenuous.. They offer great benefits and is partnered with a number of different companies that offer discounts to help you stretch every penny.
good,"It was a good company to work for. I liked it but you have to work weekends , holidays and late nights. I was willing to do it and still am but sometimes I think it would be nice not having to."
good,"A Nice team. Flexible working hours, which was great for a part time role. Easy work life balance. Early starts. No experience working there full time."
good,A good place to work overall for teenagers and terrific benefits however becomes an untenable situation for an adult trying to pay rent and survive with current wages. Often difficult to balance with school.
good,"Great people to work with, regular customers really make the job worth while. Free coffee, a pound of coffee a week to take home, decent breaks. Poor inventory management at times, some weeks you open, some weeks you close. It's not always consistent. Management could use more interpersonal communications training. Pay raises were few and far between, and constant change in regional management staffing lead to a shift in employee priority."
good,"If you are a student, Starbucks is a wonderful place to work! Unless you rise up in the company, shift supervisor, assistant manager, store manager or above, it is difficult to rely on Starbucks alone to pay your bills and live comfortably. Hours are constantly being cut and corporate is always demanding more; it becomes very tiring being used and abused by customers and corporate."
good,Being a manager had no support when needed they just care about targets. requested help but never happened requested time off never happened they just didn't want to know
good,I enjoyed the 7 months I worked at Starbucks. Left due to taking a full-time position in another city. My store and district manager were fantastic and very understanding. I wish the pay was more because open-noon was a grind and SO many customers came through the inside and our drive-thru as I worked the busiest location in our district. Starbucks has a lot of great perks and 9/10 your coworkers are really cool people that you may not be friends with outside of a work environment like that.
good,"I am not sure if the hierarchy was ever changed the way they think or changed the way they assess workers, but when I was working at my location it was not good. There was a lot of disdain of my gender and age. The regional manager also went on a war path firing anyone of African decent from any store in his area. Many of the supervisors at the store I worked at liked me on the register, cleaning, prep, and restocking. However there were the few who would place me in locations where I was not the strongest but still tried my best."
good,"They don't care about my mental health at all. The pay is terrible with how much verbal abuse I get from customers on a daily basis. At this Starbucks specifically my manager has favorites, I got written up for being 20 minutes late but others can show up 2 hours late and not get as much as a pat on the shoulder."
good,"If you can handle the never ending expectations and changing priorities, than you can really make this company work for you. There are a lot of benefits."
good,"Everyone has a different experience based on the location of the store you work for . Great benefits , work flexible hours, and can be a great part time job for students ."
good,"the company as a whole is great and connection driven, lunches and break are given, free coffee is always a plus! the regulars at each store make the tough days worth while."
good,"A fun job depends on who you work with and if everyone is down to earth and willing to be a team. THE BAD, TOO MANY CHIEFS NOT ENOUGH INDIANS. Everyone who works here wants to be the boss of a situation"
good,"A typical day at Starbucks is pretty draining. When you know what tasks have to be done at a certain time you can easily get frustrated when you have newer people working who don't put the effort in to ensure tasks are complete. On top of that, Starbucks for some reason wants all their stores to eventually cut back on their labor and pay their baristas minimum wage to act like everything is alright and that you can do things left and right with no ease. Don't get me wrong, that's what you expect when you work in customer service, the bad thing is eventually you realize all the effort you put in the job is not worth it. Great company, taught me a lot but the main thing it taught me was to know your worth."
good,I learned many things as it was my first job learning experience. Handling multiple tasks all while striving to give excellent customer service. I accumulated great communication skills and time management.
good,starbucks was a good first job. you learn quick and you have people that are there for you to help. but don't get so comfortable with the people you work with. drama happens fast and then the place becomes negative
good,Definitely a fast paced environment with no shortage of stress but definitely a fun experience with some pretty decent benefits like their College Achievement Plan.
good,"Bien que les équipes de travail soient soudées et agréables, j’ai peu apprécié la surveillance constante des employés (caméras etc), le fait qu’on fasse des shifts de 5h sans même avoir 5 minutes de pause, la relation « amicale » entre managers et employés qui donne parfois lieu à du chantage affectif."
good,"une bonne entreprise dans son ensemble, mais qui doit revoir ces critères pour une évolution en interne."
good,Starbucks have a good career advancement if you work accordingly. regarding work culture it depend on the store you go. some good and some bad. strong mental is needed as you need to handle ridiculous customer sometime
good,Make sure to have excellent customer service skills! that's number one in Starbucks. Be face-paced and make sure you know how to cope with a hectic atmosphere.
good,"Ich habe an ein paar der stressigsten Locations gearbeitet, z.B. am Hauptbahnhof, Flughafen und in der Innenstadt bei den Haupteinkaufsstraßen. Dabei war immer viel los, manchmal konnte ich von der Maschine bis zur Pause nicht loskommen und musste im gefühlten Sekundentakt Getränke raushauen. Das war am Anfang auch ganz spaßig immer so viel um die Ohren zu haben. Ob es nun an der Kasse, an der Heiß- oder Kaltgetränke Station, beim Floaten, oder in der Backoffice, es gab eigentlich immer was zu tun und man hatte oft verkrampfte Finger nachdem man Stunden lang die selbe Bewegung immer und immer wieder gemacht hat. Die meisten von uns bekamen irgendwann bestehende Rückenschmerzen, wobei die Inventur alleine hin und her durchs Gebäude und Treppen rauf und runter zu schleppen auch nicht gerade geholfen haben. Das Putzen vor und nach der Öffnung des Stores wurden auch von uns übernommen und die aggressiven Putzmittel führten bei uns allem immer zu trockenen, gereizten Händen was auf Dauer und besonders im Winter schnell zum Problem werden konnte. "
good,"If you like to have your nails done, this isn’t the ideal job. Unless your boss is lenient. If you have problems with your wrist, making cold drinks in a fast pace environment, will leave you going home injured. It pays great if you get hours, and when you put in energy you get a good reply. Customers can be a bit shrewd, but pay them no mind"
good,"Loved the job, got very close with most co-workers, had a couple of shifts make other people's lives miserable to entertain themselves and would purposefully seek out to make them cry. The Company in itself is great to work for and not every store has a toxic work environment. Don't stay in a job that makes you fear to see your coworkers"
good,"- Placed in position of shift's choosing, expected to perform tasks to high standard of customer service execution. "
good,"I learn a lot of every day dealing with customers its something you get used to its fun but can be very demanding management could be such a bummer to be around sometimes but with the right leadership, things could be good."
good,I feel that starbucks is all inclusive but be careful about voicing concerns. The job is very rewarding but also very demanding and can be physically and mentally draining. Expect to learn things very quickly and to be overwhelmed at first.
good,"The ability to transfer to any Starbucks location is nice. Benefits are nice, however the pay is quite low even if you move up in the company. Good job for someone in school."
good,"It’s almost worth it for the health care alone but there job can be stressful and the customers difficult to handle. If you love coffee, the culture can be rewarding. Pay should be better though."
good,"I really enjoy working as a barista but it seems as if the company cares about everything accept for its own people, if I were paid for how hard I work I would definitely stay, but this company is over working baristas for little to no reward. Starbucks prides itself on being “different than other huge corporations” then be that leader in the huge corporations and pay your baristas a living wage."
good,Challenging and satisfying work overall.  The team work is generally great.  The management definitely has a huge impact on the quality of the  work environment.
good,customers are so shady and weird so watch out if you close by yourself at night. coworkers leave you to fend for yourself basically. had to learn everything by myself.
good,This company is extremely fast paced. The management and actions of employees within my store had various problems that did not want to be addressed by the manager causing the workplace to become difficult. The customers are what created the great atmosphere within the store. My three years with the company were great overall and i am glad i was able to help lead a team.
good,Everyday presents a new and challenging experience and for that reason all of the employees are very close. This creates a positive work environment for all.
good,A typical work day at Starbucks is usually stressful. The company has such high demands and expectations for the positions and people end up doing way more than what they're paid to do.
good,"depends which starbucks you work at, could be a hit or miss for some people. I unfortunately did not have the best experience. I've dealt with the worst customers there, be prepared for that."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Starbucks, the labor they give out can usually be pretty low and then you end up working 5x as hard to fill in the positions they don't deem needed. The managers don't help that much, most of them aren't really set out the job. If you're trying to move up, expect to jump through hoops for a long time because it's never actually good enough."
good,"Not for people who are slow workers and/or sensitive to difficult customers. Must maintain sharp cash handling skills, as well as good memory to execute a wide array of drinks and/or food combinations/"
good,"The location I worked at was one of the busiest in Vancouver. Staff were overworked and underpaid, but I did have the opportunity to work with some of the most hardworking people I've ever met."
good,"Honestly I really loved Starbucks but my location was bad. It was all about favoritism, gossip, and drama. They didn’t treat me fair and wouldn’t let me transfer... I feel like if I would’ve been at a different location I would’ve loved it... there’s good benefits, free coffee and one free food item during you shift, and discounted food when you’re not working, at any store. I was extremely disappointed and heartbroken because I really wanted to stay at this job long term"
good,Starbucks is a great company that provides all the benefits. Experience is different depending on the store and management your under. I have only had bad experiences but heard of good. Lots of hard work that doesn't match pay.
good,"This company provides a lot of room for flexibility, however, it could offer more room for advancement for its employees. The hours as well could be improved. The benefits are nice, including payment plans for college as well as health, dental and other medical benefits."
good,Great job for college students. Worked well with my school schedule. Looking for something that pays a bit more and is more professional. It starts to feel like a fast food job after a while.
good,"One's experience with Starbucks varies significantly by location. In a smaller store like mine, the stress is relatively lower, thus making more room for personal connections with customers and coworkers. Those connections to me are very rewarding, and sometimes makes it easy to overlook the aspects of the job I find particularly difficult to keep up with. Even in a smaller store there's a lot of pressure to perform a number of complicated processes all at once and as quickly as possible, and that's the main challenge for me."
good,Starbucks is a customer friendly enviromenent. I feel like they need more work on employee happiness and managemanet skills.Works well with scheduling
good,"Its busy nonstop and customers are difficult most of the time so you have to learn how to multitask. moving up in the company is very hard unless you are your managers favorite. The work environment can be catty depending on who you are working with and it can also be very calm and welcoming depending on who you are working with. It's a fun job, but over the years it gets draining."
good,It was a great place to work as a student.  The big downside in my case was management.  It has always been a bit messy from the district manager to the many stand in and official store managers we have had in just 4 years.
good,"very faced paced as a shift supervisor. A lot of responsibility and duties are put on you if you are a shift supervisor. Pay is above minimum wage and their are opportunities to move up. Benefits are nice. partner discount, tuition reimbursement, benefits plan, etc."
good,"I enjoyed working with this company and think they have a lot to other etc. benefits and customer connections. I worked at a high volume mall store so it was extremely busy and often times tiring and stressful. It was tough to make connections with people because of how many 'drinks had to be made' to get the line down. It was an interesting experience, if I ever went back to working at a Starbucks it would be a less busy store where I could have more down time."
good,they dont pay enough for the amount of work you need to do. Cleaning mats was the worst and would be so hard and draining that i couldnt do anything before or after my shifts
good,"Lots of tools to help you be the best at your job."
good,Had fun working here. Its flexible and easy to learn. The staff is friendly and the drinks have a discount. I dont like the music selection though. It was dull.
good,"Days are repetitive and routine after the first couple of months. It's a lot to learn right away but definitely doable. the workplace culture is nice, I have gotten very close to my team and have made some really good friends. The hardest part of the job is getting hours."
good,Enjoyed working with the employees. They make you feel welcomed and gave good advice when I got hired. Got to get to know some of the regular customers.
good,"Working for Starbucks can either be great, or absolutely terrible  it all depends on the people you work with and management. If the people you are working with actually care about their job and management isn't drunk on power with delusions of grandeur then it'll be great. On the other hand, terrible management and apathetic co-workers can make it a total slog. Overall it's a grat first job, but not much else."
good,"Starbucks has great benefits. As far as the management and job, it really depends on what store you are at. Some stores are amazing and people love working there and other stores are horrible to work at."
good,The hardest part of the job has been employee cut backs. There would be nights where two people were doing the job that three people were accustomed to doing.
good,Fast-paced environment. Very poor management. You will be overworked and under paid. They are all about making great moments with the customers but then disregard their employees. The company does provide great benefits but it is not a fun job unless you are one of the lucky ones who has a great manager.
good,Hard to move up depending on how hard youre willing to work. Cant really have a family life. it was fast paced and hard at time. the system is constantly changing and that can be hard for some. Great connection with people.
good,this is not a regular minimum wage job. You need to be able to work well with others and stay calm if rough situations. Its important to know that not to take anything personally that happens at work.
good,it was a great experience working at Starbucks. I worked there for three years and enjoyed it very much. working with coffee and customers is great. Starbucks has good benefits for employees.
good,This is a great place to work if you want flexible hours and a fun environment. It can be stressful at times but the team is supportive and growth-minded.
good,"working at Starbucks is a pretty meh experience,  if you don't enjoy the employees you won't enjoy the work. The work itself is simple and can be enjoyable."
good,"•	Managing Profit & Loss growth factors while minimizing overall Cost Of Goods Sold and food wastage "
good,"Making coffee is really fun and Starbucks offers great benefits to employees, including one free meal a day and free drinks. It is nice to work in a team environment."
good,"This job was stressful and the management made it more stressful by not diffusing stressful situations. Other than that the job was fun, and I enjoyed trying new drinks and learning about coffee."
good,"If you want to learn more about coffee culture, their programs can aid in your experience. The company has a great starting wage. The management system helps to reduce stress on all levels of employment. Very fast turn-over rate."
good,"It's hectic usually, but as a starter/secondary job it's flexible for college students. The managers can be a little strict depending on where you are but the learning curve helps you adapt to change so."
good,"Flexibke work schedule"
good,Great thoughts environmentally within the company as a whole. These options of practice vary from store to store. I experienced a whole new outlook on overall practices when transferring and feel as though the Washington store could be doing more to lessen their impact on the environment exteriorally.
good,Great working at starbucks. I just feel i have had enough of it. but the environment is thriving and challenging which makes the staff on their toes. Full of customer interactions.
good,"I enjoy interacting with customers, although we do get  our fair share of rude folks. That's with any customer service job though. For the most part, meeting new people and getting to know them is the cool part. Also some coworkers are easier to work with than others. And if you work at a locations where your personalities clash, you will not enjoy working for Starbucks. Every location has its own method of doing things, although Starbucks has established routines to follow. The pay is decent but you don't get enough hours to make this your only job. And the company expects too much of us when it comes to closing shifts. Their priority to to save money and not provide an extra employee, which is great for them but terrible for us who are left with the stress of closing. Yet we always stay positive and do our best."
good,I absolutely loved my team and making meaningful connections with our customers. I learned a lot about the ins & outs of running a fast-paced environment in the most efficient ways.
good,"At Starbucks you will most likely find a good, diverse and hard working group of people. A typical work day includes making drinks, cleaning the items you used and the items around the bar to keep them sanitized and your work area clean. I learned a lot about working with customers and a lot about myself working here and is a good job to start working."
good,"If you are able to turn off the higher functions of your brain and work harder than you may have thought possible, you may make it past the one year mark. Customers will routinely yell at you and excuses are neither offered or accepted for any slight inconvenience. That being said, not unlike being on the frontlines of a war, you will fight not for the company, but for the barista working next to you."
good,Working as Starbucks was fun a rewarding. If you’re looking for a simple minimalist wage job Starbucks is the place. I learned a lot from my customer service experience at Starbucks.
good,"Working at Starbucks has taught me a lot including dealing with customers and working in an extremely pressured and fast paced environment, handling two or three tasks at once minimum and also cleaning up after myself."
good,The benefits at this job are amazing. But the hourly pay wage is not enough and it is nearly impossible to get a raise. The goals that are set by upper management seem impossible sometimes but it is a company with good moral standing.
good,"I have formed great bonds with regular customers who come in and converse with me. It also feels great to watch people leave with smiles on their faces just because of a simple hello. Loved forming a connection within my community. I have built friendships within the workplace as well. Loved how busy it is during rush hour and how relaxed it is towards the end of the day. However, the store has poor management."
good,"Starbucks is a mixed bag. If you're in a crowded location, it can be a total nightmare trying to get what you need to get done for the day. If you're in a less populated area, it's a total breeze, and even can be fun. "
good,Hours are strange and not given enough but not too stressful. Tiny locations are hard to work with a rush but do-able. The locations were always close to home.
good,"Overall liked working here. It was a licensed location. Most of the regular customers were very nice, but any coffee shop comes with rude customers. The store manager was awesome but the ladies in the office upstairs who worked for the catering company (and helped to run the store) were very rude and liked to come downstairs to “help” (got in the way and didn’t know how to make most drinks). They also would watch the cameras and text us to clean things if they saw we were slow, or would tell us to get off our phones and do something. The communication among convention center employees was terrible. Conventions were very busy and stressful but the tips were usually great. The dance competitions and religious conferences do not tip well at all. They were very lax about us making ourselves drinks and eating pastries which was nice. Downside: all employees of the convention center get parking passes paid for in the garage right across the street, except for the baristas who either had to park 10 minutes away at the IRS and get harassed on the streets of Covington on the way to work, or pay $6 a day to park in the garage. Upstairs office “managers” were also very old-fashioned and discriminated against one girl who worked there because she didn’t wear a bra- they couldn’t really say anything but would nitpick at other “dress code issues” dancing around it just because they didn’t like it"
good,The customers really distinguish the work environment. Usually coworkers are very friendly and management is pretty sweet. Hours are not consistent and you may get moved around a few times to different locations.
good,"The job was overall good for working my way through school. I would not have worked here for any longer than the 2 years I did, though. Advancement opportunities are over-hyped."
good,"Working here is ok. Nice people and easy work but can be tiresome at sometimes and rules are taken very seriously. However, they help you in anyway they can."
good,"A good place to work if you are studying. It was my first job and I met dear friends who shared the same dream as I and of course, the passion for coffee."
good,"I was with Starbucks for over 5 years. While I loved and still do love the company for what they stand for I do not think they live up to their mission and values, which is disappointing. When I first started there I was a barista and easily became a trainer. Around 5-6 months I got promoted to a shift supervisor but was not given any of the training necessary to succeed in my day to day tasks. Between having 10 different managers and not given any clear direction it took me another 4 years to become an assistant manager. Once I became one I am not sure if the training I got as correct because the manager training me became very absent and was having me do all the work. I was told on multiple occasions that I would not get far and that really hurts."
good,"My typical day at work begins during peak, Im really fast on bar so they keep the same people posted there. We only have four supervisors shifts, and have not hired more since we can't seem to have real manager stay at our store for more than two months, we have been through five managers in the past year. The workplace can be fun if you make it fun. The hardest part is not being able to connect with customers because we are constantly busy and it always feels as if i was in a race against time. The most enjoyable part is seeing my friends and always making jokes, singing and dancing as we go through out peak of the day."
good,"They offer flexible hours with amazing discounts and benefits (even for part-time employees). Some locations are busier than others, so not all the stores are horrible. Some managers are shady, but, again, that depends on the store - plus, you can ask for a transfer after 6 months."
good,Pay is very poor and benefits package does not compensate well. Moving up is very possible but please be prepared to spend years living in poverty working for peanuts. management earns 50k per year while WAWA managers can earn up to 100k per year
good,i liked making connection with everyone who came in respectfully. you made fiends. got free coffee and training to help you get better. opportunities to move up in the company
good,"I enjoyed working for Starbucks and really enjoyed my coworkers - I did not, however, enjoy working for my particular manager. The benefits were adequate, however there was no response to my desire to more up when I was over-qualified to begin with and deserved more responsibility and compensation."
good,"At the last store I was at, unfortunately had poor management and was terribly organized but the company overall is a good one to work for with right team"
good,She came from a different state and just started changing things it was bad and made no sense at all she’s not approachable and keeps cutting people hours left and right like we don’t have to proved fit our self or family
good,"The Brand is good. Conducts continuous training and skills performance."
good,Working at Starbucks always keeps you busy. There is always something to do for you to keep busy. The hardest part of the job is trying to maintain store cleanliness while keeping the store running smooth during peak hours.
good,My response is not accurate because I don’t work for Starbucks I work for Kroger which is a massive difference. If you want to work at a Starbucks do not go work at one through Kroger.
good,"It’s been a fun ride but it’s time for a change in scenery, i learned a lot and improved a lot of my own skills. They worked with my school"
good,"My shift would change by the week so my shifts would change back and forth between 11am, 4pm, and 5am. The environment was very friendly  and I really found a place to settle for a bit and grow. The hardest part of the job would probably be cleaning under neath the fridges. The. most enjoyable part was the interactions I had and the connections I made with people."
good,"The people you work with make all the difference. I had a team of very gifted individuals that made coming to work every day something fun and interesting. The benefits are amazing ie,stock program, insurance,time off... The only down side is that it is a food service job that is managed like a retail store."
good,"Stressful, but fulfilling to those who can handle the stress. Tons of discounts and benefits. They mostly work with your schedule. The hardest part of the job is training, patience is everything!"
good,"Very fast paced with loads of customers. Very customer friendly and a very social setting. Lots of room to be creative and create relationships with coworkers, as well as customers."
good,"You have to work quickly and withstand a lot of customer abuse. Management is really hit or miss - mostly tending toward the ""too exhausted/depressed to care"". The amount of work you have to do is usually beyond what is possible, and is interdependent with your coworkers. That adds into stress as each coworker tries to micromanage each other in the false belief that if the other person managed to go just a little faster than everything would be okay. It won't, because there is, by design, an unending number of tasks. Tasks at the bottom of the list of priorities (due to not having a living being demanding it be done immediately) include deep cleaning. That leads to these tasks becoming more difficult in time. Anyway, plus side is lots of hours (until you snap or reach 39.5 hours for the week), and you will be too busy to think about how little you are paid."
good,"It changes from store to store, but I work at a store that has an excellent workplace culture; we all get along well and work as a cohesive unit. I also have an amazing store manager who cares and helps us grow as employees, and coaches us so we are always improving our skills. "
good,Not that good salary range but benefits were terrific. Management was cool and appoachable but team rapport was bad. I enjoyed serving customers and doing my job.
good,"It was okay. Normal days are fine, happy hours suck. Benefits were the best part of the job and made a lot of stuff worth while. If you are looking for advancement, don't expect it to happen quickly."
good,"Like any retail or fast food store, Starbucks is a great place to work if you find the right Starbucks. If you are on time, and you come to work, you'll never worry about getting laid off or fired. Investment in the company is also very easy. One drawback is a Starbucks that is five minutes away from your store will get paid 17 dollars an hour while you get paid 11 dollars an hour, so do your research. an hour, so do your research on the different wages."
good,"Working at Starbucks had great perks, and I learned a lot there. However, it was not exactly as I had envisioned it, I did not get along well with my manager, and therefore I was happy to leave the job. If things had been different I think that I would have enjoyed the job more."
good,This is a good part time job but it does need flexibility to fit in. Development in career varies based on areas/stores you are at. You work with baristas with different cultures.
good,"management could be better, definitely a corporate company that changes constantly and expects the change to be fluid across all companies but makes it hard for employees to adjust."
good,Worked this job for many years. Fast paced and time goes by quickly. There is a lot of busy work and cleaning on top of taking care of the customers. Hours worked around school and family for the most part. Hard to get enough hours to qualify for benefits.
good,I found the management rude and didn't care for there staff. Managers were never punished for there actions and were aloud to bully the staff. I did meet tons of amazing people with the job but for the amount i made it wasn't worth what we put up with.
good,"I enjoyed working for Starbucks as a company; however, the Timmins, Ontario, location is poorly managed. My fellow coworkers would call in sick repeatedly and received little to no disciplinary action, which created a vicious cycle."
good,"I had a positive experience working for starbucks. Overall, my coworkers were supportive and welcoming as were my"
good,"Working there was a great experience, I felt that our crew was a family. Management was always helpful and was always understanding. I would highly recommend to everyone to work there."
good,It was fun being a barista but some not all of the customers were aholes I blame Starbucks culture. Just have the 'yes' attitude everyday and you'll be fine.
good,"too many DM have been in there position for 10 years or more, therefore, the SM's below, have very little opportunity to advance within the area they live in"
good,Management could be better. Very busy location. Don't get any hours. A plus is you get benefits and can work at other locations. Mornings are better than the evenings.
good,"Absolutely every location is going to be different. Stores varied wildly within my town, and mine was pretty good. Our AC was busted which lead to people passing out from heat exhaustion in drive thru, but beyond that and usual fast food manager guffaws, there wasn't anything heinous to talk about."
good,This was a decent place until the new manager showed up. I loved this place but she wasn't understanding that I have a child unlike the manager that hired me on.
good,I have had a mixed experience at Starbucks. It completely depends on the Store Manager. Some will give more thought to work/life balance. I have a daughter and husband yet I was pressured to work outside the availability that was agreed upon.
good,Starbucks overall is a great company.  I loved the environment.  Testing out new drink recipes and then sampling them to customers was always a great time.  Helping customers choose the right drink and seeing them taste and enjoy the drink was one of my favorite parts of the work day.  The only negative experience I had was with the management of the location I worked for.
good,"The majority of the staff is pleasant to work with. However, if anyone one calls out or there is a issue with the schedule it can turn the entire day into an awful shift. To be honest it's not worth the effort."
good,"It's a fine place to work for younger people. The hourly pay wont cover all your bills. Its a good job to have if you're currently going to school or need a flexible schedule. I loved my store manager but the upper management are demeaning and unreasonable, they only bother you if you take a position above barista though."
good,"Als Barista bei Starbucks ist man vor allem mit aufräumt und putzarbeitend beschäftigt, dass zubereiten von Drinks macht zwar Spass aber es ist nicht der Hauptteil vom Arbeitsalltag. Man steht unter konstantem Zeitdruck. Die Zusammenarbeit mit anderem Baristas macht aber meistens sehr viel Spass, ideal als Nebenjob. Nicht als Vollzeit Job zu empfehlen."
good,"Starbucks usually provides a fun upbeat environment in which to work, but sometimes it doesn't. Work can be very emotionally and physically straining. For instance, many baristas develop carpal tunnel later in life as a result of working for Starbucks for a couple years in their youth. While the company may offer promotion and career development opportunities, they put even more of a strain on your life than being a regular employee. In my experience, the time, energy, and strain of being a supervisor were not worth working compared to being a regular barista. The benefits are good, especially for part-time employees. Overall, Starbucks is not a bad company to work for; just be prepared to work very hard."
good,"learned how to deal with people, from a nice normal customer to a difficult customer. Also how to deal with coworker and meet management expectations."
good,"There was always something to do and if you stopped for a second someone would yell at you. Constantly behind, overworked, and understaffed. Horrible management overall"
good,Very quick paced especially in the mornings. Sometimes very stressful due to the lack of labor hours given per day so there aren't enough people working a lot of the time.
good,"Honestly it all depends on which store you work at & the Management there, because you can have the Most Fun at a Certain Store & then go to another store & it’ll be very Strict & very unpleasant."
good,"A lot is asked of you at times and for a low compensation compared to what it does to your mental health over time. A good job if you have a goal with the company (college program, cheap health insurance, etc.) or if you are just starting out and want something on your resume that peaks others' employers interest. Hard to make it a long term job."
good,"Starbucks is a great job with great benefits! The learning process of learning everything can be a bit overwhelming but with great success it takes time to learn. Starbucks is great for being flexible with schedules and support you with outside curriculars. Get to know your manager and your baristas! If you are all about team work then I highly recommend this job for you! If you are not a fast learner, then I don't recommend it! Coffee does not have to be your passion in order for you to work at this job. The downside to this job is dealing with constant call outs and dealing with customers who don't treat you with respect. Shifts nor baristas get paid enough to deal with it."
good,I have learned to adapt into any situation. I have advanced my interpersonal skills as well as customer service. This position gave me a chance to use some of my potential to be more productive and valuable to this company. I must say working with Starbucks gave me a chance to grow and develop skills I can now use while pursuing my career!
good,"During the week it would become very busy and then very slow. I learned multitasking was a necessity. During the slow periods we would clean and prepare for rushes of customers. Mornings were the busiest, everyone wanted coffee before work or school. In my time there I went through three store managers. My first being my favourite, and unfortunately the others didn't follow suit. Starbucks has a very welcoming culture, I distinctly remember never feeling out of place. Fellow coworkers shared an interest in helping others succeed. The most difficult part of the job was managing stress during those rush periods. There were times we would be down a person and the ripples of that were felt all throughout the day. However, on the other side, time went by quickly. Working eight or ten hour shifts never felt like a slog."
good,"As a part time job this is a great place to work. Schedules can be very flexible and they are willing to work with school schedules. It has a relatively fun work environment, as the employees are generally younger and more laid-back. While there is plenty of room to work your way up, it seems that the management side of the company can be somewhat stressful. Its a great place to be an employee, but it definitely comes off as a job that you start off with then move on to other places."
good,I have really enjoyed working in the Nutgrove store. It is a very friendly place to work in with lovely staff and some of the best customers. The best part of the job is engaging with the customers. The hardest part of the job is progressing past supervisor
good,"I had a great time working at Starbucks when the team worked equally as hard. Some days I had a lot of responsibilities, which were made them more difficult than they should have been. On a great day, we all worked just as fast and had things prepared and ready to go. We had great conversation and connection with the customers and were able to communicate product information excellently. I learned how to move very quickly, stay friendly in a stressful environment, and prioritize drinks based on order/ fixing a mistake. The hardest part of the job was when I was overwhelmed with duties and other partners were not helping out/ could not help out. The best part of the job was meeting so many people and getting to make connections with them."
good,"I worked in a Starbucks that was in NSU. We never got any of the benefits that the usual corporate Starbucks would, but I heard that they offer nice benefits. The management wasn't too bad, they were overall pretty supportive but had some off days."
good,"its a very fast paced job, any position your put in. it’s a very accepting place i met a couple of good friends while i worked at starbucks. most of the time customers are very friendly. my personal favorite part of the job was working on bar and a lot of people bring dogs in the drive thru so if you like dogs that’s a bonus"
good,"With a large and changing menu, the tasks stay the same.  Starbucks is a great place to expand all skills with labor, customer service, and administrative."
good,"I did not work their when they offered tuition reimbursement.  It is a really great option for someone pursuing an online degree, however.  Learning how to deal with problematic customers is a valuable skill and is truthfully worth the stress."
good,"The only way to make a living wage for in store jobs is to be a store manager. Supervisors and baristas wages aren’t competitive with other companies that offer benefits as well. Nobody gets 40 hours a week except managers because they don’t want to risk putting you into over time pay if you’re asked to come in early or stay late if someone calls out. Customers can be a joy or awful and killing them with kindness is very important to do. If there are no customers throughout the day during slow times you’re excepted to clean and restock. Standing around is looked down upon. The company is very flexible with your availability and the job itself has taught me how to multi task, be organized, and deal with people. There is room for growth but it takes a while to work your way up."
good,"I enjoyed working with the employees I had worked with. The manager was very cool. The work was easy and fun to do, the learning was very easy as well. Overall, Starbucks is a fun place to work at."
good,"great place to work! fun atmosphere, great managers, great drinks. Got free drinks on the job so that was nice! Early shifts, so be prepared for those."
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work, but you need to have the right manager. Also whether you are at a café or drive-thru store is important. Drive-Thru stores are extremely busy, but you will have more partners working with you. At a café you will have fewer partners, but less traffic coming through your store. The manager makes a huge difference as well. I've had the pleasure of working under two great store managers, but I've also had a store manager that didn't know what they were doing. They really brought down the morale of the store and it's functionality. This manager would disregard what their partners would tell them. They would change things without telling their partners causing confusion during our peek hours of operation. I could go on, but I won't. "
good,"I have been working at Starbucks for 9 months now. And i have never worked in a more liberal and unsafe work environment. Their harassment policy is a joke. we are not allowed to defend ourselves against verbal assault and i have witnessed it first hand. My manager is an amazing boss, and my co-workers/superiors are the nicest people to get to know. But i would also love to work in an environment where my co-workers are not scared to take out the trash because there are heroin needles in the trash cans or scared to defend themselves when someone verbally attacks them with hurtful slurs are sexist remarks."
good,"Starbucks is a good starter job and they hire people quite frequently. However the job is a lot of work for the pay and some stores are downright awful in management."
good,The year and change I spent at starbucks had its ups and downs. Changes in management radically changed how we were treated (For the worse). The pay was adequate. I did meet some great people and became friends with many of my co workers.
good,"The job itself is a standard starbucks job and is enjoyable, however management was questionable. While my managers never directly disciplined me, I've witnessed other co workers receive questionable treatment for small offenses while other employees would get away with much larger offenses."
good,"Great place to communicate and meet new people. Clean safe and fun environment "
good,"Routines involve brewing coffee, creating beverages for customers, and working in a team environment to handle the everyday fast pace during peak business times."
good,I think it needs to pay more I worked in a grocery store and the pay was not enough for a single person raising a child but love my boss and the job itself and I feel  I was a fast barista and that all thank u.
good,"Manager expects our part time positions to be our career goals. Sort of accommodating to schedule, but will give grief.  Really engaged in your personal development, or at least she does a good job at feigning it. Coworkers are great."
good,"The salary could be better. You make 20 cents above minimum wage and they refuse to give you full time hours. The best part is being approved to work at other stores, the weekly tip out for gas and the markouts. The hardest part is district management's expectations that force store managers to forget the employees are important. Also some are very shady at scheduling, firing and writeups. solid job for a backup but definitely not long term."
good,The training program was excellent. The benefits are pretty fantastic. But the work itself was a little too structured. And the dress code is a bit much.
good,"I worked at Starbucks for two years. The benefits were very nice, but the amount of favoritism and two faced coworkers I had made it hard to want to stay"
good,"I love my coworkers but management is terrible. They only care about who kisses up the most. I've been at my store longer than anyone, very hard worker, always covering shifts, sometimes the only person on the floor and I never get any recognition and constantly passed over when I ask to move up. I've requested to be a trainer four times and twice applied to be a shift lead. Manager will tell me I'm a good fit, then never mention it again. The benefits are good (watch out for the loopholes) and easy to fit in school, life, etc. But the management cares nothing about employees."
good,"Worked early mornings, long hours, and management was suspect, calling me on vacation requiring me to come in because someone else called off. Benefits were okay, pay was decent for managers but not great for anyone else."
good,Appreciate the work and benefits but people get lazy and no action is taken. Management is disorganized but a fun environment. Not a serious job but the company does take care of you.
good,"Flexible hours, decent benefits. Barista Championships to showcase skills, or other programs to involve employees with each other like volunteer work."
good,"I made drinks for customers, learned to manage the cash system, the espresso machines and more. It was stressful keeping up with orders and the happy hour rush."
good,Starbucks is a fun company to work for. They have very good benifits and pay pretty well. They offer tuition reimbursement for school even if it’s not a course that benefits the company.
good,"Starbucks has a relatively flexible schedule to work with for students and provides good benefits. Can be stressful, requires more work than initially expected, but you make the most of your experience there with your team. "
good,Need to have a second job on top of this one to afford to live. A good starting job for those still living at home or a decent part time job for people with another income.
good,"Starbucks as a company is great, if you can find the right manager to work for. Don’t be afraid of transferring stores as needed! It helps you become a more valuable partner!"
good,I believed I learned lots from my time at Starbucks although I do believe that as a partner I should have been more appreciated for the work I did over the years.
good,"I really enjoyed the daily interactions with each employee and customer. Hardest part of the job was being talked down to, but my overall experience at Starbucks was not that bad!"
good,I would not recommend working here because the management was not understanding of my mental health issues and didn't seem to care as well as due to the fact I was harassed there.
good,"Can be an awesome place to work when everything is going well, if not, it can be a total disaster. Since it’s entirely staffed by students, often employees are only there for the money and don’t genuinely care about the store. Management is beyond amazing, shiftleads are iffy. Work hard and stay positive and it’s a great place to work!"
good,"After official store manager left things were not so bad but then that position had to be filled and for some time we had different managers    trying to fill in but then being switched in such a short time. That was very tough because everyone worked different. As a team we all came together but then we would have new manager come in making changes with little to no experience about specific functions. Those constant changes also created problems with scheduling. However, working at Starbucks was an amazing experience when looking at the services we provided and connections made with valued Starbucks lovers."
good,Overall it was great working as a barista but once you start to move up in the company you quickly realize there is a great deal more about labor hours and short staffing the stores even during busy times to make more profit. The culture side of the company is there but it also just depends on the management of each store. I worked at several different locations with very different management styles. Depending on where you land you could have a great teacher and coach who helps you grow in every way or you could have a dictator who gives you no reason to stick around.
good,it is fun but during the rush hour the pressure is on. Management expects you to work for the amount of 2 people and the pay is minimal. The benefits are great because you can get health benefits even if you are a part time employee.
good,The people I worked with were fun but it differs between stores. I got lucky with great customers and regulars. Management was okay... didn't have many problems except for some hiccups here and there
good,"I have been placed in an administrative role to help my peers to enhance the quality of our store. A typical day for me is delegating, handling cash and connecting with customers."
good,have to fight for hours even though they're flexible and not paid enough. if you need coverage good luck cause no one ever covers and you will have to go in sick countless times. if your call out you'll have to find you're own coverage too.
good,"There's always something to do, if you down time.  Usually, most stores stay consistently busy.  Depends on the store but management usually tries to work out your schedule with you.  The downside, the pay is laughable.  They say it's because of all the wonderful benefits we receive, but I have the cheapest coverage you can get (which doesn't cover jack), and it's still hurts every check.  I would much rather get paid a livable wage than have insurance that I can't even use without paying out the butt.  You will need to have a second job to make it."
good,"The management at this location was not the best . Very insensitive to others .The working environment is very fast pasted due to its location on 22.The work schedule was very flexible while I was a full-time college student. The benefits of Starbucks are the free drinks/food provided during a shift and the breaks given were either an hour or 30 minutes. Also partner's who work for Starbucks get to take home k-cups , tea , or grinned coffee once a week. Tips from this job we not always the best , the are split by the employees and the hours worked every week. Also employees get paid every 2 weeks."
good,"I worked here for years. I love the environment and making coffee is honestly super fun. I just wish Starbucks cared more about their customers and the connections that are made. They thrive on the idea that they have great customer service, but they are constantly pushing their standards towards situations where there’s less opportunity to connect."
good,"Being that face that makes customers and your every day life people more happy. Being there to see your regular customers and talking to them, it wasnt about the money (the way of life) it was about the people being there felt like they were my own family."
good,"Très belle entreprise mais certains gérants et directeurs sont racistes et sexistes , beaucoup se plaignaient de ne voir que des hommes monter les échelons et peu de personnes de minorité visibles (noirs , indiens, latinos ect ) et beaucoup d'employés portant des commentaires discriminatoires envers les minorités visibles, la direction étant au courant , aucunes mesures n'a été prise."
good,"There are several benefits to working with HMS host, £8.50 per hour, 60% off food, duty free staff sales etc... however the managment can be poor at times,not supportive of certain situations and may not always do things as promised."
good,"Job Culture is miasmic and affecting, but can be a really cool place to meet people. The job is very convenient if you're a student and offers great connectivity with other Starbucks partners (for if you need shifts covered.)"
good,it’s not for someone with a small amount of patience and coworkers are usually nice and loving that would provide a nice working environment. also be ready to be fast paced and not panic.
good,Not a bad company to work for i enjoyed my time there an average day concluded of serving coffee and i enjoyed interfacing with the customers and having meaningful interactions.
good,"Starbucks was a fun and easy place to work, The employees were young and mostly had a can do attitude. Those who really worked hard and put forth effort were promoted quickly and were valuable team members."
good,"The customer connections are definitely my favorite part of working at Starbucks. I also really enjoy the work itself (making specialty drinks.) However, at times the job can be stressful. During peak hours, we serve around 100 people in a half hour time period. Starbucks is really focused on drive-thru times, so we can feel rushed and overwhelmed. It also makes it harder to make a true customer connection when you're rushing. I was hired specifically for a new store. The manager for this store was also hired specifically for the new location. I don't know if he didn't get appropriate training, but it's two years later and all he knows how to do is run the drive-thru. He is a very nice, laid back guy and seems to actually care about us as people. The other managers, or shift supervisors, are all very hardworking people. They don't always get along among one another. Dress is business casual, but we are required to wear a hat and an apron. Benefits are really good. I don't utilize the healthcare aspect as I have healthcare through my husband, but I have heard from others that it's pretty decent, You do have to work an average of 20 hours a week in order to receive these. People are very rarely scheduled over 30 hours per week, and because of this combined with the hourly wage, Starbucks is not a place most people would be able to work at in order to make ends meat. We get 3 free drinks per shift and 1 free food item. We also receive a 30% discount when we come in on our off time, as well as on any retail items. We also receive one free bag of coffee per week, as well as Starbucks"
good,"Enjoy my time at Starbucks. Fun work environment, fast paced job. Making drinks, helping customers, taking orders is a typical shift. Meet lots of great people, allows you to be more apart of the community."
good,"okay for young kid, theres better opportunities with more money to be made. better situatins to put your self in. It was an okay place for myself as a young adult."
good,"* The team itself is not really the issue when it comes to work, it's the type of job that everyone needs to get along and it shows how on the store level, everything is fine as long as people communicate. "
good,Fue mi primera experiencia laboral en Inglaterra. El ambiente de trabajo no me hacia sentir integrada en el equipo. Habia mucha tension entre compañeros y poca responsabilidad por parte del manager.
good,"Overall my experience was good. I got along well with my coworkers and managers. The only thing that made my job difficult were the customers. They can be pretty demanding and rude. But depending on your manager, they will try to have your back."
good,"Worked at for six years with no advancement except to become a barista trainer (mostly due to my changing schedule, but more often than not because our store changed managers at least once every two years).  Benefits were great if you worked at least 20hrs a week, which was usually do-able.  Demanding job physically and emotionally.  Very stressful.  Very draining.  People get way too bent out of shape over just a cup of coffee.  Forever dry and damaged hands due to sanitizer and other cleaning products.  Hearing loss due to drive-thru headsets and generally noise of the store.  Very fast paced; job is not for everyone.  People tend to come on and think it's going to be easy, but it's not."
good,"Great culture and coworkers. The pay was adequate but you needed to be willing to be challenged at a very quick pace. If you were willing to work efficiently and deal with customers who were very particular, you would excel. I left this position because of the manager; one of the worst I've had thus far."
good,"A typical day here is always crazy, the location I work is very high volume of customers and items ordered. Its always hectic, but you learn to love it"
good,Starbucks is not a place for someone that just wants to have fun and goof off. The company has expanded so much in the years that I have worked there. It is not so busy that there is no time to goof off at all. you have to be focused on your work and understand many different builds for drinks
good,"they were unwilling to work with my school schedule, i enjoyed making coffee but disliked the hours. everyone was always friendly and the management seemed competent."
good,The people who work for Starbucks work hard and are amazing people who go through alot and given so little in return. All we ask is for support and compassion.
good,"The job itself is fun and easy, once you know how to do everything. "
good,"If you like fast paced food service, Starbucks is for you. Between the numerous tasks, and constant orders, there's almost no down time. However, for higher positions like shift supervisors, accountability can be a problem. If things go wrong that are outside of your control, upper management tends not to care, and will hold you personally responsible. If you can do the job well, your job will be secure, but a few mistakes could cost you a lot, even an unfair amount."
good,"I recommend working here because it helped me get the feeling of what a work place is. The people are nice and you make a lot of friends, but it's a really demanding job."
good,"Starbucks is good for students and they provide flexible hours. A typical day at work is stressful, with partners being stationed on bar for hours on end. There are some quiet days, which is a nice time to get projects done. Management is adequate overall. They provide stock options, 401k, and health insurance to part- and full-time employees, which is a huge plus. There's also job security, because a partner can transfer between stores, essentially able to move anywhere and still have a job. Workplace culture is pushed strongly by corporate, but it's hit or miss with stores and if the manager engages in team building. There used to be a lot of food waste, but they've figured a way to donate the food, which is great for the community."
good,"Lots of work, minimum wage. Able to get time off fairly easily. Lots of responsibilities. Customers can be pretty rude, corporate always takes their side and doesn't protect employees."
good,"They have processes which are not followed at all, a lot of young people (millennials) who learn so fast and do the task really fast, multitaskers and intelligent but with a very low quality result, the culture is to satisfy 100% the customer and the quality levels does not matter because is more important be quick. People often no show up with no previous notice and boycotting when the manager wants to some ones to quit, giving more tasks or cutting the hours. Nice people met there but never work again there, because there is not congruence about what they teach you in your first 3 hours of training and introduction compared whit the first month working in the floor."
good,"very busy, should not have time to stand around and come ready to work. People stay focused, and should always be ready to assist the customer first. We strive to make the moment right"
good,"A typical day is usually a good day, usually having the steady flow of the partners when everyone knows their roles. The hardest part of the job is taking the heat for another persons mistakes, but that comes with supervising. Most enjoyable part of the day is when your customers leave you feeling appreciated."
good,"Working at Starbucks was a great experience for me to know more about myself in high pressure environments. Just as working at most food-service jobs, the expectations of what you had to do far outweighed the pay, but the people I worked with and under made the experience genuinely enjoyable."
good,"Easy to relocate and transfer between stores, a lot of benefits including free beans, stock options and free spotify premium. However the store I was working at almost exclusively did outside hires for supervisor positions, and the management was poor but that varies from place to place."
good,Ambiente divertido con una gran disponibilidad horaria
good,"8hour-shifts, challenging but interesting, learned responsibilities of team leading and training, learned a lot about customer service, learned about time organisation"
good,"Starbucks as an overall corporation has a lot of good things going on. Locally, my region struggled. They lost a lot of good people to other companies or other regions because of this."
good,"One of the hardest part of working here, was dealing with teenagers on their first job. Lots of crying, lots of stress, lots of having to do this all by myself because multi tasking can prove difficult to new timers."
good,"Starbucks is an overall great company. The culture and passion that goes into coffee making is amazing, artistic, and very alive to me. I appreciate the hard work that goes into making these coffee and food products for customers. The work environment is extremely friendly and very welcoming. I highly recommend this job for anyone choosing to start out. You will learn many skills and enjoy your time. The only negative thing I have to say about Starbucks is the occasional coffee quality. I love coffee, but sometimes Starbucks comes out with certain products that can have a pretty horrible taste. This, of course, is only my opinion though. There are obviously people that love everything that comes from Starbucks. So overall, Starbucks is a very special place."
good,"Supporting the needs of a team environment to provide consistency."
good,"Working with our customers is great. I enjoy making a difference in their day making them feel that we go above and beyond for them, treat them like family.  Watching my employees grow and be successful."
good,"Siempre con la mejor dispocicion de integrarte al equipo y enseñarte lo que saben, un lugar muy acojedor y las tareas bien distribuidas"
good,"I worked for the Starbucks in Target. It was a good place to work, except that you are constantly solo. A rush comes its all up to you to get those orders filled."
good,"Good coworkers yet sometimes unorganized. I learned a lot about customer service. Management was okay, the hardest part was about was being stressed because nothing was in order especially during a rush."
good,The work was fast and there was always something to be done on a shift. While it was stressful I learned a lot about customer service and developed a greater skill for multitasking.
good,"mornings were busy, afternoons and closing were steady. busy during specials. I learned how to multi task and to remain clam under pressure. My first manager was great after she retired management went down. the people I worked with were fun and a pleasure to work with. best part of my job was flexible hours and the people I worked with."
good,"lots to do, not enough time or compensation. management was either great or terrible no in between. worked at 4-5 different locations and the pros and cons were always more or less the same"
good,A typical day you'll have around 400 customers may be more depending on how long your shift is or the type of day you work. You're not given a set schedule your given a  mix schedule every week so you have to be flexible. If your looking for a busy and fast pace job this is the job for you if not try somewhere else.
good,"I’m a current Barista of 1 year"
good,During a typical day at work one may be needed to up at extremely early hours in the morning. One may also be needed be well trained and be able to fulfill every role on the floor and may even need to perform two roles at once.
good,It’s a great place to work as long as your Coworkers are good. Communication and speed are key elements to work here as it can get busy very quickly and people expect their coffee in a timely manner. Customers can be ridiculous and rude.
good,"As an intro or part time job it wouldn't be so bad. There's lots of customer interaction, a slew of recipes to learn, and something that always needs doing. Management was rather lacking at times however, and pay was barely livable for one person with low living expenses. While the benefits were nice, they didn't make up for the lack of spendable capital."
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work if you love interacting with people and want something that offers competitive benefits. However, most people attracted to work at Starbucks are young and do not need to take advantage of the health, dental, and vision benefits as most of them are still covered under their parents' policy. The hourly rate of pay is just over minimum wage. Therefore, most stores will have a fairly high turnover rate because the young employees will seek out other jobs with higher rates of pay. Corporate does not allow managers to control their employees' pay rate by performance, rather it is a standard pay increase across the entire company annually. Employees will receive a percentage increase over their current pay rate, which equates to only a few cents for most of them. This discourages the employees from staying motivated. Most of the employees who will stay with the company are the people who are looking to solely retain health benefits. Corporate will expect very high metrics to be achieved, but will not specify how to achieve it and it falls on each individual manager to come up with their own motivation tactics. Well this does allow some individuality and creativeness within each store, it creates gaps in results across the company."
good,Starbucks conveys a message of a third home for employees and customers alike. Based on my experience at my location this is not a message I feel is true to its core. The expectations are far more than what you are paid for. Certain things that one may have to deal with while working there make it a job that you can stay at for a short period of time before it starts to take a toll.
good,u can live without Starbucks but if u have free time or just young needing your first job. the job is stressful but u do need the right environment to function
good,"Hiring store management from outside the company, with no experience in Starbucks coffee culture."
good,I have been working at a starbucks franchise for a few years. I have enjoyed it but there is a constant change of management. however the pay is still very good and hourly rate continuing to improve.
good,"A typical day at work is very stressful as we are never given enough labor to properly cover the floor.  This is due to an algorithm used to forecast predicted labor for the week.  We are also not paid enough for the job we are doing.  I have learned a lot about time management and inventory management during my time with this company.  The store managers are hard working and dedicate most of their personal time to the job.  The culture is supportive of all lifestyles and that is one of the best things about Starbucks.  They are very inclusive.  The hardest part of the job is motivating other people to do their job.  A lack of work ethic seems to be a recurring theme in Florida.  That being said, the best part of the job is all of the different interesting people you meet a long the way.  Both employees and customers make the experience enjoyable."
good,"I worked at several different stores and it honestly depends on the manager (bay area management is top notch, western Pennsylvania management is garbage) Working with a s****y manager decreases moral for all partners, when the manager is not here everyone's spirits rises. It can be a really fun place to work, great place to meet people, make friends, and receive amazing benefits. My suggestion is if you're looking for a fun, part time, place to work that can be flexible with scheduling (again depends on manager), then go for it. If you're looking for a place to grow... well.. make sure you have a good and competent manager."
good,"This job can be stressful this is due to the expectations from corperate. They want us to be the quickest, drink slingers, and biggest upsellers to gain more money. if you are looking for an laid back easy job this is not for you. "
good,"It’s overall a good place to work. Depends on the location of your shop, your work hours etc. They have solid benefits and good company values. The pay is terrible for such a successful, progressive company. Even the managers are not paid a living wage."
good,"Enjoyed having great benefits and flexible schedules, although management wasn't as good as predicted. Only flaw. Great idea to allow free tuition through University of Arizona State."
good,"During work, I always feel rushed and there are very few moments I feel the store is being run to company standards. People are always saying you do something one way and the next day someone else is telling you to do it completely differently. I feel it may be a management issue but I am not sure what is wrong."
good,Worked in butler university I loved the students an culture just wish the management was better at that time...............overall nice experience. Enjoyable
good,"N/A... My experience there was very bad. The management team was the worse. Was to be relocated but was never, instead they listed me as quit. Worse three years ever."
good,I learned how to make lots of drinks and food. The managers where very kind and helpful which I liked. Getting free food and drink was good and also working with different people
good,The atmosphere and overall care for partners is prioritized but the hourly pay is so low that it’s hard to pay bills with a full-time schedule. Many other restaurants pay more.
good,"High speed production of coffee-based beverages and shift managers that are hard on you make it a very difficult work environment."
good,"This Starbucks that I worked at was in a Krogers and they told me that the Starbucks in that Krogers was owned by Krogers, however, management was strict on certain aspects and the work was very fast-paced. The customers were mostly nice but they would never tell me directly if I was doing something wrong and I struggled with trying to make the customers happy and my managers happy."
good,"I had been with Starbucks for almost 4 years and I loved most of it. A typical slow day at work would be about a 6 hour day spent doing a job your supervisor assigned, break, chat with coworkers, do dishes, have fun, break, go home. A day during the peak season would be stressful, back-breaking, sweaty, probably full of tears, 1 smoke break, maybe a wistful look at a sandwich before you realize you'd rather take a well earned 9 minute nap in the back room, and when you finally think you're done your manager tells you there are 2 no call no shows and she needs you to stay even though you opened at 3 and are scheduled to leave at 11 but you're here for the good of the company even though they don't give a **** about you, so you stay an extra 4 hours anyways and you end up hating everyone and can't give your best customer service because you smell like burnt, old coffee beans and stress and expired whipped cream and you just need a couple days off because you've been working 11 days in a row but no one is willing to switch you because everyone else feels the exact same way as you do. "
good,Team you work with can be diverse and great or you could be the outsider in a group of friends that work there and you may be disadvantaged because of it. You will often take the blame for everything that goes wrong as the rest of team work together and speak the same language and direct customer complaints and dissatisfaction towards you to diffuse it from themselves.
good,"I worked in starbucks PR its an ok place to work. they expect you to do a lot of things, more like major cleaning for 7.25 an hour. management was surprisingly nice."
good,"It's a good place to work if you're a student and looking for work."
good,"I am a barista at Starbucks and have been one for about three years now. I have been doing all it takes to be promoted and yet nothing is happening. I do not get paid fairly based on my work ethics, therefore I find it best suitable for me to find a greater occupation. It is a very fun place to work in high school, however a very poor place for a career."
good,"Fairly easy, but fast paced job.  Most of your time is spent interacting with customers, assisting other employees during rushes, and cash/ inventory management."
good,This is a very stressful job . My coworkers and Management team where awesome but the customers are very entitled. There was one customer who regularly sexually harassed many of the employees to the point that several people were afraid of him and it took months for the regional to allow the store manager to ban him.
good,"The things that will get you through there day are how you connect with your customers and how you manage your time. There are many rushes and a variety of demanding tasks, as long as you stay on top of things, it should be a breeze."
good,"Ultimately, I only partially liked this job because I felt like a component to a coffee assembly line (I had been a barista before at an independent coffeeshop and the role of a Starbucks barista fundamentally doesn't agree with my personality, which is not a knock on the company), but I learned many valuable skills on how a service-industry business functions optimally. I acquired a solid work ethic  and understanding of customer service through Starbucks which equipped me well to excel later in fine dining restaurants and eventual management. Every task you will do has a clear purpose (meaning, there are no arbitrary tasks), and if management is good, tasks are distributed democratically in accordance with the Starbucks system. During the time of my employment at Starbucks we were overstaffed, which inhibited me from getting the hours I needed and became the eventual reason for my leaving as I pursued other avenues. I have many friends who have worked for the company with similar sentiments and gone on to lead successful careers in a variety of industries. Starbucks, as a launch pad, is an excellent place to begin."
good,It was a nice experience working for them.. I just couldn’t see to get more than 4-4 1/2 hours of a shift per day from the company and that doesn’t work for me.
good,Great place to work if you live at home with your parents and have no bills. They will help with tuition and have great benefits but the pay is extremely low
good,"Fun fast paced work environment. Organized and clean environment."
good,"My fellow coworkers were fun and great to be around. We worked as a team, making the workload less intense and very manageable. Multi-tasking is a must and quick work is preferred."
good,"For what it is, there are no issues with the job. The other employees are definitely not afraid to speak their minds to you and are likely to get on your nerves though."
good,"a typical day at starbucks is making cofee , latte& teas for any guest , preparing pastries and stocking and cleanliness& also making sure you smile.."
good,"I worked at Starbucks for roughly four years during and post college, starting as a barista and moving up to shift manager eventually.  My largest critique would be the extremely tiring and taxing work hours - often I would have to close the store around 10:30 p.m. and be back at work at 6:30-7:00 a.m. the next day.  It was not an ideal situation while trying to balance work and school.  Additionally, I worked for four different store managers in four years.  The turnover was rapid and I probably managed over 100 employees during my time there.  It was nearly impossible to take days off and I was expected to work weekends - both early mornings and nights.  I could not have been happier to leave."
good,The Hurt Plaza Starbucks is known for its diversity. The hardest part of the job was the training aspect. Starbucks provides so many elements to  being a barista and adjusting to employees' learning style can be a challenge. I definitely got to explore the kind of manager I was and wanted to be. This was a great experience!
good,"very fast-paced job , lots of customer interaction , bonding with the regulars, memorization of regulars drink, tattoo policies are great if you have tattoos, hours can be demanding"
good,"Starbucks is a fun place to work at. Every store is different and every manager runs their store differently. Some are more stressful than others and it's not a bad job. It's a good job temporarily- the pay isn't that great but it is above the minimum wage but not by too much. It's enough to get by if you're given consistent hours but that more often that is not isn't the case. Overall, they're not a bad company to work for."
good,The Pay is not competitive anymore.  Although Benefits are good they are lacking in regional pay differences along with major compression issues in Colorado.
good,"Les collègues étaient stressant..."
good,"If you like coffee and consume a lot of it per day, you will probably love working here. The coffee is the best part. However, there is always work. Rarely do you get to sit and relax. The managers are mostly nice, but will constantly give you tasks do to. The pay is weak, at about $9 an hour plus tips. Tips are piled at the end of the week and split. Ends up being about an extra $2-3 dollars an hour. Making this a $12 an hour job. This is not worth it for the amount of work you have to do. The good side to this is there is a lot of benefits with Starbucks for full-time employees. Starbucks will give you a stock of theirs after working there for a year or something like that. Then they can pay for online schooling at ASU. That is really cool and something very few companies offer. However for a part-time job, this is not the best choice."
good,"Great company, but the questionable management in Okotoks made the experience poor overall. Someone told her that i tried weed(i was 16). She then made it her mission to mistreat me and make me feel like an outcast."
good,Busy at all times. Energetic Workplace. Had a great experience working there. Got a lot of learning opportunities. Very fast paced working environment. Fellow staff members were very kind.
good,"I have enjoyed working with my Starbucks family, and getting to know my regulars. I have had the opportunity to train new partners to the company, as well as coach current partners for improvement."
good,"I did enjoy my time at Starbucks whilst I was studying at college and university. However, when I became full time my motivation for this job took a downturn. I realised that above the higher management did not care for the staff. All they seemed to care about was sales. Supervisors felt like they were glorified cleaners(though did receive bonus' based on different factors), and average baristas didn't really receive any benefits other than free coffee but had to bare the brunt of rude customers and sometimes unbearable work conditions."
good,"fun place to work a second job, not a career IMO. Once you get over 25 hours the high maintenance customers, that Starbucks stands behind will drive you insane."
good,"When I first started at Starbucks in 2006 it was hard work but we were given enough labor and time to create a very clean, enjoyable atmosphere. Within the last 5 years the corporation has cut labor and increased the expected work load to the point of mental and physical exhaustion. There's not even time to read updates and daily requirements. I'm not a chatty person (I want to get as much done on my shift as possible) but when you can't even stop to ask a question because the number of customers far out numbers the labor there is something seriously wrong. And in addition to all this we are expected to ""connect"" with the customer while still being swamped with work."
good,A fast-paced work environment. Drinks are easy to learn. Employee's and manager are all wonderful people. Very positive. Customers are rude sometimes. Overall it's a great job to have if you're in school. Wonderful Benefits
good,"Customers are needy and at times demanding but they barely want to tip. It sucks people can be so condescending but don't want to pay for great service! "
good,"The manager at the location I worked for was verbally aggressive towards me and other staff and when confronted about it, she would call us liars and would demand to know who was saying negative things about her. Aside from the manager I do believe Starbucks is a decent company and do offer great benefits to partners, although constantly changing things for what they say is better can be really annoying, especially when it is clearly not better."
good,"I am a supervisor but I have really been more of an Assistant manager. Because this is a licensed store the ""hierarchy"" is not properly structured. Essentially it was the store manager (who has to answer to the licensee company) and then there are the supervisors... or in the current case Supervisor, just me. "
good,"It was a good opportunity while I was in school, but doesn't quite pay well enough to support a healthy and satisfying lifestyle. Good job for young people (students) but not really a serious career opportunity. The hours are flexible and there's plenty of locations to get hours at but the job can be rather stressful for $9 an hour."
good,"Can be great, can be soul crushing, it truly depends on how invested your SM is. Perks include great benefits and flexible working hours. Cons depend on location, as stated above."
good,An ever changing menu with new drinks every quarter. Always new updates every week and the peak times in the morning are always the busiest and can sometimes be stressful.
good,Great company to work for part time.  It was very flexible with great benefits.  I was able to work around my childen's schedule in order to balance my work and home life.
good,"Overall, I believe that Starbucks is a good company to work for. However, it is an extremely taxing job for how little it pays and how little investment most baristas will have in the company. As far as entry level jobs go, they do offer some of the best benefits of any company I know of. The day to day work however, is grueling and not for everyone. It can be extremely stressful and physically demanding at all times of the day, and the store environments tend to be an overload on the senses. One must be very good at multitasking and keeping a happy face through everything that goes on. I've worked at stores where the employees were all best friends and had a great store culture and I've worked in stores where everyone was a total curmudgeon so it's really all about the store and staff you're dealt as to whether or not it is worth it."
good,"Enjoyed working there, made a lot of friends both among partners and  customers alike but the management of the branch i worked at was a little messy The supervisors were great but the manager himself is a little lacking in a sense where he/she was not punctul and when they are on shift they don't pull their weight and at times sleeps on the job."
good,Starbucks is a great place to work if you're highly energetic and need something quick and flexible and love meeting new people and making conversation. You need to prepare to do a lot of standing and fast paced work. Communication and organization are key components during the work day. Be prepared to handle various types of personalities and  attitudes.
good,"As a company they take time to screen management of the stores more. But as ah whole they have they right vision, they just need people who are willing to keep the vision going!"
good,"Starbucks was a progressive company, but a lot of the times they put the customers over the partners, which made long days even longer. The environment was incredibly fast-paced, and the team could sometimes not keep up, which lead to stressful days."
good,Starbucks was an enjoyable company to work for. It was a knowledgeable environment with tools at your disposal to become more informed on procedure of preparation and general knowledge of coffee.
good,"It is an ok place to work if you are in college or looking for benefits only.  However, as far as advancement goes it is pretty hard to advance past shift supervisor."
good,"Working at Starbucks was a very pleasant experience overall. I would say that I disagree with what Starbucks means to society, as a whole, but working for the company was a good experience."
good,"Starbucks has great benefits, but how pleasant your job is depends on who your general manager is. In 2 years my store changed general manager's 3 times, and each time my work experience changed significantly."
good,"Working at Starbucks allowed me to create meaningful relationships with customers, including friendships and job opportunities. Within Starbucks, I was hired as a barista and given the opportunity to promote to Shift Supervisor early on, which was personally satisfying. However, I did not experience that Starbucks regularly promoted its retail employees to higher management positions. I also observed it to be extremely difficult for qualified retail employees to be considered for corporate positions, despite their length of history with the company."
good,Can be a good place to work. It can get stressful at times. But always a close nit team to work with. There are fun times to. Always enjoy the people I work with and serve coffee to.
good,There have been many benefits working for this company. Some of the policies and openness of the company structure can be very positive. The company supports many groups of people out there and it makes the company more inviting those people. I'm not looking to put judgement here for being an employee at Starbucks.
good,"Learned to problem solve with customers and employees. Decent Management. Stressful at times, but occasionally fun. Decent employees. Perks working for this company were a bonus."
good,"Good compensation, good working environment .there is a growth in the organisation. conducting series of trainings. politics issues in the organisation when it comes to promotion."
good,They talk a lot about what they do for employees. That doesn't always match up with how we got treated. They believe in change and roles and teams get shaken up at least once a year.
good,"I spent 7 years working for this company and I was fairly happy working for them. The hours can be intense sometimes if you're not accustomed to working so early in the morning. "
good,"Stressful but rewarding.  Not for the faint of heart.  The benefits are good whether you're full time or part time, but there is definitely a highly stressfu latmosphere."
good,"Great place to work depending on your customer clientele and your fellow partners, as well as management."
good,"Worked with my schedule, I was a full-time student, so I worked part-time. If I had last minute issues, they were decently helpful at accommodating my schedule. CEO is wonderful and takes care of employees. You accrue PTO after a year, per shift. Benefits were amazing, as was health insurance options, but you must work a year there before receiving any benefits. 30% employee discount on all products, including those already marked down. As an employee, there were no limits to tattoo's or piercings, and were even encouraged as a form of art expression. We kind of had a uniform, but it was really blue jeans, black shoes, and pretty much any shirt/outerwear. "
good,Starbucks is a great place for someone to work that is going to school or that is looking for part time. They war will to work around schedules. The customers are always great and fun
good,"Overall the experience was decent, but the stress from too many customers ordering a lot with not enough Baristas scheduled and poor management made it awful."
good,great place to work just expect to work 10+ hours a day the pay is okay benifits are great most of the coworkers are good. the work to life balance is non existent
good,"I worked at a store that had just opened up. We were not making enough sales so there were not a lot of Barista's working. So there would be 3 people in every shift. In any other Starbucks there were 7 people working. Huge difference. So when the crowd would rush in the person on customer support would have to stop what he/she were doing and help at register, bar, or hop on warming. The store always ended up being dirty. Nothing was every stocked. So by the end of the night we ended up staying an extra 30 minutes to bring the store back together. Unfortunately coworkers of mine were not reliable when coming to work their shifts."
good,"to work here you have to memorize drinks and learn how to make more than one drink at a time, you have to be a cashier, and cleaning crew all at once."
good,the job can be very fun and the work community is really nice but the entire company really emphasizes on quick work and customer experience which makes it very stressful and at times not worth it.
good,"CAN be a welcoming environment and place to study or meet up with friends. It's nice to see regulars and connect. But dealing with transients and druggies, not to mention being understaffed, causes tension and is not a safe or ideal environment for the partners. They are unable to make genuine connections or be friendly with all the chaos going on around them. Labor cuts make it difficult to meet demand, especially now with mobile orders, and customers and baristas can not live up to the mission values."
good,Le nouveaux barista on souvent trop la pression de la part des supérieure. Il doivent s'occuper des tâches les plus ingrate que les autre ne veulent pas faire. Les manager choisisse souvent de garder les nouveaux à la tête c'est limite faut plaire physiquement au manager sinon cela ne passe pas et vous êtes souvent juger pour rie et la plupart du temps on relève pas les autres barista qui peuvent être habiller de façon provocante voir aguicheuse
good,Would recommend to someone looking for experience in the service industry. Everyone I worked with was amazing which was the only thing that made the job worthwhile.
good,"Most starbucks are miss managed and have bad baristas. If you find a golden store, then stick to it. I currently have a great manager with great coworkers but yes, starbucks rarely fires their employees. I think to the detriment of their team."
good,"Overall the work environment is okay and have to know how to be fast paced. Though customers are great and my co workers are the best, Starbucks does try to create a warm environment for the customers."
good,"At different points in the day there are peaks. Where we get really busy and we have to make sure that we have everything that we need, while helping customers and cleaning. However the evenings are more relaxed  but we still have to be professional. We also have to prepare for the next shift."
good,"Was a manager, and got burned out.  I was a multi unit manager, so I have a slightly different viewpoint than an hourly team member would have.  I would tell people to do their own research."
good,"I guess it depends on your location, but the store is usually busy, fast paced, and slightly stressful. The pay and benefits (health, vacation + sick pay) are worth it, though."
good,"The company doesn't allot a lot of labor to each store, and sets unrealistic goals to work within their labor limits. It puts a lot of pressure on the staff to maintain constant standard while creating a ""third place"" atmosphere for the partners and customers."
good,"Starbucks provides incredible benefits, but the compensation is low, and any career advancement is very difficult beyond shift supervising. The structure for promoting within is vague, a moving target, and hard to achieve."
good,"Typical day at work: steady and could be stressful due to non-stop lineups"
good,"It is really the management, customers, and coworkers that make it worthwhile. If those three areas don't work, then the team is really dysfunctional."
good,"This is a very stressful, fast-paced job. Because customers are the vehicle for what is good or bad the variance of day to day is exhausting. Good managers know how to best place the team and step in when things are not going well, but the business is as it is and sometimes there's nothing to do. For how poorly service people are treated by customers I am surprised at how low the benefits are. "
good,"Quick paced, the other employees can be rude about helping. In my experiences there were only a few team members but I clearly cleared the air with one made sure it wasn't just a miscommunication."
good,aprendi mucho sobre el cafe sus propiedades y cualidades
good,Poor management but friendly colleagues. On the job training but they expect you to know most stuff and learn on your own. I learned to work as a team and under pressure.
good,"My typical day at work depended on a lot of things. Most people were kept on stations that they were good at, but I didn't excel in any particular field. So I filled slots when needed. The mornings were pretty stressful when I worked them. But if you open, you have a few hours to warm up before your rush. The rush can last as long as 6-10, but the time passes quickly. Evenings were more laid back. And alhough there was no shortage of work to do, the work is more structured and predictable. I found the workplace environment to be pleasant, especially in the evenings. And the coworkers I found myself surrounded by tended towards more grounded and accepting people. And it was a good place to be at the time. But it wasn't a place I wanted to stay at forever."
good,"Working at the Northstar Mall location was not a pleasant or useful experience. Some of the customers (the Alamo Heights and Saks 5th Avenue princess) were difficult, which is part of working in the service industry. However, if you are ordering a specialty coffee drink you should not be going to Starbucks. Most of the ""baristas"" should not be given that title. And the espresso machine is automated, which involves calibration. Sporadic at best. "
good,"PROS: "
good,Starbucks is a fine job if you're seeking flexibility and advancement in a work place. The people you work with are very helpful and make the experience very enjoyable. Management honestly can make or break your all around experience
good,"The benefits are good, and even part-time employees are eligible for healthcare, stock options, AND tuition reimbursement (for ASU). However, the pay is not all that great and tips are almost non-existent. So, even with the great benefits it was still hard to make ends meet (the highest I was paid after about two years of working there was $8.15/hour as a barista). Plus, I usually worked 38-40 hours a week, but sometimes I would randomly get a week with only 15 or so hours, which was a huge financial hit. PTO takes forever to accumulate. "
good,"A typical day at Starbucks can range from extremely dead, to a line out of the door. There are different rushes at different times of the day based on your location and hours. Typically, you will be making drinks, cleaning, and brewing coffee. Overall, I enjoyed working for Starbucks; always loved the coffee and the atmosphere. The amazing people I've had the chance to meet and work with have made my experience a good one."
good,"Starbucks is an enjoyable place to work. Building relationships with coworkers and customers is the best part of the job, of course, coffee too. You learn all about coffee quality and beverage health and safety. In management you often are the forefront for customer satisfaction, sometimes dealing with de-escalation of issues. The most difficult part of the job is how infrequently you are rewarded with excelling beyond your role. With company wide raises that are not based on performance, it is hard to motivate yourself and others to work past the bare standard. The company does provide benefits to employees working 20+ hours a week, which is nice."
good,very fast paced. favoritism from management. wonderful benefits but competitive for hours among employees  teamwork and team building make great relationships.
good,Upper management values money more than the well being of its employees. They keep trying to implement new technology without understanding how it affects the actual flow of the cafe.
good,"Certain managers at different stores proceeded to manage their own store differently from how the district manager asks, causing inconsistency in the product development and store environment. "
good,"Starbucks was a pleasant place to work with, with the right people staffed. Management was not the best and district manager was not in tune with the baristas on the floor."
good,Strabucks has good intention but they do more than they are capable of which puts far too much pressure on individuals who are not padi enough to deal with such. Overall Starbucks is flexible and has some good benefits and is trying to be the best but it definitely needs to spread out and not be all on a few people.
good,"a busy store with a supportive team makes it a lot more enjoyable and tolerable to work in the environment,  poor management can ruin a store experience completely"
good,"Most days are quite simple unless you work during the peak hours in the morning. Often times I was placed on bar or drive-thru and able to make the final impression on the customer. Part of the job can be very stressful though as the rushes come very fast and very thick and many times people get frustrated with the time on their drinks. Management is very hit or miss, some people really like the District Managers/Store Managers and others do not. The hardest part of the job is trying to get over the hump when you have many drinks and just feel like you're taking a long time. The easiest is probably the closing procedures and, after some practice, sequencing."
good,"It is good part-time work for the money. It is fast-paced and quite stressful, but with the right crew can be fun. Definitely not for introverts who like a steady pace."
good,"Starbucks has always been a common place for customers seeking a quiet environment. It really offers a third place which you can meet and make friends. They offer a an excellent customer service, providing a satisfaction for every individual that enters their stores. A typical day at starbucks, isn't easy because it's about ensuring that you always meet their expectations from their coffees. Everyday that passes, baristas at starbucks always give their best to give the customers the feeling of warmth belonging. One of the duties that a barista must possess is providing a warmth belonging and make every customer feel special. Although there are times that they usually encounters long lines, specially when it's christmas season. So as a barista, you really need a extra 100% energy. You always have to prepare yourself for the different types of customers you have to deal with. The management was good too, they value their employees as much as they value their customers all the time.. The most enjoyable part of my job there was the moment we saw each customers feel very special, that we met their expectations through their coffees even though we are really tired from entire shift because of the long ques, seeing their smiles in their faces was priceless. We always assure to give the best possible customer experience for every customer."
good,"I honestly wish I could have worked there more, but I was still just a junior in high school and marching band was more important at the time. The free pound of coffee a week was great, but the inability to change my schedule was infuriating sometimes. Still, it was a good first job, and if you're willing to make it a major part of your life, you should take it."
good,Make sure you have enough production to support your team. Able to maintain calm through rough situation and figure out techniques to solve problems that may occur on the clock. The hardest part can be enforcing certain rules but not having management follow through the rules. Overall it is a good job if you want to move up within the company and it's a major part of what you would like to do. The most enjoyable part is find you have grown within and your partners looking up to your hard work. That is the biggest reward.
good,"Starbucks is an exacting place to work but if you have a good team it makes it easily one of the best jobs. They've worked hard to commit to their employees and the improvements I've seen both while working there and after my tenure are commendable."
good,"Starbucks is a fantastic company for advancing young people and teaching them skills to move forward due to the company's mission statement and values. Personally, I have learned to better the worst of moments and have been able to bond with many people throughout my time with the company; partners and customers alike. The hardest part of the job is ensuring drive thru times are met as well as the overall cleanliness of the store with the amount of staffing allowed. The most enjoyable part of working for Starbucks is the people and the atmosphere once you have become a close knit team."
good,Everything was fine except the management.  I did not think that the hours were too long or that the people I worked with were bad.  The salary or wage could increase for what we are asked to do.
good,The culture of the workplace was dependent on the customers. I learned a lot about costumer service and work life balance. The most enjoyable part of the job was the costumer interaction.
good,"Being a Starbucks barista is a great side job. Hours are flexible enough so it was helpful as a student. This is definitely more of a temporary position though, unless you're planning to work in upper management."
good,"I had so much fun working here. It was a lot of routine work, but I enjoyed my time here. However, I was fired for a reason that was out of my control."
good,"It was a very interesting experience, but it can only be as good as the manager can manage. I enjoyed the benefits and the familiarity of customers, but management is key."
good,"When I worked at Starbucks it was a fairly relaxed environment with a lot of friendly faces. Normally you would greet your customers, take their orders, and strike up a conversation if the line was short and in a good mood. I think the most challenging thing at Starbucks was the lunch rushes, but those only lasted a few hours at the most. Overall the environment is a friendly one and you can get quite a few benefits from working there such as a 401k and college assistance."
good,"I enjoyed some of the fast paced things at Starbucks, making drinks, and interacting with customers was great. However, I did not enjoy some of the other employees, and negative attitudes. The put me off a little bit from working there. They do have amazing benefits, and treat employees very well. At the end of the day it just wasn't the job for me."
good,"Working in a fast paced environment, you generally have regular customers that come in daily. Memorizing choice  drinks for them so when you sawnthen coming in you could start making it was key. Building and establishing a repor not only with Co workers but customers was a plus"
good,"I'd suggest you pick your location carefully. Be wary of management, specifically store management rather than shift management. Partners tend to be helpful otherwise."
good,"Starbucks' attitude and culture are strong, but the work can be stressful during rush times when your team has to coordinate its efforts under high customer volume."
good,I've been at the company and however the manager is will make or break the whole team. I've had both and it can be frustrating having a morning shift with a rude manager.
good,"Benefits are great, but still only get paid minimum wage, even when there for over two years only a few cents over. Been through three store managers since store opened in 2016, bad partner morale as a result"
good,You work nonstop for your whole shift. The customer service aspect can be stressful. The quality of the job depends on the store and the management. Good benefits.
good,Starbuck's was always a fair job. What you put in is what you get out. If you care you'll advance up. It is a busy and demanding job. Must be able to multi-task well. Does offer good benefits and healthcare!
good,"I thoroughly enjoy Starbucks as a company. I have a manager that works very hard and tries her best to listen to her partners, However, corporate does not appear to be very helpful when equipment is broken or when the hours given to us do not fit the extreme needs of the store."
good,"Time is really important and quality is a must. They have activities that are really helpful like fixing and painting chairs for public schools, planting trees and outreached programs."
good,"I recommend this job to someone who doesn't have much work experience this could be teach you a lot about customer service, communication skills, and much more."
good,"The people that work there are amazing. However, there is little Job Compensation and benefits; calling off work requires you to call other coworkers that are willing to fill in for you. The CSR of starbucks is amazing bc they give the leftover food at the end of the day/week to charity and commit to social causes though."
good,"Starbucks is a great business with amazing benefits. Everyday, however I work really hard to only get paid very little. As part of their effort, Starbucks coorperation does incorporate encouragement and gratitude so, at least that keeps my spirits high."
good,"Quick paced, Visual learning ,Family environment and community centered. Cash handling. A lot of cleaning. Hands on training and video training as well as coffee tasting"
good,"I worked at starbucks as a barista for 2 years and I've made some friends and memories there that will last a lifetime. But...the pay for the amount of stress the employees are put under on a daily basis is deplorable. Sometimes we were even asked to do the impossible. I was going to school at the time so I never sought advancement to become a shift supervisor while I was there, but the people that did had it SO much worse. Everything under the sun was their fault, even though they clearly tried their best to run a tight crew. Sometimes, stuff happens and the higher ups need to recognize that so they can retain good people and keep their employee turnover down. I would not recommend becoming a shift supervisor here, I've seen that crash and burn sooo many times. But as a part time barista, this place ain't bad."
good,I have learned alot of customer service skills and how to work in a fast pace environment. It is a very stressful place to work at times and the management does not take the time to overview how you are doing. I love my coworkers but i feel there is no opportunities for me to grow in this company.  It is a good job for someone who wants to go to college because they do pay you back for your classes IF you pass all your classes and even then you have to graduate from the ASU program or you owe back all the money they paid for your schooling so you must stay employed at Starbucks until you are done. If you are interested in Starbucks i would say go for it but it is definitely not a place i would plan on being at for a long time.
good,"Great company culture, wonderful company, inspiring CEO. However the hours you are expected to work are insane. You will need to work 55 hours a week for the first year in order to make a dent in your KPI.s"
good,If you want full time hours consider working at a high volume store otherwise if you work at a cafe especially one with no drive though expect to work less than 20hrs a week. Unless you are a manager or shift. They get consistent full time hours each week with more paid time off and accumulate more sick and vacation hours as well as better pay raises. However if you are a student or an adult looking for a part time job with little commitment and flexibility this is the place. Little commitment as in you can choose how many hours you want to work. I believe it must be a minimum of 18 at high volume stores and can be as little as 10hrs per week at low volume stores. You are also allowed to request a reasonable amount of days off per month as long as you give them an advance notice..
good,Working at Starbucks was great because I made a decent hourly wage plus weekly tips split between all of the employees. I did not like the lack of teamwork amongst the baristas.
good,"Teaches you time management and teamwork. Both skills will serve you well. Customer Service is paramount in the Starbucks culture, so you learn how to take care of people and nurture relationships with your clientele."
good,"It was a fun work place and had the ability to showcase my creativity, though the working shifts were not convenient for me. Working in retail meant understanding and delivering well on customer service"
good,"Very fast paced. Generally a positive environment . Excellent benefits.Benefits include food, drinks, a weekly coffee mark out, healthcare, vision, dental, life insurance, stock ownership, life insurance, vacation time."
good,"Starbucks is a good company to start honing you customer service skills, it can be very fast paced and exciting, and other times it can be slow, but full of opportunities to take initiative in the work place. There's always good intentions, but drama tends to take over the work place easily and may affect the manager and how they treat their employees. I have worked under two difference managers in Starbucks, one of which was very much a bully and wasn't very much of a team player when things got tough in the store, but the other has been nothing but kind and a hard worker who joins the fray like the rest of her baristas. "
good,"Over the years corporate management has seemed to put a lot of pressure on district and store managers, who in return put that pressure back on to shift managers and baristas.  This made working at any of the four stores in my area unpleasant.  We are made to feel horrible for missing work when sick, and met with passive aggressiveness when our work ethic was questioned.  Most of the employees at my store have left, especially the long term employees all within the passed two years.  The store is primarily employed with new hires, which makes it stressful for the long term baristas and shift managers."
good,"I loved working for Starbucks, I met some of my best friends here.  But as a shift lead going to school full time I could not afford to work at Starbucks.  Their compensation compared to the demand is very off balance.  Also, there are huge inequalities in compensation throughout different genders."
good,"I worked at Starbucks for over two years, it was a struggle to get close to 40 hours per week unless I worked at multiple stores per week. The benefits were the best I have ever had, truly it is what kept me there so long. It cost me a small percentage of my paycheck to get full vision, dental and medical insurance which was amazing. Most of the people that work there were great, but the job could be pretty stressful and not a lot of workers/managers knew how to handle that stress correctly. The PTO benefit was a little frustrating, you don't start earning it until you have worked there a full year, and a year after that I only accumulated 12 hours of PTO. The biggest issue for me was the pay. After several raises and several years of putting my whole life into the company, I was making the same amount as the people I trained to replace me when I left. So while it might be great to start out at whatever amount they give you when you are hired, don't expect to make more than that even after several years."
good,"As a company it offers great benefits, the best I have encountered in any company so far.  Opportunity lies in growth. I have been with the company a short time, but can see where there are some areas of opportunity.  The employees do not make enough for the day to day they encounter.  It is very busy, and their is non-stop work."
good,"A typical workday was very busy in the morning and sometimes the evenings.  A consistent shortage of team members made this position challenging when trying to give ultimate guest service.  The most difficult part of the job was finding opportunities to be off the floor to complete managerial obligations,  Very common to work alone.  Meeting so many fantastic people who became loyal guests was very enjoyable.  Seeing them made the day fun."
good,"a typical day at starbucks in my opinion would be joking around with regulars you i have become friends with,I've learnt how to multitask better, the hardest thing about the job would be remembering what goes in each drink,"
good,"Starbucks has good quality customer service. such a good coffees."
good,"This Starbucks is located on a turnpike rest stop center. All year is busy, but intense during the summer, especially when tour buses stop there. At the time I worked there, management was ok."
good,"This is a great company to learn and grow yourself in. The possibilities for growth in the company are fantastic. The compensation for work is not the best, but the benefits are great. It is really wonderful getting to know your customers and brightening their day. I love to make latte art every chance I can."
good,Some management is mostly outside hires that lack an understanding of the jobs below them.  Coworkers are the best part of the job and make any shift a fun experience.
good,Working at Starbucks definitely has pros and cons. The biggest con I can think of is the hourly pay. With the rate of pay and non guarantee of hours it makes it very difficult to have this as a main job. Also the drastic cut of labor recently has really killed morale.
good,I've developed team work skills and better customer service since I've started working for this company. The hardest part of this job is to maintain a positive attitude on the floor during the rush. The most enjoyable part of the job is to make different kind of beverages at once.
good,I thought Starbucks was a good experience for entry level work. I learned about how high pace and multitasking work. The management was fair really rude to me but other then that the job wasn't so bad. They were pretty strict but that's okay because every job needs structure. If you're looking for a job Starbucks wouldn't be a bad place to start.
good,"Starbucks is a great job to have while going to school.  The hours can be flexible depending on your schedule, but your experience depends on how well you can get along with your co-workers."
good,"-You are required to do more than you are able to at times, such as how many tasks are demanded for a set amount of time. "
good,"Good company to work for, but uk senior leadership is full of nonsense. Personal relationship comes over quality. After a certain levevl you struggle to get yourself promoted ."
good,"Unclear, shifting priorities make it difficult to understand where to focus.  Very demotivating to be full on working on a project or analysis to suddenly find it's no longer need."
good,personally I was not too thrilled about this job after receiving it because I don't feel I get paid enough dealing with the customers rude behavior towards me and my other coworkers.
good,customer relations difficult at times. pay is not enough to live on own. partners not treated as fairly as they should be. when minimum wage goes up your pay does not go up.
good,you wake up super early to find out the closers spent all night messing around and not doing their job so you have to do what they didn't do plus all of your opening stuff in 30 mins before opening. once you open people constantly get mad at you for trying to help them figure out  their incisive orders and getting asked if you're new if you don't read their minds. you don't even get paid close to a living wage and after 2 years you'll make as much as someone just hired no matter how many added responsibilities you have compared to other partners. not worth it whatsoever. Starbucks needs to reevaluate their priorities as a company and focus more on customer interaction like every other coffee shop if they want to even attempt to try to account for tips as apart of the wages that partners receive. most stores only get 50 cents per hour and so you end up for basically $20 extra a week.
good,"Interesante, se aprende harto y divertido, gente entusiasta y joven"
good,My Starbucks was very busy. Often morning rush would have me making drinks for hours straight. The fast paced environment was a lot of fun but very often led to a lot of stress and sometimes arguments between staff.
good,"Great benefits, but they do not make up for how stressful the work environment was. If you are willing to work for it, getting promoted is very accessible."
good,"Starbucks is made for specific types of people. It's a high-paced, high-stress working environment that is very draining. My schedule was not ideal and the pay was way too low for the work that I was doing. When I wasn't working, I was usually recuperating from the previous few days of work. Not an ideal environment for people who get stressed easily or for someone who cannot critically think through more than one step at a time. Some days were rewarding, but more often than not the work was taxing and dirty. I learned a great deal of patience and the true meaning of customer service through this position."
good,"I was a cashier, barista, and shift supervisor. I placed orders ever week for front and back of house. I also interviewed and hired baristas, as well as conducting reviews with baristas ever 90 days. I was responsible for four tills, every shift counting in and out, as well as doing the same for the safe at the beginning and end of every shift."
good,"Starbucks has amazing benefits for their employees. We get paid pretty average. It is, however, an incredibly stressful job. There are very high expectations for the employees to move at an incredibly fast pace, which is fine when we are staffed appropriately. However, Starbucks has no problem keeping labor to a minimum in order to save money. This stresses out the employees and leaves customers waiting longer for drinks. When a customer is upset, they get their drink for free. When a customer complains to management, they get a gift card and an apology. I understand keeping customers happy, but not when the employees are walked all over."
good,Working at Starbucks requires the ability of multi tasking and working in a fast paced environment. Starbucks offers great benefits but pay is only 25 cents above minimum wage. Hardest part of this job is working as fast as they want you to while still having great customer connection.
good,"Not the easiest job to get a hang of, but when you do get it down, it will be one of the best jobs. The training can be stressful depending on your trainer. The discounts are great and so are the benefits."
good,"Management could be a lot better. It gets very stressful in the weekend when we’re very busy, and we’re understaffed a lot. We often run out of product, which leads to angry customers."
good,"Where I work at (we have at least three Starbucks in Birmingham; two on the UAB campus and one off-campus), we are very busy and thus get tired once all the customers are gone. And the next thing you know, more customers come along. It's great for business, but for someone who's behind the register 24/7, it's very tiring."
good,"Typical day at work was fun, fast paced but sometimes slow. Enjoyed a majority of the people i worked with, customers were usually nice, too. the easiest part was making frappucinos, hardest part would be doing the coffee every 8 minutes in he morning- which isn't hard. would be a great job for a high-schooler or college student."
good,"The hours are good ,the staff are great to get on with and always happy to help and teach you every aspect of the job so you can be left to work on your own initiative ."
good,A typical day is really busy with little to no down time whatsoever. Its fun and I have learned how to have meaningful interactions with people as I have hundreds everyday with customers and coworkers. The hardest part of the job is customers who treat you like garbage coupled with having many of them in a stressful environment. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to have good interactions with customers and have good meaningful interactions with coworkers. I have the best manager on the entire planet.
good,"Como Store Manager en Starbucks tuve la posibilidad de generar nuevas carreras, desarrollar personal y promover una cultura y política general de inclusion laboral. Contemplando excelentes relaciones laborales, aprendizaje de nuevas herramientas de trabajo, y con una bella cultura laboral. Lo mas complejo del trabajo fue lidiar con la adaptación de horarios de trabajadores, ya que en su mayoría se debía adecuar con ciertas especificaciones para ambas partes. Lo mas valorado es que fue mi escuela en gestión y administrador de negocios por años."
good,"- Typical days were hectic, small work area caused a lot of unnecessary commotion and collision between coworkers. "
good,"Depending on which part of the day you work, it can be either: very busy, medium, or quiet.  Although Starbucks Coffee is highly known for the obvious, they highly pride themselves on the customer service.  "
good,"I’ve had good managers but our new manager is unfit. Poor working conditions, never properly staffed, and always out of items. Don’t focus on employee morale"
good,During my employment I learned a lot about food handling and was able to get my certification.  It is a fast paced place of employment however people were friendly and easy to work with.  The hardest part of the job was the constant changes in scheduling.  Not knowing what hours I would work until Friday of each week.
good,I love working for Starbucks but the 2nd and 3rd shift hours are getting tough to accommodate and does not provide an ample work/life balance for me at this time.  Upper management is a rotating door lately and not all managers strive to understand starbucks employee focused culture.
good,"starbucks  offer a great benefit package , a good work and personal life balance. Job is very stressful and sometimes making the environment a very uncomfortable one"
good,Good place to word.  good benefits. Long Hours.  Weekend work.  Night work.  Fair pay okay.  Bonus just okay.  Scheduling system was hard for me to work.  Good teamwork.
good,Loved learning how to make make quality drinks in a very quick & efficient way. The job itself is a good starter job depending on the kind of management at the specific store you work at. The job overall requires you to be very detail-oriented and be able to juggle multiple things at once. The salary is not enough for all of the responsibilities you're given. The discounts and benefits are great which for some people out weighs the low pay.
good,It was a stressful job but you really learn how to adapt to the stressful environment. Helping a guest figure out what's a good drink to get was the best part in my opinion.
good,"Typical day includes making beverages, serving food, and lots of cleaning! free beverages on shift.Great way to learn or enhance social skills as well as customer service."
good,Working a SBUX is a very interesting adventure. It is filled with good energy and optimism. I especially appreciate the values leadership bestows upon its partners.
good,"Shouldn't really be a career option. Corporate does not promote from within and hires inexperienced personnel as managers. It was not until my last manager, someone that had been a partner for years, that our location had an amazing, capable manager."
good,"great place to work. productive training program, team environment with opportunity for advancement. Offers good benefits and discounts and plenty of hours"
good,"Typical work days at Starbucks is a test in running the gambit. There's always patrons to attend to and if not there are many things to keep clean and maintained. An individual can learn a lot about people working here. Also, how to quickly analyze a situation and find the most efficient and/or effective manner to approach."
good,50 hour work week within a fast paced work environment.  However the job always provided for a Fun environment. Extensive Travel... I was a Franchise Consultant and thoroughly enjoyed all aspects of my job.
good,"Para todo lo que uno entrega a la empresa limpiar atender los periodos de prueba son extresantes ,no pagan horas extras si te vas despues de la hora , los horarios de colacion son pésimos prácticamente no puedes comer tranquilo/a  , etc ... les pagan poco a las personas que si entregan el sevicio y los que estan detras de uba pared u oficina les pagan mas que el doble 👎🏻"
good,lavoro divertente se si prende con la giusta filosofia
good,I personally did not have a great experience with the company but that was due to just the manager at the store at that time. I have no doubt that I wouldn't have had the same experience had someone else been in charge at the time.
good,Prepared to be greeting customers able to function at register as well as making drinks as the customer ordered To multi task orders as well as specialty orders. Sanitizing machines properly and cleaning entire stations. I enjoyed meeting and greeting new customers this was also one of my most favorite times of the day. The most difficult time of the job was not having enough hours. I enjoyed making coffee.
good,"Customers and the partners you work with will make your day and will become your friends for life. The quick-paced day will have time fly by being a barista. However, for the manager, this will challenge your time management skills, while balancing labor and coaching your team."
good,"It's a great job, it requires a lot of communication, the hardest part is probably memorizing the drinks, but it'll later on come natural. It can be stressful at times, but for the most part it's a relaxed and fun place to work at."
good,"Entreprise agréable,direction à l'écoute, horaires avantageux pour le secteur de la restauration, entreprise favorisant la formation et l'évolution en interne. Beaucoup d'opportunités, que ce soit sur ce site ou sur d'autre sites faisant partis du même groupe."
good,"Starbucks is a decent company to work for, they do have great benefits. Work just becomes overwhelming after a while and they expect way too  much from their employees for such a low pay rate. All employees are expected to be cross-trained in multiple roles across the store. Most shifts are stressful and morale is challenged in these times. I never really felt appreciated from my store manager and assistant manager who were never really there."
good,Nothing special to add at this point.   Very relaxed overall as s company and standards. I was lucky to have great peers and employees working with me.
good,Things are always busy. Pay could be a lot better. Management can vary by store you are at. One store I was at was a nightmare. Other store I went to absolutely love. It’s like a little family. We have fun and make coffee.
good,"A typical day at Starbucks is usually busy especially in the mornings until the afternoon,  if you’re lucky. Our store has a drive-thru and café so there’s about 14 people that come in to work throughout the day. Not all Starbucks’s are this way or as busy as my store, but it does get stressful and overwhelming. There’s always people there to help you most of the time when you need it. Starbucks is a great place if you feel that you can work in a fast pace working environment,  a quick learner and friendly all at the same time. Starbucks has helped me come out of my shell of being shy and to stick up and speak up for myself when I need to. The management team at my store don’t always commincate like they should during some situations but work as hard as possible to make the store run smoothly as can be. The best part about my job is that you meet some really great people that end up being your bestfriends and have some really great times with in/outside of work. The most challenging moments can become that tention if there are arguments with coworkers or if a customer is unhappy. Sometimes I feel like our customers are always in a rush and expect everything to be fast and don’t always ask for what they want. When a customer is upset when we hand them their drink, it’s not what they told us from the  beginning or leave out something to remake the drink all over , those are the moments when it get frustrating. Our store was built like a fast food drive thru but, they don’t realize we can only go as fast as possible and make everything taste as best as possible for them."
good,"It has its pro and cons "
good,very dissatisfied with upper management and lost focus of the basic job.  i had interned on making ths my career however after 2 different gms that were not doing there job and i was picking up slack i chose to move one
good,Strabucks overall as a company they are a very clean and organized organization and I really do promote the company. Just working here it was lack of hours.
good,Its good at first but then people like to change up everything. Its not the best at keeping it the same. You have to want a constantly changing environment and not an stable job.
good,i love waking for starbucks but they won't promote me and its nit worth the pay  i work so hard and don't get rewarded of for it. i wish  they gave us 6 month raises again.
good,"it may have just been the business of my store, but it was pretty much constantly busy apart from a few hours in the day, and during Christmas/summer/fesitval/school holidays, it was mobbed. this made it hard to stock up, keep on top of orders, deal with customers in an efficient manner or even breathe. colleagues seem to forget that at the end of the day its just a coffee shop and the world won't end if you forget to day dot a muffin."
good,The first time I've worked there was ok but as time progressed customers got more complicated but I did meet some cool people over there and the coffe was great
good,"I worked at a licensed Starbucks that was very close to a corporate Starbucks. Corporate Starbucks hurt our business. Many of our customers would get annoyed because we didn't carry all the items a corporate Starbucks would carry. "
good,benefits are nice but pay is low.  work on your feet all day.  partners are receive great benefits and job security but it seems middle management is under a lot of scrutiny and the pay wouldn't match the work.
good,Unlimited complimentary beverages during working shifts is definitely a great perk. I learned how to team build and manage employees to meet store standards and fulfill criteria in a customer setting. Plenty of customer conversations and interactions that makes the job and atmosphere fun. The hardest part of the job was time management and fast paced environment. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting many new faces and networking with them.
good,"This job has taught me to move at a fast past, but to also be able to be independent, and work at a team  Starbucks has shown me the importance of communication and that no matter how big or small the task is that you have to put your all into. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers and the connections you make."
good,Great part time job. It is a very hard place to work if you can't memorize lots of recipies or processes. If you can't handle pressure with a smile and a good attitude don't even apply. You could have a great interview and get hired but ruin the brand and make it hard on the partners working with you. If you have awesome people skills and love the challenge of continuase improving change go for it. Only those with excellent people skills and an ability to work with and serve a diverse of personalities should apply.
good,"The time with my first manager was amazing. I saw all the benefits of working there come to fruition within my first 2 months and the manager was phenomenal. Wasn't a coffee drinker at first but the environment changes you. Stressful in the sense that you may burn your tongue, your hands, and you're constantly dealing with people who have yet to have their morning coffee. But it's doable. Quick-paced yet stress free."
good,"Weekdays during the school year are fun and slower paced. "
good,"Busy, work environment, opportunities to move up with the company, flexible hours for students, good increase in salary and job allows an individual to learn multiple skills."
good,"The management is very unprofessional."
good,"Other than remembering recipes and handling situations, it's a very productive workplace. There is never a moment where there is nothing to do. You are always cleaning, preparing drinks, restocking and speaking with customers no matter your position."
good,"Depending on what location, management is either amazing or not, as any other job. The customers are always fun and talkative. It's a great place to work if you're outgoing. Starbucks hires such unique people, you'll meet such interesting partners. The hardest part about the job would be the lack of labor you are given and working a rush with poor coverage."
good,"As manager I oversee my coworkers and ensure they do their part so the team runs as efficiently as possible. I learned how to be a leader and to work through stressful situations. The Starbucks I work at is a on campus, so the workplace culture is very fun. Working with my coworkers is the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"If both coworkers and management are cohesive and hard working, then starbucks is an amazing place to work. If not, this place will drain the life out of you."
good,"Workplace was stressful, always busy. Customers are very precise about products. Coworkers are demanding and rude. There is much unfairness within the workplace."
good,"Working for Starbucks has been rewarding, policy changes now without notice so following standards set for us is becoming harder.  It's not an easy position to stay in"
good,"It's definitely a fine place to work. The benefits are nice and everyone is treated well. On the downside, I've experienced inconsistency in hours from multiple store managers. Also multiple stores I've worked at are frequently understaffed. Stress is also often high."
good,"Working here is pretty cool. Love the people, the community and their dedication to their coffee beverages. Management and staff training can definitely be improved."
good,"The hardest part of the job is difficult customers, then you have your regulars that will make your day. Depending on the store location it can be very busy and stressful. Being able to multitask is a must."
good,"Starbucks takes great care of all of their employees. Arguably the best benefits for part-time workers. However, managers are loosely governed and can lead to the decay of stores. Also, labor was cut last year and the effects are easily felt. We work much harder with less people on the floor."
good,Starbucks so far has treated me well. It brings in amazing and different cultures from customers and partners. Every day something new is going on or we get out usual customers that always get their usual.It really as a great environment to work and be in.
good,"This job just really wasn't the motivation I was looking for but it was a nice paying job, great employees but managers wasn't really organized when it came to scheduling and handling small situations."
good,"Starbucks is a great company with a fantastic outlook, the partners that work there are all fantastic. I adhere to the personable and global views that Starbucks as a company upholds. The most enjoyable part of the job is customer interaction, which is also the most difficult part of the job. Oftentimes interactions with the starbucks being on disney property can be draining, but equally as often they can be rewarding."
good,"I think the work/life balance of Starbucks is great. If you're just trying to take home a paycheck w/ benefits while pursuing other interests in your free time, Starbucks is the place to be. Our store recently had a management change which is why I left. Also, be prepared to work your butt off!"
good,"Management needs a lot of work at the Starbucks I currently work at. My boss will retaliate against me whether or not I actually do something wrong. For example, I am barely working any hours currently."
good,required a lot of skills including basic barista skill and attention in cleanings. Friendly working environment provided as part of the company culture.
good,"This job is fast paced customer service. You are constantly moving, working, and getting things done. Team oriented job culture makes coming to work fun."
good,"fun place to work if you don't need a lot of money. how good job is depends entirely on the management at each store. good discounts. downer, u always smell like coffee."
good,"Fast paced and stressful but overall a good first real job. Decent place to work while in college. Cleaned, made beverages, customer service, promotional selling of products."
good,"Starbucks was a great job while I attended college. I considered making a career out of it, but other things came into play. My final manager was my deciding factor, unfortunately she was not a good leader and made the choice to leave the company easy. Previous to my experience with her all other managers were amazing. It was always a fun job, even in the midst of the rush."
good,"Starbucks is great if you have a side job bringing in additional income. "
good,The job is really hard. you have to know so many things and you deal with many many people in your day. you are always standing and only sit for your break. I worked a lot of overtime and didnt get much time off.
good,"Expect to work hard. Have good work ethic. Work in small quarters."
good,"Starbucks is just another company, you can't really expect much from them. What really makes the work environment worth it is the people that you work with. I love my fellow baristas but you might not be as lucky because you can't get along with everyone. Customers can make or break your day, they tend to get really mean. There's a lot of cleaning involved in this job, you do dishes all day, I don't know, working at Starbucks isn't a life-long career, but it's fine for like working through college or when you're at a crossroads."
good,"The job was great. I had great colleagues, but found that management was the real issue. Not only was my manager rude, but they used tactics such as constantly telling someone the same way they are messing up, as well as threatening to send them home early if they aren't more over the top outgoing, which I found irritated and demeaned workers, and their unique personalities, more than it aided them in improving. Iv'e met great friends and had great times at Starbucks, so not to say it was all horrible. "
good,"Being a barista can be very fun, you work together as a team and meet really great people. However corporate standards contradict each at times and and training for both baristas and managers needs to be more comprehensive."
good,"While I worked there, we had mediocre management. It seemed as if no other managers cared about cleanliness enough to delegate tasks correctly. Customers can basically walk all over us and verbally degrade us to a certain extent. If your management isn't great, the store basically falls apart as to be expected. When employees voice their opinions on what needs to be done, we are acknowledged but nothing changes. We are constantly understaffed and the company keeps rolling out more difficult recipes every season/holiday. It is a fast food like company."
good,"Fun place to work. Meet tons of new people. You learn how to talk and be confident. Keeps you busy. Management is a pain sometimes. Horrible hours, like 18 a week."
good,Great customers but the culture isn't that great. Schedule isn't that flexible. Employees weren't that great to work with. Management was okay. Very fast paced environment.
good,SM's only get 10 hours a week to manage the business and then must be floor coverage for the other 30.  If a partner calls out and you can't find coverage you have to go in to work.  SM's are the only salaried partners at each store so every single aspect of managing the store falls on them.........did I mention we only get 10 hours a week to do that?
good,Hectic work environment thats very mentally demanding.  The benefits were nice but the management and staff that was available was limited and set others back constantly.
good,"As much as I loved working  with my coworkers at Starbucks, it was difficult to deal with management, especially since it wasn't an actual corporate store. Working on campus was harder, because we had more traffic with the amount of students and faculty that came in 24/7. If we ran out of inventory, communication became an issue with higher ups, since they struggled to make accommodations that were needed for the products we were trying to sell (ex. repurchasing inventory for drinks, fixing broken appliances). Nonetheless, I loved the culture, and it felt like I had a family while spending the past two years there."
good,"Its cool. Getting started and getting the hang of the recipes and procedures takes a while. It can be overwhelming. Drive through times are prioritized. Customer service should come first, there is no chance to make a connection there."
good,I really loved working for Starbucks but felt it was place to work for when you're in school not somewhere you can have a family. The management above me was awful at giving us time off and respecting our life outside of work. I would suggest this to young people because with Starbucks being all the rage it is VERY fast paced.
good,"fun time working there on the daily"
good,"Starbucks is a good place to work overall, but they do not offer competitive pay. But they do offer a lot of other benefits, such as health insurance, 401k match, and free tuition to ASU online. However, personally, proper compensation is more important at this time in my life. Store Managers are mostly great, but upper management is out of touch and do not trust in or understand the daily problems of the staff in their retail stores. The job is very fast paced, but relatively easy once you get the hang of it. Most baristas will tell you it takes about 3 months to get good. They also offer free beverages during your shifts, a free coffee markout every week, a free food markout every shift, and a 30% discount when you're not working. Overall, it's a good job with opportunities for advancement, but the upper management can be frustrating and they do not pay as well as they should for what a successful company they are."
good,"If you are motivated and willing to teach yourself, this job is very comfortable and can be fun with your coworkers. Must be prepared to always be covering shifts or not having all the staff you need to work comfortably per work flow."
good,"Was fun while it lasted.  Company was growing quickly to take on the world.  Love the coffee, miss the free pound per week.  Learned a lot working there."
good,"The store manager was a bit over the top sometimes. She would yell at you for crazy things like having two toned hair, or natural hair that was too curly. I did get a lot of hours working there. Although i did once injure myself while on the job, and was unable to go to the doctors because the staffs lack of knowledge about incident reports. They were unable to provide me with insurance information the whole time i worked there. The district manager would sit in the store and yell at the employees for taking longer than 15 seconds to get a customer through the drivethru."
good,"I loved working for Starbucks because of the wonderful benefits they give their employees, however, the pay rate was too low and there was very little room for advancement"
good,"Fun, fast paced  environment where  everyday is different. You move  around  in a variety of  positions constantly learning and  challenging yourself. Everyday you get to connect with customers, learn names, drinks and  have  fun."
good,"Starbucks is a great company, but I think that employees are underpaid considering how hard they work. I love the people that I work with and we make the job as fun as we can. It is very hard to work in customer service."
good,"Working for Starbucks definitely has its good sides, but they have unrealistic expectations for how many people can get the amount of tasks done at a time while giving the quality of customer service their costumers deserve. As an employee you feel pulled far too thin. The perks are good though, and the relationships you make with your fellow partners will last forever."
good,The staff is poorly chosen and the mangers have poor skills. No body really cares about their job. There were no consequences to anyone's actions. Continuous no call no shows and call outs. People showed up late for work constantly. It was no the type of imenvironment I want to be working in.
good,"Fun, fast paced work environment. Company has high standards for customer experience, cleanliness, product knowledge. Must learn customers names or drinks. Overwhelming at first to get recipes down and techniques."
good,"Even though the company always talk about how much they value partners, they are usually hiring external for management possession with more pay than an internal hire. If you want to grow a career in Starbucks you are much better off leaving the company and trying your luck  for a better position from outside.  its an amazing place to work as long as you have good management team, however more often you will end-up having an external manager walking in who has no clue about the business and will most likely make work life miserable for you for at least few years till they understand what is actually going on. All that said i still highly recommend Starbucks for students and part-time workers.  As long as you are not to ambitious of growing within the company you will be fine and work environment is far better than most other fast food giants."
good,"A fun job but low pay and getting a raise is difficult. Becoming a sjift supervisor will also take years if you have the wrong type of manager. I love my coworkers and working peak is super fun, just not worth it."
good,"I start my day at 5:30 in the morning, I will set up pastry display and stock everything that will require my addition. Complete daily tasks such as cleaning, stocking, making beverages and connecting with customers."
good,"Loved working with a vast group of people.  Fun, fast paced environment.  Great benefits.  Working in retail management has challenges with the type of people who can sometimes be employed."
good,"it is a good company"
good,"Management works with your schedule, so this is a good place for those in high school or college. Eight to nine hour days typically, with a thirty minute break. Pay starts at $9 an hour"
good,"Overall, the work enviornment is fun and productive. The company offers benefits and allows each individual employee to grow in the company if they so desire. My only complaint is that baristas don't get paid enough for all the work they do. The system used to consist of an individual evaluation every 6 months where if one did well, one would get a small raise. This allowed motivation and encouragement to always do yours best. Now however, It's a small raise for everyone every year which isn't fair to those who put in a lot of effort and hard work. It's not right that after almost 3 years of being with the company, I make as much as a partner who is just hired."
good,I worked at Starbucks for almost three years and was promoted while there. It's a job that pays well but the amount of constant change and unorganized management is extremely hard to ever like. It fun interacting with the regulars and building those relationships but overall  its hard and stressful.
good,I loved working here. They really take care of their enployees. Not much of a pay though. You get tips every week. Can't really move up. Unless you already had management experience else where.
good,"A typical day, you're on your feet a lot and you're gonna get sticky and messy. There will be customer's you adore and customers you'd love to be able to serve spoiled milk to and not get in trouble. The company has great benefits, but some days you'll feel like the amount of work isn't worth the benefits or the unpleasant people you sometimes have to put up with. It's a good environment to work in most of the time, every job has it's off days. There will always be decisions that corporate makes that a large amount of employees don't agree with and that is with any job, not just Starbucks. It is what it is, not the worst job in the world and not the be all end all of jobs either."
good,"Very fun work environment. Will make lifelong friends with both your fellow employees and your customers. Fast paced, and always keeps you on your toes. Never a dull moment!"
good,"Great place to work, temporarily. I have made great connections with customer as well as my other partners. If you have a good manager and co-workers-- it's a good place to work"
good,"Wonderful environment and support for baristas.."
good,"Typically fast paced environment. I enjoyed my fellow employees company. I enjoyed conversations with customers and making drinks. I feel the company should pay their employees more, however I did appreciate the benefits they offered ( great health insurance)."
good,"Management had switched towards the end of my career with Starbucks, creating a few bumps along the road; but was overall a pleasant, great learning experience and opportunity. Respect is a huge element of the company, as well as having pride and care in what you're doing."
good,Loved working for this company when the focus was connecting with the customers. Their shift away from this made it a more cold and sterile place to work.
good,The people in this job is great. But the owner doesnt seem to care. We have no benefits and schedules are all over the place. Management is sometimes hard to get a hold of.
good,"Have been working for more than 3 years now."
good,Good steady job and good tips but can be very fast paced as well as having to deal with alot at once. Also everyone needs to be on top of their game or a shift can run badly.
good,i'm so happy with my job..my co-workers they will happy also to work with me.the most enjoyable part my job is we clean the sea side.I learned this can of job is to be a good leader.
good,"A typical day at work consists of making sure my crew is prepared, ready and in their right places to start the work day. We serve a variety of coffees, pastries and sandwiches."
good,What I like this company is their culture.   They will hire you regardless of your background and they  embrace   diverity.  To add they give employees room to grow.
good,The shift can be a rude a lot especially if your new. Overall its a cool calm job to work at . The customors make your day more than anything though..
good,hey never encouraged you or rewarded you for doing a good job but definitely let you know if your not at %100 for loading or picking. This is one of the worst jobs I've ever had because they expect way too much from one person. They tell you when you are hired that you can pick your schedule but when you actually start they say it's mandatory that you work at least 56 hours a week. My co-workers were pretty easy to work with
good,"Every store is different. The job can be stressful, but that depends on the manager and your team. Over the years the company has started to slack on their values and begun to focus more on the numbers. A lot of outside hiring is done for managing positions, which I do not believe should be done because important lower-level positions are not learned as well as they should be and complications tend to show within the store."
good,"Get in and get right to work. funny coworkers, chatting all shift. Lots of cleaning, building craft coffee drinks and providing excellent customer service. Overall it's fast paced and your shift is over before you know it."
good,"Everyday at Starbucks is like living life in fast-forward. You learn a lot about the Starbucks brand of coffee as well as what should be done to best interact and serve customers. Unfortunately, there's no enforcement on good customer service, so if you are focused on that you are probably the only one in your store being kind to customers. Just like any job, there are good and not-so-good coworkers. Typically everyone is super kind and if they aren't, they're normally gone within the month from my observations. There is very high turnover. No matter how hard you work, the company seems to prefer hiring higher level partners, e.g. shift supervisors and managers, from outside the company. It's much easier to get hired on as one of these then to start at entry-level and be promoted, despite your knowledge and experience."
good,"I draw, paint and do watercolors.  I had an art exhibition of 6 of my paintings.  It was great to see that people in Starbucks enjoyed them so much that I sold them all."
good,Starbucks has been a great employer for me while I completing my undergraduate degree. The benefits are exceptional for an hourly retail position.
good,worked there as a barista and barista trainer. fun environment. liked making drinks. starbucks has changed a lot over the years.
good,Company is a great one to work for while going through college but the hour changing causes issues for people on their own or with family. Most people are great to work with but there are always bad apples and I guess the job is okay as a skill builder and stepping stone.
good,"I love this place, but honestly the pay could be better. There is a great sense of community at Starbucks, but this was due to the partners and my experience was great until we got a new Store Manager. If i worked with this person, it ruined my day, honestly it was the worst. There are a great deal of positives within the Starbucks community, but sometimes the experience can be rotten thanks to one individual."
good,"I enjoyed working for people and helping them, but it does not pay very well. It also seems like you do the same exact thing every day."
good,Starbucks is great about the benefits they provide for partners. However it is usually always busy so don't apply if you think it'll be easy.
good,Its stressful job and very demanding. The team work is satisfying a lot your esteem. There are big sales targets and there is small guidance for this.
good,"Its a customer service retail setting."
good,"wok hours flexible"
good,"The co-workers are fantastic people who are from all walks of life, but the managerial side is a completely different story. Advancement was hard to come by because a majority of the people wanted to move up in the company. Raises were given after evaluations every 6 months, but were hindered by the DM. The lack of appreciation through actions like raises, awards, etc, where completely noticed. Everyone I worked with has since moved on to different locations or quit the company entirely."
good,"This place is amazing to work, incredibly flexible and take care of their employees. Excellent benefits and fast-paced environment, so you are never bored. Can be stressful when super-busy, but the customers make you feel like family."
good,"Great culture, but difficult work/life balance. Wonderful to have worked for such a forward thinking company. The expectations for store managers seem very high. My peers and I would consistently work 50+hour weeks between floor time and admin time. There's more to life than that."
good,"As an employee for over two years I was able to move up quickly and gain great experience in a small amount of time. If you are a hard and determined worker you could do the same. Depending on the area you live in, the quality of  management can be inconsistent. I do not believe Starbucks as a company places much value in their employees. As a two year partner I have had my job threatened several times by various managers while at the same time receiving awards and recognition from other managers for my hard work. Overall, Starbucks is a good company to work for. The benefits/perks, such as free coffee throughout one's shift, a thirty percent discount at any corporately owned location, one free food item per shift, a free pound of coffee per week, as well as healthcare discounts, etc. make it a hard company to leave even when given poor circumstances (which is not always the case as mentioned before it is subject to location and manager)."
good,I learned so much from this company. It helped me grow as a person. The hardest part of the job was when people would call off constantly and there was no coverage. Overall they give you great benefits and are flexible with your schedule.
good,"I loved creating hand-crafted beverages and sharing my passion for coffee. Unfortunately, the pay was way too low to survive on and moving up in the company is nearly impossible."
good,"Honing my multi-tasking skills, while focusing on great customer service, & working a team environment. "
good,"A typical day of work consists of running a team between 3-8 employees, while completing daily management tasks and updates, and also delegating responsibilities in a timely manner."
good,disconnect with management and employees.  hard work is not usually acknowledged...people tend to get away with whatever they want
good,"typically we are very busy, but i love keeping busy and interacting with customers. I work early in the mornings at Starbucks and love the benefits they have to offer. However i am tired of working at Starbucks and coming home smelling like coffee."
good,"As a Starbucks employee you should setup everything that will be used."
good,"It can get really busy, and I would say that the baristas do not get paid enough despite the wonderful benefits. I would suggest that you apply if you can be on your feet, have great organizational skills, and are a people person."
good,"During my time at Starbucks I learned a lot not only about various types of coffee and how to accurately and efficiently make them, but I also learned about communication and creating personal relationships with my customers and coworkers.  Being a barista is about more than just making coffee (although that is a crucial skill), it is about memorizing the regulars and what they want to drink, learning names, and being agreeable and flexible. The more technical things I worked with was the machinery, being on a STRICT time schedule, memorizing over 100 drinks, and operating the cash registers and customer bills. My position was seasonal and therefore brief."
good,"Nice staff, good management, ability to learn a lot of information about coffee. nice environment, busy airport keeps you on track"
good,"Make coffee for all sorts of people. interact with people, unload product and build relationships with regular customers and first time customers. learned how to communicate better with people, make coffee, work under pressure. Co-workers were nice and respectful and fun to work with. Nothing too difficult about the work or work place. Most enjoyable part at Starbucks was the late shifts with fellow friends and of course the perks."
good,"Starbucks is as fun a place to work as any restaurant, from the constant in-flow of orders, and customers, to the constant upkeep of the store. "
good,"Every Starbucks has a unique group of individuals working there. The job is way too stressful, but a decent starter job."
good,"Busy and friendly environment 90% of the time."
good,"Starbucks is an interesting work experience. I was employed at an extremely busy drive-thru location that served a high volume of people commuting from the affluent suburbs to downtown Atlanta. The work itself is fairly typical of a corporate fast food chain, complete with baffling top-down decision making. "
good,"I only worked for Starbucks for a short time, however I feel that they were very organized, and steeped in the coffee, and gourmet foodie subculture. It made working their fun!  A typical day at Starbucks was to come in, and prep the coffees to be served to the customers, and to make sure the work areas were cleaned, and prepped and fully stocked.  Also to log in and start assisting customers right away, and to be pleasant and welcoming to all of the customers who came in."
good,"A typical day is quite simple are same, with a routine to follow."
good,"They are totally unprofessional, they have favorites and if you aren't one then they will not hesitate to fire you for anything."
good,"A typical day at work includes everything from taking money, to making drinks, to hauling supplies across the store. I've learned a lot about others and myself in the process. Management in my store has been very good with customers, but disorganized in scheduling at times. My co-workers are some of the most interesting and life-long friends. The hardest part of the job is the physical stress that being a barista puts on your body and the lack of respect many clients show toward baristas. The most enjoyable part of the job is also people, because learning about people and interacting with them is a rewarding experience."
good,"Upper level management would schedule with no regard to previously submitted time off, and punish employees when they didn't come in. They would also schedule minors for 10 hour work days regularly. Huge rift between management and starting level employees as well. The actual job was the saving grace because it is fast paced but fun, and the customers were great!"
good,"This job was a fun workplace. Very jolly partners and helpful too. One of the best managers I have worked with. I really like the management because they don't leave partners working alone, they actually help out. I love making beverages but the hardest part is when it gets really busy in the mornings and it is hard to keep up with an order especially when a customer order food and pastries. But besides that, it is a very enjoyable place to work at. We get tips every week but this job is only a temporal job, usually for college students who want to earn just a little extra money. I never got more than 30hrs/week in this job"
good,"Great partners, amazing team work regardless of the state of business, we all support ourselves and was fun. Good oppornutiy to meet diverse people, increase my listening skills and problem solving skills."
good,"So the co-workers that were already at the store i was hired at were people I had known for a long time and they were all people that i had gotten in fights with, had falling outs with, and had even been robbed by one of them."
good,"I miss this job strictly for my regulars that would come in. I was a shift manager and literally received phone calls daily from the upper managers cursing me out because of the smallest of matters. To top it off the schedule is not flexible and the hours are spotty. Great for a summer job, not for a career."
good,"I work hear for the health benefits. It is an easy job but I want to be challenged! Its an open company so you can move around, transfer. etc... The hours are somewhat fickle; your shifts can be cut or extended. Otherwise its a great company with perks as long as you fallow guest service rules!"
good,Fun at times although it depends on who management is. Which it can either make or break how you feel from day to day. Being able to be creative with drinks
good,"They take advantage of people who enjoy books. Those are the ones who chose to work at bookstores, after all. There's always the constant threat of being fired if you can't sell the membership cards (analyzed weekly). The books are great, the people are great, the co-workers tend to be great, but the company itself is greedy. I remember selling the card and one of the big selling points was the promise we made that you locked in the price of the card when you bought it so if you chose to do the automatic renewal, the price would never go up. Well, the company found a loop hole in the wording, and used it to increase the price of those who had the automatic renewal. They made us all out to be liars. We promised those customers one thing and then suddenly it wasn't true anymore. That was one of the things I really couldn't forgive."
good,very busy constantly working. but its fun time passes by quick. you learn cool things on how to make coffee. very easy to pick up.make connections and friends
good,"I plan out my day in quarterly basis so I know my priorities and can make necessary adjustments needed."
good,"For the most part my co workers and I always got along, the management was out of control, we had a new manager every month, we were always understaffed, and we were training people while trying to do our jobs and so it was always just very hectic."
good,"Entering Starbucks was a big thing for me in life because it allowed me to work in an environment where I was able to learn so many skills I will take on with me to any job, although it is a very busy work place we we are trained to all coordinate together in a timely and reasonable manner."
good,"fun, fast paced work environment. there was a lot of competing amongs co-workers on the bar in terms of speed and quality."
good,"When I was pregnant, I had a high-risk pregnancy.  My manager and fellow partners were extremely supportive.  I don't have a very close relationship with my family and was not planning on having a baby shower.  One night after close, as we were about to leave, all of the store partners including our manager showed up with pizza, cake, balloons & presents to throw me a surprise baby shower.  One of them even made a baby bib out of a green apron for my son.  This is what the partner experience should be."
good,"Starbucks to me is for younger workers. It was too fast paced for me. I don't have anything bad to say about them, it was just that I worked in a starbuck's within a grocery store so I don't know if that played a part. But, i hadn't been trained on the cash register and the manager left me there for 30 minutes with minimal training, and we lost customers because I didn't know how to properly make drinks they were ordering nor did i know how to do cash register. But all in all, I think it is a good company. I just had a bad experience."
good,It's a great job but you dont want to get stuck here. The pay isn't really that great but you do get good benefits from this job. It also isn't fair how new hires have the same pay as people who have been with the company 6+.
good,Loved where I was before I left. It's all about bonding with your team while at work and getting into a work flow that makes everything easier. Keeping your partners happy means customers will get a better experience.
good,my co workers are great to work with and outside of work they are just as great. they are all hard working and do there job to the fullest
good,"Slow progression from coffee shop to fast food isn't what I want to be a part of."
good,"As a Licensed Starbucks Manager, you will rarely have support from the big box management wherever your store is located.  For me it was located in a grocery store called Giant Food Stores, LLC.  Giant management had little to no knowledge of what it takes to run a Starbucks.  Therein lies the problem.  When as a licensed store management, I was reliant on Giant HR to do all hiring, so I had no say as to who was given to me when a barista quit (which happened frequently enough).  I was frequently given unmotivated individuals that didn't have the skills or work ethic to protect the brand and uphold the Starbucks standards of excellence.  When approaching management about issues that needed to be resolved, the responses were mainly of the ""I'll get to it,"" or ""not my problem,"" nature.  Though the stores need to function as a team, it largely feels like each department is a nation of former enemies with a patchy treaty.  Everyone will be nice, but the second help is needed there will be no support given. There is absolutely no separation between home life and work life either.  I have spent hours on the phone with my staff to resolve problems AFTER working 10 hour days. On the positive though, Giant took a major leap and showed their true appreciation of the 6 years I had given them but giving me a pay rate of $2+ an hour higher that what my position starts at.  I truly felt treasured by that gesture.  As in any work situation one must take the good with the bad I suppose."
good,It is a great company part-time. The benefits are great as long as you maintain 20 hours a week. Trying to advance in the company is difficult due to the fact that most managers are outside hires.
good,"Sin saberlo preparar un café es un mundo aparte, si quieres que realmente sea una buena taza de café. aprender a distinguir los distintos sabores y aromas, las catas, es bastante difícil al principio ya que no estas acostumbrado y todo te sabe igual. Una ves aprendido ese mundo es una maravilla."
good,"I have really enjoyed working at starbucks these last two years and moving up in the company. I love working with other people but also being able to take a leadership role and put my two cents in. While working for the company i have been able to move up and not only work on work ethic but also myself as a person. The only criticism i have would be the management. Recently i feel that the store manager is not able to draw the line between coaching so people can do there job better, and just plainly putting people down and making them feel bad so that they are less productive."
good,"I have worked for Starbucks for 6 years, it has provided me with great opportunities, but the income is not liveable. The training of baristas has lost much of it's depth, and is not producing the same experienced work force as it once was."
good,"This job offers clear sales goals that need to be met every week. Multi-tasking is a must and it must be done with grace and high customer service."
good,"you'll learn about how drinks are made, how Stocking and Maintaining is vital. Co-workers will help when asked. Overall , this place has much to offer when it comes to retail."
good,"Generally a good job, but definitely stressful and harsh at times. Corporate policies and procedures could use some work; very unrealistic. Flexible hours though, and decent wage."
good,I star work by setting up the store in the more. Make sure peak runs smooth and everyone is in the place they need to be. the hardest part is understanding what they day is going to look like since it changes ever day and every hour you sometime don't know how busy or slow it would be. but i really enjoy the free drink i get when working in a day and the free coffee ever week i get to take home. my co-worker are great and easy to get along with. my manager is always willing to help me out though the day or with any projects i am working on. i
good,typical day would be to make coffee and pastries. i learned how to pull expresso shots and ground coffee beans. the management was exceptional. co worker were exceptional. the hardest part of the job would be dealing with the customers. most enjoyable part of the job would be dealing with the customers.
good,"great company but no hours unless you prove yourself to the manager. lots of hard work for 10.00 an hour. you have to be fast on your feet, this job is for the young not anyone over 30."
good,A day at work when I worked for Starbucks was very fast pace. got along with every co-worker I shared the kiosk with. Days went by fast since it was always so busy with costumers. I would definitely work there again. Everyone worked productively and to there best abilities. the most enjoyable part of this job was to please the customers and make sure they had everything they needed.
good,"Working there was fun.  I found that the management wasn't the best, but there was always something to do and always room for improvement.  The pay was pretty decent and there was always advancement in your position."
good,"Typical day involves lots of cleaning, stocking, and preparing for the next morning shift. I work closing shifts most often from 4-8:15pm which means I'm most often by myself. I've learned how to make tons of fun beverages and how to keep lots of things clean and sanitary. Like I said, I mostly work alone but when I am with coworkers they are amazing people to have fun with. The hardest part of the job so far was trying to get everything cleaned up and stocked so I could be ready to leave by 8:15. What I enjoy most is making tons of fun beverages and getting to taste them all the time."
good,"The job was pretty straight forward, once you got the hang of routine to make bevearges. The job however, was not advertised as a sales job nor did it seem like one when I first started but a few years ago it has begun being run more and more like other businesses losing its niche. "
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work when going through college. They work around your hours and compensate you for classes that apply to your job."
good,Was a very busy environment with little down time but that made the time pass by very quickly. Wonderful benefits but the management was a tad scatterbrained.
good,"A typical work day consists of continuous stocking and restocking cups, lids, coffee products, and the other various foods and drinks used to make custom drinks. Also, this job requires a good memory for recipes and formulas. Some things are made the exact same way but with different ingredients, or with the same ingredients but in a different way. You must know which recipe is for what, avid Starbucks customers WILL KNOW THE DIFFERENCE. This job also requires a good deal of physical strength and stamina, as well as mental stability. "
good,"At Starbucks, I was scheduled to open the store, every day, at 4:15am. We had customers in line from 5am to 2pm, without pause. With a decent level of behind-the-counter organization and management, the rapid execution of custom espresso beverages could provide a degree of excitement. Many stores I worked at, however, were challenged with developing an organized division of labor, and production often felt slow and clumsy."
good,"Making drinks in a timely accurate manner."
good,"Personally, my store was not as great, but the overall culture was wonderful. I love the store and what it stands for, but i found it ridiculous that we were asked to do things that machines do. We were often given almost impossible standards for things, and no one could reach them. Especially in stores that could not afford to keep a lot of people on the clock. "
good,"Starbucks is a wonderful place for a student or young adult looking to develope their customer skills. Partners work in a faced paced environment, handle cash and are trusted to do daily and weekly tasks of their own. Starbucks offers great benefits for even part-timers, stocks that build up cash flow, partner beverages on every break, 30% off partner discount on all merchendise, and partner markouts (one free pound of coffee or tea)."
good,"The most enjoyable about this job is getting to know the costumers and the management are very professional. Working as a Batista for a year now I've learned many things such as how to manage time and efficiency, coffee skills and customer service."
good,if your looking for a simple job like any other job. then Starbucks is a good part-time company. its not a career. it doesn't pay well for the economy that we will live in.
good,"Worked as a shift supervisor for 2 years and was miserable. The store could not afford an assistant manager so I was tasked with all the duties but a mere $1 pay raise. My responsibilities crept up %300 as I was in charge of : All store ordering, creating schedule, safe and cash counts as well as bank deposits, cleaning, serving customers, responding to emails, phone calls and inquires, running breaks and getting yelled at by angry customers while supervising a team of up to 7 people and serving upwards of 400 customers in a 4 hour period. The shifts were 5am one day and 11am the next making it very difficult to adjust to the times and my manager called in sick %80 of the time and provided no extra workers when promotions doubled our customer counts. Over worked and under paid , I have nothing good to say about Starbucks."
good,Se aprende mucho de todo pero empieza a transformarse en una empresa normal como otras.
good,I was hired at starbucks at 17 years old. I had previously had a few nanny jobs but nothing so dependent on social skills. I learned so much in that first year of work; from relying on coworkers to how to make a connection with a customer in a short amount of time. This is a fantastic job for those in high school or just starting college.
good,"I have worked for starbucks two times in my life. Both times were actually very pleasant. Learned a lot about coffee, and became interested highly in it. My management was not the best, but that was just from personal experience that i say. I know quite a few stores that have wonderful management. Co-workers were great and friendly, always willing to learn, and help out. To me there is really nothing hard about this job. Drinking coffee, and interacting with the regulars was my most enjoyable part of this job."
good,Target will help build and prepare you for the real world. It is a good place to start. The management team does have some problems with communicating with each other and to some of the departments but otherwise the store ensures full time hours when requested.
good,"Starbucks has it's pros and cons. Great benefits even for part time workers. Although some of the corp. changes make the work place not as fun as it used to be. Pay is ok, tips kind of help. People are nice to work with. Sometimes it's tough to keep with everything."
good,"Is a good job that doesn't follow you home, great for those working multiple jobs, in school, raising children."
good,Enjoyed being a barista but Starbucks benefits do not make up for how baristas are treated. They are changing to try to accommodate baristas work/life balance.
good,"L'équipe est soudée, les employés sont la pour s'aider et relever les défis et répondre aux attentes des clients "
good,the job required alot of novertime sometimes 14to 16 hrs a day sometimes 7 days a week for like a 3 week period. the life and work balance did not equal therefore it was a not i deal.
good,"A typical day consisted of making drinks, cleaning, making food, and getting to know your costumers on your down time. If your shy now after working at Starbucks you no longer will be. The hardest part about working at Starbucks is that its very busy all the time and sometimes your rocking the bar all by yourself for hours."
good,set up take order make drinks know customers clean store moving at face pace get along with staff have fun at work
good,"Store Managers currently work 30+ hours a week on the floor (running a register, making coffee, making drinks), then there are schedules, payroll, reviews, store training meetings, individual meetings and training, meetings with your district manager 1:1 and with your entire district, and all of the promotional sale/set up planning, weekly training for staff on what's going on and changing... It's a great company to be a barista, or even a shift supervisor for, but once you get into the salaried position, say good bye to having a life.  As the manager you're responsible for making sure your store is staffed each day, so when someone calls off sick or just doesn't show up, guess who gets to go in if nobody else volunteers?  And hourly people aren't supposed to get overtime unless it's pre-approved by people two steps up the chain of command, so don't think about letting your die-hard, awesome team players do it, nope, YOU get to go in on your days off and work 10-12 hours a day on a regular basis.  It's challenging, exciting, and will burn you OUT, but the health care really is amazing and the bonuses and stock are nice  I recommend this job for mid 20's, single, workaholic types like I used to be :-)"
good,Starbucks is an OK place to work the benefits are good the compensation is reasonable but the work life balance is not for me.
good,"Skills I have learned through Starbucks "
good,"I enjoyed working shifts where all of my coworkers and myself were in sync with one another. Typically one or two people would be on the register, another would get the next person's order, one would be stocking, cleaning and making coffee and yet another would be making all ""bar drinks"" (lattes, frappuccinos, and iced beverages). It was pleasurable to make someone's day by knowing their name and drink and having it ready for them before they even got a chance to order."
good,"During the time I spent at the Starbucks Merchandise Mart I was give then opportunity to learn a lot about customer service. "
good,Lots of perks but very fast paced environment.  Friendly co-workers.
good,"Although I enjoy the job, I mostly picked it up for a little extra income.  My co-workers are mostly college kids and are easy to get along with."
good,"Nice, But airport was too loud and very very busy."
good,This Starbucks isn't a licensed store but offers a lot of great opportunities and benefits. The staff is fun to work with and management is fairly easy to communicate and get along with.
good,"Lots of fun, good culture to enjoy your work place. Good customer service experience for entry level employees."
good,Learned to use the cash and how to make good coffee.  Learned how to work with others and what good customer service was.  The hardest part of the job was that it was very far away from where I lived and I had no car at that time.  The most enjoyable parts of the job were making the drinks.
good,"starbucks is a great company to work for, providing many benefits and opportunities. very fast paced, and fun if you like the customer service world."
good,"Good availability, average compensation, and good management. "
good,"Every morning, depending on your scheduled time, you normally walk into a long line of serious customers and are immediately put to work. It's a great thing, being busy, it certainly helps the day go by faster, and of course the kind customer's make a day more enjoyable."
good,"Managing up to twelve barista’s at a time while providing schedules every week for the entire staff. Processing and receiving complete order for entire store while making sure order list matches inventory."
good,"I really enjoyed the amazing diverse culture of people you see everyday.  Partners, Regulars, Grandparents, Families, Students, Business Professionals."
good,"Typically I open at Starbucks, I have to set up the pastry case, date all of the food, organize and set up the food and drinks in the fridge, clean the floors behind the counter and help out my other co-worker with her opening duties. All of this is done between 6-6:30 am. After that we open doors, serve the regulars that come in daily on their way to work, then on comes the mall rush at around 8/8:30. Around that time our second person comes in so then breaks start being run which we have to space accordingly to shift length and customer count at the time. Each of us have our own assigned positions which frequently switch depending on the situations so we all have to be excellent at all of the jobs behind the counter so that we cant easily move around to help out where help is needed. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the customers and keeping high accuracy to avoid the need to re-do things. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing and speaking to each person who comes in, learning their usual orders and keeping up to date with whats new in their lives."
good,Before I applied to Starbucks at the Embassy Suites I was already a frequent customer so I was familiar with the Starbucks status quo and environment. I learned a lot about Starbucks products and high standards. My co-workers were nice and highly sociable. The hardest part of the job was during rush and there are only two people behind the counter. Because it was a licensed store and it was in a tourist area there were rush and slow season. During slow season it was boring the day went by slowly especially if your working the 4 pm to 1 am shift on the weekends. Overall I loved working for Starbucks and hopefully I get to work for a corporate store within the area I live now
good,"The employees and customers can be great, and working in a coffee shop CAN be relaxing. However, due to constant management shifts, increased expectations and demands over the 5 years worked there, it became incredibly stressful, and difficult to succeed. Being hired with no availability on the weekends and then being expected to work weekends is something retail in general have made a habit of."
good,it was overall a cool job i love being a barista but because we had to be alone alot cause the staff was short it got very stressful.
good,at time the environment can be stressful depending on who you work with but when you start to talk to the customers and really connect to them its a great environment.
good,"A typical day was very fast paced but mostly fun."
good,"making coffees, chatting to customers, talking to colleges, having a cup of coffee on a break"
good,"Strong collaborative culture with talented, creative employees that make going to work a pleasure."
good,"Same tasks different day. Attend to customers, provide quality beverages, keep your self busy, by cleaning condiment bar, washing dishes, sweeping, taking out garbage, checking bathroom, restocking pastry case and anything at the bar area."
good,"When I was working at Starbucks, I worked with a very good team of guys and girls. We were all very calm under pressure. There was an amazing support from the team. However, the team could get quite segregated, making one feel left out at times."
good,the entire barista coffee lounge culture was not a fit for me but for many it is their ideal situation.
good,"The people i work with are fantastic, though sometimes higher management seems to make poor decisions. on a store-level, an average day involves trying to solve some problem or another while meeting customer demand and maintaining a positive attitude. its not easy work but having the opportunity to work alongside such fantastic people is very rewarding."
good,"I  worked at star bucks for two years and learned a lot of skills "
good,perfect hours and perfect pay. was looking forward to moving up in company.
good,My experience for working at Starbucks is great. The only cons is the low pay for the amount of work you have to do.
good,I trained new employees. opened new stores. made sure everything was clean and up to standard.
good,It was fun in the beginning. The management was great. The tasks got really repetitive. Day after day making the same drinks. Be aware that you are standing on your feed all day. I made a lot of friends there. The majority of the employees are women so there can be a bit of drama.
good,"The culture that Starbucks nurtured for many years was an environment that was fun and also a place I wanted to come to work everyday. The culture now is nothing more than profit driven menial work we have become a conveyor belt for coffee drinks. "
good,"A typical day on the job for me is opening my facility, starting prep for my facility  ( a.k.a brewing 3 huge pots of coffee, the teas for the day and laying out the pastries. ) In between serving the customers their custom made drinks, I maintain the facility with stocking up and cleaning everything before my shift is over so my coworkers don't have to be hassled when they have a rush.  I have learned a large amount about coffee and espresso beans, how they are roasted, what region they are from, and how to pair the light/dark roast with the perfect pastry, overall how to make the perfect experience while you are there. My coworkers, in my own opinion are some the fastest workers I have seen, Which inspires me to work just as hard and as fast and it helps us achieve our goal much faster. The hardest part of the job would probably be my lack being a multilingual, for we get customers the get flown from all over the world, but even with  the language barrier it is easy for me to meet the customer's needs."
good,"What I like from Starbucks is that at the same time you work you also have fun."
good,"Overall, they are a very up-beat, positive, gender-friendly balanced company to work for. You can move-up in the company very quickly, but only if you live in a larger market area, and or near the regional-head offices. they do offer exceptionally good-quality training and benifits, of which I took advantage during my time working there."
good,I would say that I learned a lot about myself. I was pushed to be able to better handle mishaps in the workplace. My manager taught me a lot about how to run an area productively without letting my friendships interfere with corrective action in the workplace.
good,"Overall, Starbucks is an amazing company and they take great care of their partners. However, management styles between stores can really vary and not many district managers or regional managers have the time to make sure that their store managers are taking care of the partners. From what I noticed, the manager/assistant manager employed at my store took advantage of the position and created policies that I don't think represent the company. Though this is just an example of my store specifically, the company overall is a great one and can give anyone a good amount of experience."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks is very relaxed just like the culture. You can see that with interior designs that include unique couches and tables that are set up like the local stores. The setting does make you feel more comfortable as if you were in a nearby neighborhood shop. The best part of the job is that your coffee and tea is FREE as long as you learn how to make it! This makes early or long days more manageable given the right resources. The other perks such as beanstock, insurance for part time workers, and free mark outs once a week are also very appealing."
good,"A typical day would consist of an early morning rush for individuals who were on their way to their jobs. Usually there would be a gradual slow down towards the early lunch hour (typically 10:30-12:00). While working there I learned that it is a lot of work to operate and maintain a coffee shop. The management here was divided into three levels: The General Manager, The Assistant Manager, and the Lead Barista. The Assistant Manager worked closely with the employees. The co workers had various personalities and work ethics. For the most part everyone got along really well and worked well together. If someone was hired and didn't work well with the already existing staff, then they usually would quit soon thereafter. This particular Starbucks was located in a hospital so the hardest part of it was occasionally seeing patients in poor health or families who were losing their loved ones. The most enjoyable part of the job was being personally complemented and appreciated for my efforts by the customer's/hospital employees."
good,"Prepare store for opening, prepare drinks to customers order. Greet all guest with a warm welcolm."
good,"Never a slow moment, always moving and always getting something done. I learned many different things about coffee and I enjoyed being around most of the poeple."
good,"Working in the Starbucks section of Welcome Break brings with it many more new challenges. There is never a moment where the Café is not busy. This creates a vast amount of pressure as you have to try and deal with every customer as an individual, up sell products to them, create their beverage with the utmost quality, in the shortest possible time to ensure the customer experience is to exceeding standards. Organisation is key for a smooth operation. Coming in half an hour early to ensure that you have everything that will be needed to keep your shift steady is imminent. Becoming a barista is difficult to. Their is a lot of training involved before you are signed off to make drinks for real. The hardest part of the job is dealing with major setbacks calmly and methodically whilst still dealing with the huge inflation of customers that are still waiting for their beverage. This causes some pressure, but if dealt with correctly the setback can be corrected. The most enjoyable part of the job is creating a beverage and ensuring that it is up to the exceeding standards that are expected, but also being able to do this as fast as possible."
good,"Everybody has been to Starbucks, it's a comfortable coffee shop with rich coffee aromas in the air and friendly people behind the counters. It was a pleasure working as one of those people and learning all about being a barista, I got to work with great people and make some friends along the way. Would I work here again? defientely."
good,it's great as a stepping stone. many people work at starbucks while in school.
good,"Dependent upon location. Could be a wonderful place to work for, or a total nightmare."
good,"Great place to work, simple and fun, and you get to work with a lot of equipment."
good,"Excellent benefits, free coffee, good discount. Help customers, make drinks, general clean up."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of constant customer attention, keeping up with daily tasks, and coaching other employees on the importance of legendary service. I learned the importance of maintaing a professional, courteous exterior, and demonstrating a customer first mentallity. Management is very helpful, and really care about their job, and the partners they work with. My co-workers were fun, and upbeat, and we fed off of each other to make the work day fun, and productive. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be working with my co-workers."
good,"I had fun for the most part when I worked at starbucks. It was a fast paced job but it was pretty fun. It was nice getting a discount and then free drinks while at work. The benefits were great, I paid about 20 bucks a check and had medical, dental and vision. You get tips and overall its a pretty good job. I only left the company because of a new manager that came in and was useless, that store ended up having a 100% turnover because of her she fired half of the people and the smart ones quit. She was the only bad manager I had when working for the company though."
good,"I learned how to Resolve Escalated Customer Service Issues, Enforce Policies and Procedures & Monitor Product Quality, how to Deal with all Types of Employees and Handled Store Cash Management."
good,"Starbucks is a very fast paced working environments with constant challenges that test the barista. Relationships were easily built between managers and baristas and baristas and baristas due a very strong team oriented atmosphere. As a barista I was expected to know and execute my daily tasks in a proactive manner while following the standards set by Starbucks procedures. This included ensuring complete customer satisfaction, enjoyable beverages as per Starbucks standards, and constant cleanliness and organization of each work place."
good,"Not a bad place to work, however, in the retail side, schedules are only posted a week at a time, giving many not enough flexibility between home and work balance. In spite of the ability to recruit employees from other stores to fill-in shifts, many positions just cannot be filled in the short term."
good,"I worked for the company more than 5 years, I loved every minute of it BUT .... eventually you realize that you can't really support a family on free coffee and minimum wage."
good,This company has taught me alot about efficient managing and the importance of communication between the levels. I work with the general public and reading people has become a great skill of mine. I have been able to apply that to the working relationships I have and have used that to hone in my management skills. This is a fast paced kind of environment that isnt for everyone. The people who last are people who can roll with the punches and take the good with the bad. I will always love how much fun it is to work with people who are like minded and adventurous and the relationships made with the regular customers is unmatched.
good,"The company underwent many transitions as a whole through my tenure, and what started as a strong building for connection and customer environments became a large corporation only driven by growth and sales. Much of the culture and value that the company once had was lost over the last few years of my employment. I do not carry any regret or hard feelings for having the opportunities and fundamental growth as a manager that has come from my work experience. I am truely grateful for the opportunity and look forward to take what I have gained from my experience to my future endeavors."
good,Although you are at a respectable fast paced company. Starbucks lacks strategy in their supply chain. Ambiguity has never been greater
good,"Starbucks, the first major coffee company to hit the streets of the world. They brought exciting and artfully handcrafted beverages to all ages."
good,"As a supervisor you have so many responsibilities, it can be hard to balance coaching partners while doing inventory and ordering while still being accounted for as a member of the team on the floor. However, most of the partners are amazing and supportive making it well worth the effort."
good,"It was difficult to get used to what I had to do in the beginning, but became much easier as I worked there. The management was also very understanding and accommodating."
good,Hours are inconsistent and not livable but it is a fun place to work sometimes. So much would be better if the CEO being paid millions of dollars would actually care about our stress level instead of his $50mil bonus.
good,The job is honestly so stressful and I kinda dread going to work every day. It is super hard to get promoted and move up in the company if your manager does not like you. The job is not worth the pay.
good,"No better job than this one to really immerse yourself in your community and make connections with your coworkers. Can be a stressful job at times, however, the company is very equipped with modalities in helping you do the best job that you possibly can."
good,"A day at work consist of getting the money bag before you clock in for your assigned register. Help make drinks, and food for customers. Some customers were difficult because they were in a hurry to catch a flight. But you always have to stay professional. Every shift had to clean, sanitize, and restock the store before they went home. After you clock out you had to return your money bag. We did receive tips and split them with whoever was working your shift. What i did not like was the manager would make the schedule and not notify the employees when they were suppose to work or when they were off. Sometimes they would change the days without your notice or consent. The job overall was easy, but sometimes stressful."
good,"Starbucks is extremely committed to this policy. The company highly values its customers, sometimes even when it interferes with other company policies. This policy is great for the customers, however, it sometimes puts the employee in an uncomfortable position."
good,"Great benefits"
good,"Starbucks is a really good job if you are either in high school, or have recently graduated. It isn't really a good fit for someone who's moving up in life, unless you become a store manager. They are very flexible but extremely hard to talk to. Many things don't get done and it's just a  stressful job for low pay."
good,The holidays really bring you all together with the mayhem that unfolds and it really creates a wonderful feeling of community. Its hard work in a busy store but it allows you to learn all about coffee and build a love and respect for it.
good,"Starbucks is a company with great benefits, but the daily operations have declined greatly in the last couple years. Corporate cares very little about having enough labor scheduled in order for a store to run properly"
good,"Fast paced environment, they teach you quickly but dont expect you to be perfect right away.  Starbucks management wont always tell you about the benefits so just make sure to look  into it all on your own and do not miss deadlines for certain benefits"
good,"Being able to trust and work as a team is essential here. There is no room for picking and choosing, you have a job to do and when you both understand what you need to do it is an amazing job."
good,"The workplace culture here is great and management tries its best to make sure that it's employees are doing well. Benefits include decent health insurance, 401k options, and discounted stock prices. The cons would be that there are little options to move up in the company, and beginning pay rate is bad."
good,"With a good store manager, its a nice place to work, good benefits not super straining job. With a bad store manager, you lose your hours, coverage is bad, things don't get ordered right, and it becomes stressful. Not very favorable toward people who cant work super early in the morning though. Some stores won't give you hardly any hours if you can't open at 3am."
good,It’s a great place to work. I enjoy the benefits and the customers. Getting to know your regulars is always fun. They are opened 365 days a year so holidays are a must to work.
good,It was a Starbucks kiosk owned by a subsidiary store. Always busy and the store managers pretty much used it as their private watering hole. Never enough hours but never enough done. Sad store.
good,working at starbucks is fun and challenging at the same time i get to communicate with customer daily and work in a fast paced job environment i would recommend friends to start there
good,"I loved my job and the people I worked with. However, my district was poorly ran and the managers were super lazy and not held accountable for anything. The benefits are amazing, but the pay is bad. After working there for 10 years and being a supervisor, I still only made a little over $13."
good,"I enjoyed meeting new people everyday and being able to learn who they are as a person everyday they come in, and making them feel welcome and remembered by remembering their order when they come into the store"
good,"I love working at Starbucks, the pay is just too low compared to other retailers in my area, which is a disappointment. Many other retailers have raised there pay and it sucks that a lot of employees of Starbucks need to maintain a second job to afford a living. But it is such a fun job and I’m happy to work for Starbucks."
good,"I was with Starbucks for over a year and during the majority of my time at my first location I blossomed. My confidence was through the roof, I felt happy and safe at work,  my peers were amazing and encouraging and management really believed in me to succeed, so I did! "
good,"I enjoyed my time there, they had really good benefits, my reason of leaving was a better opportunity at another job. But overall if you like fast paced work and people its a good job."
good,The management is awesome and so is the rest of the staff! Some customers are better than others but don’t take anything too personally or you will get your feelings hurt! Learning all the drinks took me about a week but it was super fun!
good,1 yıl 4 ay çalıştım çalıştığım insanlar genel olarak iyilerdi çalışma şartlarıda ortalamanın üstünde kendinizi geliştirmeniz açısından iyi bir fırsat olabilir ama işin stresi oldukça fazla sosyal hayatınız kalmıyor işe girdiğinizde her şey işiniz oluyor ayrıca işe alımlarda biraz daha seçici olunması gerektiğini düşünüyorum yoldan geçen sorunlu insanları alıyorlar genelde bu konuda daha hassas olunması gerektiğini düşünüyorum bu tip insanlar şirketin kültürünü zedeliyor.
good,Good job for transition or going to school. Excellent management at my location. The pay was not justifiable for the job responsibilities and the amount of work employees do.
good,"If you can stick it out at Starbucks, this is the retail spot to learn a myriad of transferable skills if you are looking to switch jobs. Or, if you'd like to move up, Starbucks is very good and quick about promoting from within, and in fact prefer to do so. The pay for baristas and supervisors could be more. Between $9.15 - $12.00 an hour is not enough for most people to live off of, so many have second jobs. Fantastic benefits for only 20 hours of work, free lb of coffee or tea every week, 401K with a match, stocks, child care assistance, they'll pay for a first time bachelors degree seeker WITHOUT requiring a work contract afterwards. You will learn how to prioritize your time in a fast paced environment, deal with difficult customers, collaborate as part of a team to meet sales goals, etc."
good,This is a fast face challenging environment. There are high expectations around knowing the product and creating a positive experience. Prepare to work hard.
good,"Working at Starbucks is a great opportunity to grow as a worker and learn skills for future jobs. A very fast-paced environment that requires quick thinking and the ability to remain cool in high-stress environments. The pay and benefits do not compensate for the work that is being done, but it is a good starter job that allows for growth. The management is very well organized, however, the highly competitive nature creates a divide between starting workers and upper management."
good,Fast hiring process. Free drinks. Wage above the market. Nice benefits. Nice schedule (they give what you need). Costumers were nice too. Good company. I would work again.
good,A typical day consists of dealing with a peak followed by a steady flow of catching up the different areas needing help and maintaining a clean and organized store until closing time.
good,"A typical day at work really depends on what time of day you begin/end your shift. I most often opened and worked through the peak of the day and got off before it ended. Management changed several times while I was there, and the turn-over rate for employees was somewhat high. However, the core group of baristas really banded together and developed a great environment as well as rapport with regular customers."
good,"This job has great benefits, but isn’t enough pay for what the job entails. This is really tough, stressful, tiring work- if the benefits didn’t exist, nobody would keep this job."
good,"The day-to-day work of Starbucks is, for the most part, a great time. The fast pace and focus on efficiency and cleanliness really created a great dynamic between coworkers and customers, and created a fantastic work ethic for myself. However, the management regularly brought the positivity of being a Partner down. It's not particularly one general manger or district manager's fault, but I saw the company's laser-focus on perfect efficiency weigh down on my managers and affected my hours to a point where I had no choice but to leave."
good,The most enjoyable part about working at starbucks would have to be coming into work and getting excited about who im working with and the regular customers that come in everyday.
good,"its ok for the time being. not alot going for it, just a minimum wage job. customers and colleagues make it just about ok. if someone really needs a job go for it."
good,Needs more structure. Store was chaotic and caused anxiety. Customers were rude. Didn’t  have enough recourses for workload. Needs better management. Great staff though.
good,"On an average day at the office, it was rather fast paced which, of course, often carrying along high stress with it, but rarely did it last for more than 90% of an entire shift. Despite the frequent stress, the job really taught me a lot about how beneficial working as a team can be, (teamwork making the dream work), the fact that I loved interacting with customers on a regular basis, it made me realize what a huge people person I really am. I'll always be thankful for the new skills and benefits that Starbucks helped me obtain."
good,It’s a very stressful job but it’s also fun. I feel like management needs work. But in reality it’s like that at every job. I love the flexibility with hours so you can still have a life outside work.
good,"Not enough time on bar, made me clean all the time. Lots of stress and not enough tips or wage. Good benefits and management was kind and understanding"
good,Every day is different which helps to keep things interesting. If you are good at handling high levels of entitlement from customers with a smile on your face then this is the job for you. Over all this is a great company that provides great opportunities for advancement and to get an educational degree. Great benefits. Great crew.
good,The company stands for a lot of good things and had great values. Management doesn't always uphold those values leading to awful experiences like mine
good,Egosu yüksek olmayan Kafa dengi insanlarla çok eğlenceli ve ciddi iş ortamı oluşturulabilinir.
good,Starbucks is a great place to work! You’ll make new friends with your co workers and the customers! It’s a great first time job! It seems overwhelming at first but once you get use to it you wonder why you was so worried at first!
good,Very fast paced job. Starbucks has very good benefits and you have to have good communication skills with people while multi-tasking. Tips also good college plans.
good,"I really enjoyed working here, I learned a lot and met some amazing people. I started as a barista but trained to be a supervisor in a new store that opened in Westfield shopping centre, Derby in 2007. Full training was given by friendly team members and it was made fun although the job itself is a fast paced, busy one it never felt like a job. I got to meet some fantastic customers that I looked forward to seeing each day."
good,"- open up the store and start setting up for the day "
good,Starbucks was a very fast paced environment and we had to deal with a plethora of angry people who are short and don't want to spend anytime having conversations. I made it my goal to impact every person I came in contact with on a daily basis. They have great benefits for all of their employees.
good,"This is a barely more than minimum wage job, let's not kid our selves. But for what it is the benefits are good, the pay is competitive, and the clientele is mostly respectful, with some notable exceptions. The pace of work is high and the learning curve can be steep, but from what I've heard from other retail and food service workers this is a pretty good gig."
good,"My experience as a Barista at starbucks was a great learning experience for me, being able to work with others servicing the local area. However I wished timing and schedules could have ran a bit more organizied and caused less stress on the employees"
good,Brew and make coffee/beverages while maintaining individual customer connections. Ensuring a welcoming environment for every customer is of the upmost importance.
good,Hay personal que no cumple con la mision y valores que predica la empresa
good,"a typical day there would probably be like very busy on most days and everyone's rushing and messing everything up, i made drinks hot and cold. the hardest part of the job would have to be the manager not even the actual physical job itself but the manager is one of the reasons why i left."
good,A typical day at work would be making many frappucinos and keeping the whole store clean. I learned how to work very well under pressure and how to multitask. The hardest part of the job is being able to function during very busy rush hours. The most enjoyable part of the job is all the new people that you meet
good,"Not a bad place to work but it is minimum wage and you deal with a not of stuff from customers. Good benefits, good environment & good work/life balance but, you definitely don’t get paid enough for that job."
good,"Starbucks has a lot of benefits along with stock options, but honestly benefits (that hardly cover simple doctor check ups) and the pay of ten dollars an hour is not worth it."
good,"Great place to work, team work, division of labour and its a beautiful place to learn and grow further."
good,"It can be secure as in you don’t get cut hours on your shifts and there is the shift swap group on FB. It also works well with school. Can be hard to work full time hours, tips are pooled weekly, customers minus regulars aren’t usually that great to be around or serve"
good,Its a great working environment when working with seasoned baristas. But the rushed training process makes it impossible to work efficiently with new employees.
good,"In the three years I've worked for Starbucks the company has made some drastic changes. What was once a fun, balanced job became a high-stress environment that had a strong, overbearing workload while undermining the tools needed to do the job effectively. I would still recommend working there, if only to use their unmatched benefits."
good,I enjoy working at starbucks and the culture was nice but stressful at times. There was a lack of staff often times and that made the job extremely difficult because customers want their orders quickly.
good,"This was a good job for me because I could handle the pace of the morning rush as well as the really slow times in the evening. Overall, Starbucks is a great place to work if you can handle the pace and communicate properly with customers and management in order to ensure a good working environment. People with social anxiety or poor customer service skills would not do well at Starbucks as job duties (including cashiering and drive-thru) are swapped regularly at the shift supervisor's discretion. My manager was amazing, but my shift supervisor (the person who actually was on site and directing workflow) was absolutely not. "
good,"the job itself is amazing. but my manager is barely ever there. she makes me work 15 hour shifts so she can go to parties anf family events. for a solid month i was working doubles and only had one day off a wee. she told me if its too busy to just not take a break. she has taken advantage of me, and my other coworker."
good,"I liked working at Starbucks, but it is definitely a stressful environment. My manager was phenomenal, but the manager that came after her was sub-par. The pay is low, and the turnover rate is  high. There is some opportunity to grow, but only if you're able to afford the low wages while you're entry level before shift supervisor or higher."
good,"Arbeit ist gut Strukturiert, es gibt einheitliche Standards aber man kann trotzdem man selbst bleiben."
good,"Bon avis général sur l'entreprise. Un salaire assez faible, mais une évolution rapide"
good,It was an ok place.to work. I'm sure other locations are better and off more to their employees. But I am a loyal customer to this day. And love the company.
good,Welcome Customers by Determining their Coffee Interest’s needs Provided Outstanding Customer Services Prepared & Presented Beverage according to Established Recipe Presentated SOP Standards based on Customer Requested
good,Nice and friendly coworkers in a fast paced work environment. The crew is always a family with shifts being taken and covered relatively easy. Customers come and go quickly with some room for customer relations.
good,If you have a reliable team working at Starbucks is awesome from the regulars to the daily new faces work was amazing. The only draw back is that the company is hiring management more and more from the outside rather than promoting from within.
good,very busy and fast-paced coffee spot. coworkers were always stressed and not very nice. hardest part is having to deal with the rude customers with a smile.
good,I enjoyed my job but Pay was bad and if you decide to advance with company you would take on a lot of extra work for only a dollar rase. They managers gave out advance opportunities to only favorite employees
good,"There's always room to move up, depending on how supportive you store manager and district manager are. Starbucks has great benefits, but the actual work environment is horrible. DM's expect you to be able to hand off drinks within 40 seconds while being understaffed and expect you to maintain their ""Third Place"" environment despite being understaffed. I've also experienced several racist encounters with customers and we are expected to serve them despite this."
good,"Working at Starbucks takes a ton of hard work, patience, multi tasking and a sense of strength. I always say it takes a special individual to be a barista, due to the way baristas are treated (for Starbucks specifically) because it’s not a space for sensitive individuals."
good,"a typical day at work start with setting the store ready for business trade. then organise the shift and assign primary and secondary task to each staff member, complete the paperwork, received delivery and prepare store order; check emails and respond if necessary, send daily report to support centre. If schedule, complete the banking operation or till audits. the duty may looked heavy at times, beside this, I love the interaction with different customers as I learn from them and they learn from you and great friendship relation are   created."
good,"Great place to work, The constant flow helps time fly by. Every day was filled with laughter and challenges, but making drinks was the great part of my day knowing I made the customers happy."
good,主任、經理等管理層非常關心下屬，並建立良好的關係，此是由於STATBUCKS工作文化所影響，不論職位大小均一視同仁，營造一個歸屬感。
good,A typical day at work is connecting with the customer and taking their orders but not only that you are warming up there food. the shift or the manager assigned you where you will be during your shift. sometimes it could be stressful in the morning and other times we could be fine. you have to work as a team and also the environment is fun when they have music playing while you work. in afternoon shift is relaxing at times but you have a lot of task to do before you leave your shift. the hardest part at first working at Starbucks is just memorizing the information and it feels overwhelming but you will get through that part to learn every part of the position and it makes you stronger as a person. the most enjoyable part is that when things go downhill you have your co workers by your side and top of that you get really good benefits and health insurance
good,"It's not a terrible company, just very stressful and the supervisors get paid less than what they actually gave to do. Baristas have a lot to do for a company mainly focusing on customer service. Not enough recognition. Have been hiring outside of the company for higher positions that others within the company would like."
good,"- enjoyed the youthful environment and coworkers"
good,There are normally really good partners to work with.  Much of the job is geared around learning how to prioritize your time while balancing customer service.
good,"No work life balance. No true support when partners call out etc need to staff but cant because we don't have enough training hrs. We get blamed for everything in our stores yet have no time allotted for us to be successful. We are the a barista, key holder, and run the business all in one. You break your back and are so uninspired you have no time for your own life."
good,"I have worked for Starbucks for 2 years and 3 months, and I have to say that it's a good job if you won't be there for the long term. As a starting job, the pay is good, and the benefits are stellar if you are able to work 30 hours or more a week, The culture of people who work there is genuine and enjoyable, and the work is fun as long as you don't get overwhelmed."
good,"It's a good place to start a career, their is a lot of ridiculous expectations on how drinks should be made and the timing of when the baristas  should be done with drinks but reality is a whole diffrent story."
good,Starbuck's used to be easy to praise. Slowly it is becoming harder to point out all the reasons to work for starbucks. Ever since the new CEO came in things have been changing and even though they are small changes for now most managers are realising what the outcome will be from them.
good,"Atmosphere is great and coworkers become friends. The mornings become highly stressful and Starbucks corporation keeps giving drinks that take forever to make but expect us to have drive thru times of 30 seconds which never happens. I’ve worked here for 4 years and still get paid under 10 dollars an hour. A lot of benefits, not enough pay"
good,"Starbucks was overall an ok place to work. It was great when it came to effectively and quickly working with others but essentially, that's how you learned -- working with others. There's a mediocre few days of training and then you're thrown out on the floor to practically fend for yourself (luckily, I'm a fast learner but there were multiple times my first couple weeks of being out on the floor where I almost burst into tears in front of customers due to lack of training). Management also does NOT care about you. They care about the customers, hence ""the customer is always right"". A customer could spit in my face, pour coffee on me, and afterwards, demand me to make them another coffee, and the customer would still be right (this obviously differs from store manager to store manager but I'm talking about upper management). "
good,"Great way to get into the coffee world, but being it is such a huge company, you feel the restrictions that come with the size of it. The store location and management definitely could define the work atmosphere throughout your shift."
good,If you like spending your day making coffee and dedicating your life to a coffeehouse then this is the place for you . Good environment and sweet employees
good,I feel that getting paid $9.50 an hour and only $.54 per hour on tips is not enough to afford housing nor insurance as a starbucks barista and all the stock and shares plus the profit off the high priced delights is enough to pay $10/hr plus tips being a minimum of $1.50 per hour or keep your own tips. I have processed tips once and there was extra money that was just thrown away or given back to the corporate company when we could've made better tips. To say that i can work 5days a week and still only make $500 for paycheck hurts me that i cant even afford my health or secure my vehicle that transports me to work with the paychecks I receive
good,"I worked at two different starbucks, one was slow but the manager was incredible and so were the employees. The one I work at now is very stressful and the boss is incredibly condescending. I also was a borrowed partner at a few other starbucks and i found some of the dishes to be so yellowed I took unpaid time after my shift just to clean the dishes. not a fan. at the drive thru store there are also too many people working there, nobody gets the amount of hours they want."
good,"Hectic busy environment, seeing customers smile makes it all worth it. You nevr know who will walk in starbucks soits worth the joy. Customers fight hard for their neighborhood store."
good,"The company itself is wonderful to work for. There's a great message that all partners are trained to work by, but management is very two faced. I was promised a promotion 3 times to have people I trained promoted over me, with almost no explanation. I put so much time and effort into the job with almost no recognition from upper management. Most people at this job get worn out after a year, and eventually leave for better opportunities."
good,"Benefits were great but that doesn't outweigh the fact that the hours were garbage which meant the pay was garbage... Worked 2 days a week because of school, so I was expecting to do at least 14-16 hours a week..... I only received 8 hours (split btwn 2 days = 4 hours a day)... waste of time, energy, gas..."
good,"The manager and crew at the first Starbucks I've worked at were amazing. Other stores have had terrible managers and unprofessional employees, it really depends on where you're located."
good,You will work at least 4 days of the week as a barista but still be expected to complete management activities. You are scheduled at least 32+ hours as coverage on the floor so it is impossible to run your business-- resulting in a very poor work life balance working 60+ hour weeks to get everything done.
good,Flexibility in scheduling for students. Good benefits at part time hours (25 hour minimum). Weekly split tips for baristas and shift leads. Lots of practice for multitasking and customer service.
good,"I really liked working at Starbucks, but it didn't take too long before I got the hang of the job. That said, each day pretty much bled into the next. I did really like my coworkers though, but always wanted to pursue something more challenging in coffee during my time there."
good,"I've worked in several locations during my time at Starbucks. Your experience ultimately will depend on the people around you."
good,"Travail d'équipe managé par des shifts ainsi qu'un store manager."
good,I enjoyed working for Starbucks. There was a disconnect between partners and management at the last two stores I was at. The team culture was great as well as the company culture.
good,"Always seemed to be in a perpetual state of short staffed."
good,"Working at Starbucks can be fun, however there are many days where it can be very stressful and unenjoyable. I have learned how to be very patient working there. The hardest part is the rush hours but my coworkers are very enjoyable and we make the best out of any situation."
good,"There is a definite learning curve to the job, but I've found that almost all partners are supportive and helpful. Emphasis seems to be split between speed and quality of service, which can cause conflicts of interest."
good,"A typical day for me at Starbucks would be arriving at 4:30 am to set up the store to open by 5 am. My barista & I would ensure that the store was ready for business! Doors open at 5 am, ready for a full day! "
good,"Certain locations are better to work at then others. Not enough involvement from upper management, and some store managers will suck. I suggest not staying longer than a year. It’s a good starting point."
good,"Great Benefits, great job, and high turnover."
good,Everything is smooth just as long as you do your work. The people I worked with had a sense of humor and were easy to get along with. Only downfall of the job was when high stress vibes occur.
good,"fun job."
good,Depending on the day you will see a lot of people come through. You get to engage in conversation and connect with customers around you. Working at Starbucks you need to have a positive attitude and patience when it comes to dealing with unpleasant customers. The thing I love about my job is the opportunity to meet new people and friends.
good,"Work at Starbucks is fun and filled with new difficulties and accomplishments. On the job, you learn your strengths and weakness and learn to cope and adapt to new experiences. The workplace has always been diverse, and smooth sailing, but when difficult times arise, you have to be extremely focused to solve matters within Starbucks policies. the most gratifying part of my job is creating good experiences for regulars and new comers, learning their names and developing a good clientele."
good,"place to start if youve never worked before. friendly work enviornment learning to handle situations, problem solving, quick thinking. a place to learn customer service very well"
good,"Starbucks is definitely a very fast paced, and stressful place to work so if you happen to have anxiety or you panic easily, I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THIS JOB. morning/afternoon rushes last for quite a while and they become tiring very easily, but for what it's worth, I've met some of my closest friends throught this job and I'm glad i have the experience under my belt."
good,"Being a manager at Starbucks was incredibly rewarding. I made an impact not only on the daily lives of my customers, but of the partners that I developed and coached. Hours for a manager can vary store to store, but you are pretty much only allowed 8 hours a week of admin time. Like other retail operations, managers are the ones to step in if there are gaps in coverage or someone calls out, which is stressful in the fast paced store environment."
good,"Great job just extremely stressful, and never enough Labor to meet the expectations they want. I love working here and it made me who I am today but I've put my time in and it's just getting harder and harder."
good,"I Have learned a lot from Starbucks; management, business, culture and sales. Starbucks taught me a lot especially  retail sales and how to deal with fast environment. It is hard sometime when It is a peak time. But I am enjoy to do that with my team members."
good,"Dedicated to overseeing general sanitation of the back and front of the house. Also tasked with preparing food and beverages for customers. I offer exceptional interpersonal and team building skills that are beneficial to building rapport with a wide spectrum of clients, managers, and coworkers."
good,"Starbucks has given me a great opportunity to pursue my higher education goals with the Starbucks College Achievement Plan, which offers free tuition to current partners. This is great! Working there can be stressful and challenging at times but it depends on how you can handle those types of situations. I enjoy working there and got the chance to finish my degree!"
good,"The company is truly great but the store I worked at was a little difficult because of understaffing. Not because of anyones doing just not a whole lot of people were applying there. Got better after working there for a little bit because a lot more people were applying, which helped out a ton in the long run."
good,"Une journée de travail typique est assez courte elle commence à 8h30 avec le nettoyage, la mise à disposition du restaurant le briefing et l'ouverture du restaurant à 9h00.C'est une enseigne qui tend a se développer dans les zones rurales, avec un management paternaliste l'entreprise mettait un point d'honneur sur le savoir être. La  difficultés résidait dans la maitrise du logiciel de caisse et l'aspect le plus agréables concourait à la proximité avec le client."
good,"Got a lot of sales experience, as well as customer service experience. Made some life long friends with customers and other employees. I really had fun learning how to make latte art."
good,"Full-time at Starbucks is rough. It is a highly active job and can be really demanding. "
good,"A typical day at work can be quite crazy and a tad stressful if you're on a busy street. There's a lot of cleaning involved, some of it can come across as a bit demeaning. However, it's a corporate job and I would never fault the manager for it. Besides that, it's an enjoyable job. You learn a lot of patience, multitasking, and problem-solving. As long as you make it a positive atmosphere, the shifts go by pretty fast."
good,"Not my favorite place to find advancement, but worth the benefits package if you prefer a stable paycheck and have something else going on because they work with you. They have tons of people who have busy schedules and accommodate all of them. Just find the store you want or can get hired at and has the manager that will work with you toward your development plan or just staying in the same role."
good,I've enjoyed my time at both my Starbuck's locations and have gained many interpersonal and multi-tasking skills while meeting people from all walks of life.
good,Fun work environment and loved the people that I worked with. Customers could sometimes be stressful and very particular about their drinks. Many of the regulars were very nice
good,"I find that many of the Starbucks don't follow the guidelines for the partner's. Managers are encouraged to work on the floor however, ours seems to lack that skill. More over there is a lot of heavy lifting which was not mentioned in the interview or job description. I do not received many hours even when I mentioned I am available to work."
good,"Pleasant atmosphere."
good,"Fun, friendly and family oriented working environment. It was a great especially when they took the uniform out baristas loved it with some allowed piercing no offensive tattoo's."
good,"Good workplace for people who don't have previous work experience. Training is really simple, easy to learn and get used to the positions. Good work/life/school balance."
good,You get great tips. Environment friendly. Great networking. Tests your patience. Learning experience. Great benifts. Markouts every week. Learning new drinks.
good,"Management gives employees too many chances. Does not hold people accountable for dress code or attendance. "
good,"Most people there cared about the paycheck and didn't care about coffee beyond ""it tastes good and gives me caffeine."" I learned most of the information I know about coffee while I was there but that's because I had to spend most of my own time learning about it."
good,It is a greta place to work but I am not paid enough or scheduled enough hours to live comfortably and pay my bills without stress. This forces people to have to find a second job or fight for hours or even find a new job altogether.
good,not bad. not for everyone I guess but idk? its on a person to person basis and some amount of thick skin. mangers depends on store and region and so on.
good,"It seems like every day, the company is asking more from its employees and we've yet to be compensated in our wages. Every store is different and there's a different culture in every store. Some are more strict, some more social, some are very peppy, etc etc, so experiences vary. But you will definitely learn how to work and get along with other people because getting through a shift is very much a team task. I'm very lucky to have made friends with my coworkers and I'd have to say that's the most rewarding part of the job. It's definitely a struggle, but when you're working with people you like, it feels less like a job. I hope to see Starbucks increasing the wages for ""partners"". Yes there a benefits and discounts, but money is what's paying the bills and I don't believe workers are being paid enough for the amount they do."
good,Very flexible with scheduling if you're a student or have other commitments. Wouldn't recommend if you don't do well under pressure or get frustrated easily.
good,"My experience at Starbucks was cool. I've met some people that I've learned from the best. I feel like that management could use work. And I feel that working at a company like Starbucks, could use some security."
good,"Overall, Starbucks is a good company to work for if you are a part time employee. It's largest down fall is work life balance for full-time employees and low hourly pay for hourly partners. They are experiencing a HIGH turn over rate, and have difficulties retaining partners because of this reason."
good,"Starbucks has a lot to offer, you get free drinks, a free food item, you work with a team of people who are all going through a fast-paced job with you and undergoing a multi-skilled shift, there are benefits and time off. It can be a taxing job mentally (planning) and emotionally (being happy for customers) and can be a stressful job if not properly organized and benefits practically take most of your paycheck. This job is fast paced and you're asked to multi-task so if that's not something you're good at, you can flounder. The management can get overwhelming because standards are high and if your line of management doesn't filter information well, it will fall onto their team. I do enjoy the team I am a part of and the customers that come in. I've worked at two stores and it just becomes like a little family over time."
good,The coworkers are what really made it a good experience. But actually working there takes a good memory. You have to work fast and be on top of cleaning as well.
good,It is important to remember that this is a chain coffee shop. however with that said i felt the best experience i had was in the cafes that LACKED a drive thru. The atmosphere was completely different and it is more laid back or comfortable like a cafe is supposed to feel in my opinion. this company has pretty awesome benefits and provides a lot of opportunity to grow. scheduling is usually pretty flexible but that kind of thing does depend on good management per store. I do wish pay could go up a little more. I just think relying on tips can be stressful however like i said its a coffee job. the pay is pretty fair. It would be better if management had a little higher pay though there didn't seem to be as much incentive (other than to put on a resume that you had been a manager).
good,"I liked working here. It was fast paced but, I like that. The customers were nice and tipped us well. The staff I worked with was great for the most part."
good,"Customers and employees were great,but the location main management was inexperienced making the job stressful. Communication was always a big problem"
good,It was a fast paced work environment that was welcoming and very demanding. It offered great benefits but would not always value its workers. But it was always a fun environment because of my fellow partners.
good,"The culture Starbucks wishes to promote is definitely admirable, and sometimes achieved. But the increased demands on employees, especially management, and increased labor cuts, means that work satisfaction, and shift quality for employees and customers, suffers immensely. If it was the Starbucks of my teenage years, that encouraged differences and uniqueness and local vibrancy, I would be less inclined to quit. But company fears over profitability and expensive reinventiveness have cost it more employees than I can count, and many a lost night of sleep due to stressful working conditions. Unless things change, I am pleased to have left. I am sadly disappointed by the company's direction and treatment of its staff. "
good,"Starbucks was never going to be my career, its a decent side job. It really comes down to the store manager if your experience is enjoyable. Pay is above minimum but not great, decent benefits."
good,Great atmosphere where employees are valued and Leadership is being to create an environment of belonging through out mission and values each and every single day
good,Training is a joke. They give you modules that take all day to do yet you leave with very little knowledge of how to make drinks. When you finally get to making drinks they don't follow half the things you just learned. The overall atmosphere is to make as many drinks as possible while not drowning too deep in orders. The only positives I can think about are that shifts are typically 4-6 hours so work/life balance is possible. You also get a pound of beans from your choosing free every week along with a free drink and meal during every shift at work.
good,"great networking, built great relationships with the associates and customers. The company has great benefits such as coffee mark outs, food mark outs, 401k, stock options and tuition reimbursement."
good,"Starbucks has a strong presence of its culture inside the office. "
good,"-Though job is secure and they hardly let anyone go, the management in my experience has never been decent. They bully their employees and are hardly ever reprimanded because the higher ups seem not to  give them anything but verbal warnings."
good,Flexible schedule and amazing benefits especially with tuition reimbursement.  Free coffee each week with free drink and food during shifts.  Ability to advance.
good,"Great job"
good,"Starbucks is a great transitional job from high-school to college or from college to career. There are many opportunities for growth and development of transferable work skills. "
good,"I was put on the morning shift where it's at their busiest time of the day. It would normally start with me opening the store with 2 other team members at 4:30 AM and business would pick up at around 5:30 - 6 AM and lasts up until almost noon. "
good,"Well outside rude customers, homeless people tryna do crack in the toilets, constantly breathing cleaning chemicals and tiring shifts, it pays the bill for a student or generally less determined individual. Quite social too."
good,"I felt like Starbucks was a good company to work for, however, the specific store I worked in was not reflective of that in regards to inner employee treatment. I was made a lot of empty promises"
good,"Working at Starbucks has helped me learn a lot about working well with others and providing great customer service and how to connect well with others. It has also taught me to be a very hard working, dedicated, reliable worker, to handle stressful situations appropriately and to get things done well in a timely manner."
good,"Starbucks is wonderful place to work as a first job or for a younger student starting college. Job is pretty easy overall. I'd say the hardest part is dealing with terrible customers, and that's honestly not really hard. It's just an inconvenience."
good,"On a daily its unpredictable but in the right store with the right management it is fun to work for the company. "
good,The location I had worked for was very fast paced and high demand for such a small store which made things very stressful. Otherwise the job wouldn’t have been too bad
good,"Starbucks is inherently what you make it, and for me, it was moving to a bigger city, meeting great people, but in the end, an exhausting experience.  Growth opportunities were possible, but often felt limiting, and what great managers I had, unfortunately, often left with frustrations.  Overall it was a good experience, but there were certainly some trepidation."
good,"I do love Starbucks for all the customer service it has gifted me with. I worked for Starbucks for 3+ years and right when I was being trained to be an ASM, a new manager came in, with no experience, trying to dictate everything and change everything. Although change is great, and a part of our life as humans, but the changes had nothing to do with our mission"
good,i would still work there if the pay was better. great environment . fast paced but must learn a few things. flexible schedule . good benefits. just not enough pay to ne able to survive.
good,Starbucks is a great company to work for. The health benefits are beautiful. Starbucks is a job that you get as a college student or someone who needs a job while chasing their real career goals.
good,I would recommend working at Starbucks to a friend; my only caviout would be to push yourself to move up immediately. If they do not hear you pushing for advancement they will not always give you what you feel you deserve.
good,"I worked at Starbucks while I was living at home, but once I moved to a new state, I took a pay cut and it just wasn't enough to live on in my area. The store I worked at was actually ok, but our manager wasn't exactly on top of it so a lot of the problems we had could have been resolved without her there. Overall, not a bad place to work, but I would only recommend it to someone as a part time thing. Not good for someone trying to make a living on their own."
good,"tons of traffic, not enough baristas, low pay for high amount of work, espresso machines contantly breaking due to such high volume of drinks being made each day"
good,"Good job, good benefits. Lots of coffee! Lots of talking and getting to know your community. Depending on the area you work, customers are wonder and staff feels like family."
good,"I enjoyed working with starbucks, the partners were always nice and we always had a good time. they respected one another, but the manager that was hired on did not meet the starbucks standards."
good,"Managers are very understanding and create a positive working environemnt"
good,"A typical day at Starbucks Honolulu, management would schedule too few employees for optimum performance for store location. With the fast paced environment due to location, each station should be manned and if staff is lacking, the store would suffer as well as the customers. The hardest part of the job would be that Starbucks sometimes lacks the resources to properly train each employee the correct way, so learning on the job in the speedy environment is pretty difficult.The best part of the job however, would definitely be client base. Starbucks attracts many different kinds of people that become repeat customers. There's nothing like memorizing a customer's name and drink order and watching their eyes light up because you remembered them."
good,"The company has shifted from third place (first place is your home, second place is your work, and third place was the place in between) to a take your drink and leave (especially seen in drive thru stores). I am not a fan of this company structure, and it wares people like me down pretty quickly."
good,"Some days everyone you work with is considerate and helpful, working together.  Other days there is a culture of superiority among baristas and there can be a passive aggressive attitude in the air."
good,"The continuing and pressing demands for the last year and half's most recent ""employee morale push"" implemented as ""The Northstar Experience"" has been much to be desired when it balances the responsibilities expected, and the compensation granted."
good,"This job is crazy, fast pace, and just the most funniest job. The management with the partners there make every shift a way that Im able to learn as well excel in my weakness and my strengths as well. The culture of Starbucks in a place the we as partners as well as the customers can keep coming back to their third home.  Ive learned that I know that Im going to keep learning more and more everyday."
good,"A fast-paced job with lots of potential for fun. Pay isn't great for the amount of work but the job itself is not bad. Great people, fun environment most of the time"
good,"Starbucks is a fun place to work, with the right coworkers and customers (as any place can be). We were all hard workers and got along pretty well. There was limited drama and it was (sorry to repeat myself, but) fun. The hardest part of the job, for me, was being patient with newbies and remembering that I had been new once, too."
good,"Great place to work, with the right people. There's a lot of cleaning to be done but I find it helps time go by faster. Working peak times can be very stressful as Starbucks holds every store to a standard of low drive thru and cafe wait times, regardless of quantity/type of drinks ordered. Customers are usually friendly and compassionate, but I guarantee at least once daily you will encounter an entitled person who isn't afraid to literally scream at you because they had to wait 5 minutes for their drink. Depending on your store/management there will be plenty of opportunities for advancement and trasnfers. But whether or not you really want it is questionable. Shift supervisors only make $1-2 more than baristas and their umbrella of responsibility is much larger. Starbucks preaches an ethical and welcoming environment but it often feels one-sided, for customers only. Pay is too low for workload required, with very few opportunities for meager raises, which benefits do not make up for. The people truly make the job here, and if you have uncooperative coworkers, petty management, and difficult customers, you will not last here. However with a strong team it becomes bearable. When I worked here I always said, I love my job, and I love the people I work with, but I hate Starbucks."
good,"Starbucks gave me very good benefits, and laid out the standard procedures and everything very well. My store manager had many issues, but when she quit things got better. The customers are evil and demanding, and yell and curse at you everyday."
good,"As my first job, this really taught me how to talk to strangers and work-environment etiquette. Along with this were the perks of having free food all the time. As a college student, this was really helpful in making sure I ate well on a daily basis (and the food there isn't all that unhealthy, there were numerous healthy options). The pay wasn't bad too. But I think the biggest downside were the hours and duties, as they would try to max me out in hours and make me clean the bathrooms on a daily basis. Though this shouldn't be an issue if you fully express how you feel about the hours/duties. The manager and supervisor were pretty accommodating."
good,"It was a decent place to work. For the type of job it is, there are quite a few benefits. But if you are trying to support multiple people off of your paycheck, you are not going to get it as a barista at Starbucks. Probably best for teenagers and single adults."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks consisted of keeping baked goods stocked, drinks made to perfection and to order, keeping a clean work space and always having a smile on our faces."
good,"After working four different stores, I can determine that they probably need a better screening process for the managers they hire. They weren't horrible, but three out of four were bullies. Overall work experience, it isn't a difficult job. It can be stressful at times, but any job can do that. It isn't majorly physically or mentally demanding, but it can be very repetitious. There's good benefits and school assistance and opportunities to advance further career-wise. It's impressive that there's an option for those considering not everyone make salary or works full time. Other than that, it's just an average job to work."
good,"Hotel is going thru a renovation so hours are getting cut left and right. It provides the benefits but because of the cuts, you won't be able to get them because you won't be making full time hours"
good,"It's a nice place to work at if you enjoy talking to people and if you enjoy a fast pace environment. They're very flexible with college students and they offer 401K benefits, health and dental insurance. I especially liked that this company is ethically aware of the products they sell. A typical day at work consists of ringing up people at the register, making drinks, playing a supporting role, cleaning and managing the drive-thru( it all depend on the position you are placed in that day). The company expects a lot from their barista's so expect your managers to be on you about excelling every day. I really enjoy the wonderful friendships I've made with my coworkers as well as the customers whom I've befriended. Making those connections with people made my store seem like a neighborhood coffee shop rather than the multi-million dollar company that it is. At the same time customers are what made my job not enjoyable at times since some people are rude and impatient. I recommend you have a thick skin if you intent on working here."
good,Peoples demands as well as corporate demands are too much to bare. It's continuously changing and prices change without warning as well as promotions.
good,"The work environment is pleasant and the job is relatively easy, despite being consistently fast paced and nonstop. Management does a good job providing people with appropriate break and lunch times; and takes care of employees by offering health insurance and 401k option. Management can be improved by providing more cultural humility training for their workers along with providing a higher starting wage."
good,"Starbucks is my first retail-like job and it's been a great experience. My manager does a great job working with my schedule to see what fits best and I always feel welcomed by my team and the team culture is pretty healthy. "
good,"Great place to start and gain experience with opportunities to move up in the company. Great benefits and partners are well taken care of. Friendly, energetic environment and place to work."
good,It is a fun job but can get very busy.  you have to be able to move very quickly to be able to help all customers that come into the store. there is a good culture and good benefits.
good,"Starbucks has topaught me value expericance that I will use through out my life. They proved some what flexible work hours, nous ever the management is constantly changing."
good,"My idea of Starbucks changed once I actually got behind and espresso machine. I become in love with the idea of creating a beverage that the customer could truly enjoy. Easy work that requires common sense, and a positive attitude even when times get hard."
good,"Not the relaxed coffee job that college students want. You need to be a self-starter that works hard and wants it. Overall, the company does it's ""best"" to be good to its partners but there is a major disconnect between corporate and the actual stores."
good,"It was a good place to work. Really enjoyed the pace of work and the teammates that I worked alongside. It was a tough part of town I worked in - Many rich people who didn't care about the employees, but it was still doable."
good,"Working for Starbucks was a really interesting experience. My manager is one of the kindest people I have ever known, and made working there really worth it. The job itself is definitely tiring, and your list of responsibilities is expansive to say the least. Fast paced, high stress, but had some really rewarding moments. I learned so much from my experience there. Overall a really wonderful first job, where you can gain valuable skills. Good things to keep in mind though: if you are an introvert, this is not the job for you. You are dealing with the general public every single day, all day. You are constantly on your feet, you don't stop moving all shift, and it's a different experience every single day."
good,good place to work. Got promoted quickly. Very friendly atmosphere. Great coffee benefits and above average health care also 401k and dental were included.
good,"I worked at Starbucks for just over 2 years.  It's pretty easy work, really easy to move up (as long as you show interest and are willing to change stores).  The customers can be absolutely horrible though and were a huge part of why I left customer service."
good,Starvbucks is a great company all in all. The environment to the customers honestly. You meet a vast range of people which comes clutch for networkers. But it comes with a decent check and the shift splits the tips from the previous week (weekly) so gas should almost never be a prob :)
good,I enjoy working at Starbucks! It is a great place to have a part time job. It has been fun to learn more about people and coffee while making new connections with people.
good,"Overall my Starbucks experience was not bad. I did not get along with my co-workers or some of my customers, but I am grateful for having an opportunity to work there."
good,"Everyone I worked with was younger and around my age, we all seemed to get along which made the 5 am opening shifts bearable. There was a lot of pushing by management to go above and beyond even though they were clear that there were no incentives to do any more than the bare minimum. It's a great work environment although most of the higher-ups are hired outside of the company limiting how far you can really climb after you become a shift."
good,"I enjoyed to work for Starbucks because I had chance to make a lot of good friends and meet interesting people. Also I learned a lot about coffee. It is a good place to work, especially when you love coffee and you love to work with people."
good,Teaches you how to handle difficult customers by giving them what they want...I say good work experience because it helps you learn how to prioritize your time and follow a routine in the workplace. Most days are pretty predictable.
good,"The people I work with, for the most part, are also hard working which makes work a bit easier but can be stressful at times when your already working hard and then the company expects you to reevaluate yourself on how you can do better."
good,"Certainly, a great place to work culture-wise.  There are tons of friendly people who genuinely want to make the customer experience top notch.  However, given that Starbucks is a retail company the tech side of the house comes with some baggage, although that's in a transition phase.  If you're in it for the long haul you may stay for a while, however, if you dislike traditional top-down management and slow pace of innovation, you'll likely start to look elsewhere sooner rather than later."
good,I enjoyed my time at Starbucks. I feel that I was treated relatively well and fairly by the company. I did not enjoy the way the manager ran the store which was ultimately why I left
good,"If your store is fully staffed working at Starbucks could be awesome, but if not you will be running back and forth looking like an idiot while angry customers stare at you. A typical day can be multitasking to the max, energy can be awesome sometimes, customers are mostly nice, rare exceptions for angry people but it happens, management depends on the store but expect to work during the worst snow storms possible. I remember having to come in when there was an emergency broadcast on the news for no one to leave. They do not care. What makes it enjoyable is the people and benefits of this company, they hook you with the perks. Like most cooperations, they look good on paper but in practice they suck."
good,It can be a fast pace environment but also a slow pace. there are many aspects of the job that you will have to kind of not let yourself be bothered by people comments customer or partner.
good,I met a lot of caring people there and the customers were some of the biggest perks in working for this company. Along with free coffee and food every shift.
good,"Very busy, but the time working there is worth the pay, great benefits and great hours. Would recommend if looking for full time. Overall an interesting and great place to work and get associated with."
good,Working here all depends on the structure of your store and the work environment promoted by your store manager. I've worked at stores in which there were so many personalities  that it was hard to get fellow staff to see the bigger picture which is the satisfaction of the customers. Other than your work place everything else about working here is about routine. Some customers are amazing and others are nightmares.
good,I learned to barista the old fashion way but this place needed the automatic machine. I was so busy my day would go by quickly and i enjoyed it. I had a car i had to drive. The parking was what made it hard here in waikiki hawaii near the zoo. I worked for john whome had a great sense in managing the store and we had great attitudes.
good,Be open to change in the work place. Overall it is a great second job or first time job. When working for the company take full advantage of benefits.
good,Working at Starbucks was fun and at the same time very busy. I worked at a rest stop so it might be different than a corporate business but yea sometimes it was good and sometimes it was bad but thats every popular place right?
good,Free coffee is great but the work is fast paced and can be very stressful. Customers are entitled and rude. It's kind of like working at an adult day care.
good,fast paced. fun work environment. some days more relaxed than others. there are times when you feel like things won't get done but they do. time management here is very important.
good,"The company is a great company and they offer their employees flexibility. Unfortunately, the manager at the time of my working there was not a great manager, which made my experience not as positive as it could have been."
good,"A typical day at starbucks is always different. You can typically expect a fast-paced, high-stress environment around 60% of the time depending on the time of day that you work. During my time with starbucks I learned some great interpersonal skills and team-building exercises."
good,"The pressure and expectations of being management are not conducive to a growth work environment. While management may have its perks, scheduling and pressure are not fun. Nor do they negotiate vacation."
good,It has been a fun work place with great benefits. It is a fast pace environment with great opportunities to interact with different types of people. The best part of this job is working with different personalities and learning how to cope in high stress situations.
good,"I really like my job when I first came there but when I saw why they needed help so bad it really changed my outlook. There it was a fast-paced, very very particular way of doing things.  Which was expected for a job like that but, there were too many responsibilities for the little staff we had. For the simple fact they did not want to hire anybody new ."
good,Working here was a great place for a college student. The hour is flexible however the work load is stressful. Face-paced and stressful while working here is the usual day.
good,"In my time with Starbucks, I learned a vast amount about coffee, logistical team management, and streamlined food strategies. Management tended to be devoted, consistent, and well trained in my experience. My manager was quick to notice potential talent and leadership skills in employees and work with them to encourage internal company growth. "
good,"A typical day at Starbucks can be either fast or slow paced depending on the season and other factors. It is a monotonous and repetitive job that can be a lot of fun with the right coworkers. While working for Starbucks, I learned a lot about how the company works, and I got an idea of just how much large companies like this waste on a daily basis. Management in my store was good overall, but the company itself is horrible and unfair to it's employees. The hardest part of the job was working with the customers and general public. Also the ever-changing rules and regulations and menu items that pass through the store. The best part of the job was working with the best coworkers ever."
good,It would be slow in the early morning and puts up a little later and become a fast paced work environment interacting with customers and team members. Management is poor but can be great.
good,"never easy or relaxed, even closing or overnight shifts can easily become overwhelming, but you learn to multitask and push yourself. You meet really interesting people working, but customers can often be disheartening"
good,Very stressful as you could imagine. I worked on a college campus so my experience was different. I was the porter who gets menu items from various stock rooms and coolers.
good,"Starbucks in all was good. I had a couple great managers, though I had a couple not so great ones, too. I had some magnificent and extra kind coworkers, and I also had some who were rude. You get unlimited coffee and discounts, which is great, and all in all the benefits and making coffee is nice, but that is not all that the job is. The job itself is actually very stressful, with customers literally yelling at you all day, being pressured to go as fast as you possibly can, literally running across the floor to try to appease entitled customers, infinite stress, tears from coworkers as well as yourself ... be prepared to deal with a lot. It is not an easy job and a lot will be placed on your shoulders. But if you can deal with it, it's okay."
good,"If you like fast paced jobs, this is it. I get yelled at a lot, deal with crazy people who need their fix and only make a couple dollars more than min. wage to have a key to the store and count their money."
good,"I would not say it was the best job. The benefits are great if you work enough. Advancement is limited in both work positions and pay. I am just sick of working in food service/retail. My favorite part of working at Starbucks, though, is that I can work in different barista positions throughout a shift instead of standing in one place."
good,Its was a great job but also sometimes we have to move on. The manager was amazing and always willing to help you reach and get to your goals. The most enjoyable thing is the community of people around and fellow baristas
good,Starbucks is a great company that offers many benefits to care for its employees. My experience was ruined by awful management that created poor working conditions. Every aspect of the job was great despite management. If your store is ran by a tyrant that honors none of Starbucks core values you're going to have a bad time.
good,Supervised and directed baristas professionally and respectfully. Multi-tasked and always kept to corporations standards for efficiency and accuracy. Enjoyed connecting with regular guests and knowing their order and names by heart.
good,"The only real issue I ever found working for Starbucks stems from the fact that it's a massive corporation. This leads to employees often feel like what they do doesn't matter and also that their employer sees them as nothing more than a number on a spreadsheet. However the day to day work is fast paced, engaging, and the people are friendly. If the size of the company doesn't matter to you this is a great place to work."
good,"a typical day of work includes promoting the culture of satisfying the customer's demands despite their lack of manners and lack of courtesy. depending on the time of day, rushes are spent handling various beverages with over 10 people staring at you from the hand-off area expectantly. The managers make the effort to accommodate students with busy school schedules. Aside from making beverages, most of the job is cleaning every single thing that is washable."
good,I enjoyed working here with our manager as soon as she got hired. I think this is a good place to work because of all of the benefits they have included.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of clocking in, and cashiering for a whole shift on average. I was not really enjoying my store location because of how un-organized it was."
good,I really liked working for Starbucks and being a barista. Getting a chance to meet celebrities at the location I worked at was always amazing. It just had poor management there who played favoritism with other employees.
good,"It's fast paced and advancement was pretty competitive at my store. You have to deal with a lot of customers, who are simply not going to be that friendly no matter what you do. You will also likely get burns from hot coffee, but my coworkers and management always made up for what was bad. If a customer was rude to me, my coworkers were always there to cheer me up. Additionally, the benefits at Starbucks are really great, though I personally did not use them."
good,"We are currently pressed to push customers though the store. Dont really get to connect with the customers anymore. The company has changed a lot. they offer a lot of benefits, but the work environment has gone quite downhill from what it used to be."
good,"Great Benefits (discounts,dental, leaves,perks), high pressure (sales, customer satisfaction), low staff morale ( pressure to perform, targets too high)"
good,Great place to work. but they keep changing the raise dates claiming to be something else. management is strong to make sure business runs smoothly and to ensure customer satisfaction.
good,"Great place to work with opportunity in advancement. Fun, fast paced, rewarding job if you love interacting with people and inspiring people as you help start their day."
good,"Starbucks culture is the best thing about the job. The fast paced, relaxing atmosphere, combined with great coworkers makes for a smooth, friendly, and productive day. I learned a lot about how teamwork and flow of work can make a job great, but to me there was always one thing lacking. Management was my only issue. Between poor scheduling, or complete lack of scheduling it was a nightmare. It seemed every member of the team was on board and participating expect for upper management. Poor scheduling, ordering, and general mismanagement went completely against the flow of the rest of the people working."
good,I've worked here too long and would like to leave Why am i being forced to to write a review? Its a decent place to work but I don't want to work there forever.
good,"A lot of the workers work at a bare minimum; it is hard to be an ambitious employee. Higher, corporate management almost rarely does improvements, unless stated otherwise by their boss. Scheduling is always a hassle; they bulk up on a lot of employees with part-time shifts and vary with full-time opportunities. There is no motivation or incentive to improve systems."
good,Overall good company to work for. The benefits are great and the pay is good depending on what your responsibilities are. You have to be able to take hard criticism while dealing with multiple personalities. Very fast paced and a lot of manual labor.
good,"Its hard dealing with people before their morning coffee and opening at 4:30. "
good,"Starbucks is incredibly fast paced. It requires thick skin and the ability to deal with change. To be successful you need to constantly be finding the balance between innovation and efficiency, and you have to understand teamwork. Overall I think it has lost the magic of its early years. It still seems like a special place, but it seems to be chasing its own tail as far as direction. Its just repackaging old concepts. Its business culture looks good on paper, but it isn't as nimble as it leads you to believe. It is as strong as its district managers. They are the backbone of the stores and the company. The store managers are the next most important pieces, then everyone at the store levels. Regional directors and above are very disconnected beyond their P&L's and current stock prices.......Mostly. There is still a lot of talent its just buried in the behemoth. I learned a great deal here. The people who led me....Amazing! I had it way better than most. I would take this experience over a B. of S. in business any day, but that was because of the people who led me. I was very fortunate."
good,"It's a huge company all over the world, unfortunately for the amount of stress one endures these days and the lack of pay makes a tenured barista rather bitter.  Working 32 + hours a week and not being able to afford the basic cost of living is not enjoyable.  Gone are the days of feeling appreciated and now just being a number. Granted we get full time benefits at part time hours, free pound of coffee a week, one free food item a day and free beverages on our shifts, but  I'd rather have a higher wage then have free food and drinks.. After 20 years of working all positions in a store, being a partner of the quarter, a coffee master, a barista trainer and constantly exceeding expectations, making under $15 is  embarrassing for a company that makes as much as they do. Any partner that works more than 5 years with the company gets the exact same $ amount for a bonus."
