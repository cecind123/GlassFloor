rating,review
bad,This company is just run by old school boys club; the management have no care to their employees; managements yelling to the employees are common; do not expect work life balance with this company;
bad,Amkor is a very political and difficult enviornment to work.
bad,Hiring managers are busy people. A single job posting might attract thousands of resume imagine having to read through all of them to pick out the best-looking candidates. Newsflash: Hiring managers don't read the entirety of every single resume that hits their desk. There's just no time.
bad,"this company is not recomded ,the System management is poor."
bad,Very demanding environment with a low emphasis on work life balance especially if you are mid and low management category. Not much growth unless you are a korean but compensation is on par at market value.
bad,Fast paced environment where you are expected to deliver more than expected for you to get ahead. Did not have an opportunity to more up the ladder due to 'budget constraints' but was not evident on other departments. They could have managed people better but did not seem to care about the junior resources. No voice on what happens next for people.
bad,"A typical day starts with constant follow-up and never ending quality issues thus, your time is allotted for several activities that you'll have to learn intensive multi-tasking. "
bad,"Despite being a MNC, the management's mindset is way before time. Career growth can hardly be seen and corporate knowledge is not passed down from top. New comers need to learn the hard way and unable to push our own potentials to the maximum."
bad,The enjoyable part of the training is the mentoring of key people from the line maintenance. They are easy to get along with and there are many 'maintenance' situations to learn from.
bad,"As an Engineer, a typical day at Amkor is usually spent making 8D reports and answering customer issues. Amkor's customers always complain and Engineers just spend way too much time answering those complaints. In fact answering complaints at Amkor is such an everyday chore that it has already become the unspoken measure/definition of how good or bad an engineer can be. The better you are at making a powerpoint presentation following what the boss wants, the better engineer you are in their eyes. True engineering skills do not matter or count at Amkor, how fast and how beautiful you make a report that is pleasing to the eyes of the boss and the customer is only what matters. Since Amkor is a subcontractor, it is extremely vulnerable to the customer's wims and many times unrealistic demands. There are product standards defined, but are mostly outdated and almost always over-ruled by the customers. This causes a myriad of problems later during execution. What I learned in Amkor is that you should always keep/compile objective evidences of past activities to protect yourself from complaints and accusations by customers and by management. Organizational charts change too often (typically every 6 moths or less) and there is little to no chance of specializing in a particular expertise and develop skills. Job descriptions are not followed and a ""may be assigned other tasks and duties as required"" clause is always exploited to the full. You may find yourself assigned to a particular station today and then transferred immediately without prior notice tomorrow with no skill sets whatever"
bad,"Assist costumers he/she inside the store"
bad,"being a mold operator, exciting new place new surrounding,i came from trim form sigulation before...before more fun in amkor, but suddenly benefits gone one by one until now."
bad,HR leadership needs to be seriously looked at. It’s abusive and creates negative effects. They don’t care about you unless you are part of the inner circle. They have an “us” vs. “them” mentality. No knowledge on Amkors business and factory environments. It demoralizes lots of hard working employees.
