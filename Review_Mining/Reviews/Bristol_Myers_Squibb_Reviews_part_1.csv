rating,review
bad,They dont pay for holiday pay. Leads or disrespectful.  A lil bit of favoritism with races. Dont understand people's have outside problems with family that they may have to call off.
bad,"My manager was so busy that he didnt have time for this direct reports."
bad,It was fun. I smoked everyday when i when into work. The place id full of junkies recovering in delray. Beware! They hire people without any experience.
bad,Classica azienda che cerca di lucrare su persone che hanno bisogno di lavorare.
bad,I have never worked for a pharma compnay that was 20 years behind the times and compliance was not valued. Staff is overworked and people are not motivtaed. It is very hard to meet deadlines here qhen everyone is chasing a regulatory commitment with band aides
bad,"Culture at BMS is poor at best.  If you don't work in NJ it is obviously because you are stupid.  I was actually told I wasn't paid to think, I was paid to do what I was told.  Even though what I was told was aainst regulations.  Poor management, poor culture, poor salary.  This is the first job I have ever left in under a year."
bad,"Do you think it is possible – that will all the money this company spends on meetings outside the corporate office’s it owns that just once…maybe just once you could leave a tip for the people who service you?? The people who get up so early in the morning to make sure your room is set right, breakfast is out, put lunch out - services your dinners that is paid for on company time and by the company.... and we put up with you not knowing how to use a projector and all your other needs – maybe you could toss us a few bucks once and awhile and say thank you! You right it off in your company tab anyway…..us servers in NJ and PA would appreciate it! and cash would be nice. Thank you!"
bad,Working here was painful! company is stuck in a time warp and would not reccommend working here.  I would equate the culture to 1950's mad men era! All the people in postions that can make a difference DONT! they are not able to be forward thining and agile.  The diversity and inclusion here is even worse.  They consistently pass by talented qualified hires to the detriment of the company.
bad,"The group I worked with were not professional, quite the opposite. It was not a good place to work. There are PM's that leave within a month. There are some that stay a year or more."
bad,"I've worked at BMS as a permanent employee and as a contractor. Depending on the department you work in, it will determine your work environment. Some departments are great to work in and some are a nightmare. Currently, working in the nightmare environment. Very unorganized environment, unprofessional boss, only negative feedback."
bad,Company is being destroyed by owners' greed. Owned by capital management firm.
bad,un ambiente de trabajo muy tenso fue la empresa que se fusiono con abeefe asimismo invito a los trabajadores a retirarse por el cierre del laboratorio.
bad,"I never would have chosen BMS as an employer.  They acquired Amylin Pharmaceuticals and that is the only reason I was with them during this time.  They were not honest about their intentions.  Cannot trust any level of management in general.   Extremely stressful company to work for.  They send multiple sales reports that conflict with one another.  No clear direction for sales force.  Lack of support for sales team.  No clear directives for marketing message especially concerning competing products within BMS.  "
bad,"Unfortunately the site closed, but overall what a wonderful career I had there."
bad,"All politics and terrible management, the only way to do anything there is knowing someone and following stupid orders given by undeserving and moronic management."
bad,they are slowly but surely getting rid of all the persons of color.  This is probably the worst place to work.  Leadership is in a tailspin - no one knows what they are doing.
bad,Management is mediocre and lack vision. Not a healthy place to work if you value mental health
bad,Good work place. Good workplace culture. Very good work life balance and they are always concerned about employee satisfaction. Good leadership and Management.
bad,"Loved my manager and he did everything he could for me. "
bad,"Looked down upon for not having college degree, treated poorly by eneginners and chemists, never given the chance to apply to other areas, always looking for an escape goat"
bad,The Tampa Florida location is managed by a bunch of goons from the street. All 3 of my superiors were given there jobs because they know someone that works in the company not because they have the education or experience to do the job. Only the superiors work for the company 95% of the employees that work in Tampa location are temps. What does that tell you about the company they only want to use you to reduce there load they have no intentions of keeping you or giving you company benefits.  Don’t get me wrong Bristol-Myers is a great company the only down side it’s poorly managed and controlled in Tampa Florida where I’m located I wish I had asked to be transferred before being micro managed and let go after a year of stress and regrets working for people that have less education than myself. By the way I worked in the IT department with mr G as my boss
bad,"Exciting science and patient focus"
bad,"Working culture is horrible with racial discrimination. Employees focus on building relationship which they think it is more important and efficient for their job security, promotion, etc."
bad,"Before Zymo was acquired by BMS, the rating would be 5 stars. The commercial side has greatly changed under the newly inserted BMS leadership (if you dare to call them leaders)"
bad,"the managment plays favorites and the culture at BMS has completly changed. Everyone is so cut-throat, they will throw you under the bus just to make themselves look better."
bad,Ottima azienda ma lavoro troppo instabile e troppo stressante
bad,very few chances for carrier advancement due to low no of promoted products. the intercontental region where we are located is out of the general scope of the company which reflects on the resources
bad,"Nice place to work.  IT ='s overhead so lots of outsourcing."
bad,"Massive passive-aggresive behaviors or simply aggressive. Unprofessional practices, no direction, no drive and a feeling that “nobody cares”. Too many politics and very complicated structure."
bad,"This is an employer that overworks its employees by maintaining an inefficient culture plagued by inefficient policies, procedures, and excessive meetings.  In addition, it is an excessively relationship-based company, which results in a proliferation of cliques and favoritism.  Lastly, this is not a company that appreciates and values diversity, as demonstrated by it's extremely low level of African American, Latino, and Asian representation, and even lower advancement into management ranks.  On a positive note, I was compensated adequately over the five years I was with the company."
bad,"Very good benefits and work/life balance."
bad,Everything in the powerhouse line of work is here.But for the amount of equiptment to operate-the compensation is not enough.Also the hours are not good.
bad,"My personal experience with the manager who's initials are M.M. this department consist of much older women who'd been with BMS for 17 years plus.  Their culture is rigid and old fashioned. They weren't open to a more modern technical work style.  I'm extremely independent, efficient, thorough and very technically savvy.  This being said when performing a task I found short-cuts,  ways to achieve the same results in a more efficient manner.  Which created great time management, and unfortunately frowned upon unbeknownst to me.  I survived 4 weeks in this antiquated unsophisticated asinine group and I'm not just referring to their processes."
bad,No valoran los resultados de trabajo sino se enfocan a tu relación con el jefe
bad,"Recruited but let go after only four months so my job could be filled by a manager's friend,  so difficult to have an unbiased opinion of the company.  "
bad,"Last manager was a joke,"
bad,"BMS was a very challenging workplace, the hours were long and management had not problem ensuring that you knew you could be replaced with yet another consultant. Turnover was high in the tax department, primarily run by PWC or Alpha Consulting employees brought on board. The pay was excellent, but no benefits at all, and finding a way to take time off was difficult as a result. Once worked 36 hours straight with 1 hour spent sleeping on the couch in the lobby."
bad,no work life balance; expect to work 12-16 hr days. The company downsizes; employees are overextended. No job security or loyalty overall. Typical corporate environment.
bad,"When working with Bancroft, you are merely just a number that does not matter in their business outlook. They do not care about the customer and their needs and they go after every change order they can in order to make a profit. They try to be very fague about the sub contractors scopes so they can make the subs responsible for items they are not usually required to perform. They have a moto of they Hire for Life, well in the last 4 years, the turnover rate is extremely high, higher than I have ever seen at any other company besides McDonald's."
bad,For many years I loved BMS. the management appeared to truly care for its people and patients. BMS oncology has become very primary care all about numbers first patients second or third. You are expendable no matter how well you perform and it is in your best interest to establish unhealthy relationships with upper management to retain your job. Very sad for a company with amazing products and pipeline for oncology
bad,"Not a great place to work at. As a contractor, they don't give you benefits, don't treat people equally and are constantly underestimating the work and the hours worked. There is no growth, no learning curve and they will also not encourage making a push towards a permanent position after the contract is over. There was also not much interaction with other coworkers. There is always budget issues being talked about, and hiring freezes."
bad,"I am a results-oriented leader with a proven record of achieving objectives in a Fortune 500 environment, and a highly effective project manager with experience leading multi-functional teams in both a direct and indirect leadership role. Excellent technical and analytical skills, organized with strong attention to detail and deadlines. Demonstrated ability working at all levels within an organization including effective interaction with executive management. "
bad,Most enjoyable part of the job is working with client group to resolve issues and support the business. Limited opportunity for advancement unless you are good at the politics
bad,"The working environment and day will ultimately depend on which group and shift you work on. Some teams are built adequately with very talented people that have great work ethic and are very easy going. "
bad,"Restruturaçao efectuada em 2011/2012, logo existiu uma centralização de servicos de de alguma forma bloquearam todos os meus objectivos de carreira"
bad,Company seems to be stuck in the 1990's pharma world and hasnt adapted to 2015. Management very inflexible. Coworkers were great.
bad,The culture was not what i was looking for in a career.  Direct manager did not create an open enviroment.
bad,"Sometimes change is good but the employees in Syracuse seem paranoid, unhappy and very insecure and 20 years ago they were ALL happy. It's just really sad. It's actually kind of a depressing place now."
bad,"It is a great place to work if you are an Employee. If you are doing the exact same job and you happen to be a contingent you get none of the benefits. The pay is also nowhere close to the Employees."
bad,"Currently, the Company is undergoing a significant downsizing and it is not a pleasurable atmosphere."
bad,I would not recommend this company to anyone looking for a job.  The company culture is not one that I enjoyed - it is very much like being in Romper Room where there is no equity regarding employees' behaviors.  Some employees are rewarded for bad behavior while others are not rewarded for being a model employee.
bad,This company bought the company I had worked for sixteen years.  The corporate culture was not the same as the former company.  I left the company for these reasons.
bad,"Very inexperienced and disorganized sales management in my area."
bad,BMS is a good company but job security should not be expected.
bad,"Managers show favoritism, company promotion is difficult, manager's make poor decisions"
bad,Interesting work in a stressful and fast paced environment.  Good pay and benefits. Poor management with to many levels and no accountability.  Hardest part of the job was dealing with all the politics.
bad,Had an dysfunctional abusive team member at the same level who was promoted to AD. Could not wok there anymore. The entire group  was abused over and over with no redress for decades. In the end this AD found joy in laying off the whole team whom she did not respect and actually irrationally distaned.
bad,"Management did not keep its promise to me, even though it is in writing. Management has so many meetings that they can not keep to their own mantra of staring and ending on time."
bad,"The Irish couldn't run a p1ss up in a brewery, always having meetings and not actually getting any work done. I pointed out that we were in fact having too many meetings and I was told without a trace of irony to 'book a meeting to discuss it' If I was the sort of person content to be sat there doing feck all, I could still be there earning 11,000.00 euros per month."
bad,"Hours are crazy for some groups (Finance) and less than 35 a week for others. "
bad,I don't recommend anybody working in BMS. It has very high employee turnover.
bad,Not a healthy work environment re management. Harrassment ran rampent and was not welcomed among team members. Unprofessional conduct abounded.
bad,"This company does not follow the culture that it states it provides"
bad,"Was a great company several years ago."
bad,"The People are great working together very helpful and always pushing each other to work harder. Although the new Management Team that was hired to come in had no answers to anyone's questions to where we would have to wait Months for an answer, Management would get upset if ""too many"" questions asked. other than that its a good place to work."
bad,"Micro-management by superiors."
bad,"Company has changed significantly the last year.  Transformation has negatively impacted morale across the company.  Rumors of bms being sold or broken up persist.  There are increased workloads with fewer and fewer people to do the work.  In addition to workloads, slow decision making, poor prioritization and yet the need for everything to be perfect make for tough and long days."
bad,"I have worked for Bristol- Meyers for many years now. Bristol- Myers is a great company to work for they have great benefits and descent pay.  However Management at the Redwood City campus has drastically changed and has taken a turn for the worst. This is a company that I used to have pride in working for but the culture of this company has now changed. Management is very critical, negative and demeaning to their employees. They micro manage staff. Staff members used to be able to speak freely of how they feel and now are look down upon and treated as ""bottom feeders"" rather than equals. Management also is very double standard and are not held to the same accountability as other staff members. Many employees have left within the last 6 months. I hope that Administration back in New Jersey starts to see the trend of employees who have left and see the high turn over that is now taking place. This is NOT a company I would recommend working for any longer. Most employees who are still here are trying to find work elsewhere. I am not saying this because I am jaded by the management I say this as a warning to anyone looking to come on staff with BM Redwood city only. I love the company what they stand for and what they believe in but I do not agree with how management and the leaders are leading this team."
bad,"loved selling in Depression and bipolar etc, learned how to probe, great coworkers, hardest part was communication with management"
bad,Position responsibilities do not align with compensation.  The level of expertise required to preform this job is not properly aligned with the current salary that is being offered
bad,Work life balance was destroyed with the move to 12 hour shifts.  Little opportunity to come off night shift. Poor decision making with upper management.
bad,"Ambiente lavorativo discreto,buono il salario,contratti tramite agenzia scadenti e poco dignitosi."
bad,"terrible management"
bad,"Good job, but not a very diverse company in tolerance.  Any variation from a mainstream conservative agenda is masked by multi-cultural employees, which presents a good visual. But it's still a good old boy system.  Alternative lifestyles discouraged.  I've seen competent, successful people fired for their lifestyle. I find it horrendous to see a career ruined  because of perceived sexuality.  I saw it happen."
bad,Con: Too much change. Promises from management that were never really going to happen. Poor management. No advancement for people who really want it and work hard for it.
bad,"Good work environment, but the upper management is in a bit of a mess. Most teams are short staffed with very little apparent concern being put towards continuity."
bad,"Rewarding to work for a company with a mission to save lives, but be prepared to work hard and play politics.  Many funtions are moving offshore or to low cost markets reducing opportunities"
bad,"Senior Business Information Analyst - salary range is $55k, for a senior, which is low.  This might be expected for a Business Information Analyst."
bad,"Muchos cambios organizacionales en peridos breves."
bad,A good place to work with opportunity for advancement.  Opportunity to get Global experience within US locations.  The people was great to work with in the US and Globally.
bad,"Die Kooperation mit der Pfizer AG, Deutschland und diverser Dienstleister war ein riesiges Mamutprojekt. Die Kollegen sind gut miteinander ausgekommen."
bad,"typical day: 70% time on meetings"
bad,"Strong pipeline in multiple tumor types.  Large, matrixed sales force may result in internal competition for access to key customers."
bad,"During my time there, too much dead wood in the group. political incorrectness everywhere."
good,Very poorly ran and very unorganized there is absolutely no structure the staff does what they want no calls no show no discipline action all of the employees be forced to work double even if they dont want too
good,BMS continually downsizes and then goes out and hires a fresh face.  So even if you were downsized the idea of trying to get back in is not the in the cards.
good,"Johnson & Johnson Health Care Systems is a member of the Johnson & Johnson family of companies. JJHCS provides account management and customer support services to key health care customers, including hospital systems and group purchasing organizations, leading health plans, pharmacy benefit managers, and government health care institutions. The company also provides contract management, logistics and supply chain functions for the major Johnson & Johnson franchises"
good,Been a while working at BMS so I'm reluctant to comment - would I go back - sure - did I learn alot - sure - was it a good experience - it sure was - miss the way they button up their processes and miss how on top of things they were.
good,Very helpful in in placing candidates in the right position with the right company. Assisting candidates to advance in their careers on to the next level.
good,The company is continuously evolving. I enjoy my job but feel as though my department may be losing head count and do not feel as secure as I have for the past 10 years.
good,"Making a difference in the lives of people "
good,"A typical day of work  include  exercising superior technical expertise and industry insight, I have been able to secure and maintain compliance with regulatory requirements in the United States and Europe, with a focus on the implementation and enforcement of IT controls.  In this position, I lead the implementation, validation, and audit of regulated computer systems, traveling regularly to sites throughout the world. "
good,"Like most pharma/biotechs, organization is top heavy, especially in the tech departments.  Site organization is good but stressful and demanding.  They are doing their best to be a strong and positive community presence."
good,I was at BMS on a short term contract position. I covered for an employee while she was on a medical leave.  My contract was only extended a month to suit the business needs.
good,"I did work for BMS for almost a year and a Half."
good,They were on a hiring and transfer freeze when I was trying to relocate to Florida. The culture was very intense when hired. The training program was very intimidating but it help me later when I was interviewing for other companies.
good,Most days I did data entry updating medical journals. It was interesting but sometimes the manuscripts were hard to read so you weren't sure of the correct spelling of medical terms. However my supervisor always proof read to make any corrections needed. It was great knowing that you were a small part in updating new medical findings
good,"Typical day at work: Always busy"
good,Pediatric Same Day Services is a pleasant place to work. You get to make children comfortable. You make the parents comfortable with their children in your care. You do what you can for smooth home transition
good,Management sees employees as machines rather then human being. Decent amount of red tape and politics. The management just focused on their goals ignoring the ethics!
good,"A good company to work. Experience may be different for each individual. you need to sometimes go above and beyond, and learn to be self motivated"
good,"Well we laugh and joke around with our fellow co-workers and reminisce and most of us are happy people by nature so that's what keeps us going but as for everyone else you can tell they're stressed out and hate whats become of the company but I guess they feel like they have no choice due to their ages and lack of talent or physical capabilities...Of all the people that are still here they're only 3 others with the drive, passion and talent to make any company pertaining to design and printing thrive. I'm positive they will leave if an opportunity presents itself...We love to think of ourselves as The A-Team."
good,"A day on the production line is a 10 hour day everyday. It is paperwork to start up and paper work to the end of your shift. While doing paperwork you have the record in your hand running up and down a line and managing your machine. It takes a toll on your ability to muliti-task and patients. The team setting offers help when you have a million things going and a group of temporary agents to oversee as well. I have learned it never hurts to ask for help from your co-workers, never trust another person to ensure your paperwork is corrects. I always took the time to go back and verify my work. My co-workers were great people, they were always there for a laugh to break the stress of the day and help out anytime when needed. My co-workers were probably the best part of the job, they all were really good people. The thought that the company had helped saved so many lives with innovative drug research and studies, really set it in that the long hours and stress always paid off in the end."
good,"Contractors are not well appreciated, and are given few chances to be converted to full time employees.  Home based/flex time work environment is not encouraged."
good,Management puts schedule and results above people.  Manufacturing schedule was voted on but management went with the shift hours that they wanted to begin with even though people left in large numbers because of it.
good,"This was contract gig, between full time positions. The commute was too long, the work was OK, some days soul crushing, some days tolerable. I was happy to leave and heard that very shortly after I left, that the department I worked in was closed and moved to FL.I didnt respect my supervisor.The person who trained me was lovely."
good,"I had been there for 30 years and it was once a wonderful place to work with lots of positive energy.  By the time I left the Wallingford, CT site, energy was low and senior management in NJ was  no longer engaged with work being done in Ct site."
good,"operators that were unskilled and put product in danger of being rejected"
good,Supervised 1 to 2 shifts of production employees as well as working projects. Coached employees to help them succeed in desired advancement.
good,It is extremely difficult to be treated as an equal among BMS employees as a contract. It is frustrating at times to not be able to take on equal responsibilities to prove your worth to the company. As a contract you are also thrown around on really undesirable days (weekends and constant shift changes) that throw off a comfortable work/life balance.
good,See Above for ratings.  Company leaves one feeling like a number.  I have worked for this company for 14 years and it has from a leadership standpoint gotten worse.
good,"I have been working for the company almost 2 years.  It has developed in that time and is becoming quite successful. However, i am looking for another job due solely to poor management. From Higher levels all the way down, they are inexperienced and taught to show favoritism."
good,"Managers were knowledgeable, equipment was easily accessible. good working environment.  Not excessive push but nice work pace. Hardest part of the job was contacting overseas personnel and the translation/commination gap.  Most enjoyable part of the job was the flex hours."
good,"Was only there a short time as a contractor.  Did not have an enjoyable time there due to pettiness and juvenile behavior of the women I worked with. "
good,Most enjoyable part of the job was working with people from around the globe.
good,"Checking the status of all the sites involved in the study."
good,How to deal with the problem on the cell phones remotely at the job talking to people that under stand the product and learning new products.  People that work there are good people.
good,The company is going through lots of changes internally which means lots of internal processes change frequently. I was hired on a team of 8 and was later told that previously my team was about 28 people. This meant lots of overtime and my team was burned out quickly. This wasn't remedied until about a year after I worked there when they limited our overtime but the workload never slowed down. I was excited to work here but super disappointed when I realized how unorganized the company was.
good,Liked working with peoples it was only a temporary job had to find a new job to pay bills and take care of my family Wash clothes buy food clothes shoes school supplies
good,Evansville Indiana is not a preferred place to work due to a lots of competency and political environment. The headquarter management and environment is good.
good,"El día típico de trabajo es de tensión continua."
good,I got to Work every weekday and expect  that the Quality and care be given to the positive environment that is not usually apparent however there are rewards
good,"The company undergoes unreasonable transformations all the time, not considering its long-term impact.    Technically equipped personnel are laid off and they end up hiring more costly consultants not only to do the work but to correct errors done.    The management team is old,  they have been there for years, old strategies are redressed as new,  they go through the same cyclical motion.  "
good,"I had the opportunity to work as an HRBP with a highly collaborative, accomplished team of Scientists.  They were open to HR expertise and guidance, respectful and appreciative of feedback.  Great stakeholders, and cooperative environment from that perspective."
good,could be so much better if the people at the top actually cared about everyone besides themselves. they treat hourly employees as peasants. they do not care about them.
good,It's a company where one can enhance their skills and get to know new technologies. There is immense resources to try newer things. Overall the company provides a good platform for freshers.
good,"This place has been great to start a career, but not in anyway prepared to foster one. Transformations, re-orgs, changing priorities always come up, and the culture is still stuck in the past."
good,"Science is great, company politics not so much. Good if you are in the ""favored"" group, if not, good luck getting promoted or even getting the hired help you were promised. New people who just joined allowed to hire over people who have been here for years. I stay here because I love the science, that's about it."
good,The opinions that I communicated previously for AstraZeneca would be applicable for this segment as well.  BMS and AZ were involved in an alliance culminating in the sell of the diabetes division from BMS to AZ. My tenure was with BMS was <6 months.
good,"My first role out of college as a Business Analyst for an approx 200MM category. I learned the fundamentals of sourcing where i supported multiple RFPs, provided in depth analysis, and eventually led RFPs"
good,"Overall it is a good place to work because of the people, challenging place to work at times.  Would think about recommending to others in the later part of their working careers."
good,New managers should have some kind of training before they assume a role with direct reports.  I would not go back to work there - not a great environment.
good,"Je n'avais aucune expérience dans ce domaine, j'ai eu une très bonne formatrice qui m'a tout appris en 6 semaines. Je trouve le travail agréable et intéressant ."
good,"Managers do not follow the company mission and are not held accountable."
good,"The company foster a diverse workforce, but poor inclusion of different ideas. Poor employee empowerment, all decisions are managed by Senior Executives, decision by consensus slow decision making process, very burocratic."
good,"Work culture is very inclusive. Leadership is aware of the need for work-life balance and is often very understanding. However, even though there is an open-space work environment, more collaboration is necessary."
good,Good job but poor company leadership. Ruined stock in middle of my time there and decided to take package and do something else. Union was disorganized and fought to keep wrong people
good,"BMS Syracuse is a good place to get some initial experience as a contract scientist. However, there is very little vertical movement in the company which makes it difficult to transition from contract to FT. Recommended to get you started, but can't guarantee you can build a career here."
good,Company's Mission is great!  Management needs to work on not making favoritism visible.  Company has a lot of resources for personal and professional growth. Company is very involved with the community.  Great Benefits and generous paid time off.
good,"Decent place to work, work life balance is not great - a lot of politics at all levels - never experienced this before at this level, have seen it in higher management levels."
good,Importante esperienza lavorativa con una grande azienda
good,"Fast paced, stressful work environment but many opportunities for growth within the organization to learn and show case talents "
good,"Good company, fast grow in oncology sector. Good for young professional to grow. Need to put a lot of overtime, not good for small molecule professional because of changing strategies."
good,I liked working here. the hours were good. the location was good... the office has since moved. I learned alot there. the best part of the job was my coworkers
good,"Job culture is very diverse and engaging.   Company portfolio is promising and opportunities are seemingly plentiful.    Management has a difficult time recognizing talent and providing advancement opportunities.   Politics play a big role in promotional opportunities. "
good,"Very large company, great product, cut throat atmosphere. I was working 12 hour nights, or even 16 on no notice. As an employee, I felt I was just a small cog in the giant machine of Bristol."
good,"Environnement de travail, globalement agréable. "
good,"Used to be a great company filled with promising scientists and a thriving culture.  Our new CEO and his company transformation are doing everything possible to gut this company so that is it a shell of its former self.  Upper-management has no leadership, and the high-level decisions being made here make absolutely no sense unless they are planning to sell the place."
good,Very productive workplace. There's colleague collaboration and work/life balance. There's flexible work options too.
good,Work never ends! My work day is busy until it's time to go home. Management expects you to put in extra hours to finish the work which makes it very difficult to have a work life balance.
good,if you want to start your career. go there.It's very different environment comparing with working in NYC. No activities out scope of working. No parties.
good,"Thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity, but navigating the culture was extremely difficult. The company has a lot of opportunity to mature digitally."
good,Many lay offs and jobs being outsourced. My department was outsourced in 2014. Job security is certainly still a factor.
good,Bristol-Myers Squibb is an incredible company to work with and clearly values you as an employee by recognizing your work and giving opportunities in advancement given that you have a manager that takes the effort to recognize it.
good,It's hard for them to promote their own but a stable working environment. They pay well and have very good benefits. It is definitely a very successful company nonetheless.
good,They do not treat their contract employees as equals. But for everybody else they seemed to enjoy it there very much. Good money and benefits.
good,Good House to Learn and had Diverse learning in Short span of time.
good,"Employees get treated well, they have good benefits for mothers and they have activities for employees."
good,"A positive, collaborative work environment that provides opportunity for growth.  An exciting space to be within the cutting edge of science for those that enjoy the fast-pace."
good,Good company to work for with sophisticated processes and amazing people. They have very good culture and excellent workplace environment. Management is supportive of work-life balance
good,"Most colleagues outside my department have very good things to say about their department and the company.  However, that's not the case in every department."
good,"•	Simultaneously led multiple phase I to IV internally and outsourced clinical trials; specializing in large and small molecular products in over 40 different protocols in 6 therapeutic areas."
good,Structurally sound but there is a lack of cohesiveness throughout markets and departments. There is a disconnect between markets and departments and lack of accountability  on management level.
good,Working here is a blessing but its a very stressful work environment. If everyone was on the same page and received proper training it would make the experience more pleasant.
good,"I built a great rapport with different business units within the company, and sometime with external customers.  I learned to work in fast speed and needed to consistently readjusting for priorities.  I was always ready to accept changes and shift the tasks among multiple projects."
good,"Massive workload with tight deadlines. Departments cut to bare minimum staff. Work/Life balance is no existent in some departments."
good,"Great company to work for with friendly family culture, this is a diversified and innovative company that recognizes talent and shared values of pharma production and success to preserve life."
good,"productive and funplace ."
good,"Patient is the most important priority everyday. "
good,"I had limited time there as a co-op, but I expect the experience was indicative of big pharma in New Jersey.  Nice offices filled with cubicles, meeting rooms, cafeteria, and gym.  Very structured work. During the summer, the industry/company slows down."
good,"BMS workforce is globally diverse to create an inclusive, high-performance culture that is agile, entrepreneurial and accountable."
good,"Overall, good company.  Executive leadership says all of the right things, but they don't always translate to the mid-managers who can either make or break your experience."
good,"This was my first job in the industry. THey gave me experience. Other than that, they are your typical big pharmaceutical company. Chew you up and spit you out."
good,"I feel my job secure is good here. Yet, during town hall meeting, the company has mentioned to develop employee and focus on improving employee career path, yet I don't see that in practice. Also, pay rate between male and female for the same position is still an issue at this company. Women get less pay rate for the same position and task."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Bristol-Myers Squibb at the beginning. However, there are definitely individuals that work for the company that can change that perspective."
good,"Pros:"
good,"Working for BMS was okay since I had to report to Compucom. Again, this is another company that never tells you the whole story and leaves you in the dark while they change their story about how long the contract is. They never have a definite answer on anything while they love to hire and let go of people on contracts."
good,company and culture does not allowing to run territory as own business.  leadership treats employees as if no past experiences and does not value emplyees
good,"good science, but heavy politics, not very patient centric in my experience. Could do more to assist patients and consumers. Heavily commercialized focus."
good,"A Bristol é uma empresa que valoriza a qualidade de vida de seus funcionários, dando flexibilidade para fazer sua carga horária semanal e com a opção de saída ao meio dia às sextas-feiras. Possui uma estrutura enxuta de funcionários, por isso, muitas vezes eu tive que desenvolver algumas funções que eu jamais desenvolveria no marketing de algumas companhias, mas o que foram bom para o meu aprendizado e desenvolvimento profissional. O que para mim era mais difícil era o imenso número de tramites e burocracias necessárias para realizar certas atividades, que muitas vezes não era necessário e que poderiam ser desenvolvidas com maior agilidade."
good,BMS provided a good learning environment for new entrants to the industry as it is quite SOP oriented. There is also a great support network within the fellowship.
good,Lots of support from management and focus on driving medical affairs excellence. However as China is a developing market lots of issues with compliance exists within the industry so that is a key thing to work on. It is a good market to pilot innovations and to grow executional skillset but will need to be very self sufficient or provide a lot of hand holding.
good,My position was recently eliminated during a restructuring and reduction in workforce effort by the company on a global scale. The company has good benefits and strives for work/life balance.  It is a good place for working mothers.  The most enjoyable part of the job was partnering with the various departments on site to ensure their training needs were met.
good,Great training program and continuous people development. Products were not market leaders but were supported. Traditional sales approach which may no longer exist.
good,"Scientifically enriched , well equipped and freedom to translate opinion is given , Good management  , well planned, Supportive team and can enjoy everday's work"
good,"Bristol Myers Squibb located in Plainsboro, New Jersey was an ok company to work for. They were in a close proximity to where I was living and the area was very nice and well developed."
good,"Was a fun place to work hard and play hard. Terrific coworkers. Small company, so each position had a wide breadth of responsibilities (vs narrow/specialization) but also somewhat limited in terms of opportunities to grow into new and different roles."
good,"BMS had very disgruntled employees at the CT location while the NJ location seemed to be the chosen destination."
good,BMS is a company with long-standing reputation on knowledge of brand science.  Excellent training department.  Pipeline is well diversify and has the team on place to have effective product launches.
good,"The department tried to make all persons mix together and become friends because we work in the same area, but I think is much more better not to impose the mandatory friendship."
good,"My main tasks involve interfacing with customers to receive and process orders, handling customer queries, investigating and resolving any issues, among other duties, while maintaining and projecting a professional image at all times."
good,very enjoyable part of job is the customers and helping patients. Enjoy conveying technical information to clinicians. Enjoy assisting financial counselors.
good,"Interesting opportunity "
good,Bristol-Myers Squibb is a large company with a lot of opportunities for learning and advancement.  Company includes hard working people that are always willing to train others on new things.  Company benefits are excellent.
good,"Main work was data entry, Per hour 10,000 key strocks. "
good,"Operate switchboard "
good,Good company but not willing to hire employees who require training.  They prefer to hire scientists who come in hitting the ground running instead.

good,The company and it's employees are committed to helping patients.
good,"Life-work balance"
good,"Although I built many very large networks in the Greater Philadelphia Are up to this point, this was my first work internationally, which helped me become an expert by the time Dechert LLP with in their high growth mode."
good,I learned about marketing pharmaceutical drugs and the whole process
good,"For a company that says they are great for working mom's, its not true.  I was always watched by other administrators that would go out on lunch breaks and shop over their 1 hour lunch, but if you had to attend a meeting for your children during a lunch hour to make sure I was back one time."
good,As an oncology representative i made contact with many hopsitals and provided imortant information for their CML patients.

good,"journées animées par des réunions."
good,"BMS is a diverse company, which allow growth and enable employees opportunity to grow.  They have a great reward system to recognize employees for their work ethics"
good,not a bad place to work. hard to keep a home life. good people to work with overall.
good,I liked working at BMS fine. Left because city I lived in was taken out of territory so traveled 100%
good,"• Promote the atypical antipsychotic, Abilify oral and intramuscular formulations, to Psychiatrists, Child Psychiatrists, and select hospitals in order to meet and exceed territory sales goals and market share objectives"
good,Helping mentain lab results was challenging because it was live data that would be used for trials that would help millions of other patients. It was a rewarding experience.
good,Great Company to work for. Great growing pipeline. Having a great experience working here.
good,"Enjoyed my time at BMS. Learned alot, won national award and trip to France. Benefits were adequate and very rewarding."
good,"Needs better change management. Desperate for better technology. Flexible work schedule (work from home once a week). Overall, good company that recognizes room for improvement."
good,"Great team culture and great managers and associates that look out for one another and really care about each other. THe company is a great company to work for,"
good,"Company's research has changed over the years and later the culture has deteriorated. With constant changes in reporting structure, continuity in leadership was not considered."
good,L'azienda da ormai diversi anni ha concesso ai dipendenti 1 giorno di smart working.
good,"Great place to work, great learning environment for children.  Yet, due to the closing of the local company, the numbers declined and had to find a job elsewhere."
good,I have now been on both sides of the fence as a long time employee in various jobs and a contractor at BMS.  I might as well have been an alien.  It is dependent on the team you are on but I found the facility and research teams to be demanding & dismissive You did not feel like you were a part of the team.  The culture is very us against you. My contract is ending after a year and although Im sorry that Im losing a regular job I dont feel like Ill  miss the people.
good,"- Birthdays not recognized"
good,"Als neuesTeam-Mitglied ist schwer Fuß zu fassen, ein konstruktives Feedback kommt oft zu spät."
good,Not always appreciated or treated with respect.did not like having a union there are times it hurts the employees rather than helping . Running processes was great all reactors are computerized no touch intermediate or API charging to reactors .
good,Many organizational changes which created a pretty unhappy culture because of these changes. Many of the personnel are extremely pleasant and friendly despite all the changes.
good,"Learning about different disease states was interesting. After a while the job became redundant. Affecting bonuses became unmeasurable. If your drug does not have a clear advantage over the competition, you become a commodity."
good,"Learnt purification techniques using gravity columns, co-workers were cooperative and friendly. Mangement was ok. Learnt different molecular biology techniques."
good,"BMS has a great work life balance but my brain is turning to mush and I feel like I'm not learning or advancing in my career. There are way too many managers, leads, associate managers, etc. No one will make decisions, therefore, nothing gets done quickly. It's very frustrating. They blame it on their ""tight controls"". I've worked in industries where there are controls in place and I've never seen anything like this. I think it's just an excuse to not make a decision because they're in positions they're not trained to be in. The benefits are good but the pay is not. "
good,"Una estupenda compañía donde el trabajo se realiza en espacios abiertos y una cultura enfocada principalmente a la atención al cliente sin menoscabar el bienestar del empleado."
good,I enjoyed the independent work environment.  I also loved sharing excellent health information & products with healthcare professionals.
good,Le travail y était plus agréable avant que nous déménagions.  Le fait de travailler à aire ouverte et que tout le monde se voit et s'entende a été très difficile.
good,"Enjoyed working at BMS, fast paced and most challenging but knowledgeable individuals.  Learned a lot from the brand team, designers, writers, print specialist, and production team. "
good,12 hours of work a day. Learned about GMP. Management and co-workers are very organized. Hardest part of the job is the long hours. Work isn't very hard though.
good,"My experience as an Executive Assistant at Bristol Myers Squibb Company has equipped me with a multitude of skills. As a team player I've maintained enthusiasm, high energy, adaptability and flexibility while working in a fast paced, multi-tasking environment."
good,aprendi muchas cosa en bristol myers
good,"The communication across subdepartments (analytical with downstream/upstream) was strained, so bottlenecks in productivity were frequent. Morale was not consistently high, some people liked it, some people hated it and knew nothing would change. A general desire to do good work was definitely there, and the perks and environment were very good. As a graduate intern, however, I was not given the freedom to work as independently as I could have, and I was not challenged or utilized to the extent of my abilities. I was often trying to work faster but was held back by people ""above"" me that didn't have as good technical skills as me. Moving up because of merit and work accomplished was not valued as much as it should have been. People moved up because of general time spent at BMS and being good graces with management. It seemed wrong. Many good workers were leaving because they were frustrated with overwork and underappreciation."
good,"Although the compensation for both contract (temporary) and permanent positions tends to be slightly higher than the same roles at other pharmaceutical companies, the culture is at least 15 to 20 years behind other companies (pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical) and many employees and contractors are unhappy there.  Employees are constantly stressed about whether they will have a job as the end of each year approaches."
good,"Established company with great products and good R&D to keep the pipeline full.  But, major changes/reorgs made seemingly for change sake and seem to go against what has worked in the past and seemingly unnecessarily disruptive."
good,"The hours are long because the days are unpredictable. You never know when an 8 hour day will turn into a 14 hour day, because 1 thing went wrong. As long as your level is low enough you will get paid overtime for it though."
good,"Ambiance dynamique"
good,"Ok place to work for. Bad management skill , lots of things need to be change for the better.  Hopefully in the near future there will be good changes."
good,"en deux ans, j'ai connus deux plans sociaux."
good,Posibilidad de desarrollo interno y posibilidad de aprender como se trabaja en diferentes culturas y entornos.
good,The culture is great but a lot of lay offs occurred recently making it a bit harder to work here. Some employees were given 6 months notice and other 2 weeks' notice.
good,"Culture has gotten worse and worse over time..."
good,El ambiente laboral es excelente y hay mucho empoderamiento en todos los cargos que te permite aprender y crecer.
good,"Every day in BMS is very chanllenger. With the main scope provide support to the Business units director and General manager, for me each day in BMS is a different day."
good,"Bristol had reinvented itself for the last year, and had built a robust pipeline around oncology. "
good,Salary and bonus is average for medium-large pharmaceutical company. Current promoted products are class leaders with strong R&D program
good,"Die Arbeit ist sehr interessant und spannend und man hat ständig neue Herausforderungen die man zu bewältigen hat. Jedoch arbeitet man teilweise unter sehr hohem Druck, was sich in der letzten Zeit immens gesteigert hat. Man muss seine Zeit und Arbeit Prioriseren können und hat sehr viel Verantwortung. Was mir sehr gut gefällt und was ich auf der Stelle gelernt habe ist das selbstständige Arbeiten und wie man schwierigem Studienpersonal umgeht."
good,"Great company to work for with good management team - I always had challenges assigned to me to keep me alert."
good,Great company to work for and stay long term. I worked with the Plateau system and learned a lot about the training environment. Co-workers and manager were always there to back you up if you need help with your workload.

good,"el ambiente laboral es satisfactorio , al igual que el trabajo en equipo, muy buen trato de los superiores , comedor en planta , vestuarios muy cómodos y limpios,"
good,"Good compensation and benefits competitive salary. "
good,"Cada día de trabajo, es una nueva oportunidad para dar o mejor de ti, y por supuesto trae cosas positivas y negativas, no debemos centrarnos en lo que no fue, si no en lo que si se hizo, así que todos los días aprendí algo nuevo."
good,"Showing a good example of KAM practice in all my accounts, in both Qatar and Bahrain, engaging all internal and external stakeholders in order to achieve my quantitative objectives supported by my outstanding relations with my colleagues as well as customers."
good,"I loved the work and the employees. The thing about BMS is that reorganizations occur almost yearly, which makes long-term job security (at least in IT) a bit dubious."
good,Bristol Myers-Squibb is a great employer with excellent benefits. Currently the company is dealing with an important transformation to keep the competitiveness in the bio-pharma industry. This transformation is having a significant impact in the operations including the HR department.Transformation that is adding some challenges in the day to day of our jobs and sometimes make me think that is time to consider other opportunities.
good,"fast growing company with lots of things to do. career growth is visible, thought the commute to Boston isn't ideal for me. the most enjoyable part of my job is to be able to help patients in need of clinical drugs."
good,"Uma empresa que oferece oportunidades aos colaboradores, bons benefícios, deixando a desejar com os seus gestores."

good,"I have worked there as Lab Analyst with a 7 months contract. even if I was giving everything every day, after the 7 months all my colleagues have been their contracts extended. the only one who's been left out it was me, with no good reason."
good,"There are the usual perks of working for a big company but also the feeling of insignificance that comes with working for a big company. They pretend to care about patients, which can be nice."
good,"This is a company that was once a leader in the industry and I was hired at that time. They were diversified and had four core business areas: pharmaceutical, nutritional, medical device and consumer products; now they only have one."
good,"Bristol-Myers is one of the better companies that I have worked for. The benefits are generous, most employees are nice, and the company makes a conscious effort to keep employees engaged and focused on the company mission. "
good,"Being a contingent/ contract work employee was not a difficult nor challenging job position. It was therefore not very fulfilling, so that is why I have chosen to work there for no more than 1 year."
good,"Travelled weekly to a five state area."
good,"I worked at BMS for nearly 20 years, first as a temp and many years as a full-time employee. I worked in three different departments during that span. "
good,"I loved the work and all that went with it. I eagerly waited for the research work I performed and the challenges that it supplied. "
good,"Called on Physicians at their office to offer new drug medication, described features, benefits of the new drug, and left samples for physicians to give patients"
good,Interesting place at work. There is few opportunities to go up the ladder so if you are nearing your retirement then good place to work.
good,Colleagues are great. It is difficult to trust management.  They are sometimes not straight forward with their intentions.
good,"BMS is competitive in salary with Pfizer, Borhinger, etc., but management has allowed stock to drop more than other pharma companies.  People working there are very nice, but some managers are not very understanding with health or childcare issues.  I guess that really depends on individuals.  Benefits are good."
good,Dynamic workplace. Never a dull moment. Not much work life balance. 50+ hr workweeks are the norm. Shrinking organization means less room for promotion.
good,Been in management your work was a typical days.I had a 170 employees working for me you had to no all the jobs.The most important part I enjoy working with people in the plant the all was good worker
good,"I worked there as a contractor. They gave me a light training and training time, the team I worked with was great, alll team players. However, the management could be better ...."
good,"- Management does not have a clear direction and frequently micro manages."
good,"Good company to work. At the beginning there were opportunities that helped developed my career."
good,Management is very hands-off. Tasks are assigned and completed.
good,"Big company and therefore lots of opportunity to move and advance.  Current culture is a bit stifling and driven by fear with authoritarian management team.  "
good,This was great it was fulfilling and cooperative. My coworkers were engaging and worked to develop and support each other. The most enjoyable part was engaging with my coworkers in and out of the office. Management encouraged growth.
good,"Productive and fun place to work, friendly environment, good work/life balance, great benefits, poor job security, management skills depending on individuals."
good,"BMS was a wonderful employer to me."
good,"I have nothing against the pharmaceutical company Bristol-Myers Squibb.  However, I am looking for another job due to the work slowing down in my three years of current position and job doesn't match my education background.  Took position because the employment agency was the only one to call me back when applying.  Now, I am trying to get out.  Rated Job Culture (3 Stars) because I only see the same couple people every day, even when working overtime due to vacation coverage.  Rated Job Security/Advancement as (2 Stars) because of a new contract with unknown details and there is zero advancement in my current role.  Supervisor rarely has extra work for me to perform when I am done with daily tasks."
good,To much and fast changes lead to feeling of insecurity and decrease the focus on work.
good,"Great workplace, good bosses. Lots of benefits of a larger company."
good,"Process morning and afternoon samples, preparation for future projects, weekly training and meetings, responds to requests of analysts and other departments. Incoming and outgoing shipments. Data management and paperwork for duration of campaign. Coworkers are easy to work with and cooperative. Adjusting to sudden protocol changes are difficult but not impossible. Company celebrations and events."

good,"environnement de travail agréable"
good,"It was a great experience working with BMS. tremendous oppurtunity to learn and implement."
good,It was wonderful to work at BMS. The assignments were objective and productive. Management eases your issues in work life which helps you to attain desired goals.
good,"The Syracuse plant management structure is filled with many former co-workers that are dedicated, hard-working individuals.  The team has weathered the storm of down-sizing and re-organization and are one of the best teams that I have had the opportunity to work with.  This was a great place to work."
good,"A dynamic company that provided significant opportunity to grow. Salary was lower, especially for tenured staff.  Cultural changes were often conflicting with job requirements."

good,"Very busy department, required to travel internationally frequently.  Long hours, sometimes weekends and holidays.  Worked with excellent team of talented people, but management team was very poor."
good,Charge back letter and credit collection from vendors that took discounts but didn't full fill terms. Very monotonous and challenging. Constant disappointment with little satisfaction.
good,"During the later years, the outsourcing was off the charts, so there was never any job security.  And although they always spoke of work-life balance, there was none."
good,"This was a good company to work for. They treated their employees well. There was a culture of caring about their mission and helping patients, which should be a model for all healthcare companies."
good,Good benefits. 401K matching and end of year 401K addition based on years of service. Good work/life balance. Great avenues available for career growth and trainings.
good,This is a great company to work for as long as you are not in People Services or Shared Services.  There are no promotional opportunities if you are from a certain ethnicity and this is due to the managers there.   Anywhere else is fine.
good,"I enjoyed the 25 years of service with B-MS.  I had the opportunity to experience brand launches of key products.  Managed a 3rd party Distribution vendor and launched a system to support the review and approval of Promotional/Non-Promotional materials for the sales force and Direct to Consumer (DTC) campaigns to Healthcare providers (HCPs).   In addition, system met the Transparency project guidelines."
good,"Pros"
good,"The best part of the job is the colleagues.  Amazing workforce.  Depending on the Division, you could have a long and successful career. Management teams below Leadership tend to be very political and still possess the old school mindset that if you are not there you are not really working. Management really does not embrace the Mobile/Remote working initiative."
good,"Esta empresa tiene mucho talento humano, sin embargo las postulaciones a cargos superiores o de rango superior son limitadas"
good,"Chilworth technology was a horrible company to work for, it was a starter job, but morale was awful and the personnel had no desire for growth or improvement. BMS was an excellent place to work and would recommend to anyone."

good,Company provides great benefits. Good work culture. Good availability of resources. Comprehensive portfolio of products. Paid time off and holidays. Good employer overall.
good,Very good company. Good opportunities. Opportunities are there to work on many projects. They like their cross-functional meetings. The expose levels to opportunities are very high.
good,I havent worked here in over 10 years but I must say Bristol Myers is a great place to work.  The hardest part of working at BMS is you need to find a nich that will not get outsourced.  Most of IT gets outsourced to an outsourcing company.  The most enjoyable part of my job was we had summer hours which gave us every other friday off.
good,Strong product pipeline coupled with principled compliance and ethics make BMS a good choice. The company increasingly started to focus on core therapy areas and this made it more effective in execution.
good,The salary is really good but the management and workload make it hard to appreciate it. good benefits and offices. toomch stress and sick leaves because of that
good,"Good people, good environmental, the work balance need improve and need to evaluate the politics of contrast and temporary worker. If you are doing work as a temporary employee must be consider as a Permanent employee and don't do that."
good,The products and people are amazing. The corporate culture and decision making at the senior management level is beyond poor. Change a few things and this could be an amazing place.
good,"El espíritu de equipo entre los integrantes de los distintos departamentos es muy alto con buena cultura de apoyo al compañero en sus necesidades."
good,I have worked here for over 10 years. In that time I have had many opportunities to learn new skills and have been promoted 4 times.  I enjoy the people I work with as we all share a vision of compassionate animal care while still completing important animal research.
good,Great experience working at the cutting edge of pharmaceutical discovery. Top notch colleagues and tremendous resources but opportunities to grow with the organization and broader company are very limited
good,"I enjoy working at BMS! We have a wonderful product in Daklinza for Hepatitis C patients. We are treated nicely, with great benefits, and are incentivized to exceed quotas very nicely!"
good,"Scientific oriented organisation."
good,"The Tampa locations was great to work at.  The site manager tries very hard to show the employees appreciated.  Open concept was hard at first, but got easier."

good,"Bon niveau de rémunération, enjeux internationaux au sein d'un secteur très concurrentiel."
good,"Competitive work environment, Focus on product benefit to the patients. Fair balance company approved message."

good,"It is a great place to work, but they are closing the CT site unfortunately for me and a bunch of other people."
good,"excellent manager, long hours, good benefits and compensation.  Enjoyed the territory, lots of paperwork to comply with FDA requirements."
good,We did a lot of work. people always worked together. My job was the same as working with JCI but BMS out sourced us to JCI. Thats when things got bad.
good,"Decent Company, working for this company has been stressful & challenging but gaining experience has been a pleasure."
good,"BMS has up and down like most of major pharmaceutical companies in the world, but in general, it treats its employees well."
good,Very good/strict company to work for. A lot of great employees at Bristol. Good pay and benefits. You typically work anywhere from 8-12 hours a day.
good,"Everyone is very hard working, management fails to see the benefit studio adds. Teams are collaborative and get alone very well."

good,"Bristol-Myers Squibb is a global biopharmaceutical company whose mission is to discover, develop and deliver innovative medicines that help patients prevail over serious diseases. "

good,BMS is a great company. However a bit stressful as the company closes from site to site. They move employees from state to state.
good,manager and coworkers are nice to work with. work hours are flexible. nice company to work at.
good,"Excellent culture that promotes career growth."
good,Overall the company is a very good place to be employed.  The only negative lesson I learned was that sometimes their are certain people that are too difficult to work with under any circumstances.  The positive was that I was constantly learning and growing. A typical day was to start right out of the gate busily and stay steady for most of the day.  I enjoy having something to do all day.

good,Great compensation and benefits; many terrific employees

Then,they treated their employees as adults by giving them as much autonomy as possible to choose when they work, where they do their work, and how best to get it accomplished."
good,Strong drug discovery leadership and many high level and sincere scientists to work with.  Very streamlined organization that can result in high work loads.
good,Enjoyed my 16 years with Bristol-Myers Squibb. I feel that is was a true win/win with me giving all I could to the company and the company training and challenging me to develop my skills to be the best I could be.
good,Bright Horizons is a company that works cares for children ages 6months to 5years. At this center the co workers are very warm and friendly. The people who care for the children do a great job with creating a warm and safe environment for the chidren they are taking care of

This site with its current reorganization is slowly developing a new culture. Downside is there is no HR support here and a noticeable lack of management skills and career development.
good,BMS is a very diverse company with a very friendly staff.  The facility is state of the art and they use the open office space concept. The management staff were great and very helpful. This role was a great learning experience for me. Being my first time working in an HR department I learned a lot of HR policy and procedures. This will help me as I am now studying Human Resources and Organizational Management. As an employee you are able to work at your own pace once give direction. The most enjoyable part of the job were the lunch and learn sessions they had almost monthly.  The hardest part for me was location and the commute to and from.

good,Bristol-Myers Squibb is a great company that provided extensive education on sales with a focus on  learning the sales cycle and developing skills to close the sale quickly.
good,The company is a great place to work for as a whole.  I enjoyed it and would love to be asked back.  I enjoyed the open work space and the people are just great!  The workplace culture and camaraderie make me enjoy going to work each day.
good,Nice place to work. Good people. Sunny days bagels every wedsday. Nice people. Good team environment. Nice offices. Nice people.   Ping Pong tables. Open office
good,"great group of people to work with but the ever changing projects were difficult to balance. Good level of autonomy, but unclear objectives made it difficult to create an effective research plan."
good,BMS has great culture with employee resource groups and employee recognition and training. The managers are not well trained on how to manage teams and very little training is provided to help managers improve. As a result all the employees that are professionally mature leave the company.
good,"1.Excellent Experience while working in Singapore with PowerQ Tech Pte Ltd,"
good,BMS that was is dying and shrinking.  The bloodletting continued throughout my eleven year employment.  Anyone joining now should be warned it is not likely to be a lifelong affair.
good,"Working at BMS provided opportunity for advancement ."
good,"Solid pay and benefits."
good,I enjoyed working with the great management. The work required to be on top of a lot of protocols in a lot of therapeutic areas. The work model is set up to keep you in driving distance from all work.
good,My years at BMS have been productive.  Great opportunity to grow and enhance my skill set.  I've had great mentors and established strong relationships with my colleagues.
good,"Daily assignments are given by management and completed by end of day.   "
good,"Day-to-day work is rewarding and not that difficult, although more physician offices are harder to access than 20 years ago.  Reps must do more than just ""deliver the marketing message"" and bring coffee or lunch....we help the staff with managed care issues and reimbursement.  District management understands that the old ""repeat the message every week"" and traditional dinner speaker programs don't work anymore, but they are constrained by metrics set by copromotion contracts and regional management that cannot see beyond activity measurements.  That means reps are forced to call on unimportant offices, or lie about seeing closed offices, in order to meet those metrics."
good,"As a medical rep, I enjoyed the fast paced work environment. I enjoyed the people I worked with. The job culture was great. It was one of the job I had the mot communicating."
good,"I'm not a child abuser so the part I stared in was a mental challenge for me,I would lay awake at night unable to sleep at times wondering what could cause a parent to have that kind of behavior to a loved one,and would prey that I would never become a mother like that, ever,I love my children and thank God for them, and ask the Lord to keep harm from them in an form.I have to say I think comady,romance, or fantasy' would suit me much better, and my contiants."
good,Company focus is Oncology trials. These trials could last for great lengths of time.  Exposure and deliverables (mainly in the form of meeting timelines) contribute to yearly reviews.
good,"I enjoy every day coming to work, everyone is engaging and truly interested in what they do.  There are a lot of changes going on but for the better.  There are some very promising products in the pipe line that will assure prosperous years ahead.  I have worked at other large pharmaceuticals and found the atmosphere at BMS to be the most accommodating to work life balance."
good,A lot of lifers.  You either fit into the culture or you don't.  God forbid if a mistake is made!  A lot of tough personalities to deal with on a regular basis
good,"I would have to say that it has been a great learning experience.  It is a fun place to work in, open environment, very modern, with excellent benefits.  I had the opportunity to work in different projects and participate in stretch assignments with other departments as part of my development.  I also loved the fact that the company allowed flexibility for working remotely."
good,"Fast-paced, ever changing organization that is focused on saving patients. Dedicated employees that care about their work and really focus on providing quality products to the customer."
good,BMS is a great place to start a career in pharma. The company has a huge R&D pipeline and a sustainable sales strategy. I really enjoy learning from tenured professionals.
good,it was a well structured company with cross feedbacks between representatives and management except they closed down the Kenyan operations
good,"Great colleagues and team members."
good,Promocionaba anticoagulantes de última generación. Organizaba cenas con speakers y participaba en los ateneos de los hospitales.
good,Bristol Myers Squibb şirketinin Türkiye'deki son yönetim kadrosunu başta Gn.Md.olmak üzere hiç ama hiç oanylamıyorum.Performans notum çok yüksek olmasına rağmen benimle ikale anlaşması yapmak istediler ve beni çok kritik bir yaşta işsiz duruma soktular.Nedenlerini az çok tahmin ediyorum ancak bu nedenler hiç de etik değil ve benden kaynaklanmamaktadır.
good,"Excellent company with aggressive culture"
good,"Bristol Myers Squibb is a very innovative company always searching for new ways to complete the daily job at hand. They are always changing as the times change. The benefits are great, the company is always focusing on their employees and what they can do to make the daily job easier for the employees to complete."
good,"There are no typical days in my job, which make it fun.  I've learned how to manage many projects at one time, how to interact with people levels above and below me.  I feel open to speak with my management, and that they do care about me as a person.  My co-workers make the job truly enjoyable.  The hardest part can be balancing the amount of work, particularly when there are setbacks of any kind, but the impact of the work, and the people I share it with are the reward."
good,A day at Bristol-Myers was exciting. The things that I learned prepared me to work independently  after a few months. The coworkers were very good at training me during those years and they made it fun to learn. One of the hardest parts of the job involved getting used to some of the light dust some of the chemicals produced after the respirator was removed. The most enjoyable part was the meals that were provided for use as we became close and met others that worked for the facility.
good,"Good company to learn to work independently and pharma process."
good,"J'ai travaillé pour Bristol Myers Squibb pendant près de 20 ans. L'industrie Pharmaceutique licencie de plus en plus. Je suis partie lors du dernier plan social. Mon travail consistait à visiter les médecins pour les informer sur les spécialités pharmaceutiques dont j'avais la charge. Prise de rendez-vous, organisation de réunions de formation. Beaucoup de comptes-rendus et de prise de parole en public. Le maniement constant de l’informatique, word et excel."
good,"Wonderful pay and work environment, work itself is just lacking. Lower management has no idea what is going on and disorganized, which leads too way too much downtime that could be avoided."
good,"Working here has been a reward among itself, being able to witness the type of work that is done is the private sector versus in municipal is a real eye-opener. A typical day at work includes weekly and monthly safet checks along with answering calls for service throughout the site. Hardest part of the job is the hours that are required. Most enjoyable is that i can plan out my shift any way that I see fit as long as my work is complete."
good,"very busy from the time you walk in till you leave "
good,"the internship there was an amazing experience, from the management to the sales team, clerical personnel, all were really helpful. They will make you feel welcome."
good,"General administrative duties, recruiting for Ph.D. Candidates and Associate Candidates during the months of September and January in addition to my daily duties.  That was the hardest but most enjoyable part of the job.  I was able to get to know the people who work on testing and developing medications for diseases.  The coworkers were very easy going and caring.  Management always handled themselves in a professional manner."
good,As an analyst for the finance dept. Worked heavily on the daily sales J/E for BMS company. Saw the work ethic of all seniors and learnt about quality patient health. Was catapulted and amazed at the precision and detail to attention w every work.
good,buen ambiente laboral con unos compañeros óptimos.buenos directivos(en la sucursal española).aprendí a trabajar en equipo
good,I would recommend working here to anyone. The management was supportive.
good,skilled colleagues
good,"As with many large companies, the numerous processes slow down progress."
good,"I spent 22 years with Britol-Myers Squibb Company, and I worked my way up through the sales ranks. I was challenged daily and enjoyed the sales role very much."
good,"This was a great company that is now simply a good company. Although BMS still get things done, and done will, the company has lost its soul. It used to be a company that truly did care about its products, customers, and employees, and now is really only focused on just the bottom line. Overall, it's still not a bad place to work. It still has the resources of a Big Pharma company. Don't go there looking to change the world or make a big impact, but if you are looking for a nice salary and a pretty stable environment, BMS is right for you."
good,You feel respected and honored; but your work experiences need to be expended and awarded. I was pleasant to work there but sometime lost challenges. so switched to gain new skills and knowledges.
good,BMS continues to reinvent itself to stay ahead of game. However organization changes bring a lot of stress to workforce and I wish it could be managed better.
good,"Collaborative environment. Opportunities for advancement through networking. I enjoyed the people and culture although the salary was low for the cost of living in Tampa. Many, including myself had second jobs on the weekend."
good,"BMS is very mission focused, driven by a ""Who are you working for?"" campaign designed to remind employees of the importance of the work we do and acknowledging there is still more work to do."
good,Competitive but also collaborating work environment.
good,"Lovely people to work with, great offices in Chester just global strategy and way business works can be difficult to handle."
good,"Très bonne entreprise avec une prise en compte du bien-être des salariés maximale."
good,"loved working for the company, what i did for the launch of the drugs, booking travel etc, co workers were just as motivated as me. Management was not good team building"
good,"As a contractor, I am recognized as part of the team, and not as an ""outsider.""  The workload is reasonable;  I handle between 3 and 5 projects most of the time.  There is a blurring of the lines between the IT Business Partner and the Project Manager's role which can be frustrating at times."
good,"I called on hospital giving presentation to physician and other staff. worked closely the Fellows, Attending's and Residents. I brought in National speakers for Grand Rounds, and Dinners.I worked closely with fellow office representatives to aid them whenever possible."
good,"The company went from a from a homey, family-friendly environment to a high powered corporate outfit with an open space working environment and had massive layoffs regardless of how good you were or how much you gave to the company.  Salaries are excellent and too many perks to list as long as you can hold on to your job there."
good,"BMS is customer focused. although there is an apparent disconnect between major divisions, the company makes effort to reduce these barriers. I highly recommend working for BMS"
good,I have loved working at BMS. Great company focused on patients. Wonderful work environment. Low wages in Florida and not much development opportunities.
good,"I really enjoyed working here, everyone was a teamplayer and management were the best. I am looking forward to another work assignment there again, hopefully soon."
good,"Bristol Myers-Squibb was a great company to work for.  It offered a great deal of benefit to their employees.  In the time that I was at the company, I was able to utilize computer/application skills that I wasn't able to any other companies.  Although I used Microsoft products most of the time, in other company, the level of expertise in Excel and Access gave me greater opportunities to formulate and distribute reports quickly.  "
good,"Kept us busy, but a lot of different opportunities. Through the years the main focus changed at times along with some of the species that we worked with. But that gave us all the chance to grow and learn new skills and techniques."
good,BMS is a great place to work but there is not much for upward mobility in terms of research and development.  The environment and culture is great focusing on patients and health.  One of the major perks of this job is the ability to work remotely.
good,"I enjoyably because you meet a lot of people, the education and training is very good, and give you an excellent benefits, I would recommend this job because it would open new doors."
good,"When I started at BMS I had a terrific manager with home office experience and a great servant leader.  Within two and half years, after my manager was let go, BMS instituted six person pods and we quickly overwhelmed and shut down offices.  Fantastic products terrible business model led to most seasoned reps leaving."
good,Well structured workplace with engaging and competent people company focuses in immunooncology and has shrunk its portfolio. Company has been restructuring and consolidating its workforce
good,I am currently needing to relocate which is the only reason I am searching currently for other jobs.  Bms does not have another opening in the area where I will be moving; otherwise I would continue working for the company.
good,"BMS is one of the last ""Big Pharma"" employers left in NJ.  I hope they stay. Some of the work we had in Development has been shipped to India, China, and Ireland so there was a layoff.  The management is young and the Company should use people with more experience so they do not have to relearn the wheel."
good,I lead the US HEOR Oncology team at BMS.  My typical day is managing meetings and topics relevant to RWE and HEOR.  I have learned they are a great company and like most of the management team.  They tend to have people in meetings morning to night and some managers are too self absorbed.  The hardest part of the job is getting my work done after being in meetings all day.  The most enjoyable part of this job is the latitude to be innovative.
good,Learned a lot over several years and it was a great experience. There was a significant management turnover which wasn't for the better. Ending up with a lack of caring for employees.
good,Great culture. Professional environment. Difficult collaboration on promoted product with parent company. Management and expectations were fair. Targeted bonus structure could have been a bit more realistic in that there was to much variation from one quarter to the next.
good,great place to work and great people.  compensated fairly compared to industry.  internal changes to corporate structure are risky.  Moving departments to locations with inexperienced personnel doesn't make sense.
good,"Productive and a fun work place with plenty of potential of being a pioneer in the Biopharma. As other companies, there is room for improvement and they are working towards that continuously."
good,"I enjoyed my time at BMS until my business unit was sold off.  "
good,Typical work day started at 7 AM and stopped about 5 PM. I learned a lot about the products and procedures. The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with site personnel. Being able to help them to be safe while doing their jobs and making the best pharmaceutical products and implanting safety practices to use off the job. Keeping Life and Fire Safety at the forefront of every day is important.
good,BMS has a friendly environment. People are very nice and helpful if you really want to learn something. Mangers have high expectations but if you are a new programmer and you can start learn a lot from this environment. Most of the programmers that work here are contractors.
good,"All things considered, I am grateful for the valuable learning  experiences gained while working at Bristol Myers Squibb in both R&D and Corporate divisions."
good,"Bonne compagnie qui soutient ses employés. Beaucoup d'évolution au fils des années. Restructuration, simplification."
good,"I enjoyed working for BMS and had a great 1st manager. Those that followed were a different story with ego's...The main reason I left was because I was going to interview for a Specialty position within the company and my current manager told me she will not let me go and would give the hiring manager a bad review of me. Not nice! I would have stayed, but under the circumstances, I couldn't work for a manager that would hold me back from advancing within the company."
good,"A typical day involves me working in a very diverse department and multi-tasking across various functions within Accounts Payable in order to get the job done. I interact with several internal/external stakeholders on a daily basis in different languages to solve issues with payments (invoices/credit notes), reconciliations of accounts and answer emails/phone calls."
good,"A typical day at work for me would be to collaborate work responsibilities with my co-workers. What I've learned is that by multitasking my worth and value as an employee increased over the years. My relationship with management has been more than satisfactory throughout my career with Bristol-Myers Squibb. The culture within the workplace is based on the following behaviors: Leads Strategically, Drives Performance, Innovates, Embraces Teamwork, Communicates Directly, Develops and Energizes People. It's a culture that I'll carry with me into my next employer. The hardest part of the job is knowing that my nearly 24 year tenure ship with the company ends on March 24, 2017 because my position is no longer needed. My most enjoyable part of the job were the good working relationships I developed as well as the confidence my supervisor had in believing that I can complete a project if it meant putting in overtime."
good,BMS offers a great work/life balance by allowing flexibility to work from home.  Sometimes the hours can be long but the work is rewarding in itself by allowing patients to live long healthy lives.  I was working on contract so was not eligible to receive benefits.  Management is knowledgeable on the subject matter but could sometimes have better communication skills.  Job Culture is excellent at promoting diverse skilled workforce through equal opportunity employment.
good,"A typical day at work begins with coordinating schedules with work partners (6) determining where you will make calls on customers.  evaluate pre-call plan for relevance and accuracy"
good,"most enjoyable part of the job is the innovative research with focused on rare disease area."
good,"Individuals I worked with in my most recent assignment, were fun,trustworthy individuals who had the best interest of the team in mind.  "
good,"Culture was stable"
good,"A typical day would start at around 9AM and end around 5:30PM in the evening. I was more involved in QCTS department. The management was very clear and focused on taking the company forward and were focused on meeting site and global goals of the company."
good,BMS is a great company. I can't say bad things about the company because is a great place to work. Is where I learned Accounting and learned how to be a team player.
good,As a contractor you are treated very differently but the compensation has made up for that. The contracts seem to be a lot longer than your typical temp. job.
good,"Zdecydowanie firme tworza ludzie i to jest najwiekszy atut, dobre wynagrodzenie i pakiet."
good,"The matrix management practice is sometimes frustrating.  However, overall BMS is an exciting work place with open seating to encourage corroborative learning exchanges.  The most rewarding part of this experience is the endless possibilities of how we as a team positively affect the lives our customers to improve their lives."
good,"Great opportunity to work with GP group.  The experience provides me with a lot of valuable insight of BMS GP work life."
good,"As with any company, you have your good and your bad. The good here is the job is laid back for the most part. The bad the morale  among employees isn't that great a lot of double standards. However if you keep your head low and do your job, you'll be fine. Don't ask too many questions that seems to annoy some people."
good,A great place to work if you have the right boss. The company has very good benefits although they were better in the past. Some areas have better development opportunities than other (such as the commercial division).
good,"Check all email first thing in am, review calendar for meetings, answers all voicemails, create new meetings from 3 managers as needed"
good,"Ambiente agradável de trabalhar, aprendi muito como Trainee e me despertou a ambição para novos desafios."
good,People are too focused about what they do which brings company to a good position !
good,BMS was a wonderful place to work.  I felt like I was making a difference and the people I worked with were fantastic.
good,"Great company that lost the family atmosphere."
good,"Het bedrijf heeft een knappe turn around gemaakt, mede door het goed inkopen van een nieuwe pipe-line. "
good,"Il lavoro consiste nella promozione di prodotti per il trattamento delle psicosi ( schizofrenia, disturbo bipolare)."
good,"alot of good people here and we always had fun"
good,"Generally a good place to work with some great people. However, frequent reorgs. can be unsettling."
good,- Review and edit protocols per BMS and FDA standards ensuring that documents are submission ready for each review committee
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was helping healthcare providers deliver better medical care through the products and services BMS provided. Enjoyed calling on virtually all of my customers. Was enthusiastic about the benefits my drug delivered.
good,Excellent group of dedicated professionals. Dedicated to providing global aviation services to the leadership team.
good,BMS is generally a good place to work.
good,"Fairer Bewerbungsprozess, gute Feedbackkultur, enger Kontakt zum direkten Vorgesetzten."
good,It was a difficult transition working for this executive. I was based at one site and my boss was at another and I was learning the position.  but I found it easy to get to know other individuals in the area who helped me better understand the position that I was doing.
good,"The culture and professionalism was evident from the start a truly comprehensive and great environment for individuals with solid skill sets."
good,"I had a really enjoyable experience while at BMS. The people were very friendly, professional and down to earth. At times, the amount of work could be a little insane but it wasn't all the time. For the most part, there was a really great work/life balance. Unless you worked on a brand that was launching. There's always plenty of process to follow, which I always prefer. My only issue was that my role was a contract position and there was no option for full time employment. So my time at BMS was short, but a great experience."
good,"Workplace culture was interactive and collaborative.  I found most SMEs easy to work with and discuss training modifications."
good,"Employee have many opportunity to learn and grow. Good working environment overall, but some managers may not be very professional. Some groups turn over rate is pretty high."
good,"Some great leadership, however, some not so good.  A lot of the great leaders have moved on and there are certain executives which should learn the difference between leading and managing."
good,"Boa empresa para se trabalhar, porém alguns lideres não condizem com a cultura da empresa e não valorizam seus funcionários."
good,"While I had some good co-workers and a great manager, most of the time the management was out for making things easy for themselves or rewarding their friends.   There was no discipline for employees who behaved unprofessionally.  The work was good and there wasn't huge stress, but there also wasn't a lot of advancement."
good,Overall this experience was beneficial to gaining a breath of engineering experience and exposure to a different industry. I would highly recommend this company for any engineering student and this location in particular.
good,"Ho sempre lavorato su tre turnazioni, in squadra e grazie a questa esperienza ho maturato una grande crescita professionale."
good,"Career enhancement prospects. Learnt about the GMP standards and 21CFR chapter 11 to a great extent. "
good,Many ongoing changes create uncertainty. There is evidence of favoritism. The company overall is great though: flexible work environment and opportunities to learn. Would recommend.
good,Great place to work and learned a lot from this place. I learned how to secure premises and personnel by monitoring property with security software and camera systems.
good,Worked with great people. Management was not transparent about goal to reduce costs by streamlining and automating jobs in order to move offshore. Benefits are great.
good,"I worked for a vendor at Bristol Myers.  employees not empowered to make decisions all decision by committee most meeting had 20-30 participants.  manager was micro-managing everyone  most employees afraid of manager, not a leader.  many contractors left before contracts ended.  No organized project management lots of what I call 'Engineering in the back of the bus' over topics and issues that should have been covered much earlier in the project planning cycle."
good,"Ambiance de travail où les personnes sont fières de l'usine et des produits. Donc volonté de faire toujours mieux, d'être une référence industrielle, de maitriser ce qui est fait. Fortes expériences et compétences techniques sur le site."
good,Position was through a staffing agency but overall great work culture with flexible work and school schedule.  Provided training for new employees and seniors were always available to answer questions.
good,Over the last three years working at BMS has been a great opportunity. I can't think of a bad thing to say about the company and my colleagues overall. There was a positive work environment to go along with the generous benefits given to its employees. I would totally recommend working for this company.
good,"Great opportunity to work with highly motivated-intelligent colleagues in a fast moving industry."
good,"First class research scientists. Teamwork is encouraged and rewarded. Good salary and benefits packages. However, Company is currently restructuring and closing certain research facilities."
good,"I enjoyed working with amazing people, and doing something that meant so much to so many. The culture was very fulfilling and conducive to teamwork and collaboration,"
good,"A typical day at work entails getting my work done in an efficient, accurate manner during a 40 or more work week. I've learned that projects/responsibilities can be achieved through generating ideas, collaborating with co-workers and initiate action. Management has been fair to me as they enforce an open door policy to address work related issues. With that said growth opportunities with my last employer became non-existent. The hardest part of my job is performing at a high level despite having the knowledge that I was told that my job position would cease to exist after March 24th of 2017. With that said....collaborating with my former co-workers and cross training with one another was one of my more enjoyable aspects of my job because it made me feel more valuable towards my employer and it's something that I will carry into my next employer."
good,"- A multinational pharmaceutical company."
good,"Typical day consists of running experiments, presenting at meetings in regards to these experiments. Learned crystallization. Co-workers are always willing to help. Most enjoyable is learning something new everyday."
good,"team effort was valued , individual efforts was recognised ."
good,"I have enjoyed working at BMS, I find that the teamwork and collaboration is great.  We are all part of a team and help each other.  People don't hesitate to lend a hand when asked or to share their experience.  Overall it's been a great experience; it's just that professional development can be lacking.  In my current department, it is hard to find a way to grow and develop."
good,"I was responsible for the SharePoint website, adding/modifying and updating existing website. I have learned a lot from the Seniors over there. I have learned new tools such as JSP and Crystal Reports.  I liked my team and co-workers a lot. The hardest part of the job is to keep myself busy when there is no work to do. And the best thing I liked about the job is that there were no traffic on my way there nor on my way to home."
good,"Learned new therapy areas in bristol myers squibb including oncology, virology and immunology."
good,"12 hours shifts maintaining all plant equipment for 24 hrs continuous operations ,many areas covered in production ,solvent recovery ,tank farms , incineration and waste water treatment areas .Reactive to breakdowns , on call ."
good,Great environment for new employees. Benefits are fair. Wish the company provided lunches and snacks and social activities on a monthly basis.
good,"BMS is staffed with hard-working, talented, and supportive individuals.  Will learn and gain a great deal top-down as well as bottom-up so long as you put forth your own efforts; can be a very challenging but career enhancing environment to be in if willing to seize opportunities."
good,Good place to work but has ceased bulk pharma operations.ALL ASPECTS OF INDUSTRIAL MAINTENANCE INCLUDING INSTRUMENTATION ELECTRIAL AND MECHANICAL PMs AND REPAIRS.
good,"Equipe de trabalho, bastante dinamica, madura, com foco nos resultados, excelente empresa para trabalhar"
good,"A good work culture that emphasize on cross culture, equal opportunities, continuous improvement,  learning and skill upgrade."
good,"My day starts out with an initial check of any developing incomplete awaiting response or continuation. Once immediate concerns are taken care of longer term projects get addressed, whether this is through email correspondence or from resource utilization. Occasional project requirements require flexibility in job responsibilities in order to get completed. This includes technical document handling, research database use, curating file library of documents needed for various needs, and then continuing monitoring of expense reports along with their valid submission and timely payment. Enterprise software use in SAP to examine, evaluate status, and continue processing priority work requisitions. Connecting with procurement groups by phone or email comes up occasionally whereas reproduction of documentation and communicating needs becomes necessary in order to get purchase orders processed."
good,"Qualificational idenity good..and job security low,"
good,"Job security is good at BMS. Less competition in the work, so everybody has a job and get good pay."
good,"Multinacional Americana donde pase 12 años ,solo puedo tener buenas palabras en todos los aspectos ,desde la gente ,la organización del trabajo , el sueldo ,los beneficios que teniamos como trabajadores  ,todo en general."
good,"Company is good in ethics and complience."
good,"its fun working at BMS ! Even after 7 years, I feel excited to go to work !"
good,14 yıl çalıştım genelde memnunum.Gurup kapanması sonucu ayrılmıştım.
good,"good benefits and good people, but a lot of shady management. one of those places that it's sometimes who you know."
good,"Aseptic clean environment, with a lot of paperwork, decent co-workers, decent management.The hardest part of the job would be the everchanging procedures that complicate the completion of my work. The most enjoyable part of the job would be some of the great relationships I've developed here."
good,"Had an opportunity to work with different teams with an integrated goal in mind."
good,Career Limiting- hard to move up in company
good,"Juntar dados, analisar documentos, avaliar produtos para montagem dos relatórios de Revisão Anual de Produtos."
good,Overall BMS is a good company. Many tenured sale representatives and managers. Then company has a great pipeline and future looks wonderful.
good,"New product launch,"
good,Spent 33 years with this family oriented company...made some great friends...company prides itself on work/life balance and stands by there mantra of extending and enhancing human life.
good,"When I started at BMS I worked in a multi disiplanary team of scientists, clinical database managers, ect all together. It was a great mix. The atmosphere was energized. In the last two years those teams were broken up and the work became mundane and slow."
good,Farsi valere all'interno dell'azienda e dare massima disponibilità per quanto riguarda gli straordinari.
good,"Great place to work, very challenging.  Very professional atmosphere. Very cooperative, dedicated colleagues on the project to get project tasks accomplished."
good,"Great place to work would definitely recommend, varies by function. Very collaborative environment, patients are always at the forefront of every decision"
good,"Challenging but rewarding work environment and culture. Lots of opportunities to learn and grow."
good,Overall good experience.   Much work to do on a daily basis.  Sometimes very short-handed which can increase an individual's workload tremendously.  Worked as a contractor and would definitely want to work there permanently.
good,Very busy and learned most of my skills hands on.  Promoted by the knowledge I learned over the years I worked at BMS.  I loved data entry as that what I was hired then my career took off from there getting into the Clinical aspects of the job.
good,"BMS moved to an open-spaced environment where collaboration was encouraged. I learned project management, meetings management, working across matrix teams, training and communication skills. The culture is focused on diversity, innovative ideas, openness and candor, teamwork and personal development."

good,Due to various positions held in the company please refer to the detailed CV.

good,Bristol-Myers Squibb was an excellent company to work for in my 16 years of my career.  Most of management was fair and supportive.  The culture unfortunately changed once they changed to a Biotech. Very rewarding to take part in the launch of new drugs to enhance and improve the lives of patients.  Compensation was very good as were the benefits. The hardest part of the job for me was dealing with the politics.

good,"This is an open environment office, meaning no cubicles, everyone is always open to help and the office is strong with Agile practices."
good,"splendida azienda ottimo rapporto tra colleghi ritmi lavorativi adeguati processi di lavorazione ben studiati."
good,"We were beginning to be given more autonomy in managing our territories; upper management realized that they could trust veteran reps with long-standing customer relationships.  With autonomy came accountability- deliver sales numbers.  That began to shift over the last 3 years, with increasing pressure for growth on growth, every quarter higher than the last, short-term goals and cutthroat rankings.  And reps came under increasing scrutiny by compliance, just assumed guilty before checking."

good,"Most researchers for BMS are mid-career professionals with years of experience. As a twenty year old, it can sometimes be difficult to make friends since the average age is so large. A typical day of work is either meetings, novel research topics, vendors, and presentations or focused research and infrastructure work. The hardest part of the job is the tendency for the company to want to differentiate itself and its software infrastructure from competitors and simplify the experience of complex theoretical or analytical techniques for ease of use, which leads to assumptions. I learned the emphasis placed on documentation and clean UI, though I prefer to generate scientific command-line interfaces over web interfaces. The most enjoyable part of the job is the banter and conversations at lunch I had with my groups, I found it fulfilling and satisfying to keep the group together, though it always feels like people are talking over my head instead of talking directly or being friendly. Maybe there's something socially awkward about scientists to begin with. The management is strong and firm with its deadlines and expectations are expectedly high in a post-grad bleeding edge organization supporting urgent medical needs. It's a tough company."
good,"Evolving culture and opportunity for staying within regional locations with reorganizations made it difficult to balance work life. would always have preferred to stay with Southern region but reorganizations layoffs and management consent changes made y family and AI have to relocate numerous times.

good,High presser management pushing sales people to get sales at any cost. Company started out as a wonderful place to work but after 16 years corporate leadership had changed and became something that was not good.
good,"worked for three months in Cruiserath which is a start up. I was a QC lab analyst. the work was all office based however, I spent my time writing up SOPs and risk assessments."
good,"Day to day, I start with reviewing emails, I usually go to meetings or complete daily tasks that lead up to an overarching project deadline. "
good,I have loved working for Bristol-Myers Squibb for the past 10 years.  Since I arrived the company has been constantly transforming itself to be an industry leader but has always adhered to core values with integrity being of utmost importance.
good,"BMS has been a wonderful company to work for. The culture is highly respectful and supportive. However, they are going through some re-organizational changes due to the scope of their portfolio that makes it uncertain how things will shake out in the future as far as job security. In my case, our entire department was let go based on a tightening of resources that made supportive roles vulnerable. Nonetheless, I very much enjoyed my18+ years there."

good,"•	Installed SQL Server 2008R2 with the latest security patches. "
good,I worked for Zimmer Patient Care Division that was a subsidiary of BMS. It was a great division with great individuals to work for. It felt like a small knit community or family while at work. I had the opportunity to get to know all of the departments within Zimmer and actually rewrite old IT systems to new standards. These new standards helped save man-hours in every department which in turn provided them with the ability to spend less time on their day to day administrative tasks and more time on providing products to customers. The most difficult part of the job was the beginning with lack of documentation of how the IT systems really worked (JCL/COBOL). However after a slight learning curve of reviewing the systems I was able to really make a difference. It was challenging - but a very fun challenging type of experience.
good,Muito boa empresa ambiente agradável porem plano de carreira fraco treinam o profissional e o perdem para o mercado por burocracia ou mesmo acomodação da gerencia

But, since my severance package is good, and more importantly, I am ready to take a new challenge to take up new research projects."
good,I enjoyed working in Analytical R&D but I moved with my husband to Maine.

They made penecillin as well as other meds. so we often worked in a Clean Air environment,which means we often had to wear protective gear and work with specific products so as not to contaminate the meds they made. It was a union job, so there was lots of room for benifits,raises and advancement.In fact I was offered a supervisor position but turned it down because I didn't want that responsibility again and the Union paid better"

Our team does strategic and strong hands-on experience on several middleware platforms, AWS Infrastructure and Services, and Data Lakes technology.

In addition to my regular responsibilities of answering phones, organizing domestic and international travel, preparing expense reports, I was also required to do project-specific activities.  My direct manager was one of the most respected and fair people I have ever had the pleasure to work with.  The hardest part of the job was not getting drug approval after years' of hard work by the entire team.  The most enjoyable part of the job was going to work every day.  I had hoped to retire from there."
good,"Most fun part of the job was that everyday was different.  I met lot of different people: Physicians, Nurses, Administrators, Pharmacists and after a while developed relationships with them.  It was a sales job so was very competitive, but very civil. Got to go to dinners, tennis matches, local plays, baseball games. Lot of paperwork and keeping inventory control of samples was the hard part but very doable."

good,"Bristol Myers Squibb provided an enjoyable and productive work place environment.  The issues were most rewarding in that they involved different countries, cultures and personalities on a very frequent basis. My colleagues were diverse, secure in their positions and knowledgeable about the work they performed on a daily basis.  The most enjoyable part of the job was traveling to the most ravaged parts of southern Africa, helping mothers and children who were most impacted by HIV/AIDS.  Bristol, the African governments and the will of the people- all working together-helped to transform the face of Aids, from one of hopelessness and despair to hopefulness and encouragement."
good,"Great experience with consumer products. Our line was Windex, Drano, Vanish, Behold, Endust and other number one products. I did new product introductions, designed planograms for my key accounts. I supervised store resets. You will see that one of my greatest successes is still in effect today.

What I found difficult was not the job itself, but rather the long ride to and from the office.  I enjoyed every activities of the studies' process, working alongside Site Trial Managers."

good,Esta es la empresa que laboralmente me dió mayor crecimiento en todos los sentidos
good,BMS is changing along with the Industry but still has that mid to small level company feel.  The culture is more collaborative than bureaucratic although a premium is placed on Culture and Compliance so it can feel difficult to navigate at times.  This is more than made up for by the fact that it is a safe and secure place to have a career and good intentions matter at BMS just as much as getting fast results.

During the processing, or our busy period, which would come up every few weeks, the hours could be either long or there were multiple shifts, however there were enough break inbetween for it to not be exhausting.

good,"I had a wonderful run with Bristol-Myers Squibb. Overall, I had great mangers and dedicated direct-reports.Overall, the people at all levels were wonderful and driven by a strong,meaningful company mission and culture. I was compensated fairly with both salary and employee benefits.There was career advancement opportunity but typical of the pharmaceutical industry, there was no guaranteed job security, I had three separations of service and the company re-hired me and restored my accrued benefits two of the three times. I did not seek to be re-hired the third time. As a result, it is impossible to put an accurate start and end date for me at Bristol-Myers Squibb."
good,"Lavorare in Bristol è stato un piacere,ho imparato un nuovo lavoro di magazziniere è stata una bella esperienza peccato durata solo 14 mesi ."
good,Didn't know what daily tasks would be until that morning.  I learned the process of investigational drugs to the approval by the FDA. There was constant changes due to reactions from drugs.

good,great experience but all positions at my level are contracted out and therefore there was not an opportunity for me to stay with BMS in a full time capacity.

It was awesome to work in an environment that was truly Team inspired. Also it was an employee driven atmosphere. Our managers made sure that you were exposed to any and everything that would promote you to the next level!!!!

good,"Typically most of my days are consumed by SAP / Labware troubleshooting.  I am not micro managed and everyday need to conform to that days tasks, constant change.  I enjoy all of the co-workers at the site,fortunately have had the chance to work with almost everyone on site.  Hardest part of the job is occasionally not knowing what the day might hold, but at the same time is challenging.  I love my job just need a second source of income."
good,"Starting work at 7:30A.M., preparations required for work, first in first out except urgently required products, testing,, reading results of the days before, data entry on PC, check system."
good,Most enjoyable part of job is knowing you are working to save and improve the quality of life for people you will never know. Hardest part of job is sometimes the pace in which you have to adjust to changes.
