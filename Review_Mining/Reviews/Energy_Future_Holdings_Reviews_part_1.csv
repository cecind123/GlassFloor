rating,review
bad,Call center specialist has much more qualifications then what they are being paid.. they are over worked and underpaid..Account Spealist Group (ASG) has been fazed out as a position
bad,this is not a good place to work at all...the management needs improvement...also the pay needs to be higher for the job...need to give discounts for electricity to there employees
bad,Please to not work for TXU ENERGY or Energy Future Holdings in Houston Texas! They treat you with disrespect and the company is out of Compliance with everything. Under pay you and overwork you!
bad,This was a temporary job to bridge myself to my next opportunity.
bad,Doing an outstanding job for almost 9 years with this company did NOT matter. It's politics as usual for this company.
bad,worked there starting the A/P dept from the ground up.  The absolute most horrible place I have ever encountered.  The job and rules changed DAILY...I worked 6 days a week for 6 months straight 10-11 hour days M-F and half days on Saturdays.  Horrible management- physical altercations in the middle of the office with NOTHING happening to the employees.  A manager that had NO CLUE what we were doing on a daily basis...and no accountability for mistakes on any level.  Very disorganized and hostile working environment.  Bills ran at least 30 days late ALL the time- took about 2 weeks for the approval process (which was out of our hands and we were waiting on other people!)  HORRIBLE HORRIBLE place!  The icing on the cake...they offered me $3 less an HOUR to go permanent instead of contract.  REALLY???  NO THANK YOU!
bad,"Not sure if all sites with in this company are like this but the management here is a joke. If you are a liar, Have no problems committing adultery, can talk out of both sides of your mouth without making eye contact, and your a racist, then this is the place for you!"
bad,"They pay was good, but they told me I would be hired, and stayed as a temp for 3 yrs and then the assignment was released. I really like the job but not mgmt."
bad,"Very stressful environment, company's debt downgraded to junk status. I do not recommend this place unless you are desparate."
bad,With the bankruptcy and new management they allowed most of the diverse workforce to be laid off. It is back to mostly men in upper management. They speak diversity but it is only tokened out.
bad,"I enjoyed working as a team, through out was good customer service skills, data entry, answering phones, making sure the ppl was happy at all times, whether if they was paying a bill, or setting up payment arrangements......"
bad,"Awful place to work. They make promises they don't keep. They tell you things during your interviews that aren't true. It's a clicky place to work. If you're not in with the right people, you get treated like dirt. Nobody is interested in doing the job correctly. People can out right do their job completely wrong AND it be recognized by management but if they're in that right brown-nosing crowd, it doesn't matter. Problem with that is it's a ripple effect. Makes it real hard to do your job when others can't do theirs. They preach about moving up in the company. Sure, if you have a degree. These kids come out of college with a piece of paper but zero experience and make twice the money as the guys with years of experience yet have to show those hot shots how to do their job. Nothing like getting up everyday and deciding whether to take a bullet or go to work. Leaving was the best decision ever. It's really disappointing though. You think you've gotten on with that great company you can retire from only to find out it's a joke."
bad,This was a summer internship and the days went by fast when working along with different leaders in the company. There was nothing to hard about the company but it was a good start and to see great leaders in corperate America.
bad,When I worked there it was a very bad experience. People were very rude and unprofessional. There was no dress code so people wore inappropriate clothes.
bad,"TXU Energy was a great company but the management is out of control. There is a lot of ""Good ol Boy System"" I worked there for 4 years and never got a pay increase, promotion or nothing. They outsource a lot. Management needs to be updated."
bad,Many issues with money and not keeping up with the industry. Will be 2016 before they know who buys them and the direction they will go.
bad,"I would call reliant customers and try to switch them to TXU."
bad,"I retired from the company that was TXU and later became Energy Future holdings. I did not work for this company. This is all I can tell you. I have nothing else that I can tell you."
bad,"One of my first jobs while in Houston. It was a business to business sale job that helped me get on my feet. I benefited from this job, by having to come in constant contacts with customers."
bad,i only worked for 2 months and was told that my position by my temp service would be only 2 months
bad,The work environment is one of stress and top down micro management.
bad,"TXU Energy"
bad,Fast paced call center environment. Below average pay for the work required.  The educational assistance was exceptional.
bad,This company filed for bankruptcy and laid off valuable resources. This was sudden and sad. Thank you so much for your help and your assistance with this new opportunity ahead.
bad,Lots of overlapping management. Unclear direction and lack of employee engagement. Poor office culture. Salary and compensation is good and benefits are adequate. Hours are long and stressful.
bad,"A typical corporate day. Spent countless hours on pointless meetings. Lots of Type A personalities who like to escalate every single issue. Nothing ever really gets accomplished because there are too many moving parts and people aren't on the same page. Management isn't really worried about the advancements of their employees and if you try to advance on your own then the behind the scenes politics stop you if you had a manager like mine. "
bad,"I loved my customer's and peers, however in Sales if you have an opinion or your Sales were being mis-managed there is no one to go to with out the fear of being terminated. I was terminated from here without cause, and even unemployment felt there was no need for termination. Its sad ""the right to work in Texas"" it really means if someone doesn't like you they can let you go. Unfair, I wouldn't suggest anyone work under these conditions, high turn over for call center, lack of appreciation, and no room for discussing things to make this company a better place. Call center reps get treated like rats and corporate like royalty."
bad,"Planned to retire at my current position.  I was told October 13, 2017 that the plant would shutdown and I would be laid off in January 2018."
bad,"A day in the call center was never a dull moment."
bad,"The job was very stressful, managers are always micromanaging. The call center was too messy and always some type of drama! Some of the managers do not care about helping you advance in your career they are just looking for a check."
bad,"Energy Future Holdings is a job for those in their youth with dreams and aspiration for winning big in sales. The young with strength to pave the concrete knocking on doors and expiring life. Your days are filled with excitement of making your quota and other days of disappointments about the one you almost got. I learned how electricity works and that no matter what the name its all the same electricity. Management is there to cheering us on no matter what, and to come back tomorrow. It's a job with a high turn over rate. The heat in the summer is brutal here in Texas.  Even though its hot when you see someone meet their goal and believe that the job is real it's an exciting moment."
bad,I did not enjoy working at TXU Energy.  It was very stressful. I was not able to work hours I can.  Management was always changing and the company's future was unsure.
bad,"Advancement only if you have a family member working for company, Experience does not matter. Supervisors give great reviews but no path for promotion. Culture is a social network environment, face book, text, watch youtube as you please."
bad,"business on calls helping customers with the home phone and the answering machines making sure everything was in working order"
good,A typical day at work would be answering business customer problems with electricity accounts.  I learned SAP.  Management was not supportive.  Workplace was very disconnected.  The most enjoyable part of the job was to know other employees.
good,A typical day at was nothing but a place of complaints.  No one was happy but I learned a lot in my seven years.  The management staff needed guidance and wasn't very fair.  The workforce was great people and I enjoyed servicing my clients.
good,Coal power plants are going away and not coming back. If you work at a coal fired power plant your time is numbered. Find a gas plant. They are going to close some of the old gas plants sometime so watch out for that.
good,"Shutting down three large power plants is why I left.Sad to leave a great paying job, but that's life.I did not have many issues while working there. It was great till I got my pink slip."
good,Management was very least concern with employee needs. Great co-workers to work with
good,Working from home has its pros and cons. Whenever you need something it is difficult to get help since you are in a remote area and not close to the Irving home office.
good,"This position requires the individual to be self driven and goal driven. You will be alone must of the time, and expected to cold call the majority of the time. Overall good company."
good,A lot of responsibilities for less people all the time.  Very few opportunities to move up.  Recent merger with another company put employees at risk due to layoffs.
good,The culture created within this company is one of safety and that of caring about ones well being both personally and in the office.
good,They would rather just fill a spot with a warm body than spend the time to find quality people or bring along quality people.
good,A great place for learning about coal mines and utilities and how they operated. Different than the typical Accounts Payable Dept.
good,"A typical day could vary from one extreme to another. I learned a massive amount while there from my coworkers. Management at the time was very poor, which directly impacted the workplace culture. The most difficult part of the job was dealing with a very overbearing supervisor, who has since moved on. The group I was apart of were and amazing group of guys that were capable of tackling anything, and provided incredible support to the operations dept there."
good,It was a great place to work. The field personnel at the plant and mine locations were very knowledgeable and pleasant to work with. New implementation projects were exciting to work on and I enjoyed all experiences while doing project work.
good,"very stressfull  job handling escalated calls daily ,and having to limit your call talk time ,and adherence,and conformance while being an advocate to the customer."
good,"Decent compensation."
good,"This place is okay if you're happy in stagnated positions. There isn't any room for advancement in my area, management is almost non existant and pay is not all that. Well it's sort of a who you know not what you know atmosphere here. I will say that they are very flexible with schedules. If you can work from home and need to be out of the office they are accommodating. The best part of my day is the Monday morning prayer in the gym. It helps to keep me positive during the week."
good,"I enjoyed my career at TXU Energy for many years, as an Account Manager, Business to business sales, Account Service Manager and as a Supervisor.  I loved my roles until I started reporting to a particular Manager.  She would rather coach you out the door instead of coach you up.  She upset everyone and it took higher management awhile to realize this and demote her, which they eventually did.  She and myself, along with many others were eventually laid off."
good,"Coming out of bankruptcy with a new CEO changed the culture since the new CEO is only interested in cutting everything, taking the company public, and collecting a huge paycheck.   Now, no long term thinking. Co-workers were great."
good,Long hours of rotating shift work make this a very hard job. Compensation is good but a good life after work is very hard to achieve. Rotating shift is not a good work schedule and contributes to health problems. Management is like all other big company management in that lip service is the norm for employees but everyone in management has their own agenda.
good,"working there was a fast pace environment, there is room for advancement."
good,My experience at TXU Energy is a really good experience however I am looking to relocate to the Houston area. I perfer to  work for a  company that offer benefits and full time employment
good,Good company with lots of changes over the years.  Texas is a competitive market and will continue to grow in this vertical.  This is not an old utility company but a competitive retail company now.
good,great place to work great benefits work 8hrs. a day off weekend i really like that when you learn your job you will move up in the company and get a raise
good,Love my team members. I worked with a great people we always helped each other and had great managers. My managers were always there for their team and let us talk openly without any fear of prosecution.
good,This information is not necessary for me to find another job. I do not wish to share information that is not needed. I don't know what you do with this info and do not wish to share.
good,I am not ready to provide a review on my previous employer at this time.  I would like to take time to reflect on my time with the organization and provide a fair appraisal.
good,I have no words for being a door to door sales man I fell as though they are under paid I don't think very fund of the job and honestly for all the ppl we talk to doors slammed in our face everything is based of sales unacceptable
good,"Teleperformance closed the doors back in April of 2017, it was a shock to all of us that was still there, some people were there more than 20 years.  It was a very sad day."
good,Great place to work with an excellent safety record. Unfortunately upper management decided to close the mine and Sandow Power Plant. Natural gas is cheaper and more environmentally friendly than coal.
good,The short time I worked there (7 years) I met alot of great people with experience galore that didn't mind helping a new guy out.  The company itself could use some polish but overall not a terrible place to work.
good,"Under new leadership the company reorganized, I am no longer employed due to reorganization.  Many employees were asked to terminate from the company."
good,The company has a good work life balance.  It definitely has major grow potential for those starting out in the call center and upper management. Nepotism is something you see a great deal of.
good,Fast paced environement. The multiple task and detail requirments are very difficult to maintain with quality work.The hardest part of the job was prioritizing the job load and satisfying managements job metrics demands. Comradery between fellow employees was the most pleasant circumstance of the job.
good,"Up early in the morning gathering for route review and assignments, walked in ant climate to gather customers electric meter information for billing"
good,"Fun people, good starting pay for a younger demographic. Schedule was a little irregular at times and getting time off."
good,I thought TXU was a good company. But as with most companies they are more concerned with bottom line than with employees.
good,No growth opportunity. Lots of cold calling and getting rejected.
good,"A typical day involved taking high call volumes of enrollments, billing questions, and collection calls."
good,"The culture is one of learning and teamwork.  I am involved in many work teams, including operations and maintenance, so I have learned about all areas of the plant.  Our management team is good to our employees and recognizes them for positive input.  We have a very strong safety culture!"
good,The environment is ever changing. The company is going through a bankruptcy and everything is in a state of flux.
good,great company nice flow of work environment. Had great hours 5am to 1pm. Monday through Friday was loveable I enjoyed working there and for the company. wish I would of had a raised but other than that the schedule made it easy to do
good,Expanded scope of project manager role and built relationships.
good,Dynamic and exciting work environment. Politically charged environment.
good,"•	Respond and research billing and payment questions, report customer outages, schedule service requests, and generate business sales authorization "
good,"• Served as Human Resource Business Partner advising in areas regarding Business Policies, established laws/regulations related to functional areas of HR management, and promoted consistency in the application of policies and ensured compliance."
good,Good company with lots of opportunities for advancement.
good,very busy. Workers are not to friendly but they get there job done
good,"i learned how to work together as a team to achieve one goal. I think their wasnt any thing hard about working here, you just come in and assist customers and try and sale something while doing so. The most enjoyable thing was being able to satisfy a customer because at the end of the day thats what its about. I've learned to give it 110% and things will be fine...."
good,"The company provided all that was needed for me as an employee, however the work conditions at times were unreasonable. I had to work in the rain with harsh temperatures. The pay however was great."
good,"The company is a good place to work, but the Texas power market has put several power companies in an awkward position in the power market.  Currently, with the subsidies from the government to support ""green"" energy i.e. wind farms, solar, etc... it has put many power producers in a non profitable situation with legacy generation stations."
good,"A safety minded company who went the extra mile to ensure your safety and attitude about it Good support from management, especially the further along I progressed in my career. work force was very stable until policies and benefits changed. Toward the end we had a lot of really young folks that couldn't handle grind and expectations so turnover grew."
good,"high level paced industry to work for (electric/energy industry)"
good,"Planning meetings on a daily basis for TXU employees, including meals for the event, over night stays for in house hotel, making sure our guest are comfortable.I enjoyed everything about my job, from prepairing meals for a large group of people,to watching the deer come up to the windows."
good,Company was a great place to work but recently went through major changes to management resulting in significant layoffs.  Some departments were left with inadequate resources compared to work load requirements.
good,"The company was a good place to work.  I work on the retail electric side of the company and it is the market leader for electric commodity service.  Coworkers are innovative, have great ideas, and are constantly evolving and collaborating together."
good,"I loved the people, but had a hard time finding the right role since the company was undergoing so much change."
good,Great place to work.   Employees work very hard but it is a fun and exciting environment to be a part of.
good,Everybody there is very well educated.  Good organizational structure.
good,Stable Energy Producer numerous plant sites company has power plants and mines
good,"Very high stress job, especially at the end.  I grew up at this company for 21 years. It was not all bad and I learned a lot.  For the last 2-3 years everything changed and it wasn't about the future anymore, and I knew my time was coming.  It was hard to focus as much on work and we worried so much about how leadership was changing and what they weren't telling us.  We could tell though in the shifting of the culture."
good,This is a place with a lot challenging work but you will learn a lot from your team members and you boss. You will also be paid well and have very good bonus.
good,"Lots of turnover and changes. Also, a lot of unknown it this current time.  Management seems great but middle management, there are issues."
good,The job was commission based. The work was usually on the weekends. Not many incentives.
good,"Worked through multiple issues that are created by our customer service agents that involved correcting customer's accounts."
good,"A market leading competitive retail electricity provider which provides electricity and related services to millions of customers as the company offers a variety of innovative products and solutions, competitive priced service plans, energy efficiency options, and renewable energy programs."
good,This position allowed me to showcase my exceptional written and oral communication skills.  There was unlimited overtime.  Good benefits and vacation packages.
good,I have been working shift work now for 17 plus years.  The past 7 plus years at EFH has been a better shift getting 7 straight days off a month. On this shift schedule you work half a year in all.  That is not counting OT weather it is voluntarily or mandatory.  The typical work day consist of working with our customer (Operations)  to provide & maintain the equipment they need to load and haul lignite to their customer the (Power Plant).  I have learned many valuable attributes while working for EFH.  Management has plenty room to grow.  There seems to be a lot of secretive intentions revolving around upper management.  The work place culture has become more disappointing over the last 3 years with all the talks about shutting down etc. We do still have a hand full of employees that care about their job and conduct themselves accordingly.  The hardest part of the job is getting the craft to motivate themselves to work with all the turmoil circulating.  The most enjoyable part of my job is the camaraderie that I have formed with my fellow workers.
good,I enjoyed working here. Good people. Good working environment. Learned how to make electricity here. Hardest part of the job is the schedule.  Leaving because they are shutting down our plant.
good,"Very fast pace very informative, diverse work environment. Many different division to work in. Clean atmosphere and able to pick a work schedule. No weekends."
good,Management is respectful but multiple projects and stressed working conditions cause the employees frustration. Nice benefits and compensation for the industry.
good,"TXU was a great company to work for, i started as a contractor through a temp agency but managed to gain full employment after 8 months, Benefits start at day 1 and include two weeks vacation and a week of sick days."
good,"Reading Meters"
good,The company participates in many employee-appreciation functions both internal and external.
good,Made and received calls for TXU Energy and Verizon Wireless Roadside Assistance. Roadside assistance was my favorite department to work in for this company...Novo 1 is a good company to work for and the usually offer overtime depending on what department you're working in. The management is pretty good and the break times are adequate
good,"Been with the company nine years this coming January. Worked at 2 different locations (Franklin and Rockdale Texas) great employees at both locations, leaving company due to plant closure."
good,"Luminant is the generation arm of EFH and is transitioning rapidly from a coal fired base load generating company into a GT/CCGT company.  Long hours, an excellent skilled staff with a motivated operations and maintenance team that is being phased out.  "
good,"EFH is now out of business."
good,"shouldTreat everyone equally, should not work long in very hot weather(need to take more cool down time from the heat). Once we get a customer  approve out in the field since we work so hard selling them and geting them on the phone with the company they should give us something for getting them approve even if they latter changed their mind."
good,"Culture has continued to get worse with the closure of the Mine that will take place in Q4 of 2018. Great place to work, just need more than 2 years to work."
good,"I have worked for the company for 5 years and the company has a great atmosphere and a great senior management team, but the company is not as competitive as it should be when it comes to salaries."
good,Great place to work before bankruptcy.  You can no longer work there because it went bankrupt. They have since changed their name to Vistra? Energy?
good,"Family company however extremely busy always. "
good,"I would unlock all doors and turn on all lights, check the meetings for the morning in a Corporate Conference Facility, make sure that the room has coffee and refreshments, and also make sure that there is no audio-visual equipment needed clean after each meeting and prepare for next day. I would also make sure that a table is available for catered lunch. I would enter any new meetings or info into the computer. I would act as backup receptionist and also assist the Supervisor when she needed me. I would meet with Executive Assistants and Executive Secretaries to get information about there meetings or answer any questions that they may have. I learned how to manage and lead from that position. I loved my co-workers. Hardest part of the job was explaining to other co-workers how to troubleshoot the audio-visual equipment on the company phone. The most enjoyable part was being able to hire people that I felt would be good workers and interviewing."
good,Best Job I ever had.  Loved working for a Great Company.  I had the pleasure of working with awesome attorneys and the guys in the Regulatory Department. I enjoyed being a part of the Legal and Regulatory Department for 9 years.
good,"Very fastpaced and demanding."
good,"Good management team, but excessive focus on cost management. Colleagues are collaborative, helpful. There's not much attrition and employees keep getting better at their work. On the flip side, leads to fewer growth and change opportunities as employees stay with the company for a long time. That said, there is not a noticeable old-school mindset due to the high tenure."
good,"I would recommend working here but the commute is too much wear & tear on my car for the pay. Good benefits provided w/ clinic on location for free. Lunches given once a month, pay increase/bonus given annually. Management seems to have favorites & job opportunities based on who you know, not what you know. I have been discriminated against and told i cannot apply for a job because i am ""bilingual""."
good,"Historically, this is a very good place to work and very family-orientated company.  Some of the smartest people and sharpest individuals work here.  As new management assumes the helm, it will be interesting to see what changes."
good,"When I started here in March 2011 we were still handling paper invoices from all over Texas. We were on Main Frame systems to enter invoices for payment."
good,"POSITIVE:"
good,"It's a stressful work day dealing withbilling questions, I learned how to setup accounts for business and manage my time between calls and breaks, if you are working stay keep busy and try not gossip you will not have a problem with co-workers. The hardest part of the day is to many call or not enough sales. Going home happy is the best part of the job."
good,"There is an opportunity to participate in initiatives that are an extension of the company.  The company does practice Corporate Citizenship in its partnership with United Way; and, involvement in the Dallas/Fortworth Metroplex charitable events.  The work culture is intense because of the demand to meet deadlines for the growth initiative currently taking place within the company."
good,We can learn lot of new things here. I loved working here. There is a huge scope to improve over existing skills and also learn lot of new stuff in the IT industry.
good,would recommend anyone to work for TXU Energy if you enjoy working with customer's and helping them resolve any electric issues or help with whatever they need
good,"Energy Future Holdings is the parent company of TXU Energy, which is their retail outlet.  While with TXU I had the opportunity to engage in several different aspects of their operation from direct supervision of sales agents to training new representatives, to being involved in setting goals for the Houston division's new fiscal year operations."
good,I worked here for many years and in different departments and there was always an opportunity to advance and grow within the company.  They had great managers to work for and always took care of their employees and made us feel appreciated.
good,"Typical day busy but fun, they celebrated the employees accomplishment as well as birthdays. The most enjoyable part of the job, I meant some special people that became my best friend."
good,"Work was enjoyable for me because I like what I do, for the most part the company was willing to invest in your learning and education."
good,"The entire team were all very knowledgeable and willing to explain and assist a junior technician like myself, whenever questions arose.  Learned tons from that team in terms of power generation, start-up/shut-down procedures,coal fired boiler mechanics ,and related auxiliary systems. Great shop cohesiveness and team effort. Typical days were relatively relaxed. Starting with trouble tickets handed out to techs based on priority, and the technicians familiarity with that particular item. We worked in teams of 2-3, which was very beneficial in terms of troubleshooting, in terms of having the ability to bounce ideas off of other techs for possible solutions.  The intense long hours were by far the most undesirable part of the job and much of that could have been prevented by management by hiring more technicians."
good,"I love my job as a operator and have good co-workers. Management follows safe working practices and gives encouragement."
good,Great company but pronen to layoffs.  Many chances for advancement.
good,Started working there right out of high school and really enjoyed it.Co-workers were great.We had fun doing a job we loved...glad it lasted 37 yrs for me.
good,"Was a great place to work, would still be there if not for a plant shutdown. Good pay, good people to work with and bosses.Good benefits and opportunity to advance in the company."
good,"Fairly relaxed work pace when everything is running smooth. but you have to take the work seriously and learn the systems because when trouble arises, you have to think, act and resolve the issues in a timely matter."
good,Good place to work. Great management team at the site. The culture had evolved to a point where all employees were engaged and empowered to make changes to processes and procedures as needed. Great safety culture
good,Good place to work and the people I worked with was good and easy to get along with. As Long as you done your job everything was ok. And management did mess with you.
good,"I experienced many new opportunities while working fro EFH. I learned the importance of developing strong relationships with my end user  as well as suppliers ."
good,Good working environment with very good benefits and pay. The people and management are very knowledgeable and helpful. The company strives to keep abreast with current technology and provides training when needed for new technology.
good,"During my time there, I loved it. Very micromanaged but great work life balance, benefits, competitive pay, time off, and company events."
good,"A typical day at work for me is going to new businesses that are about to open and help them get power to their facility. I work closely with Oncor and contractors and electricians to make sure they get their meter and power on time. I also go to businesses that are already open and talk to them about possible switching to TXU. I ask for a current bill if they have one available. I tell them they can call me anytime on my cell phone or email me if they have any questions. "
good,"Working to build scalable solutions to the client."
good,"Being an Office Manager or Adminstrative Assistant is an exciting experience.  Getting to know all the people you work with and being part of a Diversity team has helped me to grow as a person.  I enjoy working with people and this position allows me to do so.  I have had the pleasure of expaning my knowledge, through both classroom and self paced web clases.  This company has been an inspiration to me.  I love challenges to keep my mind growing and learining new things.  I am a dedicated employee that shows up early and leaves late, or whatever it takes to get the job done."
good,good company with great benefits. rotating 12 hour shifts are difficult. good management team.
good,Another wonderful company but unfortunately all customer service was outsourced overseas.
good,It is a laid back place to work. Excellent pay and benefits. It is a secure industry to be in.
good,This was a contract position. I enjoyed working here. I worked through an IT recruiter that paid me fairly. I worked under a small team doing migrations and upgrades.
good,"Vistra Energy is a great place to work:"
good,"Excellent management when I was there.  Director was informative, approachable and respectful.  "
good,I went through the Power Track program and worked at Martin Lake as an intern. It was an overall great experience. I met a lot of great people and learned a lot about power generation.
good,"I enjoyed working at Energy Future Holdings, they offered good benefits, good working environment, fun playroom and T.V. rooms for employees to unwind on their breaks or lunch. I participated in10 of the 15 5k runs they sponsored per year, which makes you feel great about participating in. Six Flags, top golf outings and Christmas events were enjoyable for myself and family. I don't need all these things to become a great employee of your company, but It did make you feel appreciated for your efforts."
good,A typical day is challenging but you encounter awesomely engaged employees that want to give their all to build something that is great and second to none.
good,"Busy yet relaxed atmosphere, co-worker were like family.  Fun and very eventful.  Educational, compassionate environment to work in.  Would recommend to anyone."
good,12 hours of busy work making power for Texas until the plant was closed. good place to work fun atmosphere easy to get along with the company as well as other employees
good,"Very good place to work, great benefits and great pay. good management with great communication skills. "
good,"Great place to work, rated in top 10 in Dallas Morning News annual Top 100 places to work survey.  Very well organized and disciplined with great employees"
good,I liked assisting customers with inquiries about their accounts. I am a single parent that struggles with adhering to attendance. Working here made life a little more simple.
good,Good group of hard working people striving to produce electricity for Texas. Hardest and best part of the job was the need for quick thinking for problem solving situations.
good,"This company has a great culture that works hard to be transparent and gives a family feel.  There are a few drawbacks with the caps on financial gain with internal promotions and the difficulty with being promoted as you enter the analyst range, but it's overall a good company."
good,"EFH owns Luminant, which controls and operates Comanche Peak NPP."
good,EFH is a conscientious employer sensitive to the needs of its employees and the desire to foster strong team environments through compassionate leadership.
good,I learned many things in this organization as as QA lead. Good friendly environment to work with.Nice opportunity to work with this company.
