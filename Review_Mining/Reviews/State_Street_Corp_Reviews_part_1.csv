rating,review
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
bad,"I was harassed almost every day, when I complain to the HR, they me they protect the managers not me. Ending meeting about other meetings. The managers doesn’t have a f...king what they were doing but they still get protected because they were friends to the big boss because  they talk about sports all the time"
bad,"bad culture"
bad,"Had my 1st child after about 2 years there. Ni flexibility. Did not request time off, so all I was alotted was 2 days until I could put in a formal request. Also blocked from advancing from management even though I had been in the role for the requisite amount of time to make a move."
bad,"Stressful and too much turnover of staff on teams "
bad,"Stay away from State Street. This is an old school bank with no future.  It is the worst paying firm in Boston and has zero opportunities for advancement.  If you have no choice, do not stay more than 2 years or you will have a hard time finding a company to hire you. This is well known by companies in Boston and they look down in those who stay more than 2 years at such a bad firm"
bad,"Overall bad company. Don't waste your time. "
bad,"Management and HR are very unprofessional and put people in positions that they know are not a threat to their position. Alot of internal drama. Silent expectation to work way more then paid. Management blames everyone for the bad experiences clients face with offshore processing centers. Work from home is really your on call 24 hours. Low starting salary at 28,500 to 32,000, with so many false promises."
bad,"There is no such thing as a work life balance here.  You work with people who only sleep 4 hours a night and the rest of the time they are working.  This is the norm and if you do not follow this you will not meet expectations.  I had to work every weekend of the summer (no overtime as we are salary) and only got a meets on my review and a small bonus.  Every month they discuss layoffs even though we are struggling to keep up with the work.  They could triple the staff and we would still be under staffed.  The morale is so low that most people are seeking medical help for their mental status.  They do not believe in promoting internally.  They will not even offer senior level positions to the internal team.  However, they are constantly hiring externally for senior positions.  In the last 11 years I only know of 5 promotion in the entire division, but I seen hundreds of layoffs.  There are things that executives force you to do that seems immoral to the customer.  The company it used to be is no longer here."
bad,"If you want to work many hours and not get paid for it this is the place for you.  They don’t reward your hard work and after many years of working for them they will let you go without a second thought. Don’t waste your life, time or energy and go somewhere else that will recognize and reward you for your expertise."
bad,State street has a terrible culture and does not pay well.  I did not like working there.  Rounds of lay offs are always on the horizon and they have difficulty keeping employees.
bad,"Terrible company to work for, everything they promised as benefits were not true, would not let you work from home, staff did not know what they were doing, manager was unprofessional, rude, and not helpful. Onboarding process was awful and unorganized. Pay was pretty bad. For new college graduates avoid this type of job cause you will learn nothing. Most people leave in a year or two for a better job."
bad,"Do not waste your time at this company, it's just a matter of time before you're laid off. Unfortunately, I have spent the majority of my career with this company and walked away with little more than a bad taste in my mouth. The company I decided to put so many years and so much effort towards ended up being such a disappointment. Now I am middle-aged, underpaid, and was hung out to dry. Put your energy elsewhere, this company is not worth your time."
bad,"State Street was not my first choice for employment but I eventually found myself in Fund Accounting.  This was a common role for folks out of college.  "
bad,"Over the past 5 years this company has moved the vast majority of the jobs overseas to India. Your training will be entirely on the job, with associates who have likely been on the job for one year or less.  In one department my training consisted of my manager placing a folder full of the prior year financials on my desk and telling me to ""figure out how it was done last year"". The entry level associates have been downgraded to doing nothing more than running macros, and have little incentive to learn the more sophisticated functions of the company's accounting programs. "
bad,"Worst bank I have ever worked for. The company is designed to set you up to fail. They do not believe in job/work balance.  As a single mother with two children, they were not accommodating to my situation when the children where ill."
bad,"Not the best experience, nice outer image poor internals.  Really old systems, not particularly innovative, poor controls, and non existent HR .  \Perhaps if your face fits...."
bad,"Horrible management, toxic environment. With a company this big you're just a number. No one cares about your life and work life balance is a joke. If you want to live a life consistently stressed out, work here."
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
bad,"No room for growth, hours of work are not reasonable - with such a huge corp as State Street you would think there's more doors and opportunities to transfer to---it's not."
bad,I really don't have anything good to say about this company after 2 years working there. All kinds of discrimination are tolerated thanks to a top down boys cub mentality. Worked with staff at various levels in multiple regions an found them to be terribly complacent and incompetent -- especially IT. Glad to be out.
bad,Not a very professional atmosphere. Its a learn on your own industry.  Employees were pretty nice however.  The building is fantastic as well. Had a very bad encounter with a co worker
bad,cube life only upper management made any sort of income in order to live in Boston. horrible place but a place to start a career I suppose if you're fresh out of college.
bad,"Awful atmosphere and environment to work in - You could hear a pin drop. Management have no idea how to manage staff but actual knowledge of their job is good purely because most people seem to have got stuck in a rut in the same place due to good location for them for schools etc so experience is there for staff that have stuck around that long. Other than that there is little to no training given to new starters, it's very much a sink or swim atmosphere and each to their own. I really wouldn't recommend to anyone, wages are poor also! Extremely long hours and overtime expected on a whim!"
bad,"Traditional growth models are under pressure. Yet the investment industry is optimistic. In an environment of profound change,"
bad,"The management is clueless.  They have no idea how to work with people.  If you kiss their a** you were in.  They only like ""Yes"" man.  Otherwise your opinion doesn't mean anything"
bad,"The team has an old way to do things, everything had to be done manually. Management blamed associates for their mistakes and for being late with reports. "
bad,One of the most screwed up places I've ever worked. Too many vertical silos. Management painfully unaware of anything. They just grind people down and work them to death. I would not recommend working here.
bad,"Management is too bureaucratic to do anything. The only thing people care about is their pay check here. Speaking of paycheck, new hires get paid peanuts."
bad,"This is a company where employees are manipulated in order to minimize costs.  "
bad,When I first started working at State Street it was a great company to work at and during the past 10 years things changed.  The company would lay off people and then expect others to pick up the work.  Long hours were expected of management.
bad,"worst managers ever, think of bad manager you had and its worst than that, the have no incentive to teach you anything. The manager that you report to is not available and you are told report to someone else every week. I worked as fund accountant and the software would go down literary every day."
bad,"poor management"
bad,"extreme lack of commitment and work ethic by a majority of those who worked there with a strong desire to not do work. Low pay and a lack of company culture. This is a good job for someone who wants to do a boring job, and wants to not do much work. If you want to be efficient and challenged, this is not the place for you"
bad,"Very low level job out of college.  ""Account"" for income and expenses of mutual funds.  Was basically just a reconciliation.  Culture was...you are a number."
bad,"extremely high turnover"
bad,Working at State Street have been very negative experience.
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
bad,"Tons of works and over times. not even be able to have a lunch before 3 pm on daily basis. constant management level changes, people overall not intend to stay."
bad,Not a company that acknowledges there employees and promotes them to do better. Under paid and over worked. Unprofessional managers who need management training. Horrible hours expected to work including holiday's.
bad,"I will not recommend anyone to work for State Street, it is very well known a sweat shop, with very low pay and heavy workload."
bad,"Has the potential to be a great place to work. With the views of management though, you really are just a number, there to churn out the work no matter what."
bad,It was a awsome place to work where I learned a lot. It was a good place to start your career and build your knowledge base about the financial industry.
bad,"This is an American company and when I apply to their firm I can't seem to get their pages to translate to English. Everything is in French, never seen anything like it and I have been applying for months. I was so frustrated trying to simply submit an application that I had to come leave a review, it's absolutely crazy. How terrible is this company if simply submitting an application through their god awful website is this difficult."
bad,They are hiring Sr Managers that have only a GED.  It's hard to explain to someone that does not understand the concepts.  They need a serious overhaul and get the right talent in place.  They just continue to make bad decisions and are years from getting themselves out the hole they have dug.
bad,"It's an alternative environment, check linked in for the pictures of the people you will be working for."
bad,Not a positive place to work. High turn over and they outsource consistently. you would feel everyday could be your last day working there. If you are lucky you would find a good management but majority is poor.
bad,"Major International Investment Banker."
bad,This place is terrible and stay away if you want a meaningful career. They lay people off every Wednesday so job security is extremely low. Good luck if you choose to work here
bad,"My job consists of being an initial point of contact for the client. I am involved in new client setups, deconversions, answering audit questions, and problem resolution."
bad,"This is a horrible place to work. Senior management knows there are limited employment opportunities in Massachusetts that will pay comparable to this company. Everyone at the top knows all your law enforcement, legal, and any other people that are in decision making capacities within Massachusetts. Your best bet is to go in, keep your head down and go out. Don't talk to anyone. This company ruins lives, is very alternative and is, all- in- all, a disgusting place to work. It is literally H E double L on earth. The cheerleaders you see in there today will regret the day they ever supported such a horrible company."
bad,"Working at State Street was by far my worst employment experience. I never worked less than 60 hours a week, was always expected to be on call, and when I discussed needing a better work-life balance was told I was a complainer. I know it is tempting to apply for a job there because they have so many openings- but the only reason they have these openings is because they turn over employees like crazy."
bad,"They are constantly laying people off."
bad,"STATE STREET CORPORATION is a world wide financial services servicing company. The days are extraordinarily long as you are dependent on world wide markets closing. Many people are recruited from sports out of college, pro's and semi-pros and run around the office all day, every day, for years. There is an extremely uncomfortable alternative feeling in the office. Honestly, I haven't wanted to step foot in an office, or anywhere for that matter once I left. Avoid, avoid, avoid."
bad,"Some hired a new manager and knows nothing about what our jobs and how we do things to get it done. Instead, they rely on others who knows the answers before they go into a management meeting. Most meetings do not accomplish much, just talk in our group."
bad,"this was a horrible company to work for. horrible management, horrible pay. everyone in the department including managers hated the job and the people there. it was so miserable to be there. the hours were terrible, most departments were understaffed and certainly underpaid."
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
bad,"This company was my third stop in banking/financial services. For me, this was absolutely the most horrible place to work. Not sure if it's because by the time I got here, my eyes were not as wide open as when I first started working. They hire management with families, so it''s hard to really trust anyone seeing the obvious motives behind their actions."
bad,"I'm on Indeed often. I see the same Accounting Associate position advertised over and over.  "
bad,You are set up for a big career failure. people yell and scream at you all day. please contact me if you agree in the forums.
bad,Horrible company to work for in the financial industry. Disturbing the way they treat people of color there. I would never recommend working there to anyone of any race.
bad,"The Quincy office in particular, is  pretty miserable place to work.  Poor benefits and lack of opportunities for advancement within the company."
bad,"basically slave labor.  low pay, long hours, no advancement.  If you get a job offer run don't walk away from the opportunity"
bad,The company treats the employees with no respect or appreciation. They will work you to the ground.
bad,"I was there for five years. Management couldn't decide what they wanted me to do after I started - I was told I would be doing something completely different when I interviewed. The lay-off cycles were frequent - lost my manager and close co-workers to lay-offs. Had about 7 different managers in 5 years. Managers are extremely paranoid about looking bad and getting laid-off. Maybe OK to get some experience under your belt if you're coming out of college - otherwise, stay away."
bad,If you like to work 80 hours a week. If you like to work until midnight consistently or if you like to work weekends also this is the place for you.
bad,"Worst place to work of all time, terrible people, terrible organization you name it . ."
bad,"State Street exists on the backs of college graduates who don't know any better. If you have any experience or brains, you won't last long at this company. Also, homophobia, racism, and overall ignorance run rampant."
bad,"Management is not empowered, people have to escalate even the smallest decisions for approval. Never work in a department where your manager held your job previously."
bad,"After the whole laying people off and staying at this company we have had so much work handed over to us. No raise in a few years work from home is slowly stopping. After years of working for this company, I realize they don’t care about their employees. They won’t promote you, they will not do a thing for you but expect everything from you. A guy quits ok cool let’s split his work among the team. It’s a joke. Leaving this place was the best choice I’ve ever made."
bad,Good starter job.  High turnover rates.  Management was variable.  Workplace culture was a typical office environment.  Pay was mediocre at best.  Learned a lot about finance.
bad,"Highly political, inexperienced management, nasty culture. Below average comp. Not a meritocracy. A lot of overweight white men running the business, more concerned about protecting their role than advancing the company. The co is circling the drain. It’s the Titantic."
bad,State Street is your place if you like to be over worked and reminded that you should be happy to have a job.  A place that does not care about it's employee's work life balance.
bad,"State Street is the typical run of the mill corporation. You are just a number. 5 years and have nothing to show for it. No promotional opportunities unless you move to another department. Managers are either never around or are too busy and goofing off to help you. Work loads have increased as the hiring freeze continues and people have quit."
bad,"Working in securities valuation (pricing) at State Street is great for anyone who does not value moving up. The work is consistent and the pay is decent considering the work and responsibility you are given. The workload is light for most of the day, and they are lenient with how much downtime you have, as well as how you use it. Perfect job for college students, but anyone seeking gainful full-time employment must prepare for almost no opportunity for advancement beyond the starting position. Management is essentially absent for most of the day until peak hours begin, in which management monitors every click. High capacity to multitask is a must as you will be expected to complete at least 2 to 3 tasks simultaneously for several hours during peak business hours."
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
bad,Beware! The company is moving jobs over to India to save money. And with that they are laying employees off left and right. The vastly underpay employees versus rival companies. They do offer work from home but that was the only positive thing about the job.
bad,"Pay is much lower than industry average, you will be better off doing the same amount of work elsewhere."
bad,"Great benefits around tuition reimbursement, family caregiver leave, fertility treatments and adoption. State Street boasts work-life balance, but it depends on which group you are in. Many groups do not allow regular work from home, require long nights and weekends, and continue to pile more work on without rewarding their employees. Great amount of vacation time, but it is hard to get time approved off when you actually want to use it."
bad,"I worked there 2 years and asked for a promotion/raise and never received either. A white male started, who I TRAINED, and received a promotion becoming my superior in less than a year. Even after the promotion he'd still come to me with questions. The position was kept a secret, never giving me an opportunity. If I was white or a male I believe it would've been a completely different situation."
bad,"Senior management has no idea what they are doing and has absolutely zero invested in State Street's people.  Annual incentives became the annual joke amongst everyone I worked with.  With the company saving a fortune offshoring funds to tax havens and offshoring jobs to India, employees saw none of those savings or profits come back.  They have drastically cut out bonuses, raises and incentives and are investing into technology and India.  They are leaning heavily on the employees who are working long hours to help the company get there so that when they do, they can replace you with technology or move your job to India."
bad,"the hours are long & the benefits are not good. there is not a good work/life balance. The departments change locations, so it is often difficult to transfer to if the commute is cumbersome."
bad,The Kansas city office is a joke.  They outsource all of the operations off shore to India and the Philippines and do not hold these people accountable.  The management team does not understand the business they are in it is awful.  All they want to do is cut expenses.
bad,so a typical day could be 830am until 10pm often packing up at 6pm and then told to stay in case needed. so often there until 10pm or later.. only stayed for 9 months as the lack of balance was not for me.
bad,"Culture filled with in-fighting, turf wars, and political back stabbing like you've never seen. Beware of recruiters who are great sales people for a lousy product."
bad,"Good place to start your career, but if you stay too long, you will see that the salary raises are minimal, bonuses are not great and promotions take a long time.  Bottom line, expect to work very long hours for low pay and the compensation isn't great."
bad,Working for SSGS has been the worst experience of my life.  Their is absolutely no sense of team cohesiveness and management fails to take any responsibility for any issues within the job.
bad,"Stay away if you value your time, sanity, or money."
bad,I have worked at State Street for over 8 years and have met a lot of great mentors and have learned a tremendous amount about the Financial Services industry.
bad,The job culture there is impersonal. It's a factory.There is no job security and everyone is looking out only for themselves. Nobody should be there for more than 2 years.
bad,It is only good for fresh graduates to get some experience right out of college. The company doesn't treat employees well. upper management team doesn't care that much.
bad,"They had horrible management - my manager didn't even try/ nor bother to remember or correctly pronounce my name. Additionally, my office had a system which checks for transactional errors, understandable, however the company did not have any resources to help employees improve, and thus, everyone worked with a perpetual state of fear of getting errors. Interns were constantly moved in and about departments due to shortages, without their consultation, they would then be expected to learn the operational processes of their new department, in little time mind you, to work efficiently somehow."
bad,"this is a sweatshop environment for preparing public financial statements and performing quality review."
bad,"Between offshoring, upper management that doesn't care and think we're all idiots, advancement being nearly impossible, and benefits withering every year, it's easy for me to advise staying away from this company. I had four internships before working here in four different departments in two different locations and each time I got one piece of common advice: Don't work for State Street. After working hear for nearly five years, I would offer that same piece of advice."
bad,There is a reason this job is posted often. Beware of management. The job is a dead end and unprofessional. Very stressful micromanaging environment and should be avoided.
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
bad,"If you like button pushing and not having to think, this is the job for you. If you ask why a process is done a certain way, you won't get an answer. They want to you follow the directions and not ask questions. You're not there to be a thinker, you're there to get the job done, and get it done quickly."
bad,"A very competitive place to work, that has a mix of good opportunities and unfortunate ones. Some areas are plagued by poor management and budgeting which to poor morale."
bad,"Teams are constantly working under pressure, teams are understaffed. the company stopped tuition reimbursement, introduced only high deductible health plan. constant downsizing and offshoring brings a lot of stress on the employees. I am long enough within the company but company still thinks it is ""OK"" to pay 40,000 per year to the person who works already 10 years. People who just enter the company getting paid around 43,000 even more than people who are very loyal to the company"
bad,Management doesn't clarify job specifics to well.  I learned how to designed websites and other minimal tasks I've never had to do before.  My co-workers are great the management team needs some help.
bad,I have worked here for 20+ years but in the past year I have never been so overworked and underappreciated.  I work weekends and 16 hour days and am talked down to and treated with no respect.
bad,I would not recommend working at State Street. The management and work life balance is non existent.I found management to be unapproachable and condescending.
bad,"The Way A Head, is the Way A Head. We all seek to understand the Way A Head."
bad,I see things that say State Street is a great place to work.  That must be the PR people that are saying that.  State Street reduces the workforce about twice a year and have sent most entry level jobs to India.  How is this helping our economy recover??  The people that are left either have no clue what they are doing besides hitting buttons or don't care.  People are overworked and have no life outside of work.  The people I work with work nights and weekends and this is normal and expected because they have to redo the work done by India if they want to keep having a paycheck.  
bad,"State Street was my third, and final stop, within Financial Services. I applied to be a pricing associate and was offered the position of Officer within a Fund Accounting group. The group I was assigned to was riddled with errors, and I was forced to independently seek out a business analyst to develop automated tools that would assist in precluding these errors. Once this was done, it was an over-staffed group of people with nothing to do all day but annoy one another and wait for daily work to arrive. Senior management was extremely ""bright-eyed"" and most came from Hockey teams. I suppose they provided the muscle, but overall I wouldn't recommend this company to my worst enemy. After sitting in long meetings with consultants examing the business, we were forced to execute two rounds of layoffs, with my layoff happening in the third round. It's a people machine, with not an iota of loyalty. Long hours, no work life balance."
bad,Expectations don't even come close to the compensation. Very little support. Ability to work form home is great until you are expected to be able to work at any hour of the day.
bad,"No raise in seven years unless promoted, consistently understaffed, rude coworkers and officers.  Upper management is great but can only do so much.  Vacation time is good but can't use it when you want due to staffing issues."
bad,"Staff crunch"
bad,"culture is horrible"
bad,There is constant change and a need to be prepared to drop what you are doing and change gears at the drop of  a hat. This can be challenging to continually adapt to.
bad,With the looming hiring freeze and overwhelming amount of layoffs this year I would steer clear. While competitors are ramping up hiring State Street is doing the opposite. The engineering teams are promised staff and capital while just the opposite is happening. Not the right move for engineers. Jobs are being offshored at an alarming rate.
bad,"State Street has become an organisation totally focussed on cost reduction. In Europe there has been a large amount of offshoring of work to staff in Poland and Asia. In addition there have been a large reduction in headcount but the expectation of management is that the remaining staff will deliver the same amount of work with less resource. This has created a highly stressful environment with staff constantly on the look out for other roles. "
bad,"I learned a great deal about Custody banking working there."
bad,The company is very successful but the transaction services side of the industry is moving toward an automated model and away from an employee based service.
bad,"It used to be a fairly good place to work, but constant cost cutting has only lead to the flight of top talent and layoffs for those who chose to stay.  I understand the need to control costs, but there really is a limit to the number of people who you let go before it starts to directly impact the client experience"
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
bad,The issue with State Street is that they're under staffed and they'd rather leave people of color or better yet minorities in roles for years while promoting everyone around them.
bad,"There are more exciting challenges out there and companies who treat and pay their employees much better.                              "
bad,"no advancement, not enough people coverage work, poor environment. lay off people. not recommend for people come here to work. tight deadline with less coverage"
bad,"This is one of the worst places to work if you're an Information Technology person. The company doesn't care enough about technology to spend the money necessary to do what needs to be done and NOTHING is more important than the bottom line. That means that no innovation takes place and no matter how good your ideas are, if the business doesn't see a profit number at the end of the project then they won't do it. The workplace culture is cutthroat and the only way to advance is to attach yourself to the right people. Thus the name of the game is not merit, it's office politics. Play the game right and you advance. Make the wrong political move and you'll go nowhere."
bad,Employees are not valued.  Upper management is out of touch with the needs of the business units.  Employees are laid off the last Wednesday of every month.  It creates a poor environment.
bad,"Over worked for no money. Managers were selective on who they liked more and gave special treatment to. I was there over 3 years and they gave me work of a person who got paid more than me but did not want to promote me. They show no compassion or interest in their employees, no type of appreciation what so ever. The only positive was the four week paid vacation time for full timers."
bad,"I was approached for a role in August 2016 and signed the contract for a contractual role at this stage.  Starting the role in September, I had 2 weeks in the role before this moved to Poland.  From this point onweards until the end of February, I was used in a ad-hoc project support role, where I was given practically no work."
bad,Culture of fear. Top performers are constantly laid off. People are so overworked that there is no time to foster healthy relationships with colleagues.
bad,"Having been employed by PFPC, BNY Mellon, Northern Trust, JP Morgan and IFS Statestreet, I can safely say that IFS is the worst Fund Admin company I have worked for. No work life balance, never ending workloads and overtime, and they push employment laws to the limit. High staff turnover, people just walking out, refusing to work notice periods, and high absenteeism are the result."
bad,Lots of re-organixation is going on @ SSgA & Lay-off's are happening all the time.
bad,Stock price driven focus.  Layoffs are ongoing and won't stop. Staff and resources being cut both onshore and offshore.  US jobs are being pushed offshore.
bad,"No effort whatsoever is being made to eliminate glut & inefficiency.  They demand highly qualified & certified workers, then just have them push paper all day, and give them a paper pusher's salary.  Expect any ideas you have to get quashed by their need to please auditors & regulators. BEWARE of the smaller building in Quincy, (Josiah Quincy Building). Just about every day, something in the building is broken, be it an elevator, a toilet, or a doorknob.  The cafeteria is comparable in quality to a prison canteen - everything is frozen & reheated, bland and mushy, and the packaged food is sometimes expired.  My coworkers have gotten sick from eating the food.  If you are fortunate enough to be working at the nice building, don't get comfortable, I guarantee it's only a matter of time before they lease out your floor and move you to the outskirts.  Hiring freeze means don't get your hopes up for career advancement, and annual raises aren't guaranteed, even if your performance is phenomenal.  Good way to buff up your resume, but when your gut tells you that you've reached a dead end in your advancement, believe it and get out."
bad,"With never ending layoffs, deteriorating benefits, and little to no pay raises State Street has sadly become a company people are running from. Senior management has run it into the ground"
bad,All they care about is cutting cost. The main way they are doing this is sending all the jobs to India. Not a terrible place to start out of college but don't stop looking for a job once you start here.
bad,"There are smart talented people at state street the division that I was in had a very negative culture meaning they would demean the company almost as if it were a joke."
bad,"learn how money gets moved around."
bad,"not a great company hard to advance management was poor and very cut throat. great building and experience but the cultures was negative, overall bad culture"
bad,"Long hours, boring tasks, only time you ever hear from management is when they are berating you for doing something wrong.The skills that you learn are very specific to the job that you do and are not really transferable to other jobs."
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
bad,"Horrible work hours, management and attitude to workers. Stressful for the sake it, work throughput would be a lot better if they maintained a happier workforce. Procedural documents only upside."
bad,I learned how hard it is to start a business with allot of turn over. I worked my but off every day with my team and loved my team! i worked at a fast pace and it was great. but i was not treated as an equal by the management because i was young.
bad,Long hours and little pay. They over work you and your job is never secure. Company is in a transition and roles are changing. Their business model seems more like an assembly line because you do one thing over and over again rather then learn different aspects of the bank at once.
bad,Its a big game of who can do the least amount of work. If you are ambitious and want to advance your career quickly this is not the place for you. Its more about teaching you the right buttons to press to get your work done rather then why you are pressing those buttons. It's a stable job that pays a little more than minimum wage that teaches you basics of finance that you will be able to take with you to your next job. 
bad,"Outsourcing and lay off kingdom - I think that describes the culture the best.  Also, an interesting fact that in this firm there is a greatest divide between employee and CEO pay in the Boston area."
bad,"Constant layoffs and outsourcing, terrible work environment. They try to cover up the mess with a faux pro-corporate attitude. Individual employees are not valued, only seen as a number."
bad,Very old fashioned working atmosphere to match outdated technology from the 1970s that is still inexplicably in use. Extremely inefficient environment with a reluctance for real change.
bad,Leadership is terrible and it is cheap company.  There are no perks of any kind.  The Healthcare is extremely expensive for such a large company.  There is not set roles.
bad,"It's not a good place to work.  They pay well, and they have to, in order to retain any talent.  Projects seem to be put together piecemeal, and there are lots of interdepartmental conflicts that make it difficult to improve the situation."
bad,"Good place to start career, hard work, learn lots of valuable skills for pursuing career in finance"
bad,Not challenging enough. As an intern i was doing the exact same tasks as the rest of the people on the team. They call it slave street for a reason. Everyone just does their tasks and leaves. boring place
bad,"Was not a fan, did not have very much to do, everyone worked from home and was not willing to help..manager was nice but did not provide any feedback to employees"
bad,"Typical Day- Waited on management to decide what diection they wanted to take, as nobody could decide."
bad,Once you think you have found a career at State Street they get rid of you. There is no job security and once you are gone they are as unhelpful as when you are there. The HR department is no there to help the employee but to cover Statestreet only.
bad,"State Street is overly focused on controlling costs. This means constant lay-offs and zero advancement. My last 6 years there I had no raise and a dwindling bonus in spite of good performance reviews. My friends who did get promoted, did not get additional salary - only additional work. As they lay people off, the remaining employees are expected to pick up the work without any additional compensation. The effect on moral was significant. However, the benefits were very good and I really enjoyed working with the other employees there."
bad,"State Street's Atlanta office does a poor job of giving its employees career advancement opportunities.  Some people are lucky and are placed on a growing client or on a team that has a number of managerial-level people quit.  Others regardless of work performance can get stuck at the some position for 5, 6, or even 7+ years.  There are a number of people in the office I have seen this happen to.  What is even more alarming is that the office is growing and getting new business and not losing much business.  When there is a new client, State Street hires someone from outside the company rather than find a way to promote a current employee.  For example, they do not even move a current manager over to a new client so that an associate can move up to a manager position while still be familiar with that same client."
bad,"All was well for me at State Street once I found the right department. I worked late hours and sometimes took work home. But things changed when I had to take custody of a child and care for them. Even though I still offered to work from home. I had to leave by a certain time to pick the child up from after care and was told that I could not work from home to make up this time lost. Causing my pay to be reduced and was still expected to work from home for free. I became pregnant and was having pregnancy complications from riding the train for long periods of time with no seat. I was denied work from home option, even though it was available in my unit. I ended up quitting and starting my own business. It was a horrible experience."
bad,"Changement de postes tous les 2 ans, mobilité interne possible après transfert et offshoring de mes activités. Cela m'a permis de travailler ma capacité à m'adapter rapidement à un environnement de travail mouvant. Et d'acquérir de multiples compétences en peu d'années."
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
bad,"I logged in to all systems, did my everyday work and was encouraged to ""learn more."" If you can work at home, they can outsource your job to India. Co-workers and management were kind and helpful. The hardest part of the job was processing my accounts on both the Putnam systems and the State Street Corporation for conversion but working with my co-workers made it bearable."
bad,"Do not work here unless you have no other options. If so, leave when you can. This place will make you gain 30 pounds, go bald, feel indifferent towards the world, lose your passion about anything/everything,  make you develop a cough, think its acceptable to wear running sneakers to work, and hope for cancer."
bad,"The company is highly focused on cutting expenses and heavy on offshoring.  Even though the people who work there are great but every one is overworked and stressed out.  "
bad,"Nessuna possibilita' di crescita professionale, no meritocrazia."
bad,"Learned a lot in State Street. Every day was a new challenge which was good. The people and management were great, great work life balance, but Financial Services industry is drastically changing"
bad,"They post and even often positions then do not hire. "
bad,Management at State Street was very passive aggressive and instead of confronting employees and building relationships they would patrol up and down the hallway staring down every employee.
bad,"... as with any company, management can make or break it, and they broke it.  They began to listen to the loudest voice(s) in the room instead of the right voice(s)."
bad,"The salary is low and stays low no matter how hard you work. The work increases each day with more and more responsibilities. Your schedule is always the same, no flexibility."
bad,"Environment and the work-life balance are very difficult. The people I worked with were solid, and my business unit team was strong. Not comfortable adding more data or information to this field."
bad,"worked with large pension funds and processed their daily trade volume.  Followed up with any trade breaks until settlement."
bad,I worked at Statestreet for many years and everyday was a new learning experience for me.   I enjoyed helping my clients resolve any issues they might have had.   My co-workers were all hard workers and I enjoyed working with them.  We were all team players and helped each other when necessary.
bad,"State Street is a good company to gain experience, however, large disconnect between management and employees.  Salary is 20% below industry average and promotions are rewarded through tenure not performance baed.  Employees' tend to share negative attitudes, dress like slobs which breeds a poor working environment.  Outside of that plenty of down time and hardly will you see anyone working overtime."
bad,"•	Liaison between the group’s client, Eaton Vance Management, and other groups within State Street including Global Custody, Core Accounting, Trade Processing, Corporate Action Processing, and Internal Audit"
bad,"I began my career at State Street, coming straight out of college, I had no idea of what to expect."
bad,"Management is very bossy and they never mingle with employees and no proper interaction and they lack knowledge and try to defend them self."
bad,"A company that will make you work like a slave with very little room for growth."
bad,Most horrible experience. They did not train me on anyhting and overworked me. They were not fair and very biased. I was new so i kept taking extra load.
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
bad,"Not the best place to begin a career - stale, outmoded technology. Great that it is located in Boston and has good work from home and flexibility options."
bad,"At least in fund accounting, they squeeze you until you're doing absolute most work possible, working constant overtime.  Turnover is high, so only people scared of the labor market or complete vegetables stay.  They get promoted and eventually become managers, etc. etc. You have nothing but young guys looking to get out and old bitter losers around you."
bad,State Street employees should implement organization's philosophy.
bad,Not great.  Management is not very helpful.  A lot of layoffs and the culture is pretty bad.
bad,"OK. Coworkers are good. Not much else."
bad,Jobs are constantly outsourced. Pay and benefits are low. There are a lot of work to do and we are expected to work more than our job description. The teams within StateStreet did not work well together.
bad,"This company has terrible management. There is a massive lack of training which leaves you struggling, stressed and angered. Furthermore, if you attempt to ask questions you are more likely than not going to be belittled. Turnover is extremely high due to lack of training, inconsistency of rules and the incompetence of others you have to interact with throughout the company."
bad,Management is very poor and they only care about the bottom line. The environment is not good and the benefits are not the great.  They expect to work long hours with no or little pay.
bad,"After working for this company in Fund Administration and Financial reporting, I have seen a deterioration of culture, benefits, job security and a treatment of employees. You are expected to pick up more work than is possible to complete in an 10 hour day, you are also expected to learn things on your own because no one has time to show you anything. Most of the good and experienced managers have been let go, leaving behind mostly bad managers who demean and threaten to fire people if they do not complete the work with little or no overtime. Work is constantly being off shored to India and you are also expected to provide training and clean up work done by the of shore team. Ultimately most of the work will be done in India so there will be no opportunity for advancement."
bad,It is a good entry level job when you graduate from school and want to enter the financial services business. Work is repetitive and work load continues to increase. Low compensation and no clear evidence of any advancement opportunities.
bad,I am not comfortable relaying this information and this should not be required. This is terrible policy for your site and should not be a required field. Please have your user experience be reevaluated.
bad,The company workplace culture is very old school. Sitting in meetings writing notes on a piece of paper. No laptops for employees which also makes difficult to schedule meetings if working remotely. Late sittings in office trying to show management how hard everyone is working.
bad,"No support from manager."
bad,"I would not recommend this place. No life work balance at all. Th company' sr management  is becoming so greedy about money. Employees are their least concern. The constant changes  in the past three years have exhausted people. And it continues. By 2020, the company's goal is to lay off 7000 employees. The new policy is if you lose two employees you can hire one back. That means the workload is unreasonable heavy. Plus the company 's strategy is to shift everything possible to India which is low cost center, you will have to deal with India with a different time zone and culture all the time. Everything makes it a very bad work place."
bad,This is an extremely large company that gives people fresh out of college an opportunity. The downside to this is the extremely low pay -- someone I knew worked at the company 7 years before I was hired and had the exact same base pay.
bad,"In my time at State Street it has been anything but fun.  You are expected to work a great deal of hours with little recognition, advancement or pay increases. The only positive is Senior Associates now are eligible for overtime.  Company does not recognize hard work promotes a culture of ""good old boys"". I transferred from one team to another with no pay increase and was not given a merit from the new team either, It made going on two years with no pay raise.  Managers are out for themselves and have little or no interest in developing their associates. Training is poor also, only do power point slides and expect you to be an expert right after it.  The positive is the closeness of many team members and learning about hedge funds."
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
bad,"never know when you'll go home for the day, low staffed. The people who work there are the best, but unfortunately the regime has ran this place into the ground"
bad,"What can I say?  They hire anyone willing, squeeze them out, pay a very low salary, make them feel like every $5K increase every level of promotion (which is hard to earn) is a huge deal, in my case also tell you your job is safe, make you train on a new system for a year, then declare that the entire 300 people office is being closed and offer to move hundreds of miles away to Boston (which is twice as expensive) with the same salary.  High employee turnover sweatshop, they only retain people without a will who are afraid to go out into the job market and people who honestly don't know what they're doing and most time don't care."
bad,management is not understanding at all..very high turn over. no body cares if you leave or join...very selfish attitude. Just keep working. management runs on favoritism.
bad,"tough environment, lack of management committment to a new business. very had to work without clear and communicated direction."
bad,SS is geared towards those who like to work 24/7 and enjoy being at work more than home.  The work/life balance is not the best.
bad,"A typical day is 90% daily, repetitive tasks. These are done for the same time every day, and becomes mind numbing after a few months. whenever you have a free second, you can look into inquiries sent by other teams or external clients to keep yourself busy. You will get a basic idea of trade settlements, reconciliation of funds, some basic accounting entries. Do not expect a formal classroom environment as everything is learned on the job. In other words, the amount of things you learn are dependent on your initiative, and there is no emphasis on learning how your work relates to the other departments, or ""centers of excellence"". Management is extremely nonchalant about  employee retention. You can do the bare minimum, or work 10-12 hours a day, there is no guarantee you will earn a promotion. Furthermore, the turnover rate in the department is extremely high, most people leave as soon as they get to a year, and management does not hire anyone to replace the exiting associates, leaving fewer people with more work. I'm honestly surprised the department is still functioning with the skeleton staff left. Also, there is an unhealthy reliance on interns to avoid hiring FT staff. The staff tends to be fresh college grads and a mix for the interns. The most difficult part of the job is trying to resolve exceptions that you have not caused, but somehow is your responsiblity to fix. The most enjoyable part of the job is once you know how your processing is done, the days go by smoothly."
bad,"I think that State Street is a good place for someone who would like to get their foot in the door in the industry. Many employees can work from home a few days a week if their responsibilities allow them to. Unfortunately, moving up and increasing your role and compensation at State Street is very hard and most employees  to want to leave."
bad,Great entry level job. The talent tends to leave after a few years due to job satisfaction. In the right situation the management is very good but you could get stuck in a bad group. Too much favoritism with the management team. Benefits are decent but far from good. Co-workers are the reason why most stay around longer.
bad,"Compensation is low, but they try to make it up with a flexible benefit package but even that isn't what it was a few years ago. Seems like they are always firing people, so not a lot of job security especially for a woman."
bad,The company is in an identity crisis. The sole focus of senior management is transforming the business to generate revenue and cut costs by any means.
bad,I was working there for allied universal at state street.The guys incharge of the security they act like that is owned the company not enough workers to do the job.
bad,"nessuna possibilità di carriera, ambiente lavorativo poco stimolante"
bad,"Lack of trust in Management Decision and lack of transparency. Difference of opinion among management. Micromanagement and adverse to CAPTIVE culture,"
bad,"Every year SSGA introduces a new theme for continuous improvement.  Employees were introduced to Lean, Kanban, Scrum, DevOps and Design Thinking.  Despite the methodical progression in training and themes, the organization is slow to embrace those principles and practices."
bad,"Not one of the top tier banks.  College education is not a requirement. Does not invest in technology. The pay is somewhat  low. "
bad,"State Street is buffeted by the industry headwinds of shrinking fees, commoditization and a disinterested workforce.  Mid to senior levels of compensation are deferred over 4 years (not the industry norm) thereby making it difficult for employees to leave.  This greatly impacts the culture and the quality of talent that can be recruited."
bad,There are many people leaving the company on their own accord and many others being laid off. This is not an ideal place to work but it did give me an interesting insight into the finance.
bad,"Took 2 weeks to conclude a very surreptitious and guarded security onboarding process; took 4 weeks to have ID issued; took 6 weeks to have time-entry profiles (3!) set up... very much focused on the state of the individual's status in the organization, and little-to-no focus on what work to be done!"
bad,"That is pretty much the only perk. The long hours and low pay make it only a stepping stone to a better company. Working hard does not get you ahead, just outlasting the rest of the people does."
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
bad,"Senior management continues to break what were client service groups down into smaller and smaller sub-groups.  The constantly increasing number of overseas employees, know only what their job script tells them, makes communication and expedience VERY challenging in a career where there are constant deadlines.  At a certain point (senior management never discloses the point) salaries plateau."
bad,"Okay for a short term, or bridge to the next job, but I wouldn't make it a career. My team was good, but the office feels like a prison: no wifi, tons of blocked sites, no perks or amenities that appeal to today's millennial workers. If you want to treat your employees like children, don't expect to retain top talent ever. Work is not challenging and can become monotonous. After several months, you become apathetic towards your job. Again, okay if you are in a pinch, but wouldn't stay more than a year."
bad,Data entry job showing colours by giveng opportunity to go for us or UK for 15 days and ask to sign bond for one year ! If you looking for stable job.. this place is not good.. this is only for KYC shared services
bad,"Things aren't communicated down from the higher levels, employees are left in the dark with questions unanswered. If you want something done, you will be wasting your time."
bad,"currently employed as a contractor (sub) to IT contract holder (IBM) for State Street Bank. As a contractor to the contractor, for customer - State Street Bank extra care is used to ensure no miscommunication exists between client and contract holder."
bad,I worked at State Street full time for years and there is no opportunity for career progression.  The processes are dated.  I wouldn't recommend working in this company
bad,I've been working full time for a little over a year and a half now and would really not recommend this company to anyone. There is hardly any finnacial recognition for hard and promotions are scarce. They really expect a lot out of you when they pay relatively low.
bad,Every place has its good and bad. You will just need to find out for yourself. Almost 10 years and no movement. Im ready to leave for something different
bad,Aside from the name of the company State Street employees have a narrow workspace and the options for advancement and improvement in ones own career are nil
bad,a lot of work needs to be done. They need to hire better managers and be more confident in the staff.
bad,Learnt a lot while working at Statestreet. But the support from management could have been better.
bad,"Unethical leadership. Managers that do not know how to lead or manage. Entire workforce is miserable. Job and stability don't belong in the same sentence. Management's attitude: ""We pay you for 40 hours, but expect you to work 55. You can thank us later for being employed."""
bad,Politics rule the Project Management Office.  You can't have a successful project completed on time and on budget when project team members are producing below average work months behind schedule and have no accountability for that work.  Open communication and transparency are not a high priority for the PMO office.
bad,State Street is outsourcing as many jobs as possible. Very little job security. Toxic work environment. Lots of unhappy employees. No raises. Lousy health insurance. Managers are instructed to lie to employees. The company has very little respect for employees. Profits are put before everything including quality.
bad,"State Street is going through a difficult phase right now.  Many layoffs have occurred which leaves departments void of proper expertise to do the work.  New positions are either college interns or offshore full time positions.  The moral is poor right now with no budget or encouragement from senior management to stick with the company and help to participate in its recovery.  Teams are asked to put in more hours but not compensated for their efforts (i.e. merit increase or bonus).  Employees are hard working and show good collaboration and teamwork but management is below expectations for a once great company."
bad,"They are undergoing a transformation towards more outsourcing, do not recommend working here.  There are constantly layoffs, negative news and many manager there that do not care (my direct one was not one of them, but there were plenty).  Also got the sense upper management did not care about the people that did the work.  There are better places to work than here, steer clear."
bad,Morale of the department I was in got worse and worse with each organizational structure and round of layoffs each year. The work is either mindless where people will be processing pressing buttons. If you are smart then watch out because you will be given work in which you will need to think plus a bunch of mindless work because they will pile it on until you leave.
bad,"Ineffective use of senior personnel time in meetings and meetings to prepare for meetings"
bad,"Very poor management and even worst infrastructure. Management has no clue how the system works and how to handle situations. New and innovative ideas are not welcomed at all rather you are forced to follow the process that is dictated by management."
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
bad,Not a collaborative environment. Work is done in silos. Technology is behind. Not opened to process improvement. Hard to navigate through the organization. Limited job advancement.
bad,Place is ok and the pay isn't that good but it's a job.  You work alot of hours and management doesn't know what they are doing.  If you need a job they are always hiring
bad,"At the beginning I was OK with working on my own initiative but"
bad,"unreasonable deadlines"
bad,"open work environment with flexibility to work from home, good place to gain industry experience. High staff turnover, long hours for some positions no overtime pay."
bad,"Be ready to sumerge yourself in a lot of work that leads nowhere. Systems are proprietary, so there's very little you can take with you when you leave. The Center of Excellence Business model makes it difficult for you to get a 360 degree view of your work, as you would be doing the same tasks repeatedly. It's a decent place to work, but not a place to develop one's career. I've seen some of the most talented young people lose their edge after working at ""Slave Street"" for a few years. Stay informed and choose wisely!"
bad,"This company continues to lay off people.  So not very good to work there.  If you could, find some place else to work and you will have more job security and work-life balance."
bad,This is a job. That's all. No career made here. The one plus here is that it can give you some great buzzwords to hook on your resume when searching for a new place to get into a career.
bad,You will have the opportunity to be exposed to many different aspects of the business. The problem is that you will have no life and not chance to do anything other than work. They also underpay you tremendously.
bad,"In my role, things are very fast pace and high pressure.  You learn a ton in your first few years, but given the environment we're currently in, it's not a great place to be.  Legacy initiatives has destroyed teams and pushed out key employees that held legacy knowledge and skill sets.  Skills don't always rise you to the top, often times it's ""who you know"" which gets to be very frustrating.  Management moves slow when things could move fast to help teams be successful, and they move fast when clients are at risk.  With a little foresight, lots of ""issues"" could be mitigated, but they aren't.  Lots of proprietary organizational acronyms that have to be learned, State Street has a way of complicating things in this light for no reason.  Other teams look down on you if you don't understand the lingo as if you don't know what you're doing.  Lots of office politics, people talk, there's nothing you can do about it."
bad,"Other departments are probably different, but this review strictly refers to financial reporting/fund administration. "
bad,"Good place to start if you're getting into finance/accounting, but promotion and wage increase does not really happen. The work load is torturous and not worth the little pay you receive. Only the older folk are willing to stay there longer as they are settled in, all the younger people are clawing to get out of there. Hours can get ridiculous with very little chance of recognition."
bad,"The fund management company with global presence, badly management when it come to staff, unjust culture and managers are force to get unpaid overtime from staff. Long hours with out recognition and reward."
bad,"This was a bad job, being a manger is the worst from hours to days off. No family time its the worst. It was horrible. The worst"
bad,Its a good place to begin a career but it is unwise to stay more than a couple years. The long hours get very tiresome and you are not treated as a valuable asset. There is also very high turnover.
bad,"I could see my management trying to do the best they could with the people/resources they had, but changes in upper management priorities, staffing (couldn't keep the group fully staffed), training (basically no time to do any good training), etc. and the sheer quantity of daily work meant that they could never keep ""good days"" (where everyone got off on time) going for more than a week at a time.  Hard to make systematic improvements when you can never quite stay caught up on the day to day work."
bad,"Hardly any work life balance"
bad,"If you looking for a work and life balance this is not the place for you.  This is a cut throat company which corporate model is ""Do more with less"". The only way for career advancement is if you willing to live and breath the your position. When you think given it all you got than you must give that much more. Looking to be challenged in a way you have never imagined this maybe a place to start. The words "" sink or swim"" take on its meaning after working for this company. I am grateful to have work for this company because I feel I could do the US president's job with minimal to no training --maybe exaggerating just a bit--but comes close to it."
bad,"The experience I had at State Street has made me understand the importance of corporate actions and governance, and how to generate efficiencies from an aging structure."
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
bad,It was a highly stressful position where if you did not fit in with management you felt ostrasized.  No matter the output and the long hours that I put in I felt at the end of the day that I did not accomplish anything.
bad,"Lots of cold calling for potential clients and trying to sell family and friends insurance and investments. Learned about different investments and insurances available to individuals for retirment. Management was very passionate about the company, but you had to sell in order to gain their respect. Co-workers were all seasoned vets in the insurance industry and were very clicky. Hardest part of the job actually making sales. The hours were the most enjoyable part of the job, you can make your own hours."
bad,Very micro managed.
bad,Very badly managed. Amazing place to work but the slow paced culture kills it. No visibility provided to people who work everyday and no clarity on the organisation goal.
bad,"Not great for training employees for advancement from position hired for.  They don't provide much to train you to move on from the position from which you were hired.  Unless you already understand investments, this isn't the right company for you to learn more!"
bad,"stop outsourcing all the jobs to india. management should care more about their employees, quality of work, not only about the money saving."
bad,"The only bright area of State Street is the work/life balance, since apparently they know you need it to remain at the company. State Street constantly goes through cycles of layoffs, getting rid of the employees that have been there the longest first. The budget is always tight there, and it seems like every year bonuses and salary increases get cut from the previous year. All State Street cares about is its bottom line and share price, and it comes at the expense of the hard working employees."
bad,"this place has very poor culture, no training, unknowledgeable managers. good flexibility to work from home, but there's either 12 hours of work to do every day or 30 minutes of work to do every day. no in between."
bad,The company has begun to outsource most of it's jobs and since doing so they have down sized greatly to the detriment of their current employees.  Good people to work with though.
bad,This is not a place I would recommend to grow but to learn and experience. Where you work and how your department is will determine how enjoyable the job is. Not every experience is the same
bad,"Good place to start, learn and develop your skills."
bad,"hard to advance if you are not in the ""in crowd."" Most of the groups within departments don't work together which leads to a very cut off work environment."
bad,Starting pay and benefits are good but there is no room to grow. You will be stuck in the same position for as long as you work there. Employees feel very expendable and the training is almost non existent.
bad,"A good company to start at, not a long term career. Prepare for team restructuring at anytime. Company is looking to offshore and outsource many back office positions"
bad,Too many jobs are going overseas and too many Boston based employees are being let go. Upper management is shedding too many US based workers to save money. With that said it's creating a very volatile workplace.
bad,Poor management manager have there own fav associates no team bounding no team work manager keep stress on associate no appreciation from managers no increments
bad,"State Street's constant pressure on expenses means no investment in technology and high turnover from layoffs and low compensation.  Sadly, service does not drive customer loyalty."
bad,"A typical day at State Street involved data entry of purchases and sales of stock.  My colleagues were a pleasure to work with however the Management staff was more demanding than friendly and little conversation was had beyond what was necessary for the job. As much I enjoy working hard, I didn't feel as if I was making a difference and that is important to me. I had an opportunity to move on to another company that I felt fit my personality after just a few months at State Street."
bad,"Pay is low and work is dull, good stepping stone. Worked in operations and stayed there for exactly a year then moved on to another role. Vertical movement is unlikely"
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
bad,They don't treat employees well and work life balance doesn't exist in the Financial Reporting area.  They are sending 70% of the jobs to India.  They don't provide adequate staffing for each client and the groups are typically short-staffed due to high turnover.
bad,"The harder you work, the less you are appreciated and forget about being recognized. Employee benefits are lacking to nil. Worst part is the toxic work environment."
bad,"StateStreet is a great company to work for when they finally have finalized their transformation. My role was changed Day 1 when I arrived and it's left me disappointed and more than frustrated. Some business units have great leadership, unfortunately, HR has poor leadership, a vertically silo'd philosophy that lacks horizontal integration and even worse communication to their workers about ""The Way Ahead."" My role is a unique role that has very little definition, high-stress, little executive buy-in and zero support from executive leadership. I've had to build it out as I go at a level that doesn't facilitate the ability to execute. "
bad,"First job out of college. Did not know what I wanted to do, but I found out within 1 year that this was not the path for me. Lack of team and management support forced me to realize it was not in a position to succeed and make this a suitable career choice."
bad,lässt sich besser in einem persönlichem Gespräch darstellen
bad,"a lot of the jobs are getting off-shored. The offshore team has no idea of what they are doing. "
bad,"this was a very good first job, but was not somewhere that I would want to stay for long.  Although working from home was nice, i was not a huge fan of the work environment."
bad,"This place over works you and gives little pay. And expects you to work from home after logging in long hour at the office. My manager had no knowledge of what my daily tasks were. I was going to meeting with senior level management, because he did not know what to say in these meeting."
bad,Great benefits. I learned a lot working at State Street Corp and have expanded my skillset by adding valuable knowledge of internal systems used Worldwide by financial institutions. Hands on experience with Anti Money Laundering applications. Decent overall.
bad,"Not recommended.  It's been a while, but I remember it being very laid back and not overly demanding.  Pay was terrible.  I'm sure it has changed quite a bit since I was last there."
bad,"When I first came to State Street I loved my team, however, after promoting to another team, I found that there was a massive difference in culture between the teams and that going in, that is something you should ask about.  "
bad,Poos senior level executives who have been around the company too long and should have been shipped out years ago. No advancement potential. Paid poorly in compensation for the amount of hours put into this company.
bad,"Never enough people to do a job. It is kind a a mill type atmosphere. "
bad,"Opportunities to learn a lot about company, clients and industry"
bad,"weekends, about two nights a week, and one or two weekends a month. Because the work is sporadic, regular hours aren't efficient or cost effective for employers, which are typically local law enforcement agencies. Because you need to be able to work at a moment's notice, you can't be out of town, under the influence of alcohol, or otherwise unavailable when called.e cleanup technicians d"
bad,Working here was great until the last few years. There is no growth in the department and are under paid to fulfill multiple roles. Do not feel appreciated.
bad,"There is not much opportunity to advance at State Street, but it was a pleasant environment with many nice and kind people. If given the opportunity I would work there again."
bad,I enjoyed the people I worked with The benefits were excellent.  Layoffs occur on a regular basis. The morale is very low. Work can be monotous and tedious.
bad,"Day to day are very long hours,  Overtime is normally not paid even if you worked more than 8 hours. Must be approved in advanced but it is never approved.  I learned nothing from this company,  You need to be self educated.  They show you a few things but no training. Because they have too many clients and not enough employees.  The most difficult part of the job was to be productive after 8 or 9 hours."
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
bad,This job was from almost 20 years ago.    A review of it would not be accurate today.  Otherwise it wasn't a bad job and gained experience in the industry.  Moved on to a competitor for higher pay.
bad,Work atmosphere is not very good.  Outsourcing to India and displacing current employees.  Shortage of resources and not a good work life balance.
bad,"Upper management's closing of Reqs and moving of Reqs to India, has created a shortage of resources and many employees are miserable and looking for other employment."
bad,"Good starting place out of university. Work is monotonous, turnover usually high and not challenging at all. Benefits are ok, co-workers tend to be young and fun."
bad,Expense cutting and under investment has led to long days at the office.  Company has been having annual layoffs for 5 plus years and don't see that changing any time soon as it chases quarterly eps.
bad,"Worst bank to work for in Boston but better than average pay. HR is serving management and management only. It is useless if you want to advance. If you know how to manage up and want to be treated like a slave this is the perfect place. Some incredibly smart people work side by side with incredibly ...silent people....who look smart. "
bad,"long hours were well rewarded, management team surrounding me could have been more supportive, team on my desk were swamped by work and had little time for aiding me and another new hire."
bad,"crowded work environment, hiring lots of people with no room to put them, growing fast pace, lots of red tape because its a big company, fun part was learning about different investment products and attending training and seminars on different important issues in the field"
bad,Lacks motivation and direction - conniving management does not know how to set priorities or treat employees well. Only traders receive the glory but they are not properly trained.
bad,"All dysfunctional departments start with Senior Management. The senior leadership at this company is terrible and could care less about career paths for their employees. The work is as boring as it gets- all around. The Managers at State State are there due to the fact they have no other options. The experience and professionalism of the ""Senior Managers"" is quite possibly the worst I have ever seen. The VP's at SS are great listeners but will never take the correct steps to help and add value to someone's career. This department has unbelievable turnaround and there will be some major changes in the future."
bad,"Overall not too bad. Pleasant atmosphere. Like any other financial companies. If management likes you, you will get ahead"
bad,"Duty varies. Able to learn a lot on your own but no training provided. It's a great place to land in the industry, however, it's not a place to stay long. Working environment is not very positive."
bad,"50 techs support 10,000 end users. We had 7 minutes to resolve each call, or have a good reason why.  After they had us write a ton of knowledge base articles, they shipped all 50 of our jobs off to China."
bad,"I enjoyed my time at State Street, I was given an opportunity to travel to different locations to set up office and train staff. I was not happy with the management, there was no interaction."
bad,"It depends on what group your in, but Client Operations is the pits.  Typical day constists of an overload of emails inquiries(500+ daily), internal IMT inquiries, client reporting deliverables, audit deliverables, as well as routine daily work.  State Street does not make it easy either.  "
bad,"Depend on your department, a work day can be stressful specially during peak demand. Internal mobility within various departments yield various skills; however many incompetent managers lead to high turn over ratio. Co-workers are great but frequent lay off dashes job security."
bad,You are very siloed off and there aren't many chances to advance.
bad,"There is no job security, most work is being sent offshore. It is very hard to get promoted, work days are long and management is content with the high turnover. Many strong, loyal people have left because of better jobs or because their jobs were sent to India. Loyalty means nothing and hard work is not rewarded. The best thing about this firm is flex work (working from home). Salary is below average."
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
bad,nsemms like they really dont care about rewarding hard working people
bad,"A very large company known for its machine-like attitude.  Basically just trying to work a few intelligent individuals into the ground and waiting for everyone else to leave or be replaced.  It can offer a positive opportunity to a small, select number of individuals but most of the time its a stepping-stone type of company.  "
bad," Managed 30 Contingency Plans encompasing 3,500 employees across 20 different geographical locations. Directed continuity events during business interruption. Partnered with business units to ensure testing of the continuity standards were in compliance with corporate and federal standards, receiving top audit ratings past 3 years. Successfully managed application testing, alternate site and limited staffing excercises. Improved relocation sites but condensing space and upgrading equipment. "
bad,"Worked here for a year, friendly staff all around yet no incentive to stay long term.  Management should place more emphasis on the ideas behind processes and procedures, rather than simply having employees ""push buttons.""  Great place to launch a career however the salary for fund accounting is relatively low industry wise.  Very thankful for my time here but glad I got out when I did."
bad,"Its a good place to start. You will be learning a lot for whatever industry you are gettin into. However, you will be stuck in one role for very long time, and don't expect there is any cross training.. If you are in AP, you will NOT be doing anything or gettin training from AR. Simple as that. And job security? There is none."
bad,high turnover and no retention policy. limited career development opportunities.
bad,"Below market pay for similar positions, No room for growth due to lack of promotions."
bad,"It's interesting that this survey is a) mandatory and b) tagged as only sixty seconds.  It's disingenuous to have a survey with a mandatory 150 character answer, and say that it only takes 60 seconds."
bad,pretty ok place to work with very few opportunities for growth. Management doesn't make decisions fast and people are not empowered enough to make decisions.
bad,"Senior management stated that one should always be in the office., which is an antiquated approach to retaining talent. It was very difficult to prove otherwise, and even after that, remote options were only once a month."
bad,"The company encouraged working from home at least in my department. The was little to no boundaries for the workday. The work culture was task oriented. On the job training and self-initiated training was the norm. Management is results focused. The hardest part of the job was short deadlines and extensive on-call requirements. The most enjoyable part of the job was evaluating, installing and integrating new technology in a large geographically diverse company."
bad,"The turnover was so bad that I had 5 different supervisors over the course of a year. It is very hard to get any productive feedback in that kind of environment. As a result, I kept getting passed over for promotions to people who were worse at the job but that had long term supervisors to fight for them in the promotion meetings. That simple fact colors my whole view of this company and I would never recommend it to anyone"
bad,"Gives you decent experience considering it is a part-time college job, but low pay and company morale made me want to stay away from working there after graduation."
bad,"My job has ""morphed"" multiple times over the years. Very rarely is one day the same as the last.  That is a good thing.  The people on my immediate team are excellent at what they do.  We work very well together and even though we are a global team, we support each other in many ways.  The issue is management - specifically upper management.  They are impatient.  When changes are made - they do not wait to see if the changes are effective before making more changes.  They believe we are ""industry leaders"" - and in some areas, we may be but in many others it is obvious we are falling far behind. This is just an opinion from ""someone in the trenches""."
bad,"There was always this notion from company leadership that its greatest asset was its employees, although my experience there was quite the opposite.  It seemed to me that they valued cost savings more than they valued investments in people and technology.  They preferred to grow through acquisition as opposed to organically from within."
bad,Absolutely dread working there. It is a sweat shop. They work you really hard. The hours are really long and senior management doesn't seem to very caring.
bad,they have a lot of lay offs.  they hire then they let you go.  Not a very nice place to work.  The building was very nice and the workers were nice as well
bad,"The job largely depends on your manager, which can range from great to awful. In addition there is absolutely no set path for advancement. It is almost impossible to move up without strong arming your boss with an outside offer or making a lateral move to a different division."
bad,"Great view and location, other than that it costs $53 per month to park, and they pay poorly. Lots of vacation time though. It seems they care more about getting things done in a timely manner rather than getting things done right. There was lots of slacking off and playing around among upper management, even when someone needed help. Not a very serious work environment."
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
bad,"had to meet SLA's every day no matter what happened that day - everything was about meeting the numbers  --- tickets, issues, phone calls  -- as long as you had good numbers"
bad,low pay with high responsibility in this company. Management doesn't seem to care about your career. Management seems to also put employees in positions to fail.
bad,The best part was the cafeteria. The people were nice. Home/work life balance could have been better. The parking was not good as it was located in downtown. The option of the garage was too expensive.
bad,Good place to start your career right after university . After a few years however there is minimal job advancement as well as low morale among employees.
bad,"THis would be provided at a later date, currently i just want to review the jobs available in this site. And see if this job site is worth my time."
bad,"Not much money to be made at SSB, advancement opportunities are slim and getting slimmer, and this reflects on the management which hasn't transitioned into a more tech/flexible company."
bad,The company is too large to create a culture. High turnover rate and under paid employees. They lied to me about the position I was hired for. I was told it was a rotational position which turned out to be false. The training programs are irrelevant and a waste of time.
bad,Incoherent and constant changing of processes. Difficult to follow procedures when they are constantly changing. Unwillingness to train
bad,Used to be a great place to work.  Now employees are constantly monitored and can be fired for the slightest offense (as State Street defines an offense).  Always looking of your shoulder waiting for the ax to fall.  Have gotten rid of so many people with knowledge that there are not many people left that can answer a question.  People ignore questions via email and/or phone as they have had to absorb so many other responsibilities.  Company very reactive to quarterly earnings and make short-term decisions to meet numbers that make no strategic sense.  Management only cares about stock price and what will go into their pockets.
bad,"What I learned from friends that moved on from SSB is that every other company is better in every way. Management at SSB always changes and they can't decide on the most efficient business model. "
bad,"State Street needs to work on better work/life balance for its employees. Management seems to be more concerned with cutting costs than with anything else. Department was a skeleton crew worked to the brink of exhaustion. That being said, the benefits were great and the compensation was above average."
bad,"The people there is amazing and fun. Employees are young and smart. Mostly all of them are pursuing a CPA or CFA while working."
bad,With the financial down turn and aggressive bottom line management State Street has a conflicting message for employee's. It promotes individual performance for compensation but rewards with pacification.
bad,"Aside from the knowledgeable and helpful management teams, who are stuck in the same system as all the other non-executive staff, there is little benefit here. The term 'doing more with less' is utilized in the most extreme sense as the teams I've worked for and with are constantly facing staffing and time concerns while the executives pile on the new business. There is no employee rewarding program and little financial incentive, if any at all in recent history, to keep the sheep happy here. The experience is a plus as the exposure is beneficial, but given the strapped daily schedules and delivery deadlines, you have little to no time to actually dive deeper into your areas of work to become more well versed. Get in, get the couple years experience you need, and move on to bigger and better things."
bad,"very political, operation and consulting groups always pointing the finger at each other."
bad,"Meet with management team on a daily/weekly basis to discuss key projects, and key risk factors."
bad,"Good team "
bad,Good place to do an internship or to have as a first job.  It's a resume builder.  
bad,"Let me start by saying that State Street is a very large company, and managing a company of this size presents some very challenging decisions."
bad,The WMS and GTP divisions are full of dead end jobs. It's a decent starter job but that's about it.
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
bad,"Has Great benefits, very bad communication within the company and employees"
bad,"State Street has become infamous for its toxic culture and where careers go to die. I could not recommend. Depending on your manager, there is some flexibility and you never have to work very hard."
bad,Never got to travel for the company.   It was very cost conscious from the very beginning.  Pay raises were minimal and bonuses were non-existent. And they were constantly trying to move folks in lower cost locations.
bad,"no career growth opportunities. stiff culture. too much politics. no transparency. "
bad,State Street is turning over too many US jobs to India. Caused massive lack of company loyalty. Not currently a viable long term place to work in its current cost saving state.
bad,repetitive with slow growth and lack of investment in employee development. there was little challenging work and very little emphasis on using initive
bad,"State Street Corporation is a good place to gain entry level work experience. But, there is little to no opportunity for growth in many sections of the bank."
bad,"Over the last few years the challenge of working at State Street has become greater. The company focus is on cutting cost. This means moving everything to an offshore ""low cost"" location. As people leave, it is taking an extremely long time to replace them, that's if we are allowed to replace them. "
bad,"You have to pay a lot for benefits, pay for parking, pay to use the onsite gym, etc. Most jobs are being outsourced with current employees being asked to train replacements. Little to no growth opportunities"
bad,"Pros:  Work/life balance, good starting point for a career"
bad,Executive management is out of touch with actual operational conditions.  They are always told what they want to hear.  Procedures and controls are not being followed entirely as staff is not properly trained.
bad,"The company is going through lots of change, both in the operating and management. Used to be a great place to work. Now employees are constantly monitored and can be fired for the slightest offense. Always looking of your shoulder waiting for the ax to fall. Have gotten rid of so many people with knowledge that there are not many people left that can answer a question."
bad,"I have worked here for two years now and it has been a positive experience. However, my current job is not in my long term career interests, so I am looking to move on. Pay is less than industry average, but vacation time is excellent."
bad,"I went in as a temp-to-hire.Learned how to reconcile hundreds of funds per day for clients. Co workers are very nice. However, the company itself is silent when it comes to your job security. Had to ask multiple times about the status of my employment which was met with vague answers.They kept me till the end of contract then renewed it with my hiring agency without telling me."
bad,"Company is trying to out-source and automate jobs and, thereby, reduce workforce.  Staff who are left are burdened with extra responsibilities and no additional compensation.  Management doesn't listen to employee complaints and only is concerned about budget and timelines."
bad,"compensation was very good but long hours for salary workers, communication from management was constantly changing, staff reduction was frequent, offsite management was not working well"
bad,"SSGA is trying to move in the right direction but bureaucracy is still stifling creativity and growth.  The compliance function has grown too large and wields unchecked power, need to find a better balance between compliance and operating business."
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
bad,"Administer pension/hedge/mutual funds and ETFS including applying expenses capstock and striking NAV at the end of day\"
bad,"The job itself is really boring and repetitive, no real vision of what you're doing as contributing to the entire company."
bad,Dull meaingless work with little to no responsibility. Some people have been there for 3 years and are still an Associate.
bad,"It was ok working environment, but it seems to be very disorganized. If you have high passion and potential, I don't recommend to work here."
bad,"I was 'State Street', I worked there for 31+ years.  I loved my job and the people I worked with."
bad,"Entry Level compensation is a disgrace. This fosters a culture that is lifeless because no one bats an eye when people come and go, its expected. "
bad,You are number and the guy next to you will probably change rapidly.  The work is tedious and you will learn very little as you just blindly run Macros all day.
bad,"There was not much room for growth in my group at State Street and the management was hit or miss. I originally had a great manager but then State Street laid him off and the new manager made the group miserable. It's a great place to learn finance right out of college, but it's best used as a stepping stone."
bad,"I have worked at State Street for 3 years in multiple roles (Fund accounting and compliance) and this is what I have gathered in that time:"
bad,"hard to advance, stiff culture in some groups, not very challenging, and terrible pay."
bad,"The day is practically the same day to day. Balancing spread sheets, measuring incoming foreign trades, and meeting daily reporting deadlines."
bad,"Monitors audit engagement, ensuring proper coverage, timely completion, and appreciation of auditing principles and practices.  "
bad,Overall the job is a good start off company with great benefits.
bad,"I worked there for 3 years as a trade processor, most of the time it felt like high-school, our floor was run by several cliques, if you keep your head down everything is fine, but rub an passive aggressive associates degree holding gossip or two the wrong way and suddenly you find yourself under intense scrutiny."
bad,"The best thing about my career at State Street was the professional relationships that I developed with my co-workers. I felt like part of a team, not just with my direct group but with all of those that were around my age. However, I felt that management did not do what was necessary to advance the careers of us associates. It was more like they were willing to let the good workers go then see them advance and compete for management positions. Instead of managers doing better work, they would impede the advanacement of the associates below them. I did only work in the transfer agency, so I can only speak for that department. The experience I gained was mediocre. I wish I had only stayed at the company for 2 years at most."
bad,"There is a reason the company continues to underperform in the market.  Political posturing and power struggle among senior management is at another level.  Roles are convoluted, and de-centralization abounds not by efficient design but due to the power play.  This is a highly political environment that drags the company’s performance down with it.  They fall behind their peers/competitors in innovation and infrastructure as a result, with people more focused on posturing and positioning rather than production.  Motivation is misplaced towards this. There is no end in sight, as another major reorg has occurred, something that seems to happen every few months."
bad,"The review summary really summarizes the current status of the company well. Unfortunately, as State Street looks to offshore more of its operations in India, the morale stateside, at least in the KC office, continues to go down.  The company is a far cry from what it was back when the KC office was known as Investors Fiduciary Trust Company."
bad,The work itself is slow and tedious. Lots of departments do repetitive tasks daily. They pay way below market average for any position. Only upside is the time off (3 weeks from the start) and most people are friendly and great to work with.
bad,"Not a fun place to be although just like everywhere else, it depends who your boss is.  My experience was with managers that were 'survivors' and surviving was the only way they made it to senior management.  It wasn't because of brains or knowledge or ability to strategize."
bad,"If you have just graduated from college and get the opportunity to work for State Street, it's fine for getting your foot in the door and getting professional experience. The schedules usually aren't too bad depending on the team you get hired on to, and vacation days are a plus. Other than that, advancement is difficult depending on your team, and management is usually inconsistent. Basically getting on the right team or becoming familiar with the right managers will give you more opportunity here. Starting pay is pitiful."
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
bad,Its a bank servicing other banks. Massive layoffs frequently. Changing direction often in the SoCal office. Working in a bank is slow compared to other industries. Good place to retire.
bad,Lack of communication with co-workers. Some team member is not friendly and provide bad feedback for you with no reason.
bad,"Pros – Good benefits"
bad,I enjoyed working at State Street and career advancement was a lot better than JP Morgan
bad,"If your looking for a fun place to work stay away! Its a good first job, but not much room for advancement."
bad,"The pay keeps getting worse, it's hard to make money for a bank when the stock market is not going up... luckily they are heavily affiliated with the SPY and GLD tickers, as these two tickers usually hit the top 5 highest volume tickers trading in the market frequently."
bad,"The people are great, but no real appreciate for all the hard work that's put in.  No one cares that you put in 10-12 hours days regularly.  Most employees are over worked and under appreciated.  Department continues to have high turnover.  Upper management needs to wake up and realize that this current structure is not working."
bad,"was copying and pasting in excel for my entire internship, it wasn't very fun and i didn't feel like my work was meaningful. leadership was very friendly, however."
bad,"I have worked in State Street for several years and have witnessed the company's performance getting worse and worse each year.  The only way top management knows to improve financials is cost reduction which results in talents leaving the company.   The revenues and customer satisfactory reduces as a results of losing talents, which brings in another cost reduction plan. This company will not get better until the company starts to work on retaining talents."
bad,"Felt pressured all the time and leadership gave the ""you're on your own"" attitude when needed help. High turnover for a reason and low pay for entry level"
bad,"State Street has a churn and burn feeling.  At one stretch I worked something like 29 out of 30 days.  Not sure if it has changed, but people were in and out quickly."
bad,"The pay was low, even when they promote you. The work is dull and there isn't a lot of help when you need it. Everyone is so underpaid and overworked they don't have time to train."
bad,Poor pay and unexciting work.  Hard to feel part of something special in a company so large.  Very few opportunities for advancement.  There are better companies to work for in the financial services industry.
bad,overworked and stressful. Some employers don't understand that if you want a happy employee you have to balance work and personal life. People should not life to work.
bad,"Daily and monthly processes are pretty standard for a fund administrator. Good place to learn the ropes, and start off your career. Compensation was lacking, and a lot of the good employees leave in a short period of time."
bad,"Huge company with limitless potential. Made great connections. Demanding, challenging and high-paced work environment. Little support for managers. Lack of individual focus makes certain tasks difficult to complete properly."
bad,State Street is well known as the company for new college grads to develop a base of knowledge and experience. Once a strong foundation is built the best talent leaves to companies with better benefits and pay scales that are more inline with the industry averages.
bad,"A typical day is extremely busy from start to finish.  Throughout the day we ensure trades are processed onto the market and everything from income dividends to derivatives are booked correctly.  We also help the client to get any new funds set up, markets open and answer any question they may have.  We also ensure NAV's for funds are correct and that prices being put on the stock market are correct."
bad,"The culture in State street or  to be exact where i was is toxic, lots of micro""managememts, no connection between the "" High above ""' and the lower staff, sometimes quite unprofessionals . I would definitely give it a miss going forward."
bad,Used to be a good place to work...now I would not recommend.  State Street is sending more and more functions off-shore.  Current employees must train their replacements off-shore in order to qualify for their severance package.  They are also targeting senior managers for lay off to cut costs.  Problem with both is that the less knowledge people are running the show!!!  All this for the stockholders.  Attitude from upper management is that you can either adapt or leave.  This is the way of the financial services industry.
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
bad,Work at satellite office. Very little room for advancement. Offshoring of work continues. Bonuses were cut by 50% last year. No raised for AVP or above for a few years now. It feels like they want you to leave.
bad,"I was thankful to have a job post-college. This was a good company to start in, as it allowed for me to get some corporate experience. It wasn't what I ultimately wanted to do though, so I started studying for actuarial exams while I worked there, and eventually was able to leave and pursue other interests. "
bad,High-turn around. Most people use Statestreet as a stepping stone into a more concentrated field in finance.
bad,"Even if your field of study is not related to finance / accounting, you can still easily start off your career as a fund accountant/ portfolio administrator / fund administrator / account controller, etc."
bad,"Place is okay. Good stability, but pay is quite low. The benefits are actually quite good in a down economy. It really depends on your manager here and the group you work with."
bad,You move up in this company if you know someone. Hard work rarely pays off here. Great people but management doesn't take very good care of the employees
bad,Good place to start out and learn about Finance and banking the company is heavily regulated as all banks are but otherwise great company not much more
bad,it is very dynamic and friendly environment . The hardest part of the job is domain knowkedge of finance. The most enjoyble part is to see that your code running in production.
bad,Good place for students fresh out of college.
bad,This company is great start because they willing to hire new graduates; Promotion is very difficult and the pay is below average. Good thing is the benefit package is acceptable and there is an option of remote working (not on a daily basis).
good,"Since we has the merger with IBT the culture has changed. They are laying off 7,000 people to rehire 3,000 in India.  Our jobs are getting outsourced left and right and every week someone is getting laid off."
good,"Main tasks"
good,"Solid Company , though the corporation is in an identity crisis. The sole focus of senior management is transforming the business to generate revenue and cut costs by any means literally by any means with no long term vision which makes the employees- top performers and other - feel non-valued. Too many Chiefs, not enough Indians."
good,"Poor choices in the past are finally catching up with them."
good,"Overall the department I'm in is a good first job stepping out of school to build your 1 or 2 years of work experience. However, if you are ambitious and want more I feel you can quickly grow out of your role.  "
good,"Fast paced, good startup for a fresh out of college, knowledgeable managers, getting better at flex schedule, good benefits."
good,"Working at State Street Corporation was a great experience, the environment is good, but the cultural aspect wasn't great, people aren't that friendly."
good,"There is a strong hierarchy, people are obsessed with their titles. Senior Associates have 5 less vacation days than everyone else. You do not speak, or share ideas until spoken too. The only collaboration is between upper mgmt. Technology is sorely out of date. Health benefits are expensive, considering that the company is global."
good,"Work/life balance could be improved. Training must be taken more seriously, but good place to start training and move to other companies. Free lunches for employees are excellent"
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
good,"Great company for new college graduates and people who want a quick eCommerce learning experience. "
good,Great company to work in depends on who you have as your manager. Benefits are great. You have the option to work from home but at manager's discretion.
good,"Frankly speaking, coding culture is not good as it's not an IT company and everything is business driven. They use Agile to manage, but they won't divide stories as per application architecture. Bussiness decide what you need to do."
good,"Lots of low level employees, very few managers. Tough environment to get help sometimes. Really have to figure most of the job out on your own - teach yourself."
good,"a typical day at my jobs start with running reports, processing  trades, meeting multiple deadlines thru out day. and its basically  a repeat process after  that."
good,"They are offshoring jobs at an accelerated pace and no one here has security anymore,. I would urge anyone to look elsewhere for a job, unfortunately. It used to be a great place, but not any longer. Constant layoffs and offshoring daily it appears."
good,"State Street USED to be a great place to work, but with outsourcing all of the work in Kansas City, it has become difficult for the remaining employees."
good,"They pay below average for the industry, will overwork you until you burn out and then relocate you to another group if you decide to stay with the company. Management is concerned about the client, you and your family are an obligation that can only be an inconvenience."
good,"Great place to start in finance in Kansas City. However, salary and career advancement leave a lot to be desired. State Street usually pumps out tried and tested employees for other companies such as DST, PNC, or Key Bank."
good,Basic do everything at state street car wash and detail like shampoo. W.e do probably close to 500 cars on weekend days and during weekdays close to 350 and very busy car wash and I love taking patient to my job make sure things done very well and good. I always love seeing myself for Customer to be happy and feel grateful for our work.
good,"""weekly"" Layoffs in finance demoralizing and makes a stressful environment.  Communication not always consistent to staff or at all. "
good,State Street workplace culture are outdated and only one sided. The manager only see his way. You have to do what they wanted. There is no room for creative and efficiency.
good,State Street preaches work life balance however that is not the case.  They work you like a dog with no added compensation.  There is no true management structure as such the teams are left to fend for themselves.
good,"A little behind the times with technology, but overall a decent place to be."
good,I enjoyed the time that I spent at State Street Bank. I was lucky to have had a wonderful manager who would applaud us for a job well done She created incentives and ths motivated us to work harder. My co workers were great and we worked as a team.
good,Input data into system
good,"I started at State Street IT in the late 1990's. In those days State Street was an excellent company to work for. The company seemed to value employees, rightly so, as stakeholders. There was a loyalty to the company from the employees which I thought was really nice."
good,Too many departments/silos involved in every process making difficult to hold any one person/or team accountable.  critical processes have been moved to Indian with little oversight
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
good,Just about Average - no latest technologies - Management is not updated and does not like updated as well - just make it work for the customer - Thats all
good,"it lets us employees go & replace with off shore people. they do not care the quality of the work or they do not know the quality of the offshore people do. Invented stupid framework OSA, does not use industrial standard frame work."
good,I worked in State Street almost 5 years. I contributed a lot in my field. But a lot of office politics exist in the place and one need to be very careful if you want to be productive.
good,Management leaves you alone with work to produce results which has positive productivity expectations and lots of responsibility. It can be a tough environment as the timelines are short and work is extensive.
good,It seems like there are much easier ways to do things in every aspect of the job. I am disappointed with the way management refuses to move forward and change. They prefer to micromanage and not recognize problems.
good,"The work itself is fine but there are an excessive amount of processes that need to be followed. Meetings are abundant and they are run poorly a lot of times. People there are incredibly talented. Besides possessing large amounts of domain knowledge and technical skills they are very compassionate and self aware. It made for an environment to improve technical skills while learning about the domain specific knowledge.Management over promises frequently, and promises are binding at State Street. To compensate for too many promises they add more people or they have existing people work way more than reasonable. The workplace is very traditional office/bank culture. Dress shirt and dress pants are worn by almost every employee there. The hardest part of the job is being put down for missing something or not being able to finish something to completion because the priorities are not well defined. You can do 95% of a great job, but the 5% will eclipse the 95%. The enjoyable part of the job is the technology that is being used. It is truly interesting."
good,"It is a hit or mis with management. If you get a good manager is determines how your experience will be when you get there. If you get bad manager, Just run. Job advancement is only applying externally."
good,"The team is mostly under 30 years old and the work environment is relaxed, good for recent graduates looking for an entry level position to get some experience or people looking to make some cash while studying for CPA/CFA. Work is very repetitive though and becomes boring after 6 months to 1 year. Compensation is only better than working as a teller. Turnover excessively high, no incentive o stay. Pension plan + healthcare + educational assistance are decent."
good,Management difficult to work with. Many changes to company environment and no communication. Manager not into work from home days. Not treated like a professional but like a kid that needed to be baby sat.
good,Contracted for disaster recovery project. Two sites involved. Traveled to both sites and implemented redundant services. Performed fail-over testing. Documented all work performed.
good,"High tense enviroment, low work ethic, poor managment. Benefits were minimal at best. Hours were very consistent, day was predictable. Understaffed most days."
good,"I was with State Street from 2009-2013 (albeit that the last few months I was on short-term disability leave).  During this time I saw things become completely unwound, sometimes it seemed, come unwound in real time.  My group at my previous employer, BoA, was disbanded and a number of us let go in early 2009 as a direct result of the 2008 financial crisis.  I was absolutely thrilled in 2009 when I was taken on in July 2009 after only a few months of being unemployed."
good,"The management at this company is incompetent, ineffective and totally inefficient. This is my biggest issue with working here. It's hard to feel a sense of accomplishment when you've got a boss that doesn't understand the job themselves."
good,it has become very clear that you must leave state street in order to increase your salary. State Streets salary is no longer competitive.  the benefits have been reduced to a point where they are no longer competitive either.
good,"The job is the same every single day and lack of management expertise to try and ethuse workers through the daily grind. No encouragement or thank you on a job well done or helping others out. Selfish mentality in the work place with everyone looking ot shift blame. On the plus side it is ocated near town and transport is accesible."
good,"State Street drives short-term profitability with continual layoffs, movement of jobs offshore, management reshuffling.  More than once I was assured by one area of management that my contract had been renewed, later told by another renewal had never been budgeted."
good,"The company is okay. Feels that there is too much work for to little employees due to company does so many layoffs. "
good,Hires a tremendous amount of financial positions within New England . There fore there is a lot of turnover. The company is fast to replace due to the constant talent applying.
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
good,A great place to work to get your foot in the door in the field of finance or accounting. State Street employees a lot of people especially high school students for the summer. Advancement or promotion opportunities are slim to none. Even if you have more experience and higher education than someone else. It all comes down to preferential treatment . . .
good,During my employment I found out my husband was cheating on me and I had to put in for a divorce.  They quickly found a reason to let me go.  They did it during their famous round of lay off's.
good,State Street has undergone tremendous changes in management and staff reductions and it has resulted in a decline in employee morale.
good,OK place to work but depends on the team you in. Comps and benefits industry average. on average you work forty five to fifty hours per week
good,"Great way to get your feet wet, but you'll want to get out quickly. The pay is terrible, and they are moving a lot of work to India."
good,"I learned a ton while working at the bank but, there is really high turnover due to low pay and terrible working hours.  The management of individual groups is generally very poor."
good,"SSgA is one of the good companies which will a great opprtunity for Fresh graduate to start up their career. Company provides a standard  initial salary and good working environment. But in the case of promotion and salary hike, SSgA is ZERO. the most enjoyable moment is work environment and the freedom that the company is giving to its employee."
good,"I started working at State Street soon after graduating college.  While I have been fortunate to build strong relationships with my co-workers over the years, I find myself stuck in Operations with very little, if any, opportunity to advance my career in another area of the bank.  "
good,This would be my first experience working for a large corporation. Work is very repetitive but gives a great opportunity to set your foot through the door. Co-workers are fairly young and easy to get along with. Hardest part of the job is getting the recon finished before noon. Everyday has something new to look forward too.
good,State Street is in progress of transforming its business model bringing in a consulting firm to review processes. This has caused wide concern about job security. A big focus of the company is a straight through front to back process with its purchasing of Charles River Development. Positions in that area are secure and potentially fulfilling.
good,"* work load is busy"
good,"I've been with SSGA for over 20 years and have had a great experience working with them.     Company is losing it's edge and alas is going through some lean times.   it is laying off lots workers, outsourcing jobs overseas and doing massive cost cutting..  Moral is not great for those of us who are still employed there.  Three years ago,  I would have highly recommended the company as a place to work, but not know.   Maybe things will improve in the coming years."
good,"State Street is a great company however, the management staff are not alway competent. My manager did was not very supportive. She constantly blamed every one for her mistakes."
good,"State Street is a good place to work. I was challenged with new tasks over a period of time. The work environment is past phased and innovative. However, there is lack of management appreciation and encouragement. State Street is always behind in compensation compared to peers in the industry. What I observed in my 10 years of State Street is that too much of top management. It's more like a reverse triangle. I hope the things will change over a period of time."
good,"State Street is full of quality, hardworking employees and has tremendous benefits (specifically time off, flexibility, and insurance). Leadership is lacking, however, and causes employees to take on more than they can realistically handle and adds stress to daily lives. Culture is generally pretty good, with the exception of directives pushed down from upper management."
good,Good company to work for and provided necessary support for personal and professional development - good environment and ability to add variety to the daily work
good,"More focused on getting your specific tasks done that why you are doing them. Very quiet. Never really work parties/outings. They also pay various employees different amounts, even if they are on the same team and have the same title/role."
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
good,"Good business insight, but poor management and execution"
good,"•	Collected documented proof and maintained case files for transactions deemed suspicious on retirement accounts for a client with approximately $18 billion under management "
good,it has many meeting. which are not related to the work some times. never allows contractors to work from home. there is some partiality i feel between fte and contractors.
good,Outsourcing so much work oversees.  People leave and do not get replaced.  Way overworked and cannot usually take all your vacation time due to the work demands.  OT is expected even if you are salary and do not get paid.
good,"Outsourcing very common and no room for mobility. Long hours no training. Good benefits. Too political. Don’t recommend to anyone, unless you’re just starting your career."
good,Typical Corporate Environment. Many different offices globally. Senior Management primarily focused on cutting expenses instead of caring for their employees.
good,"Compensation and advancement opportunities are low but training is in-depth to accommodate newcomers. Few opportunities for employees to make their own mark, processes are inherited from earlier generations. Loud open office at Boston location"
good,"My manager was terrific, it was the company itself that forced him to lay me off. The company downsizes consistently, laying off many workers. Not a reliable workplace, or company."
good,"It is a very stressful, demanding, fast paced environment and there is not as much flexibility as promised during interviews. You usually do not know what the job entails until you are in the team."
good,SSC was a great place to work till about 7 years ago.  The focus turned from the employee to strictly the stock price.  Felt more like a cog than a valued employee.  Executive managers brought in with minimal experience while laying off good and knowledgeable workers. Morale is very low.
good,"You will be busy most of the day but you will learn many things about industry and fields in general. Downside for my group is fact that it is under the huge favoritism. If you happened to have officer or AVP who knows how to value employess by performance, you wont have this issue but in my case, promotions were based on favoritism."
good,I find State Street has been a good first step in financial services however can be difficult to progress within the company. Also the pay is not very good in comparison to other financial institutions.
good,"I worked at State Street as a temp until I could find a full time job. It wasn't anything I hadn't seen before. It was all by the numbers. If you can stand working in a large place where the only people you see on a regular basis are in your group, try it out. If you need a little more consistency, you might want to try elsewhere."
good,"Depending on the management, there can be limited mobility once you land in a role at State Street.  In general, the consensus is the hours are long and everyone is being asked to do more work with fewer resources."
good,"SSC is working to change the culture of the company.  I do feel in time that will happen, but a lot more changes are required.  Pay is not competitive, so make sure you negotiate."
good,"State Street is known as a farm for good reason. Either you grow and flourish. Or get sent out to pastor. I was lucky enough to get my foot into the job and gain an entry level job, which was imperative to the growth of my career."
good,"Very poor management"
good,"I have no complaints. I was treated well, but once the job of the team was re-defined, my skills & experience were not a match. Great company, unfortunately, I was not a good fit with the changing job description."
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
good,It's a culture of management by crisis and the Human Resources dept. is run by contractors with no skin in the game and it shows. Career advancement programs are virtually nonexistent.
good,Long hours required no personal time. They can't keep people long enough to fully train them. They continue to add clients to an already understaffed team.
good,"The company is going through lots of change, both in the operating and management model. Communications are non-existent, and employees generally do not feel empower to help drive the strategy forward or support the required changes based on new strategy. The  company has been significantly crushed with negative regulatory findings bringing about a culture of hiring external consultants (usually one particular consulting company) to address problems without giving employees the opportunity to support or take leadership roles in re-defining the new standard. Leadership lacks long-term vision and are sadly subjugated by short-term needs to reduce costs (which do not match up with excessively using consultants) and ensure regulators are kept at bay."
good,I have worked for State Street for 5 years now in 2 locations.  The experience can vary drastically.  In lower level positions the days can be slow but you will quickly move into heavy responsibilities as the turnover is very high.  Management is typically determined by those who choose to stick around not by merit; and they quickly lose understanding for the weight of the workload and the changing daily environment.  You will move up quickly if you stick around.
good,Good beginner experience but lacks advancement opportunities and there is not much lateral movement available in this location. Overall direction from management is missing as well.
good,"State Street is a good company to start your career at but it's a struggle to get promoted. Benefits were good but they have been cutting more and more. Compensation increase is little to none every year. Bonuses is well below industry standard at average of 1%. Most VPs only want to delegate and do not know the day to day process at all. Management doesn't want employees to work overtime, but give them more than they can handle in 8 hours. Work life balance is not good for many employees, mainly the ones who know more than others. These people end up doing too much work, even their manager's work and cannot even take a break to eat lunch while their managers eat on time every day. Coworkers are a hit and miss but that's at any company.  This is a good place to start, but even after 10 years, you will never make 6 figures being here.  Job security is always a concern as State Street has had 3 major layoffs and now going through the beacon program."
good,there's little room for autonomy. have to follow procedures everyday. flexible schedule. there are room to grow if you know how to look for it. the pay is probably the worst thing about the position though.
good,"Not my dream job; horrible management and hours are not very flexible, especially for employees that have a long commute."
good,"I think that State Street is a good place for someone who would like to get their foot in the door in the industry. Unfortunately, moving up and increasing your role and compensation at State Street has proven to be extremely difficult and most employees either seem to want to leave or never be challenged."
good,"A typical day at work is coming in the am and following up on prior day's issues."
good,"I have been at State Street for 15 years and have seen many changes, not all for the best.  The company is more motivated to make a dollar than it is to ensure a happy staff."
good,"I developped great Microsoft Excel Skills, I gained a lot of knowledge of Financial products and a very unique aspect of accounting"
good,"Answer Ad Hoc requests from the client/managers, send emails daily to our Joint Venture group in India or to different custodians dealing with our accounts."
good,"I think the title speaks for itself. I'm sure not all departments are the same, but I believe Fund Accounting at State Street is like a HS classroom, in a bad way. Employee turnover is very high, no mutual respect for co-workers. Most employees are recent grads that get promoted to managers if they stick around for over a year."
good,"My typical day at State Street was to resolve claims. Each day was different depending on how the trade failed, the research needed for each claim and the counterparties involved."
good,"I joined and found it pleasant for the first 2 years. My direct manager has kept me with them for the past 3 years. The writing has been on the wall since late 2009 that if you are driven and what the company calls a ""high performer,"" it is time to leave."
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
good,"Company made many strategic changes over the last ten years that had a negative impact on middle management.  Overall, I was given the ability to independently manage my workload and support team."
good,"Fire and re-hire mentality, management appears confused in the company mission.  Company culture is a big focus but employees are not clear on what that means nor is management."
good,"State Street has a lot to offer.  If you want to move up in the company and are a go getter, you can move ahead in this company."
good,"coffee shop in Boston.. "
good,"Like most places, playing favorites or being a favorite is the only way to excel. That goes without saying for most places. Personally I would choose hard working, quick thinking individuals as someone to keep around. But preferably the company managers want ""yes men/women"" that don't do their share. The company will hide growth and changes from employees until its too late and they are shoved out the door, in order to get them to work hard right before they are abandoned. One pro is if you don't want to grow in the company and remain under the radar this will work for you, unless your manager changes every 3 months."
good,Good beginning first job out of college to get foot in the door and learn the ropes of an investment company.  There is a good work / life balance and plenty of groups to join.
good,When i was first employed i enjoyed working for this company as time went on and i tried to advance myself to other positions available it was very hard for me to transition to another area of the company. This company has a high rate of layoffs.  This company also does not recognize the employees for the work they do.  The compensation is not relevant to the work on a daily basis.
good,State Street Bank got me ready for a career in the I.T. industry. I got familiar with most computer issues as well as most installations. I also got familiarized with the Bloomberg operating system.
good,"Not much to say. It gets you going in the professional workforce. Culture and workload vary greatly from team to team. Some great managers, some no so much."
good,Not my favorite place to work. High stress and low morale. People would come into work every day on Monday and already be looking forward to the weekend.
good,"offshoring alot of work related tasks, "
good,"State Street is undertaking some significant cost-cutting efforts to offset negative industry trends and a downturn in stock price in 2018. This has caused organizational turmoil, as leadership has been in major flux and domestic resources have been getting laid off. All decisions appear to be made from a holistically budgetary mindset. Morale has been impacted, particularly among less tenured staff for whom career advancement looks to be best pursued externally. There is currently a hiring freeze in which no external hires are being made, and staff reductions are not being addressed, resulting in increased workloads with no resultant rewards."
good,A good place to learn and grow. But you stay for a long time you become stagnant. Worklife balance should be forgotten before joining and also pay. Overworked and Underpaid. Management is not interested in Individual welfare and only care about numbers. Management is interested in good numbers but that won't reflect in your paycheck.
good,Very fast moving with zero training. Good people with varied backgrounds but everyone is so busy that they dedicate almost zero time to helping new people.  Not recommended for folks that are new.
good,"There are great teams to work for here, if your hours are flexible. There are also some very tough clients, who require an enourmous amount of work on very tight schedules. Upper management tends to show favoritism in my specific department. Once you get to team lead, it’s a long shot to move on up unless you are a favorite."
good,State Street made me realize how prices change over time. Emphasizing the importance the security of online information in a workplace. Practiced secure pricing and  saved and recorded important information.
good,"SSB is a good place to work. Good colleagues, team members. Definitely a chance to learn and grow. Fast paced environment with good work life balance."
good,"This is a fund managing company. The work starts from 8am to sometimes 10pm or even 2am the following day, depending on what day of the month. it is extremely busy at the year end and you are expected to work without being paid overtime."
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
good,"As with any large company, your level of job satisfaction depends on the team and manager you end up with, provided the culture within the larger management chain is aligned with your immediate team's values.  Having worked for the company for many years I had amazing managers and groups as well as not so amazing.  If you can find your place you can thrive and be happy here."
good,"State Street is too big to generalise.  Individual experience depends on the area of work.   Much emphasis is put on Talent Acquisition, while existing employees are ignored and not lifted or motivated to take-on leadership role or move within the company.   On the flip side,  senior management seems to take great care of each other like a good  ""Boy's Club""."
good,"Keep up or get left behind is the essential mantra, regardless whether you work directly through SS or are a contractor for them. It's a highly fast paced environment but a lot of ""looking out for myself"" mentality"
good,"For the department I worked it much of the work was routine, and the management team was not very in tune with the staff.  Many people that I worked with were younger and left after a few years because there was little job growth"
good,"Good place to gain entry level experience"
good,GE Asset was bought by State Street and consolidated the department I ran. To regulated environment and culture of non trust. Don't value and treat long term employees and never go to bat for what is correct
good,"I have no comments for this company as I do not know well enough to make that but my manager is great. Risk of being laid off is high, I think. Maybe it is because the division I am in."
good,"Working at State Street Corporation for the past 6 years, I have seen a lot of initiatives to reduce cost, but some times at the expense of overworking it's employees."
good,"SSB is a place to work when you just get out of college, they don't pay well but hire a lot of entry level people.  People that stay here usually have no other options, they started really low and never got a BA or BS (just completed few college courses).  When the down sixe staff, the don't send you a notice or pull you aside, the eith have security at your desk when you come to work or your pass card is rejected when you try to enter the building.  Great place for a year to get into the stock marjket game, but if you want to move up learn more about accounting leave after a year or two"
good,"A typical work day is fairly relaxed (with the assumption that this is not a busy period).  Management encourages internal mobility, which is communicated throughout each department.  Depending on team, can be a fast-paced environment.  Lots to do and many networks to join and get involved."
good,"Not the best but not the worse... if you love your family this is not the best place to work for. Work to Life balance is horrible. "
good,"Good working environment but management is not organised. Lots of communication gaps, lack of stability. Work is not much productive or beneficial for future career."
good,Compensation for low level employees is poor although company wide benefit packages are competitive in the industry. Turnover is massive issue across all departments.
good,"Having worked with State Street since college, I was able to move to various departments via opportunities State Street affords. The company provides stability and great networks of people with years of experience."
good,"Yes, you will get a chance to advance but it will be hard. Expect to work 10 hour shifts with minimal to no recognition. Be prepared to have a ton of work load thrown at you. The managers will often threaten to take away WFH for small human errors or tardiness. Be prepared to work your butt off for little compensation. But the experience of working in a confined office space is always a plus. Having the option to work from home is awesome, plus the amount of vacation days you'll get to have off."
good,"The staff are friendly and always want to do their best."
good,"State Street, though a good place to work, has had regular layoffs due to outsourcing overseas. Job security is low. Work/life balance, though touted, is not enforced in practice."
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
good,"Management by committee can be quite frustrating. If you want to punch a clock, have a lot of flexibility, aren't frustrated by a lack of support (e.g. call the help desk for everything and rarely get on-site support OR self service for things that are not your expertise). Then this is the place for you."
good,"Lots of young employees, so good place to start straight from college. Not the best money, and monotonous work. Some fun work life balance initiatives - yoga classes, health and fitness classes, etc."
good,Good workplace to work and support is provided. And dynamic teams to work with makes the job fun. Overall is a good environment to work in.
good,"8 hour + shift, answer phones, crisis management. Run data base cycles, create new user accounts."
good,"Minimum opportunity for growth and a culture that does not promote collaboration or internal development.  The management teams are reactive rather than proactive, and there is not much for encouragement regarding employee development."
good,"Get your foot on the door.  Gain experience, exposure to financial markets and move on.  There is potential but management is losing focus on values."
good,"Employee moral seems very low as most workers appear over worked and under appreciated.  In my opinion, State Street hasn't attracted or retained the best and brightest in the industry.  From my experience, employees come in with high expectations for success, but burn out rather quickly and hit the job search hard."
good,"Interact with people from across the Global Operations Organization, investment managers and  subcustodians in markets across the world..  High risk environment, risk management skills required."
good,Gain good experience and knowledge in mutual fund industry. Hours can be extremely long depending on your team and deadlines. Co-workers are extremely helpful and nice.
good,"The job is good, but culture not great. Pay very low. No room for career advancement. Management thinks only about themselves."
good,"In terms of the daily activities they have been planned on a weekly basis to be sure any tasks should be properly accomplished. I usually share the plan, improvement, to my manager in order to be aligned with him to the business goal to be achieved."
good,The lack of new technology. This creates a frustrating environment and often times results in errors that could be avoided with more up to date software.
good,Accounting reconciliation. Learned some excel skills. Got exposure to back office finance operations. Work gets quite boring and repetitive.
good,"Friendly coworkers, management is flexible with the schedule."
good,State and Federal tax preparation along with excise tax.  I would not like to comment on the current company that I am currently working at.
good,"I would take care of high profile customers accounts with procission and enthusiasm.  I processed over 300K checks monthly.  I ran excep spreadsheet reports to account for this money down to the penny.  There was never an over or shortage."
good,"A typical day is 9 to 5:30 Monday to Friday some weekends are necessary. "
good,State Street provides entry level employees good experience in the financial service industry. Unfortunately the culture is one that needs to change. Management is constantly getting pressure and that trickles down to us. Co-workers are typically all the same age and working with them is the most enjoyable aspect of the job. I have learned many skills while there that translate well in any of my future ventures. These include financial terminology and forecasting as well as efficient communication and computer skills.
good,"Daily tasks was to spend most of the time in meeting."
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
good,A large collegial environment.  Everyone is very in tune with what they are doing and a great place to gain large amounts of experience in the financial industry. 
good,Low pay.
good,"Benefits are OK, but depending on department can be a very negative work environment"
good,Conservative company to work for.
good,"A good place to start a career while you gain the academic requirements, industry certifications and build a industry network."
good,The company is an overall good company to start off at if an individual wants to enter the investment/ financial industry.
good,"Due to the changing financial landscape, it has been a very stressful few years. The corporate culture has changed and work loads have increased dramatically."
good,"This place will turn and burn, just hope you get lucky with one of the few good managers. Everytime someone leaves you get double the work for the same pay, and if you cant still produce you have 100 management meetings. They don't treat their employees well, and will cut people at the drop of a hat- (have to cut 8% expenses every year because they can't find a way to be profitable)"
good,"State Street is a huge company, so your experience will depend on what department and what team you work with. My personal experience in the security valuations department was so so. The work was highly repetitive, there was a lack of professionalism, and a strong feeling of disconnect from any other departments."
good,learning environment helps to enhance knowledge here. exposure to arc reporting.stressful environment during quarter and annual cycle which also gives opportunity to know your core strength.
good,"Some fun and helpful team members and some not so helpful. a lot of the work is automated so not much manual work. when there are issues or delays, you'll be required to work overtime."
good,"It is a great environment to grow and learn about the industry. However, salaries could be improved. Great working space for graduates and opportunities for career progression."
good,"Decent culture but organization is struggling to transform to successfully compete due to cost pressures and an unwillingness to make radical changes"
good,"My team was a good group. But the workload and the lack of more hires make the work life balance very difficult."
good,State Street is not as good to work as at it had been. Management has been keeps sending all the jobs overseas with no training and laying off good experienced employees. Its great to watch the bottom line but it comes at the expense of good employees and not providing the best service to their customers. Lots of teams and departments understaffed and overworked.
good,Good mix of accounting and financial securities work. Daily job functions are hard to perform as the operating model is overly functionalized amongst many departments.
good,Learned new ways of analyzing data to optimize time to meet firm deadlines. Utilized various platforms to research and reconcile data. Kept close communication with all the team members.
good,"As above, the job is fine but it is currently under staff and management will not increase head count. Very difficult to get ahead in the business with promotions or increase in salary."
good,"The working environment in state street is pretty good. Both management and the people are good. However, most of the company responsibilities are moving to another country. Less job opportunity in Canada now."
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
good,Management could use more training on management. Upside is there are many employee resource groups to improve and enrich the employee experience which is good since it can feel like your a robot in a moving machine.
good,"Very compliance-driven culture due to the business they are in and their size. Unfortunately, this can lead to resistance to change and complacency with the status quo."
good,"In my time at state street I never really felt part of a team. I'm known as a people person and I take pride in my interpersonal skills. However at state street I just came in put my head down, did my work, had my deadlines and every day was like the one prior. Also with the addition of their new CEO came a change in culture, leading them to send 85% of the work force to India and 15% here which will likely be executive management."
good,During my 15 years at SSB there was clear deterioration in moral over the years as jobs were outsourced an/or eliminated while the work increased leading to over worked employees who couldn't do their job at a high level because they were covering for people who were no longer there.
good,Management has no concern for the impact decisions have on employees. Hiring inexperienced external candidates over promoting valued internal prospects promotes a culture of high turn over and a toxic work environment.
good,"5 years no raise, yet CEO gets sizeable raise every year.  Removal of company issued mobile devices yet CEO receives increase in bonus numbers.  And the constant threat of lay off.  Company driving to be more off shore than on shore...."
good,"come to work, work to complete all deadlines and tasks needed.  Started having to train overseas for everything we do and start doing more with less.  Feel like I have become a high paid babysitter, my skills are not being used anymore.  I love the ability to work from home to complete my job but hate that the company keeps moving my team further away from my home.  When I states we were located in down town Boston and I chose not to work in the Quincy office.  They have now moved my team to the Quincy office and I spend about half of a work day commuting to work."
good,Tough market driving challenging work environment.  State Street is adapting and morphing the organization to respond and remain effective for its clients and employees.
good,"Management can be stressful, as they try to push work to the associates, with no help or understanding on work life balance requirement. "
good,"Great company, no regrets. Working with the CAO of State Street and then supporting the Board of Directors, was wonderful. Moved on to SSGA , was there for almost 4 years, many changes under new management, again, no regrets."
good,"Too much red tape, not enough training; people who step over others are promoted. Poor work-life balance, but good benefits otherwise. All depends on who is on your team!"
good,"Even though I opted for State Street for a reasonable salary, I soon discovered that this job was not for me even though the Management were very accomodating"
good,"The company is going thru a financial squeeze which have limited opportunity, and pushed many jobs offshore.  As a result moral and job satisfaction is very low."
good,over my 10 years at the company I have definitely learned a lot and gained valuable experience. However the company has to change to compete in the global environment and it does not include putting the workers interests first.
good,"Hard to screw things up, but the talent leaves for better companies. If they paid more maybe more people would stick around. Sometimes you feel like a monkey pulling a lever."
good,"Great place to work. Good security clearance. Benefits like chair massages, food discounts, parking, etc. Good hours and decent pay. Easy to find and get to"
good,"Great life balance.  However, salary is low and tough for promotions.  As someone who works from home it is tough  to get the recognition deserved.  Also, lots of it is abiout who you know and the department you work in."
good,State Street is more focused on meeting the bottom line then making the company a good place to work. I spend most of my lunches eating at my desk because we have so much work to do and not enough people to on the team to help with the work.
good,State Street is a company under going reorganization and seeking for cheaper labor transferring knowledge overseas. There is no job security as the market place is very competitive.
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
good,"State Street was a great company to work for while in college because it prepared me for a real-world job by challenging me everyday. Although, management in the Hadley office was extremely strict and did not create a comfortable work environment for asking questions."
good,"State Street presents tremendous opportunities if you're interested in an environment with global impact.  It's global nature combined with a lack of integrated diversity, and ineffective management pose serious challenges."
good,People are really helpful and supportive. Executives are accessible and seemed interested on what you have to say. Your voice count. Diverse and culturally competent.
good,"Great working experience, especially as a first step in the corporate culture! Gained a lot of experiences and made a lot of networks for future endeavors!"
good,"Everything was ok, till new dealrrment head came to us. The structural restructuring resulted in layoff of all the group, even though we were one of the most profitable units in the company."
good,Good place to work. Interesting work. Different challenges everyday. Allows you to learn different skills everyday. Friendly place to work. Lots of different roles within the company
good,Managers could do more to acknowledge your performance. The work load has increased while short staffed. The pay does not compensate the stress. The people I work with are great. I receive more appreciation for my client service from outside my unit than I do from management.
good,"I can only speak for the Derivatives Department at the time I worked there. It may have improved by now. However, that was the most unorganized place I have ever worked. You are on your own from day 1. There was literally no training, and your teammates lacked the time to teach you. SO BE A QUICK LEARNER! "
good,With most of the work being outsourced to State Street in Poland I was rarely challenged. Management made decisions on how the outsourced model should look without any input from myself or colleagues resulting in multiple changes in strategy.
good,The procedures to access data to complete analysis is very restrictive and lengthy.  It will often takes days to gather 1 hour's worth of data needed to determine an answer.
good,"It is much easier to advance and raise hour income at State Street coming from the outside. Within the Company its known that you fall behind external peers in salary, benefits and title."
good,"typical day is quick paced and dynamic.  International presence with working relations with India.  People are nice to work with.  however, advancement in a different department was difficult."
good,Supervisors and Managers are poorly compensated for the responsibility and work stress. But you can get a foot in the door after graduating college. They lack training.
good,"State Street is a decent place to acquire some basic skills and move on to a stronger company.  Culture can be lacking depending on the department you're in.  There are many State Street lifers who have little to offer; however, hold senior level/high paying positions."
good,"Excellent benefits and work life balance as a FTE.  However, as a contractor, it is the polar opposite.  Also, upper management favors youth and a flashy pedigree."
good,Working is Productive and allows you to learn about a large corporation and large systems. It is like a huge ship so change is not easy and takes time
good,"Work from Home is a benefit but not all managers allow this.  Work life balance greatly depends on the department.  Job security is not guaranteed and layoffs or ""redeployment"" is rampant.  Employees are not set up to be successful."
good,There is a fair amount of turnover right now and new management makes things challenging. Global company with a lot of tech and challenging requirements for audit and regulation.
good,"There is a positive job work/life balance but poor management and job culture. For example, there is segregation among cultures, languages, and there is no unity."
good,"didnt want to give a review, just wanted to fill out the survey about the company and rate it. I think there have improvements made to the company in a positive way but the downsizing creates a negative tone."
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
good,"I'd worked several different positions over the years at State Street, different departments, different managers and what I found most upsetting about State Street is the lack of people skills in their management. Often times managers are promoted from positions which they were great at--but being great at your job doesn't make you great at managing other people. I had many toxic experiences with different managers here, mostly involving micromanagement problems or overly aggressive handling of teams. "
good,"Started out as a fun place to work. Made many great friends and acquaintances.  Many of the skill learned there still carry me today. Once the suits in Boston started meddling and restructuring things, it became impossible to be promoted. Entire departments were shifted to India and wages were artificially suppressed."
good,"The most enjoyable part of working here is the work-life balance and affinity groups that help you expand your network. However, being a large institution, your contributions could be lost and advancement will be solely dependent on your boss."
good,"Nice people around you. However, you work too much under pressure and get burned out easily. Days are often too intense. There are multiple deadlines during the day... might be stressful."
good,"Working in the Audit department is the perfect job for someone who wants to focus on having a family. There isn't much room for advancement, but it also doesn't force a lot of over time."
good,"Company is focused on maintaining themselves, and not improving to keep up with competition. Most people have a ""not my job"" attitude and are incredible protective of their jobs."
good,"Long hours and work thru lunch break, but it really depends on which group you work for. High overturn rate. People were nice and a lot of room for advancement because of high overturn rate."
good,"After joining SS I could not get over the pace at which you are expected to work at?"
good,Great place for lots of flexibility and remote working. Defiantly a place with jobs not careers.Expect to be let go if you ever become too expensive. In the metro area State Street becomes a black stain on your resume.
good,"Not a great place to work in terms of atmosphere or work/life balance but good overview of the funds industry.  Not great for promoting hard working staff, or replacing good people who leave."
good,Some departments have no work life balance. Overall good opportunities within the company to advance and great internal mobility. Benefits and pay are average
good,Software shop; offers flexible work arrangements; not much scope for moving up. Management bringing in new staff but only on technology side & seems like boys club.
good,"Fast paced and dynamic. All engineers were extremely professional. As a financial institution, the bulk of the work was done off hours. This allowed us to work unimpeded."
good,"If State Street could start paying people more competitively and give them legitimate opportunities for advancement (as opposed to a minuscule raise to do the same work after a year) it would be a much, much better company to work for."
good,"State Street is a very youth oriented organization. It is a good place for young college graduates to gain experience. But, there is obvious age discrimination and they go to great lengths to hide the discrimination. When they started moving the accounting jobs to India and the Philippines; the older employees were the first to be laid off. Older employees were often overlooked for promotions and held to a much greater standard when attempting to get a promotion. "
good,"State Street is a decent company to gain experience, however compensation is very poor (salary and bonus) and management has no flexibility to remedy this."
good,"generally speaking this is a good place to start as  first job, but need to consider better opportunities, promotion room is not good, high rotation rate"
good,"Tell us about:"
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
good,"I have learned much about the sales process, as well as servicing clients for trade analytics, as well as the trading process in general.  I have performed many roles in my job, including sales, client servicing and operations.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the people I work with, but the opportunity for advancement in my role is extremely limited."
good,"8 hour work days are common, learned lots of information about securities, co workers are very mixed with complacent and very driven people, same with management team."
good,State Street is a solid company to get your feet wet in the investment world. You need to leave after a few years though as the internal movement within the company can stall and you end up getting trapped in a salary that is not available at external companies.
good,"A good place to gain knowledge of how a custodian banks work. Good thing about this company is Sodexo coupons, Pick and drop facility.but poor infrastructure, Slow decison making, Less risk taking. No Proper workplace no cafeteria.Also No clear cut ploicy as HR sits in Bangalore office"
good,"Does not really value the employee, who is nothing but a cog of giant machine."
good,benefits are excellent at state street.  Job is not hard but pay is not that great and the layoffs are getting bad
good,"On a weekly basis i plan with my manager all the activities have to be done in order to be aligned with the Corporate Objectves and expectations."
good,"Nice to work here for almost one and half year"
good,I worked here for several years and enjoyed the time prior to the sub prime mortgage crisis. My position was eventually outsourced to India and we helped train our replacements.
good,"although it was relatively easy to get a job there right after college, the day to day work was pretty mundane and not challenging."
good,"Long hours, only promoted if you can get in the proper social circles"
good,"A good start for experience and college."
good,"Approval of account overdrafts"
good,Good place to work. Pay is low but other benefits make up for it. Work life balance is poor. Over the course of 10 years I worked countless weekends and evenings. I gave up scheduled time off when I was needed in the office. I worked with some great people here.
good,"Woking a lot with off shore, odd hours."
good,Decent.
good,i t was such a great place; However there was not room for advancement.
good,"State is a good company to work for but it's mostly kids straight out of college. There is a extremely high turnover rate. The average college student stays a couple of years. The promotion potential is very low, you only get promoted if you are friends with management."
good,"A good place to get started for those interested in Accounting. High turnover at lower levels makes it relatively easy to move up from Associate 1 to 2 and even the Senior level. Manager turnover is much lower, so it will take longer to reach that level. The work is being increasingly simplified and becoming more basic, so it is becoming tougher to continually learn on the job. Obviously affected by the economic downturn, there have been a number of layoffs recently, but the high turnover levels keep them in a position to hire."
good,"They try to incorporate a positive workplace culture with working groups, social clubs globally.  There are talented people of most ethnicity. They are currently making changes to become a more digital company which would help productivity."
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
good,"WMS and IIS divisions had good work life balance, especially for parents. Compensation appears to be low across many of the fields, long term employees enjoyed good career advancement but poor compensation even after several promotions. Recognition and awards for good performance were provided. Training in some areas was provided."
good,"the team was set up without proper planing, no accountability, ownership from the top management, Ideas shared were not rightly used. Team meetings were not useful and time consuming. Spent unproductive time of my experience at State Street"
good,"Global Organization - with global opportunities"
good,Good only with money wise. Knowledge flow is very limited and restricted. Work life balance is okay. Welcome thought is very narrow per management....
good,"Very good company to work with. Great experience and very good learning. Got exposure to many things which where unknown."
good,Internship while I was in college so I dont have great insights on exact job or how they are to current employees but it was fine when I worked there.
good,"Considering it's one of the largest banks in the world, it should be expected they have a protectionist perspective when choosing the type of innovation investments."
good,"State Street has been around for a long-time and is therefore presented the challenges of attempting to be agile at a large bank."
good,Lack of professional development opportunities within the company here in Toronto. They find staff retention hard and is a large staff turnover each quarter with low paying bonuses. A lot of red tape when trying to make process changes.
good,"the work for not for me, Department was rather law than Financial department, due to this fact I decided to finish those collaboration after three months."
good,No job security.  They continue to lay people off from the company yet pile work upon those that are left behind.  Then once they are done with you they let you go.
good,was able to work from home when i had family issues  pay was not great dozens of employees left in the span of a few months due to lake of pay increase
good,State Street needs to adapt to find the proper balance with it’s staff and its goals. They tend to talk out of both sides of their mouth when discussing the importance of their staff.
good,"State Street is a great company to work if you have a family. Its flexible with options to work from home. The management is good to work with, they are very concentrated in your career and options."
good,"Continued layoffs, coupled with hiring freezes, has put more pressure on existing employees to continue offering the same level of service to more and more clients."
good,Company continues to layoff  US staff and transfer jobs overseas. Join this company with caution as this will continue for foreseeable future. Staff is friendly and works together.
good,"unable to disclose information, fun place to work to get your title and your hours but do not stick around they dont pay for much and they would rather have young people."
good,A nice firm with some nice people but not among the elite investment banks/asset managers and doesn't seem to have the potential to be among. Seems to be a big disparity in employees - many with no formal qualifications which can be telling in how work is presented.
good,The back office of state street can be a lot of work without much personal advancement. You're expected to do robot work and the compensation is low. Flexibility to work from home is a pro.
good,"Working for State Street is what you make out of it.  There is a vast array positions for which someone can obtain valuable skills and experience.  You work hard and be savvy enough to take advantage of them.  Speaking of taking advantage, the company will take advantage of you if you let it.  Example :The pay for internally promoted employees is significantly less than those hired from outside the organization.  That said, one would be foolish to stay with the company for any longer than 4 years before moving elsewhere."
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
good,It was overall a good experience to get your foot in the water. But everything else was okay. Work load was about okay for me and eveyone was nice. Great company for starters
good,it is a fine place to work if you are looking to just make a pay check. it is full of soul less incompetent managers and people who don't care about their jobs
good,"State Street Corporation's work is made tough as it is a large organization comprised of different interacting units; that said State Street does a pretty good job of having these different areas communicate and work together effectively. The compensation, however, was not there."
good,"Work is tough, with long hours a regular occurrence. Direct managers are great but the higher you go the more they bend to the will of the bottom line. Culture is one where this is known and everyone teams together to get by. People are genuinely great to work with but the pay is below the industry average and the people feel that. "
good,"At State Street, there's a chance to meet many different people due to their diversity and their affinity groups. However, their pay is definitely not competitive."
good,"such boring workplace i ever have. doesn't have any team happy hour time. they are just work work work. i learn pretty sample. find the problem and solve it. nothing else. i wish i can learn some more, but there is limited that you can go in."
good,Benefits are good but outsourcing has sent many jobs overseas.  Four of the last five positions held within STT have been outsourced.  STT has directed its resources to IT and saving money by sending the jobs overseas.
good,"State Street can be a good temporary option. They have a poor culture, where people fear so much for their jobs. It's not a very friendly place for work"
good,"My 12-year experience at State Street (Global Advisors) was very mixed."
good,"The people are great and there are always opportunities to raise your hand and take on a new challenge that can propel your career forward. Just like any other company, your career growth at STT is what you make of it."
good,"Direction was limited, Information was sometimes shared. Work was abundant enough, but with very little responsibility at lower levels. Turnover was quite high."
good,"There are too many internal meetings."
good,Being in a remote location provided opportunities for intraoffice collaboration and organizations but could leave one feeling isolated from their working team if they were across the country or across the world.
good,"the company as a whole could do a lot better only if, they stop laying off people and working the remaining employees to until they cant deal with no more. this causes a lot of good managers become bad ones. working there made me sick in many ways; it started getting mental then it to affected my physical health."
good,"Work/Life balance are great. Career advancement is what you make of it.  "
good,The only thing that matters here is the shareholders and their profits. Another company with grossly overpaid CEO and excecutives along with some of the finance world's lowest paid employees.
good,"Fund Accounting is very stressful with multiple deadlines in day that you have to meet for client deliverables.  Hours are normal for lower level workers, but very high number of hours for exempt workers."
good,Nice as a first job. but there were long hours.not to much space for advancement.workplace culture depends from the group you are in. nice manaement..
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
good,"it was a very repetitive job that did not give me a sense of accomplishment. Not rewarded for good work, only mistakes are pointed out. The people I worked with were all great"
good,State Street Corporation is a great place to work. Great place to gain experience in the financial services industry. There is a good work culture and work-life balance.
good,It was a contract position that didn't guarantee that I would be extended or given a full-time position. I wasn't given great direction about what needed to be done during the time I was there.
good,"management - encouraged open communication"
good,Employees aren't rewarded for their hard work. No opportunities for advancement. Poor managerial skills and communication which affects employee morale and productivity.
good,A big corporation with a lot of possibility for a person to grow in his career. Exposure to different managers and clients and a chance for a person to develop a complex set of working skills
good,Too many org changes going on causing everyone to run around to secure their role. This is causing competing priorities with no one taking a overall look at the business. Room for advancement or mobility is limited. Only hire from outside mostly Citi...
good,"You will experience all types of feelings while working at State Street. State Street exposes you to different type of financial securities however depending on your client, it could be limited. You will be working directly with the clients and several counter-parties daily. While work does pile up, the work environment that you will be in will make sure you do not fall behind."
good,"I gained many practical skills relevant to my legal education as an investment compliance intern at SSGA, it was challenging work and many hours of commitment without enough compensation."
good,"Quality co-workers made for an enjoyable working environment."
good,"This was my first job out of university.  I didn't expect much, I was just looking for experience and getting my foot into the workforce.  It was my first real job."
good,"It was an okay internship experience, a lot of people weren't very friendly. The cafe food was delicious, fresh and cheaper than Dunkin Donuts, awesome!"
good,"This is one of the hardest jobs I've held, you need to be focused and ready to run the corporate rat race if you want advancement. This is not a career or employee oriented institution, they will work you hard and offer little coaching to achieve your professional objectives. "
good,"I enjoyed starting my career and State Street.  I learned a great deal about foreign currencies, securities lending and developed strong relationships with brokers all around the world.  As the economy changed so didn't the culture in the workplace."
good,"Constantly working with others, great team work and effort from many. You are constantly learning and adjusting to new roles and or situations. Great way to build experience."
good,I worked as an intern for State Street processing trades that on a standard 9-5 job full time during the summer and part time during the school year. I found the job to be enjoyable and overall not a bad internship but it was rather monotonous.
good,"Average place to work. Very below average compensation. There is a lot of turn over which can be good and bad. Overall, would only recommend for entry level, trying to gain experience."
good,In order to advance in a group you will need to change groups. The pros are that there is flexibility with being able to work form home and there are options for 2 or 3 days. Quincy office is good to work at because you can park your car.
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
good,State Street is a company which has been undergoing continual change and transformation.   Satisfaction will depend on many factors.  Environment is challenging
good,State Street is a relatively easy company to gain a job offer with due to their high turnover. Keep that in mind. Promotion opportunities do exist but it wil depend highly on which division you work within.
good,"the staff and supervisors are understanding and will do whatever they can to help you feel comfortable. the properties and duties are dangerous."
good,"The salary for entry-level jobs is below the market."
good,"The company work environment wasn't good, Management was lacking and the communication was non-existence  There was no sign of advancement . Training was insufficient and after 2 years working there it was time for a change"
good,State street is a pretty good company to work for.  They do have flexibility with work@home.  My work is very dead line driven.  You a lot in a short period of time.
good,"You can give your all but as soon as they have a chance to out source you, it's over. Lot's of long term folks have lost their jobs due to out sourcing. People don't really matter here,it's all about the numbers."
good,"The shareholder services team does extremely repetitive work on a daily basis. The daily routine is pretty much the same for everyone and there is little room for growth. While this job may be for some people, it certainly isn't for everyone."
good,"Incredibly silo'd work environment."
good,"+ good benefits you won't have time to use anyways"
good,"Took it as a job straight out of college. I wanted to put my foot in the finance industry."
good,"Fast paced environment, lots of things to learn, very approachable Management. "
good,"Good Place to start your Career,lots of learnings for Freshers. Good work life Balance. Job security."
good,"Resolves administrative problems by coordinating preparation of reports, analyzing data, and identifying solutions."
good,Bank loan processing of trades based on investment managers' requests are the typical day at work. Learned how to multi-task in a fast-paced setting. Co-workers are great. 
good,"Executive leadership is so disconnected from State Street Kansas City.  Numerous KC jobs being sent to India leading to increased mistakes to correct for reviewers, which is frustrating to say the least."
good,"Fun work place with supportive management.  Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop.  Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company"
good,"This company, in its younger days, was truly a diamond in the rough. After being purchased by it's current owner, managers went from caring about employees to plastic personalities. IFS, in it's heyday, was amazing. Working hard, burning the midnight oil, and working from home was an honor. It soon became an expectation. Managers also played good cop / bad cop scenes. Sub management was intimidated by senior management. If it was not for the previous CEO and his team, this company would not be where it is today."
good,"State Street offers good benefits in terms of vacation days, 401 K and depending on your department, a good bonus. However at State Street over the last 5 years they have introduced Centers of Excellence which they are using as a blanket model across all departments. It works effectively for a lot of departments but not for all. As a result there is a lot of turnover during the ""break in period"" creating a domino effect. Sometimes this breakout works but when it doesn't after a year or two they revert to the original model. Unfortunately, a lot of experienced staff have already moved to other departments."
good,"A fun environment to work in and a good culture, but less than amazing benefits or pay. Some long days, but typical days have a good work to home life balance."
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
good,I collaborate with State Street employees and clients to process domestic and international trades. I have learned alot in my time there.
good,"Spent 14 years at State Street in a career dead end. Would have left, but the bottom dropped out of the job market; and with no experience outside my assigned duties, I didn't expect to have much luck in finding a new job. "
good,not a bad place to work.  salary descent.  nice people.  new office in berwyn is very nice.
good,State Street is a great corporation to start off in right after college. They have great benefits and Flex programs but it is very micromanaging and poor compensation
good,Scrub all new Corporate Actions announcements. Inform Investment Managers of new Corporate Action events. Supporting different investment teams is very time critical and there is a lot of due diligence needed. Management was great and very open to share knowledge of the subject. The team was well put together and composed of experienced individuals. The most difficult part of this area has to be any risks that might occur during the process of a Corporate Actions and having to explain to the client where an error happens. The best part of the job is when all events are managed correctly and the area is incident free.
good,A typical day involves meeting strict internal and client deliverable deadlines. Its vital to be self reliant and work independently to achieve team overall success. Great opportunity to work with many hard working co-workers and professionals around the clock while facing tough challenges along the way. The hardest part of the day is having to sit through down time and wait through systems issues while it's elevated and being fix by the technical support team. The most enjoyable part of job is when faced with new challenges and adversity that I worked hard independently and contribute to achieve a team common goal that at first seem impossible.
good,"This is your typical office space job. Nothing special, nothing exciting, at all. You will not be challenged but if you work hard you will be noticed. The pay is below average but if you stand out you can make up for that, after a year. The job is not too bad but it is a cube farm and very mundane, robotic work everyday. Great for starting out, but will burn you out around a year."
good,State Street is okay company to start your career. The management and work culture is below par where I worked.
good,State Street is actually a good place to start off from college.
good,"A typical day included managing the pension funds for over twenty high-end clients. The work/life balance was off. A typical week included 10-15 hours of overtime. Where the background checks by the FBI to perform the multi-million dollar were okay, the extended time away from my family was not. This could have been avoided with an even distribution of workload to the team. My co-workers were great to work with and would provide assist as needed with general entries. The hardest part of the job was to getting everything done in the time frame given. The most enjoyable part was I knowing that I did the best I could do each day."
good,"Nice place to work, great people however compensation is not up to par."
good,Decent company for graduates to gain experience.
good,"A typical day in the client representative role consists of researching and answering inquiries from clients about their portfolios as well as putting together daily reports for AVPs and clients and doing ad hoc projects as they come up. I learned that working in the finance sector is not as secure as rumors had indicated. From year to year, State Street is in a perpetual state of flux, acquiring other companies or outsourcing. Constant changes—and constant instability, I would argue—jeopardizes job security with layoffs. Employees are fearful of losing their jobs from quarter to quarter and often do. Management, on the whole, is sub par. Officers and AVPs are more preoccupied with placing blame with their employees than with finding ways to motivate their employees and make them feel valued. Promises of career advancement are tenuous at best. The strongest connections are made with co-workers, who are also cogs in the wheel. Experience at State Street should be limited to two years for initial exposure in the financial sector. Afterwards, it is best to move on to more professional and serious companies that offer competitive compensation and work/life balance."
good,"Not a lot of interaction with other groups or clients in certain positions. I have had many roles within the company and the ones I enjoyed the most were the ones where I could foster relationships with clients to help assist them more easily. There is good job security however depending on what group you are in the opportunity for growth is lacking,"
good,Overall I believe my position was a good entry level position and had good training for the position. I would not go back because there was too micro management going on in the groups I believe and that it was too hierarchical overall. The hours were long and I felt way underpaid for what I was doing. I would rate the overall experience a 3 out of 5 or a 6 out of 10.
good,"Die Arbeit bei State Street ist von hoher täglicher Belastung geprägt."
good,I learned a lot during my time at State Street. I was exposed to many different fund structures and many knowledgeable people. My time there was well spent.
good,high levels of client satisfaction faulty programs and worked with developers to remedy the problem expense account checks resulting in decreased manual
good,My experience as a consultant can be different. But as a team member I felt welcomed because my team consisted of friendly people but I was working with teams that were not very helpful and stressful. So it totally depends on the team and the people.
good,"Eine affinität zu Zahlen, Zuordnungen und komplizierten Abwicklungen muss man habe, um diesen Job gerne zu machen, ich habe ihn gerne gemacht, aber leider ist die Niederlassung in Deutschland (gesteuert über Amerika) zu sehr damit beschäftigt in Billig-Lohn-Länder out-zu-sourcen, sodass leider einige sehr interessante Arbeitsplätze weggefallen sind :-("
good,There is not much of a work life balance in my department. Work is slowly being outsourced with you having to cover for the work as people leave onshore.
good,"While there are many positives of State Street, such as generous vacation time and resources to expand knowledge, it is easy to feel lost in the inner workings of such a large corporation.  Varies across the company, but there is a lack of team morale and culture does not promote a vary team oriented dynamic, which creates little incentive and no sense of purpose."
good,Lots of great and talented people still work at state street but that has gone downhill during the past two years with a major focus on offshoring and cutting labor costs through technology improvements. The approach taken seems to have been to see how deep they can cut and then scale back once things start to break down.
good,Worked on an agile team to create a new state of the art market data reference platform.  The work was both challenging and interesting.  The team was a very close and cohesive  group.
good,"Great company with many benefits but due to CEO change, layoffs are high and offshoring is maximized. Your experience really depends on the team and management"
good,"Worked the overnight shift and had some job autonomy. Overall I enjoyed my time there. Good work environment and pleasant coworkers. Unfortunately laid off due to the ""Great Recession"". or would probably still work there."
good,"Workplace culture is very professional. "
good,"General cleaning is always first, and a quick check in with the boss to make sure there ae no new objectives for the day. The hardest part is embalming training. but it is the fun part."
good,"Went to India and trained a new team in two different waves, 15 people.  Recommended subgroups, identified gaps, provided training.  Created an envirement where people can succeed.  My AVP sold it as it is an opportunity to build a culture.  Anyone can go over there and show them how to tie out an SOI.  For the new comers I taught them things like that, for those with experience that already knew financial reporting, I showed them 2nd tier training, troubleshooting….  who to reach out to for certain problems."
good,I worked as a trader for 22 years.  It is a very fast paced area in which i have learned many things in the financial world .  I am able to think very quickly and provide information that is tangible for my clients.  I want to be with company that provides secuirty and advancement.
good,Positive work environment and friendly co-workers. The beginning and the end of the month were the busiest times in my department. They have a very good vacation policy.
good,The best part of working at State Street in Toronto is some of the people.  Management is ok.  But the salaries are extremely low.  The company is cheap.
good,"salary is not a great otherwise workplace is good there is no problem really if they give std market payment then that shul be a good place."
good,I really enjoyed the fact that my position in the company allowed me to work remotely from home most of the time.  I did need to go into the office on occasion for certain tasks.
good,The company pays well but lacks in managements skills. There is no proper training. The departments are silo and the groups stay together. Not a lot of trust within the groups.
good,Lots of politics. Too many meetings and less time to do actual work. Policies & red tape takes away productive time. Lots of fluff and less of innovative work.
good,People work hard but not sure if its appreciated by upper management.   A lot of projects are funded and worked on but never really amount to much improvement in customer service.
good,This is where I was first introduced into the industry of charitable planned giving.  I learned a lot here and this carried me through to future jobs.
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
good,Did not work for long time but its nice place to work. Colleagues are very helpful. But however I worked there for 6 month and in that time period no Client Manager came to meet me or introduce.
good,"I spent 12 years at state street and while I was able to work on some challenging projects and developed some thought leadership, in the end I was not valued.  Move to low cost locations is more important than retaining valuable employees.  Poor management across the organization"
good,"The company was a great to start off right out of college. Pay was decent, but the hours were pretty intense. I was working an average of 50-60 hours a week, within the first 3 weeks of starting"
good,"Not a stable job. Good for the student to get some experience and a good place for training. A lot of changes going on, it is hard to tell.  a lot of la off."
good,Great business unit teams and working environment with flexible WFH opportunities. Too many meetings so cuts into daily productivity. At time people stretched line.
good,"Have worked across multiple clients within the OTC Derivatives group. Responsibilities include trade capture for both Middle and Back Office, cashflow calculation and agreement, position and valuation reconciliation and production of daily client reporting."
good,"Enjoyed working at the Company, but the pay was not all that great for the work that you put in. There was not much more to add to this. It is a good place to start right out of college."
good,"State Street was a good experience after graduation because it offered the ability to see the whole financial services industry and if you are not very familiar, it was a good way to learn. The biggest problems seem to be you feel like the teams that are client facing a far more valued than middle and back office. It's understandable but the company preaches unity and ""One State Street"" but they also believe that brokers and traders are far more valuable than the treasury team."
good,The management did not define the job profile correctly. The project manager was asked to be technical writer although job requirement did not say that
good,Work was dull and boring. There are many deadlines that require you to work late on most days. Not much work life balance. People aren't ambitious but complacent with their positions. Not easy to network.
good,"Company has been focused on addressing regulatory issues the past 10 years. There has been little to no investment in the technology infrastructure. Too many manual and time intensive processes and information silos exist. It is becoming harder and harder to do your job effectively, much less enjoy it."
good,"It was my first job in an office setting, and opened the door to other full time positions. It wasn't the most fun place to work though."
good,"State Street has awful retention.   When they hired me as a contractor they told me they would be able to promote to full time if they thought I was a good fit.  I have exceeded at everything they have asked, and my team has told me numerous times how valuable I have been.  But now they are making huge cut backs and cannot hire any of the temps full time.   There is also very little structured training."
good,"It was nice because I could work from home. Hard place to work because there are many layoffs. It is definitely a good place to work, but not a good place to work if you are looking for job security."
good,Provides and environment where you can gain different experiences and skills by managing your own career and active networking.  Training is available but is mostly self driven.
good,Over the years it has been a great pleasure working with the people in my group. The Team I was on worked together in day to day activities and helped each other when individuals needed assistance. The day to day work varied depending on coverage when employees were out of during certain days of the month. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to problem solve and create new procedures to make tasks more efficient.
good,"Employees at the high profile divisions (SSgA, SSgM) are treated like royalty.  Divisions that are more of cost centers, have lower morale and people who do not want to stay for long term."
good,"Great people"
good,Great place to start a career in finance and learn the logistics of banking. Workplace culture can be dull at times and boring. Was not much room for career advancement.
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
good,"Just like any company, State Street has its pros and cons. And everyone has it's on perspective. So, not going to say its good or bad company to work for. Everyone has their own opinion."
good,"Although I worked there for a number of years, the constant churn of management has taken its toll.  Not the best place to work long term but it is good experience for adding to your resume and working at a company that is more focused on caring about employees."
good,Overall good experience with a professional environment. Management was good at leveraging company's capabilities and recognizing company's deficiencies.
good,Great place for young professionals to start their careers.  This is a stepping stone for other career advancements or internal advancements.  Great place to network as well.
good,Financial service professional with a high level of integrity and over 10 years of experience. Strong analytical problem solving ability that contributes to the corporations’ over all financial wellbeing. Receptive to change and intellectually curious while in the pursuit of client solutions. An effective team participant with mindset that goals are achieved through collaboration and understanding.
good,I have nothing particularly good nor bad to say about State Street. Just the basic financial company. The pay was not good and the workplace culture is what one would expect at such an industry.
good,"Jobs - Browse Companies - Salaries - Browse Jobs - Employer Events - Blog - About - Help Centre"
good,"Company has a lot of bright individuals in the business, however the business is held back with old technology which limits the productivity levels of employees."
good,"A lot to learn, you will be exposed to many platforms, opportunity to work with people around the world."
good,"Opportunities are available if you're tenacious.  It's a good place to get your foot in the door with a well known bank on your resume. "
good,State Street was a good company to work for. They offer a variety of opportunities for employees to expand their knowledge base and provide them with several outlets to succeed.
good,"Most employees are undervalued and underpaid. There is a high turnover rate because salary is better elsewhere, so many people leave. Career advancement is difficult due to lack of promotion to higher roles."
good,I prefer not to comment since I haven't been working for the Company very long.  The group I work with is very nice and hard working.  I've also met many people I would consider hanging out with after work.
good,The work at State Street was boring as all get out!!  The people were fun to work with but the work was not fun.  Great place though to get your feet wet if you are just getting out of college.
good,Layoffs are frequent making the culture somewhat unstable. This gave me a great look into how the company operates and gave me the ability to form lasting relationships with peers.
good,I had a good time working at State Street while also being a full time student. The office in Hadley was a great environment to get to know the internal company systems.
good,"Typical Corporate Environment. Many different offices globally. Senior Management primarily focused on avoiding political scrutiny, for example implementing gender equality initiatives which is not based off merit but simply gender.  Salaries are either on the lower end as compared to other similar based institutions.  Typical Corporate Environment."
good,Productive company  and I enjoyed working with my coworker and client .I learned a lot during my time and will highly recommended it any friend and family members
good,I enjoyed my time working in the positions that I held over the course of my time there. Those who held managerial positions helped me to grow in my skills related to my positions.
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
good,Ho trovato un ambiente lavorativo stimolante e flessibile
good,CEO preference over majority of people. Company is in transition to new future whereas it be meaningless for the majority of the job seeker to get in.
good,"Pros: The people are great and there are always opportunities to raise your hand and take on a new challenge that can propel your career forward. Just like any other company, your career growth at STT is what you make of it"
good,"good working environment, decent people to work with, relatively average pay and normal benefit. "
good,"The company is definitely feeling expense pressures and influences of technological advances. As it's racing to catch up to the rest of the industries, it's going through major organizational changes to accommodate."
good,"State Street has strong management in place to guide careers and relationships.  Working for the bank provides ton of opportunities to learn about various areas of the financial industry, top to bottom.  You get what you put in to it."
good,"A decent place to work, but not without drawbacks. The work/life balance is often poor, and senior management places pressure on employees with only regard of the compay's benefit. The employees and many of the lower managers are excellent, and there are several sponsored activities to be involved in."
good,not a bad place to start not great as far as pay cannot make many moves unless you play the game and schmooze. Do not give great bonuses or cost of living increases and the raises are 2% if that.
good,"Workload wasn't too heavy but very political office and not much room for growth.  People were very friendly and approachable in the office, willing to help and answer questions."
good,"There is always something new to learn. The environment is deceptively competitive. If you are aligned with the right people, you will succeed. Overall, you get out what you put in ."
good,"Stamford is a nice city, close to NY, but living expense is not much lower than NY. Working environmental is much better, larger space, commute is better,"
good,"Work is good. Busy, competitive. Long commute to work is very discouraging, but it is what it is. Believe that I need a better work-life balance and looking for opportunities outside banking or finance industry, for a change.... Have spent enough years doing banking stuff. Time to move on"
good,"The culture within my team was great, however, because the company is so large culture varies greatly from team to team. The work environment is relaxed."
good,"Flexible scheduling, understanding RD to work under, team players with all disciplines in therapy. Older building design makes functional mobility for patients within rooms a challenge."
good,"Can be highly political, some people work harder than others. Decent place to work if looking for balance. Benefits are ok - high deductible health insurance can be expensive if you have kids."
good,"This was a good starting point and many other companies will gladly steal you away especially after you have been trained."
good,State Stree has a typical large bank service provider culture. It is one of the more service oriented banks that I have worked for. I learned a great deal in how to service institutional clients.
good,Expect to work massive hours of overtime.  Sometimes in excess of 12 hour days.  The pay is substandard for the industry.  Many people work here for 2 to 4 years and leave for greener pastures.  They are off shoring more and more jobs to China.
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
good,"Little rewards, work life balance is very hard to attain in some teams. There are little opportunities to progress. Communication from management was little and far between."
good,"- Good working environment"
good,"The main goal was to maximize shareholder value, do more with less.  Spent the last two years with the company offshoring to India.  Little personal development.  However, it is a good place to start a career in financial services, good benefits, pay is on the low end to start.  Flex time and Flex work"
good,"It was a great place to start a career and get your foot in the door while raising kids.  They do offer flexible work hours and arrangements, which is nice.  Also, the benefits are good as State Street is a large company.  However, as with most large companies, it can be very political and actual work merit is not necessarily enough to advance.  Also, there is ongoing effort to outsource and automate many processes so one's career prospects on the trust and custody side is very uncertain."
good,"Decent place to work, good benefits package pay is ok but could be better.  Work force is split up between a lot of younger people and people who have been there for 15 plus years."
good,"This job had its ups and downs.  I didn't like dealing with some of the clients but for the most part the job and my co-workers were a lot of fun.  Unfortunately, the company was bought out and the job ended."
good,"it was an ok place to work."
good,"Maybe a good place for senior workers; but not a good place for interns and entry levels. Seems no one cared and expected me to do anything. "
good,"Resolved client discrepancies including overdrafts and losses."
good,"Great to work with such a good company and very proud to be an employee as well. "
good,"State Street Corporation, known as State Street, is an American worldwide financial services company. State Street was founded in 1792 and is the second oldest financial institution in the United States of America."
good,Lack of promotions advancement and trouble with transferring to different departments. Advancement beyond a certain point is who you know and how close you are to them
good,"Typical fast paced financial services company.  Good opportunities for employees to move within the company to advance their careers."
good,"State Street is a great place to work especially if you are looking for the work/life balance.  However, the benefits package is poor.  Also, advancement is challenging and there are lots of politics in order for someone to climb."
good,The training may not be sufficient to complete all aspects of the job. Day to day Processes do not change often. Typical required reconciliation of cash.
good,"Able to work alternative work schedule."
good,"State Street is a great place to learn the skills to succeed in your career. They offer great employee perks, but depending on the department you work in be prepared for long working hours."
good,"Flexible working arrangements.  Wish they provided laptops though hate using my personal computer for work stuff."
good,"Great company with a numerous opportunities "
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
good,"good company"
good,"Ok company for starters. Need more work life balance. Custody, accounting and nav pricing experience good for a beginner with little requirements needed to start"
good,"Starting salary is not that great, but definitely room for advancement. A very independent job where you have to learn a lot on your own. New hires need to be gritty, persistent, and work hard."
good,Stable company with good work/life balance. They encourage global / internal mobility. Salary is low for the industry and promotions are hard to come by.
good,First job out of college.  Great place to develop important skills. Corporate culture is somewhat disturbing.. Employees are under-payed for the amount of work and time they put in.
good,This is a good company if you have blinders on and are happy doing the same job repetitively.  If you want to advance they will notice you and offer some challenges.  You must be proactive however.
good,"Bad training process - you sit and watch someone perform the job for a week and then start on your own funds. Only are taught to solve the problems that come up in that week. Extremely high turnover in the Derivatives team due to heavy and increasing workloads, lots of hours, and minimal compensation -- even for experienced workers."
good,"Large company with a long history, above average benefits, but very hard to stand out.  Lots of bureaucracy.  Not as nimble as start-ups.  Large global reach"
good,"The job was fine. The job was quite fine.  The job was certainly fine. Fine is how I would describe the job.  In my opinion, I had a fine experience at the job."
good,"There is no clear path for job promotion or salary raise. It might be a good place for students fresh out of college, definitely not for long term career development."
good,"After 19 years it was ok, If you work hard good pay but when they need to down size not good. The benefits were good at first but towards the end they were not"
good,State is a pretty good place to work.  People are easy to work with but systems and processes are outdated. They do offer work from home for jobs that will allow this.
good,"Institutional accounting and management of corporate 401k, 403b and 457 plans. "
good,Built the business from ground up was exciting and difficult.  Put new ideas in play but each client wanted different reports and was difficult to assimilate are the requirements.
good,The Management is not as per mark. I am working as contractor from Syntel inc.in State street. Management always showing the gap between employee and  contractor.
good,"Good work life balance for the majority of the year apart from when several funds become due, then overtime will be required. However, far less than manny previous places I have worked. A standard day will be the review of UK investment funds, which could be any component of the financial statements. There is opportunity got further learning and to pro-actively improve skills and knowledge. The canteen is pretty good and serves really good subsidised meals."
good,I am working on a very profitable product as a software developer. Team is good and management is also supportive.  Compensation and benefits are good too.
good,"Pricing,time management,reporting,data analysis, Pnl on Funds,Bloomberg/Reuters exposure plus various other vendors. Exposure to market activities amongst securities such as Fixed income,equities etc"
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
good,"good experience with team life"
good,"High pressure and stressful atmosphere with tight deadlines. As a result, work days were long and tenuous but a necessity in this industry. I learned how to micromanage multiple tasks given limited time constraints and how to coordinate with other fund owners on a daily basis. Moreover, the workplace is ripe with young, talented overachievers which inspires you to do your best work consistently. Overall, an eyeopening and invaluable experience and opportunity that I am thankful to have under my belt."
good,Good place to work to get entry level experience. Look forward to utilizing the skills I learned to leverage my career growth and professional development.
good,Very good for parents who need flex hours/ working from home options. Friendly atmosphere within the company. Very supportive with progression and development

good,"Agile development environment, demanding work loads, growth/promotion opportunities for productive staff. Flexible work schedules including work from home."
good,"Long hours"
good,"Good place to begin career. Tough to move up within the company, and tough to continue learning because most entry level roles are very narrow in scope."
good,"Worked part-time as a manual processor in Global Ops in Hadley, MA.  Good work-life balance in addition to being a full time student."
good,"The salary for entry-level jobs is way below the market, this place is only good to put your feet at the door. Good work-life balance"
good,The managers are great.  There can be opportunities to move up quickly for a great career. You can be a subject matter expert in certain areas of the business or have a broad understanding of everything.
good,Many deadlines. Significant oversight. Superior time management is essential for this line of business. Management and co-workers were all highly qualified and easy to work with.
good,"worked at State street right out of College, I t was my first experience in the financial world. I will be forever grateful for everything I learned. I learned a lot there"
good,"The company is well-established and reputable. However, the management is lacking in various aspects. The nature of the job is very monotone and not intellectually challenging for those that look for more than just a pay check."
good,"Don't learn a lot, no opportunity to go above and beyond. Don't value the employees or their development. Good place to start out of college but would leave quickly."
good,"State Street was great for my work experience and growth. I did well and progressed nicely through the ranks and learned an incredible amount about fund accounting, custody work, client facing operations and management. "
good,"For the most part, employees are working almost each other in teams specific to their skills and knowledge basis. Everyone is approachable and independent work is a crucial aspect to the working culture here."
good,"I only worked here for a few months, but I was able to see in that short time that State Street was a great company. I learned a lot during my internship, and it has helped me throughout my life after college."
good,Fast-paced deadline-oriented environment. The associates in the operations groups are knowledgeable and motivated. Work/life balance can be cyclically impossible depending upon the business area. Task variety is challenging in a good way; a person can develop many useful skills.
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
good,Typical financial services company.  Diverse environment to service client base in most of the leading investment vehicles that are currently on the market.
good,"Corporate atmosphere and people were good to work with, lots of collaboration, however company wide lay-offs occurred too frequently."
good,"Pros"
good,"I was a summer intern at State Street in Kansas City, MO. The pay for interns and full-time is very low compared to other companies. All of the employees act like they hate their job."
good,The company is a great company to start off with you learn a lot of knowledge. I went in there knowing not much on investments and now i have increases my knowledge ten fold.
good,This was a great experience that provided me with a broad introduction to fixed income and ETF portfolio management. Was able to work closely with both portfolio managers and executives.
good,"Pros"
good,"	Monitor payments due from clients and promptly contacted clients with past due payments."

good,"Excellent place to start within the financial industry as State Street is globally recognized, operates in many markets and is constantly seeking to innovate."
good,"-Good for entry-level opportunities to gain foundations"
good,"State Street does a great job of training, with a dedicated staff and lots of tools available to make you successful.  It has a professional environment and interesting work.  The starting salary is far below industry standards.  Advancement can be very quick or take years depending on your team."
good,probs the dopest place of work i've ever worked at. Every day was sick. It was like the company motto was YOLO because we just always had a blast.
good,Working there was always interesting. The company is mainly sticking with contract workers. Which sucks but it was a cool place to work. One of their benefits is that you can spend two paid days a year volunteering.
good,"Good place to learn. Got an opportunity to work on a market leading tool for financial crime."
good,Too much politics too little importance on real work. Heavily saturated with people who have been with the company 20+ years. Change is not accepted at all. Most people only care about keeping their jobs and surviving the next layoff.

good,The hardest part of the job is working from home most of the time which lead to less interaction with co-workers within the team.
good,The office environment is fast paced with opportunity to learn from team members. A good amount of overtime but with support from the company for career development. The most enjoyable part of the job are the people.
good,"I had a decent experience at State Street. They treated me professionally, but I didn't see tremendous growth potential. I left to go to law school"
good,Fast paced high volume work environment. Something new to learn every day. Certain times of the month and year are more stressful than others but that is to be expected in this field. Not very easy to move forward since there is a large competition and very high turnover rate for lower associates.
good,"Poor office culture - people wear headphones, not very interactive. Although the company itself is well credible. It really depends on what department you are in!"
good,"Open door policy"
good,"the office is comprised of cube farms"
good,"Came in, ran my received deposits from my bank account, pulled my research, allowing me to apply the appropriate payments, to the appropriate accounts. If money didn't belong to me, I wired those funds to the correct bank account. completed my recon, then performed my data entry for the day. With the time remaining, I would run my bills and check them, for preparation to send out to our Client Ops team, where they would check and advise of any issues with the bills, I would then correct and return, repeat then work, if needed, other wise, the ops team would then send the bill out to the client for there approval/payment process."

good,There is a great feel of Global inclusion. Every team works together to meet deadlines. Co-workers are friendly.Hardwork and initiative is needed at all times to meet the needs of Clients.
good,"Job is monotonous and management is unfair to employees.  No recognition and hardly any bonus compensation for good work.  Management treat employees like school kids waiting for the bell to ring to go home even though work has been completed.  No dinners or lunch bought for the group working late nights for month/quarter/year end reporting.  There is practically no incentives."
good,I work as an Accountant/Tax Accountant on a daily basis. I prepared financial accounts for clients and tax forms for individual and businesses. I review the work of other employees.
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
good,Good place to get your foot in the door.  Experience really depends on group you work within.  Training system could be improved.  Strange corporate culture.

good,"The job was excellent in that there was always new information for tax treaties, so never a dull day. The days always flew by, lots of responsibilities.

good,"It is a great company. I have learned a lot from my experience of state street. the co-workers are nice and working culture are up-lift."
good,State Street is willing to train new employees.  The turnover ratio is high in Fund Accounting.
good,"Working in several different departments. A typical day would be coding the prior day's accounts with overdrafts and providing comments, as to whether not the client will be charged. Throughout the day answering time-sensitive emails on accounts that are overdraw, and contacted the group that handles it to determine if the overdraft will remain or if there will be coverage. Also throughout the day, I am reconciling accounts with discrepancies between accounting and the custody/client side. Prioritizing by the monetary  amount and the age of the item. Management is accessible for any escalations or issues. Co-workers are helpful. Hardest part of the job is researching and finding a solution within a limited time. The most enjoyable part of the job is the sense achievement when you've resolved a very aged item or high dollar item."
good,This is a good company where you can learn a lot. You can advance if you work hard and learn their business.
good,Positive work environment.  Great people.  Would work there in the future.
good,Good company to start your career as a fresher in terms of learning and compensation.
good,"I have learned how to become a valuable leader, and how to communicate with other memeber of my group.  I have learned how to prioritize certain tasks that are more time sensative."
good,"This particular group within State Street Global Services doesn't necessarily bring in the most revenue for STT, but it was a great place to intern. This team services the business development arm of State Street's Investment Management Services and was a great place to intern and gain some client-facing experience."
good,A typical work day involves meeting multiple deadlines.  I've learned a wide variety of computer skills and knowledge of the financial industry.  Management is knowledgeable and eager to show or teach you anything you ask them to.  Hardest part of the job is taking on a heavy workload with multiple deadlines throughout the day
good,"Worst job ever. Terrible culture and pay. I wish I had never taken that job, almost ruined my career."
good,Don't compensate employees and pay a low percentage of benefits.
good,"Got good review, but chance to advance within company wasn't easy.  Hoping that has changed by now. "
good,"State Street is a great place to learn the business, there are many departments to move around which gives employees a chance to better understand how a major financial corporation works. "
good,"Over all very good place to work , management was excellent. the support staff was excellent"
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
good,"The staff was very young, positive and eager to learn. Great place  for college grads."
good,"NA - I respectfully decline from giving any further poor reviews for it's unprofessional.  If you are reading this I would say, ""read between the line, this isn't a good review for this company"".  Good luck if you decide to take a position with them."
good,"a typical day ..Started at 700am and finished 3 rd left overs and then went on to our daily work which consisted user requests and monitored pre programmed jobs that would run that would on their own Learned many IT protocols management was old school, coworkers great bunch of people "
good,"Average Workplace.Good location.Good people."
good,"•	Review reports prepared by colleagues to identify and track entries that impact NAVs"
good,A decent company but they definitely need to stop with the total overall company changes. It is getting a bit overbearing and I also feel that a change is needed.
good,"I am a consultant in SS. Work is good depending on the project you work in. sometimes when you get involved in production issues, it eats a lot of your development time."
good,"Testing new technology and train the team members"
good,"Solid foundation in financial services, the place where 90% of people start there careers.  Most leave after a year or two to other smaller financial companies or within State Street to SSGA.  High turnover is a negative."
good,"While working at State Street Corporation, I was fortunate enough to work with C-level executives while learning about all of the different areas of the companies. "
good,Good entry level position for finance and growth. Global company with many opportunities to grow and diversify.
good,"Low pay, high turnover. Much of the Middle office, operations jobs hire out young ""worker bee"" types who will work at the job for a year or two and then leave. This causes project management issues."
good,"One of the best things about working for State Street was the flexible schedule.   Between the flex schedule, the compressed work weeks and the work from home options, the work/life balancing act was easier to manage."
good,A typical day consisted of updating reports. Weekends often required because my boss was inundated with incorrect figures from his spreadsheets. Co-workers were difficult to deal with because they were spread out not according to their department.
good,"Very challenging workplace, hard work will get you more work.  Workload and expectations are difficult to manage work/life."
good,Worked on process improvement projects. Co-workers were enjoyable to work with.
good,its a good company to start your career with but management isn't really engaged nor inspiring.
good,The firm was a supportive and educational foundation for the rest of my career.
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
good,Typical day was monotonous.   Great name but didn't feel valued as an employee.
good,"Requires attention to detail, ability to multi task, working under strict deadlines."
good,"The typical day at work is always working  I have learned to resolve issues.  My co-workers are ok.  The hard part of the job is workload is over loaded and short staffs."
good,There was not much room for advancement and the pay could have been much better.
good,"At the time, the work load was large, and there was no incentive to stay.  Long hours!"
good,"good people with a lot of opportunity. i learned about fund accounting and custody accounting."
good,I have been working in State street as Wipro Consultant for more 2 years. I worked in Transaction management analysis team. All of my co-workers are really helpful. i have learned so much from working in state street 
good,I dont feel there is any job security with the company. Moving up the corporate latter seems nearly impossible.
good,I have been with State Street Corporation for a long time. I enjoy the people and the company but I wish to advance in the field of business continuity and there are no opportunities for advancement in this role at my company.
good,SSgA is one of the largest asset managements firms in the world.
good,"The job was interesting and overall it is a good place to work. However, it seems that some co-workers do not care much about being social and meeting new hires which can make some days long."
good,"Good place to work, wish there was more flexibility. Day to day every position has thing due and deliverables to clients. Local management is really good but some have been promoted to quickly. One of the best parts of the jobs are the co-workers are great!!"
good,"Even though I made 42.000 after 15 years, I was able to do the work of 2 employees, came in every day and had a less margin of being sick. I was able to meet the clients needs via telephone or placing trades on the pc. I was able to multi task to ensure all deadlines were met. When procedures changed, I had to write my own ones, as upper management was to handle that procedure due to pay grade and shared it with my fellow co workers to ensure when I had days off, would process the trades to avoid a loss, trades up to millions of dollars as we reconiled and paid interest at the end of the month. The job training was nil and you had to wing it. I was one of the top notch employees who handled a heavy timeline, and set up funds inbetween never having a break."
good,"Booking trade, and giving my manager a report of incoming and out going incomes of the funds"
good,State Street is a good place to start a career and an excellent opportunity to learn more about the financial service industry. The managers are helpful and great mentors. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to meet and interact with great people.
good,Good people to work with on the job and good learning environment.
good,"It is a company that only focuss on making profit and looks good on the book,and not about quality."
good,I enjoyed the client relations and problem solving aspect of the position the best.
good,It was exciting working in the mutual fund industry and fun working with recent graduates.
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
good,the hardest part of the job is manaing the people. the most enjoyable part is figuring out an issue or working closely with the team so a sto meet deadlines and get the job done.
good,"Great enrty level positon to work afrer college, and get the experience. Very talented staff to learn from."
good,"I've gained a lot of experience and knowledge from my current role, unfortunately the opportunity for advancement i had hoped for isn't there. This has lead to me to look into other opportunities to further my career as well as expand my knowledge of the securities industry."
good,"State Street has been improving their worklife balance approach, entailing a work from home day once a week, and are flexible around needing time off."
good,Although i have learned alot from working here I feel there is no career advancement or job security. I enjoy the people i work with and we all work great as a team which makes things a lot easier. Month end and quarter ends would be the most difficult part of the job we have almost 300 funds to close.
good,Decent place if you want to grow in your initial career years and have big name on your resume.
good,I have worked here going on five years now and am grateful for the entry level position as well as multiple promotions that I have received in the years since. Having said that it is an extremely large company where it is difficult to get recognized.
good,State Street was a great first place to work! Employees are all friendly.
good,"I was working here as a consultant. they clearly distinguish between and employee and a consultant. Felt out of place, uncomfortable and unhappy working for them. May be its a different world as a employee."
good,Very reputed firm in US. Not as much known in India. Good with employee benefits. India management is still new. Internal job movements are easy. Mobility is possible.
good,"I joined State Street fresh out of college, so for me it was a good starting point at gaining some professional experience within a business setting. But, like most large companies, your experience at State Street will largely be decided on the team that you ultimately end up joining."
good,The culture is great. Colleagues are willing to assist and help inside an overall team environment. Everyone wants you to succeed. Mgmt needs better communication with employees.
good,There was no typical day at work as it varied every day depending on what kind of trades went through. Good workplace culture with a young and helpful workforce.
good,"busy with over time"
good,"massive layoffs over last ten years or so have made the environment very uncomfortable and negative"
good,Company is very good in terms of the services they provide and the work the have but the management is very poor in every aspect. Working there is a nice experience one can get
good,"Work life balance was great here as they give you 3 weeks PTO, but management needs to be more well structured.The most enjoyable part of the job is working with great coworkers."
good,"Company has a good work culture."
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
good,"Environment is okay to work, great career for a fresher, biased management, no career growth. People who look for longer stay cannot stick around as biased management. Lack of good transport facility."
good,"Typical working hours is 45 in a week, meaning 9 hours a day excluding 1 hour break. Over time is minimal. High standards delivered to the client with greater accuracy."
good,Teams have a lot of leeway on how things are run so your experience will vary greatly.  They continue to move many functions overseas and are constantly reducing the headcount in Massachusetts.
good,I do not want to write a review however i am required to put something in this part for you to accept my earlier answers which I want to submit. I only need to reach the character minimum.
good,Personally I felt that the IT department needed much better leadership. Many of the IT VP were not really experienced in IT to be a VP. They lacked motivation skills and were not technically inclined. Mostly they would choose IT applications based on vendor recommendations instead of practical application of the application.
good,The job just like any other can become repetitive. What i enjoyed most was the opportunity to partake in other activities that were of interest to em and helped further my knowledge and experience.
good,"Learnt a lot about investment banking. Enjoy working with management and have the opportunity to work from home anytime."
good,"Most of the people at State Street are great to work with and are more than happy to provide direction and give you the freedom to do your job autonomously and are open to questions as needed."
good,"It used to be a great place to work however in the last 10 years morale has been gradually declining.  Ever since the 2008 financial crisis there has been more scrutiny, more admin overhead and a growth in outsourcing making it more difficult to get things done"
good,"State Street Corporation was a great experience. My manager always provided new opportunities for me to learn by giving me multiple assignments and tasks. However, it can get repetitive."
good,"The benefits are great, the salary not so much. I have appreciated my time here and learned a ton. They are starting to outsource though and it’s time to look elsewhere in KC anyway."
good,"If you like to work at home this is the right company for you, 80% of people work from home.  the workplace is very quiet when people do come to work. I have great coworkers that have really taught me some good things about the new systems."
good,"I was with the company for 10+ years, there was not much room for advancement,  I didn't find many open opportunities to develop skills outside of operations. They have great parent leave options and generous vacation time.  I appreciated working with a collaborative group."
good,"good thing about statestreet is they are very flexible for work from home. So if you have family with small kids, and money isnt most important, work here"
good,"Diverse experience is great but not enough people to share the workload"
good,"As far as the overall company as a whole, they are pretty great. The benefits are top notch, but I would say the exact opposite is the case for the team I am on now. I work 6-3, no designated lunch, we are unable to attend any of the company networking or training events. We are also not able to participate in the company kickball or dodgeball events."
good,"High turnover rate, poor pay for new joiners and some managers act in their own best interests. Definitely a wide range of personal experiences possible there though as a lot of people dont leave."
good,"State street is a good company to work for but not a company where you want to grow your career. Also, the company have a great benefit on the 401K plan but not the healthcare plan"
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
good,Being my first 3rd role in finance I felt there was a lack of warmth and for me that made the environment feel lackluster and dry. Only the benefits provided by the company and compensation I see is what keeps people.
good,"Nice environment, not stressful, ideal if you want to have a life out of work. Cons: a lot of temps, no possibility to become perm. Additionally, they're now moving the department to Poland and a lot of people are losing their jobs."
good,"State Street Bank is a company with IT which is 10 years behind the industry because of their lack of guts in risk taking and heavy dependency on contractors."
good,"Local management is good, but the expectations and resources provided are unrealistic.  Hours can exceed 60hrs a week on heavy cycle periods.  Managers will put in as many hours as you, but overall its not sustainable."
good,State Street Global Markets is a good place to 'start' or 'end' your career for a majority of those in the industry. People do not typically gravitate to State Street Global Markets when they are a star in the industry unless it is for compensation.
good,"State Street is a good starting point for a career there is a lot you can learn here if you put the effort in. There is a good social life but that really all depends on your team. "
good,"The culture and work life balance depends on the group you work in and your manager. Every year there does seem to be a focus on cutting costs which seems to result in losing head count. There is a big push to move functions to low cost locations and as result when someone leaves your team it is almost impossible to have them be replaced. "
good,"Tätigkeiten: leicht wenig komplex"
good,"The corporate culture at the State Street Sacramento office is relatively relaxed. The dress code only requires that you where pants (jeans ok) without any holes in them, non-athletic shoes (Vans are ok) and a collared shirt. The management is competent and helpful. The starting salary is fairly low and because State Street is so large there is a lot of red tape."
good,I started in State Street as an A2 and quickly found that the work-life balance leans heavily towards work. The roles are end to end so if you are looking to learn about the industry and don't mind psi overtime then it's a great place to start your career in fund administration. There are opportunities to cross train and move up once you gin some experience however you will be expected to work unsociable hours at times without notice so be prepared for this. Management are keen to help with advancement and are generally experienced. The most enjoyable par of the job is the people.
good,"I worked for the company right out of college and gained a lot of experience and knowledge.  Had a couple of promotions, but there were many layoffs which I was involved in.  Great entry level position for someone out of college, but wouldn't expect to make a career there."
good,"After being there for nearly 10 years, I have decided to look for a better fit for my career life at this time. Overall not a bad place to work if it fits your life style."
good,"The people that work at SSC are wonderful, smart people. Upper management is currently trying to retain talented but at the same time there are many announcements of layoffs."
good,"This is a great company to work for directly out of college or with a few years experience. Typical work days, 9-5. The work can be monotonous. The salaries and benefits aren't as competitive with similar banks/firms/companies and I continuously saw the loss of talent as employees advanced. Employers like seeing this reputable firms name on a resume."
good,"State Street is  great company to work in. You learn a lot. A typicl day could be"
good,"I was in charge of completing monthly tasks such as TERs, KPI's, Monthly calender reviews, BNAV Macros and monthly TNAs to Finance. I also had to answer any queries the client had on NAV calculations, was responsible for posting management fees and state streets to accounting. I had many of daily tasks also such as obtaining and sending daily trials to finance. "
good,"Forward-thinking, great work-life balance.  Large company with lots of potential for growth.  Management is supportive, however, systems could be more current."
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
good,State Street gives you a lot of flexibility with home/work life.  Management is always willing to help you move up the ladder and the company reimburse you for studies.
good,"Good Team helped me to learn things. Always enjoyed support from senior associates to resolve the issues. "
good,It's good place to work. work culture is also good overall. but for a guy who wants aggressive growth or learning this is not the place. the company does give you a lot of opportunity but you may have to wait a little longer for it.
good,You can really make a name for yourself if you're smart and you work hard. It won't take long to be recognized and you'll be a big fish in a little pond.
good,"Job is busy, management is hands off.  Hard to have work life balance as every day is a different time frame of when you are getting off work ranging from 5 PM to 8 PM.  Benefits/retirement are good, however, you have to work holidays because you are following international markets."
good,"fast paced environment , technologically advanced. required a lot of overtime and being connected to the job 7 days a week"
good,Compensation at State Street is below industry average but offer many opportunities for advancement and growth. Great organization for new graduates looking for their first job.
good,"Good company with a lot of structure.   Due to series of layoffs there are far fewer employees to do same amount of work.   However, company has a strong culture on flexible work and encourages it where feasible.   Benefits are very competitive.   Great group of employees."
good,A good company to work for but varies between different departments. High turnover and lots of talks of layoffs bring down company morale.
good,State Street is a great place to get your career started. It is a great stepping stone. I have learned a lot here working here for the past 4 years. But I feel it is time to move forward and find something bigger and better. I want a career that is more challenging and that will push me to do more.
good,It was a good starting experience but the corporate environment was a bit stifling. It had the feeling of a data entry factory. Every raise bonus and promotion has to fit in the corporate best practices structure.
good,Typical big bank atmosphere.  Fast paced environment.  Hard to get noticed. Going above & beyond is the norm.  Flex and work life balance only for a select few and rare in client facing roles.
good,"there isnt much to this job, although there is a lot to learn. had to learn how to use State Streets systems and databases in order to do daily work. there is nothing too difficult about this job. as long as you are sensible and make good ethical choices, there should be no problems. working on a team was nice, even if some of them are super negative about life as a whole.  this job is the most difficult in the beginning, but after a couple of months, its easy."
good,"Good for entry level position but not a very good money to start with. Fast paced environment, 10 - 6:30 pm hours. Channel Center offices at the sea port."
good,"My department was always busy with deployments, upgrades, and data migrations.  It always kept me on my toes and busy which makes the weeks go by quick, My managers were also hard workers so it made it easy to come in and work hard."
good,"State Street is a very big company. One department varies a lot from the other, because it is too big to ensure same kind of management. My department is the typical one that treated employees all the same. By saying all the same means that excellent people are not recognized among the other people. Other than that, State Street has its charm that comes from the grandness of the company and the myriad business it is handling."
good,"Very busy workload daily and a lot of research work for  clients. I've learned that always treat clients with calmness and respect.  Hectic environment, difficult management but nice and professional coworkers."
good,"This company is a great place to start your career.  However, it is unlikely you will move up the ladder without knowing someone that likes you, even if your performance reviews are excellent and worth of a promotion."
good,"This company offers so many training programs to excel and advance yourself.  SS has so much to offer such as tuition reimbursement options.  "
good,"-support and education is offered when you first start in the role"
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
good,"There was always something new with State Street each and every day. The hardest part of the job was not being trained properly. It was a hands on learn as you go process so I experienced ups and downs with the job. I met many good people and became close to clients all around the country. I learned much about the financial system, and the ins and outs of investment management and accounting for many firms."
good,"•	Managed a portfolio of funds with twenty billion in total assets consisted of multiple sub advisor relationships for various investment products."
good,"State Street Tax is a pretty good place to learn about RIC tax and to manage different types of people. They are much more automated in their tax processes then any other job I have worked at. However, advancement is tough to achieve.The major plus with working with SSB tax is the great people you work with and the relaxed environment."
good,A progressive company that offers advancement with great benefits
good,Flexible work environment that allows you to work from home.
good,State Street is a great place to gain some experience and break into the financial services industry. They provide a solid training program as long as you are willing to seek out the training. This is a great place for college grads to get their feet wet but they may find themselves wanting to move elsewhere after a year or so. Promotions are based on tenure and not performance and salaries are below industry average. I do value the experience I have gained here but I am looking to move out of the back-office environment. Upper management (VP and up) is solid but there is a disconnect between their managing techniques and those of team managers.
good,"Pros:  Coworkers are all very nice, management tends to be relaxed."
good,I enjoyed working in the banking industry. I was there for a good amount of time. Sometimes I wish I'd stayed in banking although you never know.
good,State Street is a great place to start and and bad place to finish.
good,"I work in a team that is spread across the globe which makes it challenging to schedule meetings and develop relationships. I currently act as a key liaison to the client, a subject matter expert and a project manager. I have received a lot of valuable experience and training in my current role both in terms of project management and client services. I have a great relationship with my clients and co workers but the industry has faced a lot of challenges in the past and I'm looking for a fresh start."
good,Most enjoyable part was the team
good,Lots to learn about financial operations.
good,Better than average benefits. Flexible work schedules. I learned a lot about the manual testing process and software quality assurance as a whole. There was also some opportunity for me to develop more marketable skills (e.g. VBA software programming).
good,The company's work is very easy to pick up and learn and the mangers are very nice.
good,"Great Jumping off point from college, lots of activities to keep employees engaged and involved in the community."
good,Good company to work for. Good Work life balance. However growth is slow with too many hierarchical levels. Annual appraisal is not good with less annual bonus.
good,"Good job to get into the corporate world, but you will be broke! I would suggest to try and get an internship here instead of working full time. However, the management is very nice, knowledgeable and understanding."
good,"State Street has good benefits, great vacation benefits, flex work arrangements (work from home). The company is moving a lot of work overseas which is their greatest fault."
good,"Menial work but the team is great. As an intern, you can interact with multiple different departments ranging from different levels. It has a very flat hierarchy."
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
good,"Good work/life balance but without a sense of belonging."
good,"Need structured training for employees offsite. Company needed updated technology, policies and procedures. The employees in general were friendly. The company extended me the opportunity to participate in developing their training modules"
good,"- Nice Experience"
good,Very busy work environment. Limited room for grow. flexible work. Good work life balance. Benefit and compensation not industry standard. High turnover rate.
good,I would suggest State Street require any persons who are becoming a manager to take a management course and get certificate in management. Too many inexperienced managers trying to collaborate and manage a team.
good,"Good environment and management is very approachable and helpful, however it is a big disconnection between low level and upper management. Upper management forces practices and policies without consulting with lower management and without proper knowledge of the outcome of these policies. People are treated as numbers by upper management, however lower management puts tremendous efforts to fix upper management mistakes. People are worked very hard while compensation lack by much compared to competition."
good,I worked alongside some other college students performing operations for SS' institutional investors.  The various functions within some databases was difficult to learn at first.
good,"Good place to learn things. I used to be valuation analyst, worked with PhD level quants and they knew things. Some things i learned too from them and on my own."
good,"It was an okay job to work at, I worked part time only 5 hours a day.I had a few concerns to where they complaint too much, felt the job that i did wasn't good enough for them. I felt that i was overworked in a short matter of time that i had to be there. But i was happy that i worked there with wonderful co workers and an understanding boss."
good,Typical financial services company. Senior management are not helpful and projects are done at a do as it is pace. Meetings are always cancelled and training is minimal.
good,"There's a lot to like about this company. One thing that lacked was that everyone was on the same playing field. That means the slackers still received the same pay as those who enjoyed their job or who were looking for a raise. However, job performance reviews often resulted in bonuses as opposed to permanent raises. The pay is sufficient, and with the included benefits, it's doable but greater financial return for the work would be greatly appreciated."
good,"There are many job opportunities that will allow you to further your career. The people are great and there are always opportunities to raise your hand and take on a new challenge that can propel your career forward. Just like any other company, your career growth at State Street is what you make of it. The company is investing in its people and technology which is great."
good,I was given a wonderful opportunity to work with State Street for 6 years. It was a good and supportive environment for financial minded professionals. Unfortunately my aspirations were toward human services.
good,"To be honest, I would not recommend State Street to others. I interned there because it was a large global company but I didn't like the culture that much"
good,"The people are great and there are always opportunities to raise your hand and take on a new challenge that can propel your career forward. Just like any other company, your career growth at STT is what you make of it."
good,"Overall good place to work, but salary and benefits are low, and not a lot of career advancement. seems like the structure of the company is weighted for employees to only be average."
good,"No career advancement, look elsewhere for good career. If you care about your career and developing your career, i would certainly look else where. Good place to gain experience though"
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
good,"A very stressful environment. layoffs and more work is compiled to the remaining employees. "
good,"A typical day at work consists of processing and reviewing daily, monthly, and annual reporting. Coordinating team and individual training sessions on audit, compliance, and team procedures."
good,"It's a great company to work for.  At this point in my career, I'm looking forward to find something new.  A lot of talented and smart people at the company."
good,Very low pay and bonus structure for type of work/industry.  Consistently waited for other departments to complete their work in order to finish work in my department.
good,It is a good place to work for a recent college graduate to gain some professional working experience. Currently they are closing some departments because of the new office that has just been opened in India.
good,"State Street is a company that is what you make of it.  The most successful people will always be the ones with their own end-goal and that do whatever it takes to achieve it."
good,it's an okay place to work for after graduating from College. Don't expect getting a lot from it. You will learn a lot if your manager is willing to sit with you and explain what needs to be done. I figure things out by myself because there weren't people there to train you. Manager's can be a joke and unprofessional. It depends on what client you work for.
good,"Overall I had a good experience at State Street, but I was one of the lucky people to have a manager who truly cares about his employees. The company is changing slowly for the better. Many teams have been converted to Agile teams, which has resulted in a more dynamic environment. The management, however, is still very resistant to change and the disruptive nature of Agile."
good,Good work/life balance off-set by slow-moving decision making and below average compensation. Poor decisions by parent (bank) has limited options for the asset management business.
good,"Great people, I actually enjoy working here. It is such a great opportunity to develop new skills and grow. In the other hand it is very difficult to balance life and work. However, i enjoy it and will see whats next."
good,"Depending on your role at State Street, there is typically a good work/life balance as they encourage employees to work from home whenever possible.  If you are working in operations, you'll have many daily deadlines and a faster pace of work.  Corporate function roles typically are less deadline oriented and have a better work/life balance."
good,"great place to work, culture was great and people always smiles. Fund account are balance.  accounts not balance.  management was great.greag taking on new customer accounts"
good,"Can be very pressurise at times. Initial departmental training needs work."
good,"You can expect ending up working long hours in particular in operational teams. However, colleagues are great, very professional  and make it all worthwhile."
good,"Good place to begin career. Tough to move up within the company, and tough to continue learning because most entry level roles are very narrow in scope."
good,"Great People, Interesting Work, Bad Work/Life Balance - if your salaried, So-So Compensation, Benefits used to be alright but they recently cut educational assistance, they are starting to offshore most associate roles and soon to be senior associate roles but limit the amount the offshore teams can be responsible for so the work is getting pushed up."
good,"It is a big company, so you need to make yourself visible to the right people. Show good work ethic and you will be presented with new opportunities. Good benefits, pay could be more."
good,"Low stress, nice people, slow pace; "
good,"It's a daily routine to login in the morning , check your mails"
good,Compensation is not very high. All benefits are offered and growth opportunities are there for people who are willing to work for them. The hours vary which make scheduling out of work activities difficult. Good work for resume/experience building.
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
good,"Great place if you're NOT an admin who tend to be thrown projects by up and coming consultants who don't want to do their own work, and you always need to find ""back-up"" if you're out of the office for even an hour!"
good,Many opportunities for advancement assuming a hard work ethic and willingness to put in the hours. Being placed on the right client and right position will make you a valuable employee and allow you opportunities to travel.
good,nice place to learn a lot.  new work always available but not enough time to learn the work that you already have.  nice people. but very long hours.  compensation is good
good,"I really like my job which was Wire Transfer Investigation. They outsourced my group's job to Canada and put us to the other group which I had no experience, so I ended up with layoff."
good,"work from home and flexible hours are desirable, but salary will never be increased by more than 3% per year. Diversified environments with good people."
good,This is a great company and a job experience for young people entering Finance industry. Iconic building in the center of a beautiful City.
good,"Pros:"
good,Not a bad place to get in to the the Financial industry but employees were somewhat miserable and just worked for a paycheck.
good,"A typical day at work is coming in every morning and looking at the teams work flow and deadlines, taking a workload management meeting with my team of 6 and delegating where necessary.  Throughout the day I must track all deadlines and work alongside colleagues to ensure these are done.  Out with workload management I attend management meetings, Site meetings and Client meetings.  I look at the teams statistics and workload volumes for the week ahead.  I am also the point of contact for the team for any questions or assistance they need.  I am also responsible for checking the majority of the workload done by the team on a daily basis, this is a requirement due to the risk involved.  I enjoy working alongside my colleagues and love it when we are able to work together to get things done as a team, there is much satisfaction in completion of high volumes in an accurate manner.  The hardest part of my job would be market changes to ensure the clients expectations are met at all times."
good,State Street offers many flex schedule options including work from home schedules and flex hours.
good,"-Day to day tasks are vey repetitive"
good,"I did fund accounting for about 130 funds. I have worked with futures funds, fund of funds, fixed income funds, swap funds, and some multiclass funds. The funds never really have alot of activity on them unless its after a pricing day. Because thats when shareholders could buy and sell into the fund. The fund group I worked in was pretty small they do a really good job of training everyone and making sure you able to to the daily task on your own."
good,"A typical day at work consists of reconciling breaks with our recon team in Ireland in excel based files through email communication. We start the day answering emails and doing our daily tasks such as posting bond interest, finance fees, corporate actions, realized cash, and booking trades and ledgers."
good,Things are constantly changing at State Street to improve the business.  The management is highly engaged in day to day activities.  The hardest part of the job is the potential for stress. The most enjoyable is the numerous opportunities for advancement.
good,"Great place to start a career, however many people end up stagnant in one role."
good,Co-workers are very knowledgeable and understand the job the do. The company is very supportive of volunteering in the community.
good,"Same day to day routine ... mostly invidiual work, but I would like to have a job where I can get more involved with the actual job title."
good,Decent job out of college. The pay is well below industry standards but we are told that will begin to change.
good,"Process trades on a timely basis in order to keep your internal and external clients happy.  Communicate with Investment Managers for FTTOP procedures for audit purposes. "
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
good,"Good place to gain exposure to and an understanding of, the financial services industry."
good,"State Street provides an excellent opportunity to experience all aspects of the financial industry. State Street encourages its employees to utilize programs such as online training, and flexible scheduling. The company recognizes employees whom are hard working and find solutions to improve back office operations."
good,"A great group of individuals who are honest and understanding. As of the moment, the Berwyn office is only hiring on contract and this leads to a lack of job security."
good,"Great company name and values, but senior management does not know how to compensate based on performance and do not let employees progress to advanced levels unless if they complete the 1-year mark."
good,"A typical day would start around 8:30 AM and end around 5:30 PM. I learned a lot about process control, project management and resource management."
good,Great company to start career. Co workers are great. Accommodating to work/life balance.
good,"Fun place to work, salary not great, advancement possible."
good,"State Street is a very solid place to work if you're looking for something steady and standard in a corporate setting. It's just not an outstanding place to be. There's a strong feeling of stagnancy and inertia. The company is aware and pursuing a strategy of repairing this through multiple employee engagement campaigns and more competitive recruiting, but the fact stands that there's a strong clash of cultures between old-school family-oriented employees and young and cut-throat business kids. If you're looking for genuine diversity of thought and culture, this isn't the place for you. If you're seeking a means to pay the bills (and put aside some hefty retirement savings) while keeping a relatively uneventful work life, this is a great place."
good,"1.	Remained extensively organized to meet tight deadlines for cash expectations, client review packages and cash sweep"
good,"State Street is a fast paced environment, that allows motivated individuals to advance within the company. "
good,"Not a lot of thinking going on here, easy work with lots of down time and lots of flexibility to work from home. Lots of vacation time as well, but low salary and not a lot of room for advancement."
good,"I think that State Street bank is a very good point where to start your career because the environment is friendly, you have the possibility to manage your career and you have client exposure and responsibilities. Unfortunately, salaries are not very competitives and the job not very stimulating."
good,"Daily, people would make you feel like you don't belong. Hold the door for them and get no thanks. They would go to your manager behind your back claim that it is a feedback. Coworker would boss you around especially because they've been there longer than you."
good,There is a CHALLENGE with the goal of the company. They want to be the best custodian yet that requires the best technology. The recent reorg and redesign of the IT department is meant to drive towards a new methodology but its a slow start and is lost in red tape bureaucracy.
good,"Overall state street is a good company. I like the work from home option, but there are not enough people on teams to handle daily workload. Many people leaving and not getting replaced and there are little or no promotions."
good,Great people to work with. They shipped a ton of hard working American's jobs to India in order to save money. Did not appreciate that much. Did not feel like I was paid enough.
good,"Pay increases are low, bonuses are almost laughable.  Learned a lot of skills, best rewarded at other companies.  Best plan is to stay less than 5 years, by then you have experience that others will pay more for."
good,"It's a good place for new graduates, but not much room for promotion if stay in a level for many years. The culture is totally different within different teams."
good,"Really solid benefits, 401k match, pay is okay. Culture is very corporate, but relaxed. People are moderately ambitious, but there was always a sense there is something next."
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
good,Each day I was required to balance cash for several Mutual Funds.  I learned how to use macro's to increase my productivity.  I enjoyed working with all my co-workers.  They were helpful and kind individuals.  The accountants constantly challenged us to keep their entries accurate.  I enjoyed the challenge of keeping the accountants accurate. 
good,Generally people will not acknowledge you when you walk into the office. You just sit at your desk and start plugging away at the daily work. I learned how to succeed in the operations field as well as the accounting field in 5 years. You may or may not have a micro-manager. You may or may not have a manager that actually cares about you and your career. The hardest part of the job is making sure everything is processed by deadline. The most enjoyable part of the job is that you can learn as much (or as little) as you want.
good,"First job, gained a lot of experience and skills. Co-workers were friendly."
good,"Friendly enviroment, with stability and advancement opportunity."
good,"good institution, easy work, mundane, boring environment. Great place to work if want to work from home. Technology needs improving, management needs to get on same page."
good,This is where I learned about the business culture. This was a good first job out of school.
good,A typical day includes performing daily tasks but also learning new details about these specific tasks. They may be the same some days but most likely they aren't. There is something new to learn everyday and working directly with my manager to gain more knowledge and experience on our specific funds. Learning how to multi-task under total pressure
good,Good company to start your career in a real life business environment and learn basic knowledge of finance and accounting. However most of entry level jobs have been offshored.
good,"Typical day at work:"
good,"Good values,fun place to work, good co-workers,............."
good,"8.30-6 pm . Overtime is given but questioned depending on the team. Salary is lowest in the industry ,excellent benefits. A lot of employee engagement activities. Training is not that great. Good interiors except for the cafeteria . Education expenses covered if eligible.Training is not very structured"
good,All big financial companies are outsourcing today.
good,The salary is very low for the amount of work that ones has to do a daily and weekly basis. Okay place work for someone that has never worked a job in life. For experience workers I would not bad to place to work.
good,"Since most people in my location are young they are just very immature, which makes it really difficult to advance in the company. Also often people would be rewarded for mediocre job."
good,"I was a contractor for the lifecycle program, my track was storage and networking including storage San arrays San switches and NAS along with networking"
good,"Working at State Street was an amazing experience. I worked with a very small team and hardworking people. They thought the importance of a hard work place and also I was very comfortable in my team . The work was not easy nor hard because I enjoyed each second of my work ,"
good,"Everyone is willing to help. Good work team., but too much pressure and overload of work for little pay., but I did learn a lot about International Latin Business."
good,"Completed daily SL8500 ejects, processed daily, weekly and monthly Tandem backups. Monitored systems consoles, processed weekly AS400 backups, contacted apropriate vender for system and program errors. ,"
good,I was working at the fund accounting department and everyday I had to calculate distributions for multiple money market funds. Two dead lines per day and no room for an error helped me to learn how to work really well under pressure and become a perfectionist.
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
good,"State Street offers training, education reimbursement, excellent benefits.  A great place to start a career in Investment Accounting.   Mangers could be volatile.    The company change a lot between 2000-2003. Changing CEO's several times in early 2000's. Certain departments promote within.  Layoffs were constant."
good,The great benefit of working at State Street was the ability to move around and learn so much of the business. State Street is large enough that they have departments in all aresas allowing you the oppoutnity to become an expert in one task or the ability to move around and learn many parts of the business.
good,"It's nice in paying and working culture is nice, if you are comfortable with night shift, you can join here, they are paying well for fresher as well."
good,"Good,good people and culture.Need to invest more in IT and need more on site opportunity and may not be good for some people"
good,Great people to work with but long hours made it so that I had no work life balance. I could not see a long term future there. I gathered some great fresh out of college skills. I still have maintained relationships with the co workers I met there.  Management never felt supportive enough. I wanted to study for my GMATs while working but that become nearly impossible when I would be coming home past 8pm  2 weeks of every month.
good,"I loved State Street, but I was only a contract employee. Literally half of their employees are contractors who receive no benefits, which is State Street’s way of saving money. "
good,"Company provides easy advancement for new employees but after two promotions, the next available spot could be five years. The benefits are good but the pay is typically lower than what the market would offer with similar experience. Work/Life balance is a struggle for almost all roles. Once in management, the expectation is at least nine hours a day with some holidays and weekends."
good,"Company with a lot of opportunities, but limited due to slow adaption of modern technology and principles."
good,"-Managers know less than entry level employees"
good,Overall the company is definitely a great place to start your career. Be mindful that raises are very low. Promotions are rare unless you're located in Dublin or India.
good,"State Street is a great place to work if you are looking to expand your horizons and grow.  There are many programmes that will assist you in achieving goals, lots of learning and development opportunities and chances for advancement.  The downside is that some managers (I can't speak for all, as the company is so large) do not allow folks the time to go and develop those skills. Promotions to supervisory or management roles are based on current skills, not necessarily if the person is a good leader. Also, given the size, it gets easy to become ""just a number."" "
good,"If you want to learn about the industry, to have ample training opportunities, this is wonderful ."
good,"Very good benefits package - four weeks vacation, paid maternity/paternity leave.. Depends on the group, there could be very little work life balance."
good,It's OK working here...all depends on manager of course. Not happy when they reassign you to a different positions or role. Surprise there hasn't been any lay off recently. Career board mostly has jobs listed in China(probably not a good sign.)
good,"A lot of opportunity, great people, good benefits, flex schedules, interesting work. Things aren't handed to you; you need to prove yourself and work hard. Internal Mobility. Lots of big company bureaucracy"
good,"Very fast paced, well structured work environment. Everything had a specific procedure, and everything was thoroughly cross checked to make sure there was no human errors."
good,Its good.sometime we have to work long hrs but it still one of the best place to work at.
good,Some management decisions are not logical ie the layoffs in US and London to move development to India and China. Short sightedness. They need to pay more for good talent.
good,I would come into work knowing exactly what is needed to be done. I would communicate with management to escalate and issues. Would attend meetings and conference calls.
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
good,The environment at State Street during high volume seasons was stressful and the days are long. The benefits are really good though and there is a good team mentality.
good,"It’s a great play to work. The changing work environment makes the job exciting. The benefits out weigh the compensation. Although the flex time, remote working, vacation time and parental/maternity are amongst the nest in the industry, the compensation is not with industry standards."
good,"Oversaw 450 SSgA funds (Equity, Derivatives, Commodities, Fixed Income, Domestic, and Emerging Market etc) and 11 Dodge & Cox funds daily with valuing and pricing on Navigator pricing system."
good,This was a great place to gain lots of experience in the investment industry. I learned lots and the environment is relatively young workers.  I had lots of fun working here.
good,"State Street is a massive company with plenty of opportunity. It seems like many people there have been there for quite a long time, which is a good thing I suppose. There's also plenty of activities and groups to get involved in."
good,"A typical day can range from 8-11 hours of action packed learning, decision making and prevention control."
good,I enjoyed my experience at this position. It broadened my base of knowledge and risk management while allowing me to use my communication skills to build valuable relationships.
good,SSB does have supportive management but they help you in the event you want to advance  your career. There have been constant rumors of layoffs since 08 and a tremendous amout of outsourcing.
good,"State Street was a nice place to work with supportive management, decent amount of red tape and politics, but is expected of a big company."
good,"- Prepare monthly statistical reports"
good,Overall a typical work day is not too bad. Management can improve. You do learn a lot through this company that are transferable skills you can carry on to other jobs or for your career. Hardest part of the job would be the end of the day the last two hours of work. Heavy on emails and communication. You have to be good with customer service skills. A lot of office skills are developed here.
good,"State Street provides a work environment with multiple challenges throughout the day and is constantly evolving with changes in the business, regulatory and client environments. Recent changes have taken away the self pride of ones work and broken it into specific tasks for that is all you are asked to complete. My position ensures all those tasks completed by other individuals are done properly, timely and accurately before our end of day deadlines."
good,In this role I performed metrics analyses to determine productivity for various departments of State Street.
good,At work servicing client is a challenge. Accuracy and productivity is most required.
good,"Good place to work, they made up mini promotions as a form of motivation. There is a link for everything you need, understaffed and they were slowly sending jobs offshore"
good,"Typical overtime, management was not very supportive, salary is under industry standard, basic benefits, easy interviews, confusing workflow process, very supportive co-workers, high turnover rate"
good,Thank you for providing me opportunity to work with a Great Organization and Show case my Skills. It was nice working with State Street. I have always Enjoyed to Work here and it was very nice stay in Quincy.
good,I honestly enjoyed Every team I was on they made me feel welcome and assisted me with any work when possible the The only thing I wish they did a better job of was protecting the employees that they do currently have that work very hard under them I get company changes cause for drastic measures but it seems like with this company it’s a consistent thing where every few years they lay off a bunch of employees other than that I love everything about this company
good,"Great workplace Culture, lots of opportunities to interact with senior people and learn a lot about financial concepts but the tech stack is little underwhelming compared to other companies in the industry."
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
good,Work From Home 50% czasu lub więcej - duża zaleta niespotykana w wielu firmach
good,"- good place to start"
good,good place to work. good learning experience and clients are really knowledgeable. You have two be self motivated though! The  atmosphere is light in Boston.
good,State street is a great place to start a career. I really enjoyed being part of a rotational program where I was able to gain experience in various positions. I only left the company to pursue other interests.
good,"State Street / State Street Global Advisors is a great place to learn the various aspects of asset management - front, middle and back office.  It is a fast paced and highly regulated company with a large library of training courses to keep you up to speed and compliant. The work culture can be difficult and demanding as cost cutting / job reductions are common. I enjoyed the people I worked with very much."
good,Worked as a regulatory intern. Good experience but needed more support in terms of technology and management. Good people and the pay was very fair for an internship.
good,"A great place to work with helpful people all around. They listen to you and appreciate you. To my knowledge, there are opportunities here where talented people should be a given a chance to prove themselves even more - which I feel needs a little push."
good,"Good place to work and learn new things, colleagues are very supportive and friendly.Management is good, apart from work you can be part of any other social activities, i was part of CSP programme, felt very happy working with the team."
good,"Stable and safe work environment. Employees tend to keep to themselves and focus on work, may be a cultural thing or HR is deliberately hiring worker bees."
good,"Great opportunities for professional growth, great coworkers, fair amount of autonomy, but aggressive working hours in derivatives department.  The hours can flux dramatically at times, and appropriate resources/support are not always allocated to the teams needing it."
good,"The biggest takeaway from my experience here was the knowledge I learned about financial markets and securities transactions. The people I worked with made the day more enjoyable and were always willing to help if needed. Management was nice and understanding and also played a part in helping me learn along the way. "
good,"Company promotes a Work Life Balance but this is dependant on your manager as some managers are better than others at supporting this."
good,"I got to work on a lot of interesting things in a short span of time. Being able to handle such huge data, making reports, developing a data science curriculum and all definitely took a toll over me and I am glad I overcame it and I enjoyed being challenged."
good,"State Street is a great company to get your foot in the door in the financial services world. Opportunities for growth exist, but are often just as dependent on playing politics as doing quality work."
good,I would go back. Day to day operations. Work with many internal teams and some external. Learned a lot about systems and banking. Most enjoyable part of the job is the people you work with.
good,"Overall, State Street is a good place to work.  Good compensation, manageable hours.  The firm is fairly top-heavy which slows decision-making and overall progress and can be frustrating at times."
good,With all multinational companies it sometimes depends on the culture of the individual office.  I had a great experience at State Street and would recommend it to anyone looking to improve their knowledge of financial services.
good,Need to have good training material. Need to learn on as we go and procedures are not updated on a yearly basis as they should be. Management needs to consider work life balance and recognize effort that is put by their employees.
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
good,"Great people and culture for the group I was in, fast paced and forward thinking.  The group was focused on data delivery through BI applications.  Interesting work and enjoyable."
good,"Enjoyed working with the people at State Street.  Would recommend. this company although US based and run, it was overall a good experience for me and learning opportunity."
good,Experience working with Statestreet had got the flavor of Europe payment formats. Worked at the implementation and coding which was stressful with long working hours
good,"Good Place to learn a lot and you have an opportunity to make good money."
good,"- The office was filled of dull and unhappy faces hence why the overall culture was not up to par. Management within my team did not communicate effectively. EX: if I did something improperly, my manager did not correct me personally, instead, the feedback would be delivered through someone else."
good,"Great people to work with, good teamwork and cooperation. Tasks are challenging but help you grow and prepare for next job. In general, it was pleasant to work here."
good,"All depends on the team you get.  Does feel like working for the man though. I didn't get that much work, so it was boring a bit.  Would've preferred more analysis instead of document curating"
good,"Great learning experience, and exposure to mutual funds.I worked under the Goldman Sachs group during my time with the company. The compensation that was given was substantial too. Great years!"
good,"The work is not very challenging for someone looking for a job in financial services.  We report cash and sweep available cash at end of day.  "
good,"Great Exeperience, tend to burn out employee's with demand to keep a lean workforce.  At most points have been spread thin in terms of FTE count to required daily goals."
good,Working at State Street was very beneficial to me personally. I created lasting relationships and I learnt a lot in the field of Mutual Funds. People were encourage to think critically and think for themselves and also the culture was great for personal and professional growth.
good,I was on a six month contract to support their videoconferences located at their conference center but also worked at the main office where the Traders were located. Very interesting! State of the art IT and video infrastructure made it a great experience.

good,"I have stayed with State Street for almost 30 years and I am only leaving because my current job is being off-shored."
good,"I was a six-month intern at State Street working as a Performance Analyst in their Investment Manager Services division. It was a great job where I learned a lot about the role due to assuming manager responsibilities a few months after starting. I was given responsibilities and then expected to use my time to fulfill them without being micro-managed. I could use my time as I saw fit and was able to get my work done everyday. The environment was very relaxed on my team."
good,"Fast-paced environment that requires new knowledge be incorporated quickly to better improve banking operations and processes. Banking industry is heavily regulated and one must be able to identify areas in which the bank may be at risk for audit, information leaks, etc.  The most difficult part of the job is balancing the audit requirements with the business's need to efficiently and profitably run their operations.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the opportunity to work with a diverse, intelligent and highly motivated workforce, which encourages one to constantly improve."

good,Overall State Street was a great experience.  Management has a clear vision forward and work life balance was excellent.  Leadership is developing tools for job mobility.  The one drawback is the frequency of layoffs to meet expense targets.
good,"Each day brings new and different challenges.  Oftentimes, these are exciting issues which are engaging.  Unfortunately, these challenges have become increasingly overwhelming due to a lack of resources."
good,Company provide a great opportunity for entry into the financial industry. Be prepare to learn a lot and do a lot.  It's a great place to increase your finance knowledge quick.

good,"This was a great job that paid well and had full benefits. They train you very well so don't worry if you don't have a background in finance. The job is very easy and the only important thing is your attention to detail. placing a decimal in the wrong spot could potentially mean the difference between thousands and millions of dollars. The job was straight forward. A far as advancement, it depends on the group you're in. There is the potential to move very quickly to management, or you could be stuck in a senior position for a while."
good,I enjoyed my time at State Street. The workforce was relatively young (mostly late 20s to earlier 30s). We worked hard but it was an enjoyable experience overall.
good,"Since the Business Transformation Initiative, there is definitely more of a division of labor. Things are less client specific and more broad strokes. There are some really good people who work there, and if you're a career-driven person, there are opportunities for advancement. The benefits package is second to none."
good,Encountered different issues every day. Learned a lot about the business. Co-workers were great to work with - the best part of the work environment.
good,Typical work day includes running processes and learning about the different types of securities and the ins and outs of working for a large bank. Tend to get lost in the shuffle due to large number of employees and management seems overwhelmed.
good,"Considering that I've only been there for 9 months, I am not a very reliable source. I had some good times and some bad times. It was a good place to be. If I wanted to continue working at custody bank that would be the place I would be aiming for."

good,"- Really enjoyed most of the staff in the offshore department"
good,"Data Entry Role - Now Primarily Outsourced to Indian Labor Market..."
good,"State Street has good work/life balance, especially with the ability to work from home a couple days a week.  Operational outsourcing is getting out of control however.  Most of my former jobs are no longer available in the United States.  I work in client service for very demanding clients who have at times expressed frustration with the timeliness and accuracy of our data, which is directly correlated to the offshoring of our operations work.  Management is good, however we have reorganized our department structure 5 times in the past 5 years which can be frustrating and disruptive to getting our jobs done."
good,"As an intern, I learned a lot about corporate culture and how things are run in a more professional setting. Being able to ask questions about the daily tasks made the experience more inclusive."
good,"A lot of work to do, learned a ton in my years there. Sucks that they are under layoffs, would have liked if they kept most jobs onshore but the industry has been changing and companies must adapt."
good,"The company culture was not as good as expected for a top company. People talk too much during working hours, which is very inefficient. Management level was not contributing enough to the company's value while earning the highest salary."
good,"State Street is not a place to stay, but a good place to start and move on from.  Good benefits and give you access to everything you need to be successful in the future."
good,"State Street was a great opportunity for me to pick right back up with my career. After I completed Graduate School- management took notice of my work ethic.  I was very fortunate to land a role in a great department. Unfortunately, State Street is known for it's frequent job cuts."
good,"The company itself has an amazing global reputation but locally, everyone knows the hiring process is a big joke. Employers literally accept any co-op/intern who is breathing. Unless you are a foreign student or expat, there is always some kinda of position for you at state street so you can slam that name on your resume and be super confident although you only push buttons at work for 8 hrs a day."
good,"State Street offers a ton of opportunities to learn new skills, join new groups, and even change careers mid-stream. Their non-salary benefits are fantastic and their focus on work/life balance is second to none."
good,Working at State Street was my first internship/office experience and it was a good stepping stone for me. The work I did was easy enough and I felt that it was worth while but just wasn't something I wanted to do full-time or an environment that I felt entirely comfortable in.
good,"As an intern it was a great experience, however the wage given for an intern does not suit the city of work, given that the rent in dublin is so high right now. Typically work was 90% excel and in house software with the remainder spent replying to emails to/from clients. Working with teams is essential and is good for developing such skills"
good,"State Street is a great place to work, but unfortunately it has had too many layoffs for anyone to feel secure. There is also room for improvement in the areas of career development and training, and work-life balance."
good,The team I worked was nice and it was a mutual respect to work with them. Team culture was good. There were re-orgs occasionally which was painful otherwise overall good company to work for.
good,The branch I worked at was small and everyone considered their co-worker family. Lots of nice people and the culture was great. Gaining access to all the systems was a real headache and good luck with moving up the ladder quickly.
good,"As a CRM Associate my typical day at work varied from week to week as I had an extensive role. My main responsibility was to report, support and aid my manager with administrative support such as preparing for the client meetings, being responsible for confidential contracts and documents, booking trips and taking charge over the trip finances. In addition I supported the head of the CRM Team as well as the assistance with weekly logs and HR related projects. Furthermore I also supported the CRM managers with their contracts in respective of their clients. "

good,Nice people work there and you will find that most people are very easy to talk to and will help you learn the ropes in your role and lend you good advice.
good,"I was an intern, but my team made me feel as part of the team. Always engaging and providing me with work that typical intern wouldn't normally do. I had an interesting experience, I have an IT background but was interested in business and finance and this accounting role opened my eyes to this world. Daily activities were mostly the same but were timely. Did experience the occasional circumstances like mergers and split among others. Would recommend for those interested in accounting/finance."
good,State Street offers flexible hours and a great work/life balance for students looking to make money during the semester. The pay is competitive and the junior analyst position provides the chance to develop a range of useful skills.

good,"It is competitive workplace which excites you to learn. I have added some new technologies to my Profile such as Jasper and Sybase. The management was helpful too if we do good work. Workplace culture was friendly, we used to celebrate all the festivals together."

good,"I would say I got to learnt alot being a fresher .being a part of pilot batch of SSGS in India ,we all were given the required training. The management had given us enough support and trusted us ."
good,"Worked at the banks for some years and enjoyed taking on a new challenge. "
good,"High energy, fast paced, great experience. Through my current position of Client Service Specialist at State Street, I’m responsible for securities operations within fixed income, equity, domestic and foreign.  I excel in a fast paced deadline oriented work environment, which has instilled a key attention to detail into me.  Quickly becoming expert with State Street’s systems as well as ideating creative and more efficient workflow process have been crucial towards my success"
good,"only Internship - got good opportunity to learn stuff."
good,Team is very friendly and motivated. there's a lot of work to be done and people are working hard to achieve it. culture is fine and people just perform what they are told to perform. little room for growth
good,that was an good experience in that organisation and the working culture is good and i enjoyed with some special events and activities over all experience is good
good,"Good environment to learn. Very good managers. You learn from the exposure to exotic products and by relating with Investment Managers and clients. Days can be long, but in general there is a good work-life balance."
good,Working on new and advanced applications to keep track of the thousands of projects State Street Bank has nationwide provided me the opportunity to really challenge my creative thinking in order to best serve the company and the project at hand. This challenging environment allowed me to feel increasingly motivated to over come the next complication and work to the projects success.
good,"I work from 9 - 5.30 each day with an hour lunch and a semi relaxed timesheet system. Most of the day is spent running calculations and preparing excel worksheets to be run. Some of the time is spend on calls with the clients answering any qustions they have about the current period's filing. I learned much about funds structures and the regulations surrounding them. The management in my team were always very helpful and nice, as were my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was the uneven work distrabution- you might have no work to do all day and then at the end of the day the client would provide feeds so that you have to stay in late to work on them. The most enjoyable part of the job was the supportive team and work location."
good,"Intense environment with a lot of opportunity for overtime and learning new things. Flexible work arrangements may make work/life balance possible."
good,Good co-workers. No career path. Some times overtime. Good location to work. Interesting orientation. Learned Bloomberg. Ran Macro software
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
good,Very good company for entry level employees looking to learn a bit about the custodial banking industry; easy to stand out if you're willing to go the extra mile
good,"It is a fast paced working environment, which is constantly evolving. At points hours can be long but those days are few and far between. As there are a plethora of different departments, that are many areas in which to grow."
good,"advancement opportunities depend on hard work and making yourself visible. managers are fine for the most part. the culture of the company is very good, fast-paced and enjoyable."
good,Great place to learn and meet people.  Most things depend on your manager and coworkers.  Ability to move from within and find the best place for you.
good,"- Daily work can be monotonous, but staying active within the company creates a better sense of pride in your work."
good,"A dynamic company that many people have no idea how it impacts the financial system, a great place to start your career or transition from another job.  Long term employment although stable can often lead to a stagnate career with limited options internally and externally due to long term incentive pay trapping you in place."
good,"•	Manage and provide training to an ETF accounting team contributing to the net asset value (NAV) calculation"
good,I was a bank teller all through college and a little after. At the time it was only a part-time position and I was commuting from Cape Cod to Fairhaven everyday which was not ideal.
good,State Street is a good place to work with great work/ life balance. The coworkers at the company tend to be really nice and helpful.
good,State Street was a great first job and a great place to obtain experience in a lot of different areas.
good,Good introduction to the accounting/finance world. It's more dificult for new people due to a transition into more smaller roles. Now most people only see a piece of the pie and don't understand how all the departmental roles work to maintain the day in the life of a mutual fund. Multiple deadlines throught out the day.
good,Good place to work with various opportunities to increase your skill sets and knowledge
good,"Our office consists of mainly of college students who screen and process trades that our clients send in on a daily basis. We regularly perform callbacks with our clients when they send through high risk transactions, in order to verify the large transactions. Our workspace is an open environments that encourages cooperation between coworkers and management in order to clear up points of confusion on difficult trade tickets. One of the more difficult aspects of my job, but also the most rewarding, is dealing with never before seen tickets when management is absent. I really enjoy communicating with our clients on callbacks as well as leading a team of workers and serving as their ""go-to"" if they have any immediate difficulties with their tickets."
good,fun place to work at with good advancement opportunity. Pay and work life balance is not very good.
good,work and life balance. having opportuinities to internallly seeking jobs.
good,I had the chance to be accepted for an internship in State Street Bank within the middle office department. This experience was very enriching in the way that I was able to perform complicated operations and became totally proficient on Bloomberg and Excel.

good,"Great place to work and grow if you are in the right area."
good,The work was interesting but it did not seem like they had a real project for interns.  The office environment was very quiet and there was little supervision.
good,"Compare to my previous organisation, I didn't felt much in such a way, like facilities, organisation environment and all not that so great I felt like okay okay"
good,"Relatively new management with tough market condition, depressed conditions in Hedge Funds are putting a strain everywhere in the firm"
good,"Need of concern: "
good,"There was a lot of disagreement about how things should proceed at any given moment, and a lot of this was hidden. Otherwise, it was a decent place to work with talented people."
good,State Street gives you great hands-on experience through their internship. I basically worked as a fully-fledged member of my team while I was there and gained a lot of skills that were valuable later on.
good,It belongs on the team which you join. Good place to work and long  relationship can be maintained.Benefits are good however management depends on the head on the department and treating the team varies.
good,"Work life balance was good"
good,"State Street is meritocratic and very flat organization for a bank. The management is new and are still trying to figure out things which sometimes causes frustration. However, it also provides a great learning opportunity and flexibility to try out new things."
good,"The company gives us the resources to succeed and encourages personal development, but the culture has changed over the last few years and I began feeling more stuck in my current career choice. The benefits are good, but compensation could be better given how much work is distributed to those left in understaffed teams. And even though this is conveyed to us as a company-wide situation, nothing is done to mitigate the longer hours and increasing workload, leading to a growing disconnect and discontent with upper management."
good,"Great company, if you can handle how impersonal and bureaucratic it is. Megacorp benefits are nothing to sneeze at, and it's a relaxed place. But you're probably never going to get seriously promoted."
good,"State Street has excellent benefits, good working conditions. The best thing about working here is the work life balance. There are so many people that work remotely or have flexible hours. Also, the opportunity to learn is huge. The downside is that it is very difficult to get promoted internally unless you apply for internal jobs and make a switch ( internal mobility)."
good,Lots of politics.  Too many meetings and less time to do actual work.  Policies & red tape takes away productive time. Lots of fluff and less of innovative work.
good,"IJP's are the best options and something that I have found this place to be very good with. Lot of career options."
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
good,"Great people, and networking culture. Raises are pretty hard to come by, and bonus pool gets reduced every year.  The trade off is great work life balance, but employees need cost of living increases at some point too!"
good,Challenging transformational environment with a solid global presence servicing and consulting. State street is an optiomal incubator for new talent to learn and acquire experience in the financial industry.
good,"A reasonably diversified company, StateStreet, provides opportunities for youngsters to start their career. Initially there are a lot of opportunities for career growth but soon one can get easily stagnated."
good,State Street has a very great culture. Everyone I interface with at the bank is very supportive and they allow for me to take on new challenges. There is a strong team atmosphere as employees push each other to be better everyday.
good,"good company to work for, very helpful managers. Could be better pay. Worked as a summer intern, got plenty of hands on experience. would recommend to a friend"
good,Good people in a very large company. There are many different areas to advance but there isn't much room for collaboration with others on tasks in meaningful ways that make stronger connections between co-workers.
good,"It's nice to work in state street and good work life balance in the company. It's growing in India and it will grow more in near future."
good,very good culture. Helpful staff and management. Only the pay scale is not so attractive. Would recommend anyone to apply for a job there. Toronto office location is really convenient.
good,"Culture lacks sensitivity and humanity. Employees are expected to perform as machines which, as one would expect, does not happen very often and leads to failure to achieve targets."
good,I like that they do a lot to make the employees feel at home and appreciated but they are very understaffed and it makes work more stressful and tiring.
good,"Pros: can be a really great place when you work with great people"
good,The Experience was great my mentor would help me often times but I always understood the tasks and the assignments that were handed to me. In addition to that the workplace I was in was comfortable.
good,It was a very high intensity and very fast-paced work environment. It required being very detail-oriented and a multi-tasker. The management was quite helpful but didn't focus on promoting leadership and training for employees. There was over-reliance on college interns.
good,"Business Analyst facilitate to gather technical requirements after understanding the business requirements. Documents the requirements which is referred by developers, testers, all the stack-holder. Run the query and develop the reports for data analysis."
good,I enjoyed the department I worked in and would be ok working at the company again.  I worked in the Bank Loans department for three years but would want to work in a different department to gain a different set of skills and knowledge if  the opportunity to work there again occurred.
good,Good balance work/personal life.  Limited chances of progressions.  Salaries are lower than the ones offered by other companies in the same industry. Overall the company could do better to retain talents.
good,"Nice, friendly co-workers. Laid back work environment."
good,"Good place to work overall. "
good,Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire.
good,"I enjoyed my time there. The pay is not very high and the raises you do get are small, but the benefits are good. I enjoyed working on my team and liked the corporate culture. There were two rounds of layoffs that happened while I was there so I can't say too much about job security."
good,"Depending on which group you work with, your work life either consist of constantly working or working normal hours. Also depending on which group you're in would dictate how quickly promotions come to you.  If your group has fairly high turnover because processes are unclear and not established than you will be able to rise quickly."
good,There is not a typical day in my current position since each day is different since deliverables happen once a month. I learned quite bit about investments and accounting. The hardest part of job is not knowing if you will get out on time.
good,"I would recommend anyone to work State Street as this is a good company to start. They have great benefit and flexible work schedule for anyone with children. A day working here could be slow/relax, but also could be stressful and fast-paced sometimes. People are mostly friendly."
good,"you have more learning and exposure to new technologies and process "
good,"I was very happy working there and enjoyed most aspects.  I was fortunate to learn a ton in the short time I was there.  Expectations were realistic, and I was provided with great resources."
good,"Cooperative work environment, new learning, good management and supportive workplace culture.  The most enjoyable part of job is working in team wherein every team member is heard and respected."
good,"This is a great place to learn the professional culture and build a foundation in the financial industry.They offer great benefits such as Work From Home(WFH), 401k(5% match),tuition assistance and really extensive learning resources. They also provide a really diverse list of social groups as well as a deep community service database. The only issue I have is the low compensation."
good,Nice place to start in the financial industry. Strong culture and career advancement. Pay could be more competitive in my opinion. Can advance if motivated.
good,"When writing your review, please consider the following guidelines:"
good,"My team is comprised of talented, energetic people who are driven to do well.  The culture is professional and formal.  A lot of emphasis is placed on LEAN."
good,Flex work schedules are encouraged and work life balance is good.  Open floor plan that encourages good communication.  Lower on the pay scale for compensation.
good,"Work flexibility, Volunteer opportunities, Excellent Employee Engagement programs. The Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) are great. 4 weeks vacation on your third year and can buy 1 week. Great company to seek what you love since this it has opportunity in a quite range of different jobs."
good,"Overall I had a positive working experience at State Street, however I think there needs to be more diversity within Management. Working in the technology area of State Street, I saw very few Managers of color and it today's society there is room for improvement."
good,"Having worked with State Street for a number of years, I have had the luck of starting off as an intern and moving to various departments via opportunities State Street affords. I will say that I have observed a large gap between those that are 'starting' their careers and those that are at the 'tail-end' of their careers. Very few people fall into the bucket of in their 'priime'. The company is very 'safe' and provides stability, structure, and great networks of people with years of experience."
good,Good Life Work Balance with a very caring and knowledgeable staff. Work load can get to repetitive depending on what department you're under. Overall very good company to start working for right out of college if you can get your foot in the door. My con is the room for advancement within your group.

good,There is nice work culture but business is moving from statestreet syntel to someone else that's I want to move from here to save my job
good,"Since starting at State Street I have learned a lot about the financial services sector. "

Unfortunately I was fired but I don't believe it was done professionally but instead people were acting upon their personal feelings and not professionally. I also feel that I was tossed around from manager to manager and was not able to put my feet firm on the ground and stay in one group and be trained as I should of. Other than that the company has great benefits and a lot of clubs and associations that are super great. Its a very diverse company so you meet people from many different countries and some of those people become some of your closest friends. I did learn on my own despite the lack of management but I can also say that I did receive help from some officers who supported me and knew I was a good worker.

Therefore, my typical day in the office began at 5:30 to get a head start on the day.  Most managers work 50-60 hours a week.  The hardest part of the job is the red tape to move things forward.  The best part of the job is working with the people."

good,"As a consultant I had to go to their location 53 miles away from my home even though they had an office only 5 miles away from my home. Even though I mostly work with people offshore or out of state, people I had never met, I was still required to be at the location where the manager was.

good,"Working for SSB, was a pleasure.  Co-workers were very friendly and helpful.  I earned a normal pay for 10 years ago, up to $15 an hour. Training was made easy and again the most enjoyable part of the job was working with friendly co-workers."
good,"The bank was going through a transformation.  State Street had bought part of Private Clients Groups accounts department. Because the workers knew that at some point we will all be without a job, the atmosphere was a nervous one. (e.g A manager might ask one to come into the office for something.

Daily I would perform cash forecasting, reconciliation (cash/asset), data input, income, corporte actions, alternative trades, expenses, trade monitoring, failed trade resolution, aged items, processing incoming or outgoing wires, transfers or checks and invest in clients EOD short-term vehicles. Answer any internal or external questions or issues to different departments, investment managers and the clients. I was also chosen to work on a new client conversion. Which consisted of lots of manual input of foreign and domestic trading, setting up electronic processes and working closely with the client to keep them happy during this process. I then moved departments (with the new client account) to oversee the move to another department went smoothly. And then was given the opportunity to work in the fund accounting department, where I learned even more. During my time at State Street, I was fortunate to have great managers teach me so many different aspects of the whole process."
good,"The employees at State Street are some of the hardest working, motivated and success-driven people that I have encountered.  The culture is collaborative and optimistically forward looking.  There have been many changes to the organization over the last several years that have negatively impacted job security, but senior leaders try very hard to communicate organizational changes and impacts to employees openly and often.  The employees are top notch and some of the best you will find in the industry."
good,"Benefits are generally good and salaries are competitive, but the economic climate in recent years has left many without a pay raise several years in a row (as of 2013). Large performance reviews are conducted bi-annually, and smaller reviews are conducted on a project-by-project basis. State Street has made a significant effort to push flex hours and telecommuting, which is evident in the culture. It's not uncommon to see 50% or more of the office working from home on Fridays. "

good,Everyone who worked at Legal Seafood's knew exactly what they had to do every time they clocked in very self explanatory job and I genuinly enjoyed working there. The main thing i had an issue with at this location is the General manager who first hired me later switched locations and as a result ended up with a decline of management.
good,"Good work/life balance. Company was receptive to working from home which provided flexibility and enhanced productivity."
good,State Street is a great organization to work for. There is a lot of opportunities. The secret is to get out of of comfort zone and network. Be involved in network groups.

good,This is a team work company.Communication is very important. Use common sense and ask questions if queries exist. That helps me to find out the right information and then process the transactions on time.  I learned how to race the time with myself.
good,I would recommend this work space for someone straight out of college to build their way up. A good chance to build a career and get involved with different networking events to enhance opportunities for growth.

good,Lots of great opportunities to progress and great job satisfaction. The office is great and filled with a lot of capable people that you can learn a lot from
good,"Great work/life balance- most groups have some form of flex schedules (work from home, compressed shift). Flex scheduling is the hook that will keep you there. Management differs between departments- some are great, some are fairly bad. There are opportunities outside of your direct position, so it is encouraged to look into branching out and becoming involved in opportunities as they arise.  Benefits are industry standard. Salary is good if you arrive externally. Raises are poor if you are here for a while, hence many will leave for a year and then return to get back to a competitive salary."

While I learned a great deal and owe my career knowledge to the company, I didn't love the work life balance and recognition State Street gives (or lack thereof) to its employees.  I work very long hours and work incredibly hard for little recognition and compensation.  Employees feel like a very small piece of the overall picture."
