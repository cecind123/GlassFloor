good,"I usually have a different schedule every week, Same days but different hours. So it very difficult to plan anything extra until you get your schedule on Wednesday for the next week. Recently we have changed out management every month or so. The district manager retired so we now have a new one and he's changing everything."
good,My typical work day would start out running a cash register and then I would step in assisting customers or other associates as needed.
good,"Great place to work decent hours"
good,Working for Publix was generally a stress free and enjoyable experience. I acquired a great deal of knowledge and experience through the training programs and from my fellow co-workers. My supervisors and co-workers were very pleasant to be around and upon my request would help me in any way they could. The most difficult aspect of my career at Publix was the inadequacy of the necessary parts to fix or repair the trucks and engines.
good,"worked with a variety of people"
good,"I would arrive to work at 6:45 A.M. for my 7:00 A.M. shift. I was responsible for assisting customers, stocking shelves, organizing backroom, taking inventory and ordering products, and sweeping and moping. I learned great customer service and organization skills. The most enjoysable part about working with this company was that I always had something to do and it was always different"
good,Publix is a great company to work for. The benefits are amazing.
good,"Their benefits are unmatched by any other company I have worked for.  I absolutely loved working there and would have never left, but a new chapter had to begin in my life.  This company has only good things to offer for everyone!"
good,Would have stayed if pay was higher and if could have got full time status
good,"I enjoyed working here. It had a really great atmosphere and great co workers. The hours were really good and they worked with your personal schedule. The hardest part of the job was getting all the work that needed to be done, done on time. The most enjoyable part was getting to work with great people and always being happy."
good,"My job was easy; cash register. However, if I did have a problem, either an employee or store manager would help me.They didn't get angry when I forgot something and were as helpful as could be. Except one manager, Lenny, I would always try to tell him harmless jokes and he would get upset. He even gave me a bad score on my evaluation because I never got my uniform dry cleaned."
good,"I was a Grocery Clerk for 5 1/2 years. Outside of some disagreements from time to time with management, it is a great company to work for."
good,"I really enjoyed working with the customers. I was the one responsible for making the donuts which I found extremely enjoyable. My manager took the time to successfully train me to succeed in my skills. There was no part of my job that I found hard to achieve, it all was enjoyable to me."
good,"Same as the other Publix, it was a great place to work.I loved being at Publix, I was just ready for something more."
good,I didn't mind my Front Service Clerk position (bagging) until it became monotonous and outside pressures made it apparent. The manager at the time was A+ along with my coworkers. There's plenty of good things about working for Publix but there are a few annoying aspects of working for a super market.
good,Publix is a great place to work. Very friendly co-workers and everyone works together as a team. Also enjoyed my management team while I was there.
good,"Publix has taught me how to give premier customer service, I have also learned how to operate the cashier and multi-tasking working in a fast place environment i enjoy making all my customers happy."
good,"Publix is a great company to work for because of the job security, benefits and overall working atmosphere. However, for me it does not pay enough until you have worked about 4/5 years for the company."
good,"I love the people I work with and what I do but we don't get paid enough for the amount of work we employees do in an eight-hour time period. I have been working for over two and a half years as part-time with no promises of advancement. Even though I love to see smiles on satisfied customers, I have to put food on the table."
good,Publix is a great place to work. I have met some of the best customers and co-workers. This company is also very flexible.
good,"A great company to work for"
good,"Bag Groceries, Clean when needed take out customers Orders "
good,"I've enjoyed working with the staff. Clean environment, customers respect and request for me and my two deli managers had great attitudes."
good,"Terrific company - not a fit for my skill set as most of my day would be spent writing technical training manuals."
good,"Publix is a busy grocery store that emphasizes pleasing the customer.  I have learned how to make a good impression on people in less than five minutes.  My managers are always willing to answer my questions and help me when I have a work related problem.  I love my coworkers. We strive to work together as a team.  For me, the hardest part of my job is trying to please so many customers in a short amount of time.  The most enjoyable part of my job is training new cashiers and being able to develop long-term relationships with my regular customers."
good,"security in investment. love the bonus, the enviornment and customers made the work place seem family friendly"
good,"Publix overall is a great place to work, and the environment is very customer and employee friendly."
good,Publix was a very busy place to work. but that was great because it made the day go by fast. I also had a real great manger she went over and beyond to make sure you had a great day.
good,I always arose to thought of going to work with Publix on daily basis. I was at a medium pace store so there was always new things to learn everyday. I learned how to handle many personalities with a variety of people. Along with learning how to be a productive manager. I did have the blessing of working and also learning with/from my co-workers. The hardest part of my position with this company was trying to always go above and beyond their expectations. I always wanted to be better than what they expected from me. I did succeed in that achievement. I would have to say the most enjoyable part of my job was walking into smiling faces and always knowing that they would do whatever means necessary to help me with my daily goals.
good,"Order products"
good,"Publix focuses on what really matters in retail, the customer! That is my most favorite thing about working there. A typical day of work is arriving at 6 am to start daily production which has to be completed by 10 am. Other associate begin to show up at the top of the hour for about the next 3 or 4 hours unless we have a busy day ahead. My co-workers are a joy to work with; everyone gets along for the most part and we joke and laugh amongst getting our work done. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the deli manager and assistant manager; they are unorganized and there is no structure. They half way do their job which leaves it up to the rest of us, but it must be done so we make sure that it is completed. Most enjoyable part, is the advancement and opportunity to climb the ladder in your department or train in another department and float around."
good,"With a hectic school schedule, Publix is the ideal place to work for as they believe education is critical for there employees. Giving your immediate manager a fair amount of notice of your school schedule and what your availability will be lack during your semester is a great perk you receive as a Publix employee.  "
good,I loved working at Publix very flexible with school schedule and for full time students. Enjoyable when meeting new customers in the neighborhood and to Florida.
good,"I was with Publix for 10 years. They always worked well with scheduling. I had to leave for personal reasons, or I would have still been there. I had the opportunities to try for a few different jobs. Started out as bagging groceries. I was put to a front end cashier, then after a few years, they asked if I wanted to work in the front office. I transferred to another store about 1998, cashiered there, then after about a year, I was asked If I wanted to train in the Pharmacy. I accepted. I found it enjoyable and interesting ant the same time.. The hardest part of training was learning everything fresh, being I've never worked in the Pharmacy before. I  found it a new challenge but I did it, and loved it."
good,Publix is a great place to work and they treat their employees great. The management is good to work for but could give more praise in upper management to the lower management associates.
good,"always something to do, never a dull moment, a lot of people to work with."
good,responsible for coordinating all functions associated with the customer and their service.
good,"My typical day at work usually begins at seven in the morning and will end anywhere from two to three in the afternoon. I'm a cashier, so I make sure to greet customers and to ring up their order on the cash register and to make sure that if it's necessary, to give them change back if they paid with cash and to make sure to tell them they have a great day. "
good,Very happy at Publix. Scheduling is just not working out for me at this point in my and my familes lives.
good,"Publix provides all the training you need to accomplish your job well and also provides great benefits to employees.  Breaks are given each day in appropriate lengths.  For part time positions hours are flexible and managers work with you for whatever you need, but as you move up in the company they require more of your time and give you much less of an option.  Not family/life friendly in that aspect. Managers are all friendly. A normal day up front in customer service can include but not be limited to getting carts, bagging, cleaning, cashiering, helping customers in and around the store, etc. co-workers usually have the same friendliness because Publix requires it in the people they hire, so they are 95% of the time all very pleasant to work with."
good,"I ran a register, helped customers, & kept my area clean & organized."
good,It is a nice place to work but they have changed over time like most jobs. It allowed me some flexibility to take care of my family and go to school. The were changing demands and several customer issues but I got a lot of commendation from the managers for customer problem resolution. I was allowed the opportunity to be creative because of my experience which was nice. There was the potential for growth.
good,"I have worked there since I was 15 and I loved it! Although dealing with customers can be annoying at times and some co-workers can be difficult, it is an overall great experience and I think of the people including customers as part of my family."
good,"The most rewarding part of this job was working closely with customers to ensure their special days were perfect.  From planning the perfect wedding cake to facilitating other customer logistical requirements such as ordering specialty confections from vendors, delivery, set up and handling complaints, it was a challenging work environment given the diversity of people. "
good,"Publix Is an all around great company. They strive for the success of their employees and work with them to ensure they succeed. Although there is no grocery discount, their benefit program is exceptional. Deals on hotels, trips, car rentals, and much more. Also, their stock buy in program is great as well. oh yea, and the health and dental plans as well. Only Employees can buy into the company and it helps with the 401K as well. All of the co-workers are pleasant to work with, mostly always joyful and easy to get along with. Management is there for your needs and willing to assist where they can. The job duties are simple and doable, with very little stress or frustrations. all around great plae to work. "
good,Publix is a overall a great company when you are hired full time.
good,This place gave me a chance after no one else would. I was a freshman in college pleading for a place to work and found Publix. I was really happy when I first started working their and Im starting to miss the job now.
good,Publix was a very good place to work. I was there for 31 years and would still be there if I had not moved to an area where there are no Publix.
good,We all worked together as a team and got along great.  Everybody did their own job and helped others as much as possible.  We had a great manager whom treated us with great respect.
good,good learning experience for a part-time job during high school.
good,"I would have loved to stay with this company, but I was having travelling difficulties at the time. The hours were great, and the staff were friendly."
good,Co-workers are all kind and generous. the hardest part of the job is staying on your feet for the whole day
good,test water.
good,"During my few years at this jobs I learned many of the skills I know today pertaining to the work environment. In a typical days work I could have done anything from cutting meat, to helping solve a customers problem, or working at the cash register. I was also a member of my stores grocery team and was responsible for monitoring and ordering new products, as well as stocking the shelves and helping customers find products. The most difficult part of my job was when it wasn't premiere shopping time and there were no customers needing help. The most enjoyable part was after helping a customer find products they were looking for and possibly recommending new products to try, or ones that may enhance their meal."
good,"A typical day at work included greeting customers, ringing up their groceries, bagging them and making sure they had their needs met. I learned a lot about professionalism and working with the general public as well as how to cook from the Aprons department. My co-workers and managers became like family to me and we would often spend time with each other outside of the work place. The hardest part of the job was getting enough hours. The best part of the job was the friendships I made."
good,"Good paced, safe environment"
good,Good Working environment and very fast paced. I liked to come to work and work among great employees and have nice small talk conversations with the customers

good,nice place to work. it a family. if u want to work there u can work for as long as u want the job is secured and there is room for advancement.
good,"Very Customer Friendly Environment, great Work Environment"
good,"A typical day at work for me is dealing with mostly happy customers some angry, I learned a lot just by working at a grocery store and I learned to value my health. My managers were somewhat fair, some days were better than others, my co-workers were very up lifting and hardworking, easy to get along with, and were always willing to give a helping hand. There wasn't actually anything hard about my job, besides trying to calm down an angry customer, the most enjoyable part was being able to make someone's day just by asking how their day was going or a little 2 minute conversation with a cashier."
good,"Was team leader at the facility maintence warehouse over seeing shipping and receiving (UPS,FedEx & US Postal, creating routing schedule for delivery truck. Also ordered parts for maintence workers at times also was driver for store emergency delivery's. Work with an awesome group of people."
good,changed ad weekly and maked signs
good,"All in all a good place, a typical day just passes by quicker than I can imagine. Unloading trucks is the hardest thing there."
good,Publix is a great company to work for. Management was exceptional and the workplace was wonderful.
good,Unloading the trucks and stocking the shelves in the store. Then doing inventory counts.
good,"Learning how to make fruits and vegetables into flowers,animals,plants,etc. to decorate platters or salads most enjoyable for me. I also learned how to deal with annoying customers nicely. The hardest part is many customers and only two associates working the lunch rush, that was most days."
good,The benefits publix offered were great and unless you were the seasonally you had job security if you did your job right. There is some advancement within publix but you would need to be there for a long time. A good place for teenagers to start their first job and hold till they are finished with school.
good,My co workers are cool they make the day go by fast. My managers are good with situations that goes on. The hardest part is when you have difficult customers. I enjoy thing about my job
good,The co-workers are great people. I enjoy working here for the most part.
good,On a typical day at work i scan atleast 500 items to sale. I gather up and bring in about 50 carts a day from outside. i do Daily chores around the store. Management and co-workers are usually nice at publix. The hardest part of the job is probably cleaning the bathrooms. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to communicate with my customers everyday.
good,Met a lot of new people. Mostly elderly people in my area that were friendly and had great conversations with. Learned how to interact with customers in a friendly environment.
good,"Doing payroll, helping customers, working a register,stocking"
good,"The jobs themselves are fairly monotonous and for most people life starts when they leave work. In this regard it is a great place to have a steady guaranteed income (given you are willing to work hard) and advancement seems to be open to anyone willing to put in the extra time and effort. For the most part the people are good as is the management. The upper management all seem to have good character and a great willingness to talk to anyone, no matter how busy they might be."
good,"Learned to handle large sums of money, deal with difficult customers, adapt to different management types, advancement in status plus annual raises."
good,Well everything was the same day in and out. The job itself was a fun experience.
good,A lot of advancement. Nice people to work with. Many different departments to go into.
good,Pulling cookies hardest part of job it was cold in there for food product. Fun with co-workers
good,"i was a seafood specialist,i ordered the seafood, iset up the showcase and took care of the custermers needs."
good,"A typical day at work would be meeting the customer's needs as well as establishing a relationship with weekly customers. I've learned that providing quality customer service goes a long way. Even the smallest things make a big difference. My co-workers are very nice for the most part. we all get along very well and make a good team when it comes to meeting the needs of our customers.The hardest part of the job is working with co-workers that are not dedicated to going above and beyond for the customers. The most enjoyable part of my job is bonding with the customers, and also seeing the satisfying look on their face when you have met their needs."
good,"Working at publix has taught me the value of working hard. When I first got the job at the age of 14, I thought just having a job means you could be rich. I was sadly mistaken. I later found out the more hours you work the more money I could get to support my family. So I did just that. I worked countless hours."
good,Pays great.
good,working very hard
good,This is a great company to start off working for the first time. If you stay with them and preform well you can move up into management quite quickly.
good,"Great place to work, management really cares about you as an employee. Always feel like I'm part of a team"
good,"Offers Benefits that other companies do not offer, Job security is also a plus"
good,Very good job to get your feet wet. Great culture and one of the best places to work. Each store is different and management changes regularly.
good,"It is a great place to work, always striving to make better.They offer health care dental 401 and disability."
good,"Publix was a good and strick work enviorment. Management was strick on making sure their employees were doing their job right. Publix was excellent at providing great customer service and made sure their employees were too. Everything in the store was to be kept clean at all times and employees were to be well dressed clean cut, clean shaved, and no body odors. If employees were late to many times they got a wright up and to many lead to suspension or termination. Good work lead to free meals from deli and good evaluations which determined your raise. Over all Publix was great company to work for."
good,Publix is a great company overall but it might suck for you if management is selfish and egocentric depending on your store! The managers come and go as usual but some of them try to be relevant! by
good,"Publix was an amazing work experience, there is a clear line of progession and many chances to improve yourself. Management is willing to work with you and customer service will get you a long way."
good,"As publix being my first ever job, I have learned a countless number of life skills. I love publix as a company but the store that I attended work is a little much. The number of customers has doubled do to other stores closing. The management is also somewhat ignorant and impulsive. I love publix and would highly recommend it for anyone as a first job."
good,Is this portion actually necessary? I do not feel like reviewing my past places of employment that I resigned from. There is a reason I resigned. I enjoyed the benefits and pay. Worked there for 7 years.
good,I'm always getting nice treats for having great customer service. I enjoy my customers. My co-workers are a great deal to be around as well. My overall experience is great.
good,"I love all my co-workers there, especially the management. They treated us fairly and the atmosphere was just awesome. I have a wonderful experience working in publix."
good,This company offers a great experience to anyone who dedicates themselves to it. Some policies are a bit out of date but they are trying to move forward with rectifying that. Excellent work conditions for most besides management but they are well compensated.
good,When i went in for my first day I was greeted and helped very well. I had a hard time for the first time but it got easier over time. You have to answer the question right for you to be called and interviewed.
good,"There's much that can be said about corporate America, but Publix dodges most of the negativity by being a company that is fairly run and open to working with it's employees. There's rough spots, for sure, but it's a pleasure to work at Publix."
good,It's a amazing place to work and they really care. Some rules are strict but they are very easy to follow and the people are great and you are never tasked with so much that you feel overwhelmed
good,I loved publix it's really a great company. The job in the deli is crazy but every manager I worked with there always worked with me. I would definitely go back.
good,"My favorite part about working for this company is that they care about their employees first. If you take care of your employees first, it makes it so much easier to take care of your customers needs too. And they give you a 401k, and stock benefits that you can take with if you work with them for 3 years or more. They even offer tuition reimbursement!"
good,"The training is excellent. Unlike other jobs I have held, they give you the recourses and knowledge to fulfill your responsibilities. The opportunity to cross-train was very good. Getting money handling experience gives opportunities for the future. Good place to work."
good,Working at Publix has given me the opportunity to help customers when they have needed it. Everybody that works there is nice. Everyone helps each other.
good,I Enjoy what I do working for PUBLIX I started as in aprons service rep cooking demonstration meals because I love to cook the late hours created a problem for my family life so I transferred to early morning hours which works well for me . For such a very large company the salary is low and raises are minimal even though you commit to more availability and do more on the job then that is Required but I do love the people I work with they make my days very enjoyable
good,"I’ve also met great people while at Publix . It really is a pleasure to work there . They also provide assistance for college , depending on your degree."
good,"A typical day at Publix is very relaxing but can also be busy. It depends on what day it is. On the weekends is when they're the busiest. The weekdays are not to busy. A typical day at work for a bagger is getting carts, making sure everything looks organized, helping the customers look for what they needed and asking customers for helping out to unload groceries. For a cashier, one scans groceries, conversate with the customers, assist customers if needed, and help may things look organized."
good,"Being Management is a wonderful privilege at Publix, while the job it self and the benefits are great, I have not been able to manage a healthy work life balance. I come home stressed and angry almost everyday and my family is suffering. I care so much about work and can’t seem to leave it there when I clock out. Being a Publix Manager is truly wonderful but it isn’t for the weak minded.at all."
good,I loved working at Publix. It is a very friendly environment. The management  was very helpful with any questions or concerns that you would have. Employees are always a pleasure to be around and great teamwork.
good,My life as a cake decorator is very rewarding. Managers are very stressed. Working at this company is very promising. I am interested in excelling in a new career path.
good,it is a good company to work for there benefits are good to I like working there just didn't  get long with some people it is a hard job in the deli you are always busy doing something which is a good thing ti.e goes by fast you have to keep up with the pace
good,"Loved this job, the pay was great considering what similar companies pay, you can always go to another department if you want to branch out. Loved the culture."
good,"All of the managers really put alot of effort into providing the best for their employees as much as they do for their customers and were fair and helpful if you ever sought to grow there and turn this into a career, which is why the experience of working there was 10/10."
good,I worked for 17 years! Loved my job! Fast paced. Busy. Great coworkers and benefits. Pay was competitive . Customer service is key! Great location. I only left due to disability

good,"Publix is one of the best companies I've ever worked for.  The pay is reasonable,  especially working partime. They are very fair and the atmosphere is very friendly,  I've been working for Publix about 10 months and I have not had a bad day yet. Thank you Publix"
good,"I learned most of my customer service skill during my time at Publix. Management was very good and patient, respected the policies. I also learned how to operate a register."
good,"Job selector and is very fast pace and very crazy too much be going on. free lunch everyday, if you move to another position other than select then the company is great to work for."
good,I enjoy working for Publix it’s easy and relaxing but it does matter which department you’re working in too. I was a cashier and I worked in customer service. I really missed working for them and I would most definitely go back. The pay is low but they do offer good benefits and give good promotions.
good,"If you work hard, they will notice this and you need to let them know you are pursuing a career there. Sometimes it takes a long time to get full-time! You  you need to make it known if you are really truly wanting to make this a career!   Benefits if you work 30  hours plus a week or you are full-time. After one year or so many working hrs you receive employee stocks."
good,"You join a team and can rise through the ranks if you want to. The pay is good. You almost never lose your job,and the company hype is amazing. You definitely feel like you are part of more than just a grocery store."
good,"I assist all the Customers with their: Deli Sandwich Meat/Cheese Orders, Make Customers Subs to Order while they wait & Serve Customers Hot Food to Order."
good,Publix is a very stable place to work that pays really well being percentage based. Offer lots of benefits and great opportunities and stock options. Very organized as well
good,The other people that I worked with were amazing. They hired me in at a rate just above what my other job was paying me and I was happy to have been offered the job.
good,Not all businesses have the work place benefit package/401k stock options plans for their workers like Publix does and also extends to part time workers that have been with Publix two years
good,Publix is a great place to work. Advancement opportunities with benefits. Publix is a team environment. I enjoyed forming relationships with my fellow associates and customers I would see on a regular basis.
good,Publix is a great place to work the management team is very responsive to everything very good open door policy the work life is so hectic because you're in a busy location but overall the stores good.
good,"Publix employment was great. Good clean professional  environment. Very effective, engaged management. Firm but fair. Expectations were clearly communicated. Products are always neatly displayed and with-in use by dates. Teamwork consistently encouraged. Management and staff always go the extra mile to ensure prompt, courteous customer service. Polic"
good,It's an good job but hard to become full time and no set schedule so even with being full time is hard to balance out your time specially with you have an family and want to jave family time
good,"Show up to work, clock in. Some days I would bag groceries, cashier, stock shelves, clean the store, make sure the store is a maximum efficiency throughout the day. The Management overall are amazing and know what their doing. Most of the Managers make us feel like we belong and can be comfortable to work and not stress us out. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the people that don't want to do the work. The most enjoyable part is knowing that I could've made a customer's day better."
good,Publix is a good company to work for. You can move up in management fast (Depends if you're willing to move). they Understand your personal balance with work and family.
good,Great work place but management not so cool. Great benefits. 30 to 36 hours unless there’s a holiday. Your day off can be take it away. Free lunch love working for Publix but management suck.
good,Publix has great benefits and they promote from within which is great. It ensures that the Publix culture is kept alive  year after year.  This guarantees customers are treated like kings and queens just like when the company started.
good,"For the most part I love my job and the customers. Sometimes management plays favorites and I don’t feel totally appreciated for how hard I work while others who don’t work as hard get recognized. "
good,"I throughly enjoyed my work as a cashier at Publix. I thought that not only were my co-worker and managers wonderful to work with, but even the customers were kind."
good,"Publix was my first employer. I really enjoyed working at the store. It taught me the importance of appearance, professionalism, and customer service. I think it is the perfect first job for any person, especially teens and young adults. There, you taught the value in hard work."
good,"I go in an hour before I have to clock in everyone is nice polite of course once I clock in it’s time to work yes it’s gets very busy but everyone helps and everyone has something to do there is no standing around and the customers are sometimes rude but we handle it professionally as we can and we carry on about our day once it’s night time business is slow and it’s time to clean and get ready for closing so,e stay over night till 12 or 1 but that’s for full time people of course and yes that’s the Publix way and the management is great as well"
good,Excellent work environment. Opportunity for advancement. good benefits available to full and part time employees. On the job learning and training opportunity's.
good,"Publix was a very pleasant experience. As a cashier in customer service, I was forced to be more open and polite to everyone around me, and had to make sure I communicated everything clearly both to customers and coworkers. This is a spectacular place to learn those types of social skills."
good,"Publix was great for a first time job. It was easy and the people who worked along side me were very nice, and helpful. At the time my manager was pregnant so we helped her a lot with her job. I learned how to bag certain items with others, and how to handle cash. They had flexible hours since I was still in high school."
good,I love working for Publix.  Face to face customer interaction is great.  co-workers and staff are friendly and you get along well with them.  Also there plenty of stores to choose from.
good,"I loved working for Publix I was there for three years. I was there through the good, bad and the ugly. Management changed so much in the pharmacy and it started going downhill because you have to have a manager that is for their team and also the patients as well."
good,Seems to have lost sight of the publix mission in some areas. Not so much a big family anymore. Instead most employees are treated as a number instead of a person
good,A day of work consist of cleaning your work space and quickly and accurately scanning and bagging grocery items awhile providing excellent customer service to all customers.
good,"Best company to work for. Great benefits, opportunity to earn as much as you want as a selector. Great management, promotions from within the company. Free stocks just for being a Publix associate."
good,"Publix is the best job I have had so far. The hours are fair, the pay is fair, opportunity for raises and advancements are obtainable. Management shows genuine interest and care for employees, open door policy allows full comfort, honesty and judge free environment for employees. Publix employees feel more like a family than co workers. Overall good place to work."
good,Publix is a relaxed job. its fast paced at times depending on the time of day. Management was good. Nothing hard about the job at all. I enjoyed seeing all my regular customers coming in to shop
good,"Publix was a wonderful place to work. I made many friends. Once they left the company and after I left, we still remained friends. The culture is wonderful. Working at Publix was a pleasure. It was a place i looked forward to going."

good,Most managers are really great they really feel more like family than management they care about their associates and it was a privilege to work there.  The associates are wonderful we all work together for the common good. I loved the last department I was in Produce Receiving Day shift.  We celebrated birthday's Length of Service and if anyone got hurt we gathered money to help their family and if anyone had a baby we had a shower. I acquired many great friends and it was painful to leave them but my health was not good.
good,Great coworkers and customers.  Friendly people all around. Most enjoyed interacting with the customers. Least enjoyed people taking advantage of Publix's refund/return policy.
good,Overall my experience at Publix was ideal. Of course some things need to be put n place to make improvements. Some great days and some bad days. Hardest thing is the workload per man.

good,"Responsibilities included slicing meats, preparing chicken, making sandwiches, stocking items. I was always pleasant to the customers and some would only come on days that I was working."
good,"Great place to work, staff was like family, the benefits were great. I worked there for a little over five years, most days were pretty relaxed with small parts of the day that got more fast paced especially around hobidays when the store was busy. But I enjoyed it and the customers were also great."
good,"Fun and friendly place to work. Management cared about employees, busy during season so hours were always good. Pay was good and great environment to work"

good,"something diff , not for me culture is real good , hard part are the customer , typical day work for publix you have to keep a smile all day, you have to keep in your head that the customer is always right"
good,"A normal day would consist of working as a team, but also individually. Preforming task that were required to be completed by the end of shift and helping others. Learning new things as seasons change and being able to show your own creativity. It was a very family oriented work place where they cared about not only the job but you and your family as well. The hardest part of the job would be the rise in production during the holidays. The most enjoyable experiences were working as a team and seeing the beauty of the finished product."
good,i personally has a few issues when working at this store but it was all personal. as in i just didn’t get on with certain people. but as far as i could tell the publix company as a whole was pretty impressive and truly loved and cared for their employees. i wouldn’t just say i’m likely to reccomend this company. i HAVE recommended this company to many people.
good,publix is  a great company to work for the flexible hours the benefits and also the advancement opportunities.If there was a way i could teach at publix or run/work at a publix daycare that would be a hole in one.
good,"Fast-paced environment"
good,"After I left the company, there isn't any other grocery store like it. If you are trying to find another grocery chain to work for after working for publix everyone is inferior to publix. They have the highest standards and it may be stressful at the time but you really appreciate it after you leave because no other chain cares like publix does."
good,"I would go into work, and get to my job right away. I learned plenty about the super market business while working there as well as making great friends.

good,A typical day at work is learning about something new everyday. I learned how to do things in different departments like produce and floral arrangements. Management never really gave me a chance for advancement which i would've taken it and ran with it.  hardest part of the job was being in a department that was very cold. (Produce) The most enjoyable part of the job was the fact that i smelled like a fruit when I came home.
good,"Working at Publix was one of the best decisions I've made. The work wasn't too difficult, and the management was great. The managers were very supportive and willing to provide opportunities for growth in the company. The workplace environment was unlike any other.

good,I started at Publix when I was 16 years old and it was an amazing experience. It helped shaped me into the person I am today. I learned everything on how to clean toilets at 16 to how to run a 35 million dollar a year store.
good,everything about this company is great accept you get too attached to the nice managers that you do more than you should  and they expect more from you without paying you more. they can easily hire you at 9.75 and raise every 6 months but then they hire someone new with less experience and begin them higher than what you make which makes you want to do less
good,Publix is an outstanding company to work for.  It offers the opportunity for growth within the company and is a relatively low-stress place to work.  There are many opportunities to learn new skills and develop relationships with all sorts of people.  Customer service is their prime competitive advantage it is rewarding to serve the customers and seeing them come back on a regular basis.

good,"Despite the challenges that retail can bring, Publix was great to me.  It paid me extremely well, I made life long connections to people, and I truly enjoyed the work."
good,"Publix offers associates several benefits as well as competitive pay. Although you must work your way up in the company, the culture is supportive and if you work hard moving up to a desired postion should take less than a year. Since the company is employee owned motivation to work hard and honestly is not an issue."

Pay is low but they do offer great benefits if you are a full time employee. I was crossed trained in every department but my main title was a deli clerk during my first 5 and a half years working for the company. The environment is the deli is very active and fast paced. My last 6 months I was transferred to the Pharmacy dept where I was trained and became a certified pharmacy technician. Pharmacy environment was very relaxed and slow paced.
good,"Checked out customers, bagged when needed, help customer locate things in the store.  Filled in for call offs.  The culture at publix is great. Teammates were great"

By far the only job I've ever felt appreciated at. Reviews based on your performance, part time and I've got every benefit that most jobs offer except paid time off."
good,"Great and excellent company. Hours are not the most consistent, but that comes with the job. Needs to work on organizing the back room more but that comes with a great crew over time."
good,"Typical days are working in a fast pace environment, but workers always seem to be happy and cheerful and enjoy their job. Publix values its employee's and I would say management is respectful and professional at all times. The benefits are good and pay is very competitive, very good stock options. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with a fast customer flow during the holidays or big events like game days."

good,The pace and intensity of your job honestly depends on your location because I worked in downtown Atlanta it was non stop all day. Other than that its pretty nice place to work easy to move up in the ranks if you want fair pay.
good,"Being a stock guy was fun but hard. The long days hurt but the pay check was always nice and most of the customers are good people.The staff working at Publix is a mixed bag, some are very good at what they do and others don't really have a passion for work but are let go after not too long."
good,Got to be fast paces. run 80 cases per 60 minutes. Managers usually work with you and if youre looking to advance you have to be completely determined and focused
good,"I absolutely love my job at Publix, and plan to continue working there throughout my college years. My only reason for leaving will be after graduation, when I obtain work in my field. Even then, I might continue working biweekly or monthly, just for the sake of my admiration for a company that genuinely cares about its customers."

good,"I starter at Publix as a cashier, after 6 month I was promoted to Customer Service."

good,Good benefits and pay. If you want to have a career it's a great place to work. Publix promotes from within.  It's just getting a little too physical for me.
good,"Very great place to work, especially for students, while you may also advance into management and make it a career. Would recommend as a company 100%. If you don't mind working in a retail, I would say it is your best option!"
good,Can’t say anything bad about Publix. It’s not perfect but it’s better then the competitors by a lot. If you would like a stable and secure career this company is it and you would be a fool to pass up an offer to work for them.
good,Fast paced work with opportunities for advancement.  Good training and reward for hard work.  A lot of interaction with customers- so it can be good training for social skills.  Good benefits and eventual partial ownership in the company with the ability to purchase Publix Stock.

I learned a lot on customer service and how to go about solving problems within the store. The workplace culture was very friendly, good community and very flexible! There were no necessarily hard parts of the job--nothing that couldn't be handled. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know the co-workers and regular customers that came through the store."
good,"Scheduling can be annoying, however, great place to earn a living.  Low stress environment for hourly associates.  The hardest part of the job is keeping every customer happy."
good,The Management and Employees were great to work with. I still consider them and friends. Publix is a great place to work and shop. Great customers. The food products are top notch. Food preparation and quality seem better than most other grocery stores. The culture of cleanliness and neatness is spot on.

good,"Excellent company. Very competitive for pharmacy position. I have learned to work fast, safe and efficient. I enjoy Publix, it is a pleasure working for them. The hardest part is separating and competing with hundreds of other pharmacists for only a handful of positions. I enjoy the stocks, the pay, that it is a private company and that it is relatively simple to move up if you are ambitious enough."
good,"It's okay, if you wanna make it into a career start in any department except customer service its rough. customer service is just brutal you have to be nice even when the customer is being completely rude and obnoxious."
good,I had a wonderful experience at Publix. Everyone was kind and worked together as a team. The most enjoyable part of my job at Publix was helping people get the medication they needed.

good,"I really loved working for Publix warehouse I was a produce selector at work many hours pays good very high pace If I can do it again I would retire from Publix warehouse .

good,"I am currently an employee of Publix and needless to say it is a great company to work for!!! I have worked for a few other retail giants but I rate Publix the highest because they are truly a great company to work for. The management, unlike others, are really invested in great customer service and treat their employees with dignity and respect. Yes Pharmacy practice is about the same wherever you work but at least some companies like Publix don't pile up unnecessary tasks outside patient care services!!!"
good,I have nothing bad to say about this place great establishment to work fun place to start if your looking to get over fears such as talking to people well not the fear but the nervousness other then that a great place to work

good,I enjoy working for  this company and I would recommend the company to anyone searching for employment. it feels like I am around family and friends when I am on the clock.
good,Publix was not for me at the time as I was a single mom with daycare issues.  Never knew what my schedule was going to be from one week to the next.   Great place to work with benefits
good,"Check product dates ,rotate, check refrigeration , food prep in all areas sub shop, rotisserie oven, fryers , prepared deli platters. Slicing meats and cheeses. Pricing product ordering product and supplies. Customer service , taking and filling customer orders preparing customer orders. Learned the benefits of working as a team .Enjoy serving the public."
good,"Publix is an overall great place to work. Management would be the only concern that I would have. Some managers don't know what they are doing which ends up hurting the whole department. Some managers are mean and that throws the whole attitude of the department off as well. The meat department is a great department to work in. The hardest part about the meat department is simply just the fact that it is cold. You defiantly learn a lot as you continue to cut meat. The more you wrap and tag meat, the more you learn the product. Overall in my personal experience the meat department is one of the best departments to work in."
good,"I loved working for Publix. "
good,"great benefits, just feels like a dead end job for someone of colour. I enjoyed having a set schedule and being able to apply for full benefits. I enjoyed being able to shop there as well."

good,"A typical day includes cashiering , cleaning the workplace"
good,"A typical work day in the deli was extremely busy you had to be able to multi-task. I learned how to multi-task such as answering phones, taking care of customers every need, and keeping up with production. The management system all depends on the current manager some are great and others not so much. The workplace can sometimes be tense, but we all worked together as a team to take care of customers. The hardest part of the job was the multi-tasking.The most enjoyable part was being able to put a smile on customers faces."
good,"I completely enjoyed my experience as an employee at Publix. There were not enough opportunities for me to have full time employment, so I had to accept an opportunity elsewhere"
good,a very physical job selecting was tough but they paid me very well and was very understanding to certain situations as far as when kids would get sick and i would have to switch a day with someone so wouldn't have to call in
good,"I loved working at Publix as my high school job. However, it is a slow advancement process. They hire great people. Some employees refused to do the ""lower level"" work: bagging, cashiering, getting carts outside."
good,This job is quick paced most days but sometimes it can be balanced. You just need to have the right team on the right days. Most days its good and bad
good,"working at Publix is a joy making things in the Bakery, serving the customers, It was nice. The co-workers are easy to get along with some of the Managers are very good but you will have a few that will have issues with anyone."

good,Great customer service and friendly place to work good benefits good job and great work place helpful and easy to reach management with good head work flexible work
good,They are very understanding people and try their hardest to work with people. They genuinely care about their customers and their employees. They are hard working and are always willing to help you to help yourself move up and learn as much as possibles.

good,"Basically if you worked at publix, it's a great grocery store. Its not really for everyone though, if you're not able to deal with always treating the customer as if they are the most important person you may want to try somewhere else. The people are nice enough and it is a great starter job that could lead to a career. Just requires a certain level of dedication."

good,Managing daily operations and up to 15 or more associates.Inventory customers service was top priority.Ordering products.Keeping track of items and making sure good profit was made monthly
good,Enjoyed my time at this company. Retired after husbands death and relocated or would still be working there. Fell like training and guidance was always exceptional. Always felt appreciated and accomplished with my daily job performances
good,"I enjoyed working with my coworkers. The management was great. They were very flexible with my school hours. My hours were good, as well. I loved interacting with all the customers."
good,"I started as a bagger in 2013, and now I am a CSTL. That just shows how quickly you can advance with this company. The benefits are fantastic for full-time. PTO, 401k, Dental, etc. The people you work with are very supportive and don't make you feel like a cumbrance. I would honestly recommend this job to anyone, first job or last."
good,My typical day of work is simple just doing my job and getting threw my day. I learned that we should go to work every single day and help out customers.
good,"Awesome company, excellent management and coworkers. If you work hard, they do notice and will give you raises accordingly. Also, family like work environment where you work as a team and also don't work major holidays. The stock is also a great opportunity you don't want to pass up."
good,Great place to work with great pay  Great benefits  equal opportunity I would go back any day! My last manger was equal/fair I will recommend anybody to apply
good,Publix is a great place to work. This location is a higher volume store and is really fast paced. The team is excellent and really keeps this location motivated and exceeding its standards.
good,Publix provides an encouraging and satisfying work culture and environment. Our customers are great and so is our management team. The quality of benefits provided by Publix and the investment in it's associates are top notch.
good,"My position requires my full attention and focus as my duties are fast-paced. Customer service is premier, which makes for a reputable company to be employed for."
good,It is a really friendly and enjoyable environment. It can be overwhelming at times with customer rushes. Management changes a lot but they are good at what they do.
good,Publix was a great place to work. The opportunity for advancemet is great. The pay is good and culture is great one to be part of. Its a wonder family environment and Publix does take care of their own.
good,"Great place, rewards people who stay and clearly expresses interest in employees with countless ways of helping employees financially, personally, and medically."
good,i have always been a bucher a typical day consists of prep work loading and unloading truck etc i learned that hard work and attention to detail pays off the workplace is a steady pace with something always going on to keep you busy or motivated the hardest part of the job was adjusting to the schedule the most enjoyable benefit of the job is the satisfaction of a hard days work
good,It was fun to work at publix at first it just became to much to bare in the long run like I said too much drama in the workforce if there was no drama I wouldn't have resigned from publix
good,"My favorite thing about Publix is that you have great benefits and a good work family. The co workers all are usually very friendly and want to talk and get to know you outside of work. My biggest issue with Publix is that it's not the best paycheck for people not in management and if you are not strict with your availability, they will schedule you a ton with out days off."
good,It is a friendly work place as long as Bette Shai is not around because when no one else is looking she will call you a b word and start yelling at you even though you did nothing to deserve her kind of behavior. The job security part sucks because once you get fired or quite they do not allow you back. Their job security sucks.
good,"I started with Publix as a 16 year old looking for a first job. Little did I know, this ""first job"" would end up carrying me through college and paying for my degree through the reimbursement program. I have had a wonderful experience working for Publix as a part-time associate and I would recommend it to everyone."
good,"Publix is a great place to work and they provide competitive benefits.  For anyone looking for a stable job with room to grow, without the need for a college degree, this company is the best.  The downside is that the only way to really start earning is by advancing to management and Publix demands a lot.  If you do not mind spending your nights, weekends and holidays working, then you will be well taken care of."
good,Publix is great while you're in college just don't expect to get promoted very quickly if you ultimately decide you want to stay after you graduate. Publix is very over-saturated and as such there aren't a lot of spots available.
good,Publix was a great place to work for health benefits as well as well as retirement benefits. They offer stock to their associates that have worked a certain amount of hours.
good,The hardest part of my job is making enough to get all of my work completed. Management is always trying to help you move up in the organization. The most enjoyable part of my day is interacting with my co-workers.
good,I began working at Publix as a cashier and also stocking shelves and fronting products. I worked my way up to pharmacy tech by applying and studying on line and at home to become efficient in my job. Learning drug names and effects on the body was my goal so I could be a great tech. Loved the work.
good,"I've learned a lot in my 5+ years working for this company,, co workers become your family and safety becomes your bestfriend .The hardest part was the holiday season it would be a very long day 18 hours .."
good,Publix is one of the best employee own company which I truly loved and enjoyed. I would definitely recommend the job to any first time ob hunter because there is room for advancement.
good,"A great company to work for, if you want to move up be prepared to promote your self and the best thing since sliced bread.  Publix has outstanding benefits and they are quite reasonable company to work for"
good,"Overall a typical day is positive involving passionate coworkers and appreciative customers. I learned how to be more confident in my abilities to understand the needs and wants of customers, to solve problems some customers may have with a product or service and to help coworkers achieve their personal goals and aspirations."
good,"Busy days many customers i have enjoyed,  always focusing on filling prescriptions in a timely matter,  best part of day is when work complete and customers were satisfied"
good,"Co-workers became like family. Great setting enjoyed working for a private company. Benefits were awesome. They bought stock for you. There was nothing hard about the job, The customers and patients treated us with respect. I treasured the management for treating us like people and not just numbers."
good,"I've Worked for Publix for over 3 years while in High School , My duties were unloading the trucks that came in 4-5 days of the week ,Greeting All Customers , kept shelves full ,  Organized items accordingly to the labels (face Front) , Condensing back room freight."
good,I truly enjoyed my time spent working at Publix. I was with this company for 5 years until I moved up north to Chicago. The fellow staff and customers gave a true family feel all around.
good,"I worked at Publix for a part time college job. Flexible hours, so it's great if you have class. If you have the drive to move to management, and make a serious effort, Publix will reward you. The compensation is more than minimum wage to start as well. They are strict with the traditional Publix rules and regulations, but they like to keep a consistent image at every store."
good,"My typical day was maintenance on the second shift of all equipment on the ""hot side"" of the Bakery in Lakeland. Great management and enjoyed working with my fellow coworkers. Learned alot about ovens printers, weigh scales..etc..hardest part of job was constantly clearing  conveyor jams. most enjoyable was working on installing new electrical panels"
good,Publix is an amazing job but needs one key thing and that is better balancing skills for the employee because if you need 2 jobs to maintain a stable life they want you to themselves or just replace you and you get less hours
good,"Very traditional environment, focus is on customer satisfaction. Hours vary pretty widely if you're part time, full time is more consistent. Great benefits; healthcare, 401K, and stock options. A bit sexist depending on the managers. Most challenging factors are back to back shifts and managerial push back, for example it often seems like the expectations are higher than they should be but as long as you're visibly trying to meet your goals, there aren't a lot of consequences and higher ups will try and work with you. Best part of the job is the community aspect, management works pretty hard to build teams of like minded people to reduce conflict, they strive for a familial environment and it makes work a lot less stressful. Bottom line, be courteous and professional and you'll do fine."
good,Excellent company to work for. I thoroughly enjoyed and appreciated the 9 years I had at this company. I was able to develop a work ethic and learned great customer service skills which I believe are important regardless of ones career path. Great management and great work culture. They made you feel as if you were part of one giant family and sincerely cared about you. I would highly recommend this job to anyone.
good,"Great enviroment, friendly and helpful people. Good place to work and gives you great experiene in customer service. Shows you what to expect for future job preferences."
good,"This job was a demanding one,but the pay and benefits were really beneficial and fair.A real team atmosphere,and we were more like family members than co-workers.Still remain in contact with a lot of them....A great work experience"
good,I loved Publix and would go back any day. Customer service as a cashier was my day to day job. The management at my store was great and made sure they took care of us and knew what was going on with the associates. The culture was all types of people and religions that worked and shopped there daily. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and providing exceptional customer service.
good,Great place for a young person to start off their career though i had my own complications peers i worked with loved it there
good,"fun place to work, close relationships with students"
good,"It was a very good place to work, they focused on making sure the customers were happy, as well at the workers. Always kept the store clean, and met a lot of new faces. I learned how to not waste time and to keep my self busy when it was slow."
good,"I really enjoy working for this company. My wife and i are looking to make some bigger decisions about our family real soon and that calls for me to find a typical day job with set hours. If you do not mind the retail hours, then this is an ideal place to work. Everyone is incredibly nice and willing to work with you, and there is a tremendous amount of growth happening right now as the company moves up the east coast. If you are willing to accept all the knowledge that the amazing managers offer you, you yourself will be on your way to rising up the Publix ladder."
good,Publix is a great company. They worked around my college schedule with no questions asked. This was very important to me. They have great management and staff.
good,"I started working for pubix right after I graduated, I have been employeed with the company for 7 years. I am very confindent in my job, in fact I am the only associate at my location that can help in any department. Over all publix is a great place to work, even though you do have to put in work/time in order to see full time postions. Management come and go do to the high turn around in the different district."
good,Very friendly customers and associates create the ideal working environment. Starting pay depends on what you made at previous jobs. Deli work is continuous which makes the days go by fast.
good,"Good place to grow within the company. However, I am not the type to bag groceries and do the same thing over and over again for a 10 hour shift and make minimum wage."
good,"Great customer service, "
good,"Great place to work, i learned to become more vocal to customers and it taught me doing things as a team is better than doing it by yourself."
good,"Being the type of job it is, it is amazing. I highly recommend working at Publix for anyone who is currently going to school or has work restrictions. They definitely will work with you on that.. but. If you have an open availability, be ready to come in with some very odd shifts. Kiss a sleep schedule goodbye, since they enjoy working you all morning shifts one week and then until midnight the next. Sometimes back to back."
good,I would show up to work and help get the store ready for opening. I check out customers and help with bagging. Sometimes I would stay when the food truck came and helped unload it.
good,"I was only part time and I learned a lot about deli meats and the processing. As I will now only purchase Boars Head Meats. Management was great very understanding.  My co-workers where always willing to help and we worked as a team, I am still friends with many of them. The hardest part of the job was standing for long periods. The part I liked best working for Publix was a flexible schedule that I was able to choose what days and hours I could work, I also enjoyed interacting with my co-workers an customers."
good,"Publix is a wonderful place to work for! "
good,Publix is great place to work and meet all types of different people. I like coming to work and putting a smile on the customers faces.
good,The people I worked with that enjoyed their job. Overall it was a very pleasant experience. The company really cared about their employees.
good,Publix Pharmacy was amazing to work for and sometimes I do miss it. It isn't as crazy as other companies so you can focus on serving the customer and providing good service.
good,"Publix is an excellent place for a young student to gain work experience. I have never applied for a job and not gotten a call back, on the strength of my experience with Publix alone."
good,"It is a very good company to work for that offers good benefits and growth to part time and full time employees. A typical day is usually busy with customers that we are constantly providing customer service to. This includes money orders,faxing,lottery, showing customers where items are, etc."
good,"My time at Publix was great. I had excellent bosses, coworkers, and work environments. I'd recommend this job to anyone that needs a place to work while looking for something that might pay more."
good,I have learned a lot working at publix have they have thought me a lot of job skills  and  customer service  it was overall a grate place to work and meet new people  you will gain respect for yourself and have a great they will give you your time off if asked
good,"When I cashier, I greet customers, answer questions about products, scan items, and process tenders. Other duties occasionally pop up, such as cleaning, bagging, and returning items to their shelves."
good,"A typical day of customer service at Publix includes greeting customers, asking them if they need any help finding anything, bagging for customers, and collecting the carts from the parking lot. Publix has taught me how to work with a team and how to provide quality service for the not just customers but for co-workers and managers as well. The management is wonderful. Great staff, great team. Its almost like being a part of a family. My co-workers are mostly teens trying to save money for school, or people who have decided to make Publix their career. I think I am leaning in a different direction than Publix and would like to work in areas that apply to the skills I have attained from college."
good,My most enjoyable part of the job is making a customer smile and knowing they found everything okay . I like to able to bond with my customers treat them like family.
good,"The days and nights working there was great.The management team is okay.Co-workers are like none you every worked with before.The hardest part about the job was the heat,I enjoyed lunched that the company provided."
good,"Working at Publix has no ordinary day. I may have just worked in the warehouse ,but my fellow associates were family. Publix strives to keep the bond between associates strong and it is a very positive environment. Everyone is understanding and very helpful. I recommend anyone who is looking for a part-time/full-time job to look into Publix. Management and benefits are amazing!"
good,Publix is a great place to work. Everyone works as a team to get things done. I've learned how to communicate better with customers and the best part of the job is getting to know our customers.
good,"Working in the deli is extremely difficult physical work, however it also is a great department to exhibit excellent customer service skills and sales ability."
good,I enjoy working in this environment that is dedicated to proving premier customer service and being apart of a company that has integrity and job security.
good,"My typical day at work was very fast-paced, including all of the responsibilities listed above in my employment history. I learned about providing cutomer service above and beyond what my customers thought possible. My managers were excellent, never asking associates to do what they wouldn't do themselves. The managers and co-workers were generally very supportive of associates, and helpful if unforeseen problems arose. "
good,"The main support role of the CSTL is to be responsible for the operation of front end.  This allows mgmt and office staff to then function according to their roles.  CSTLs are responsible for pitching in in any area when necessary.  Many are cross-trained in other departments.  Within customer service departments a CSTL can be seen cashiering, bagging groceries, acting as an office staff, learning managerial duties, handing customer and staff complaints and concerns, new hire paperwork & store orientation.  The CSTL does it all."
good,Coming in at this job and getting right to work is what I like. I learn a lot of communication skills. My managers were great. I got along with all my co-workers. the hardest part of this job was leaving. I enjoyed every moment I was there.
good,"On a typical day, customer service team leaders are responsible for making sure things are running smoothly for their department. CSTL's manage the flow of customers through check out and make sure that all cashiers and front service clerks are doing what needs to be done to take care of customers (i.e. unloading shopping carts, engaging in conversation with the customer, catering to any child needs, taking the groceries to the car, etc.) "
good,Management could be better.  Enjoyed helping customers and loved my coworkers.  Hardest part of the job was the understaffing.
good,"Helped associates with on the job training, open door policy. Learned how to deal with customers who weren't happy with something that happened in the store."
good,I would switch from cashier to front service clerk daily. I gained experience in about every aspect. Improved communicating skills. My co-workers also helped me become a leader. The hardest part of the job was cleaning the restroom. The most enjoyable part of the job was to be cashier.
good,"My typical day consists of working with customers, making sure there satisfied with the product they buy.  Customer might ask for something we have never cut, which makes the job more interesting.  We are all part owners of the company so managers don't put themselves in a special category as a manager. All co-workers are equal in the company, we just have different.  There really isn’t a hard part of the job.  I would have to say the most enjoyable part is not having to worry about job security."
good,"They were very flexible and always helped out a worker when s/he voiced an issue. I took care of the Dairy department and they generally let me be instead of nitpicking over any possible thing because they knew they could trust me to get the products out, rotate them, and keep the milk and eggs sufficiently filled. I learned a lot abut hard work and efficiently utilizing my time. This job allowed me to come out of my shell more and I would greet customers as they perused my department and engage them in conversation. The hardest part was trying to get the entire backroom worked while doing all the other things I needed to do, but I managed."
good,I arrive to work with a smile on my face and it stays there because my coworkers and fun and nice to be around and are also smiling the majority of the time. Ive learned a lot about people and how to communicate better with others and i love to see customers smile. My managers are always accommodating and understanding and very awesome to be around. They know how to  joke around but also maintain a professional level.
good,"Worked at Publix for 13 years. Held positions as selector, sanitation worker, warehouse man, order checker, and motor driver. Recent policies have changed the atmosphere of the company but it is still good work. Good benefits."
good,Fue una buena experiencia porque conocí gente de distintos países y pude aprender de sus culturas. Asimismo me adapté rápidamente al sistema contable americano y al dominio de su moneda y sus sistemas virtuales de caja registradora. En mi segunda experiencia pude perfeccionar mi inglés al mismo tiempo que aprendía más vocabulario aplicable a los negocios y al almacén.
good,Great place to work. Employees work as a team and there are numerous benefits for full time and even part time employees. Management has flexible time schedules factoring in individual concerns. Promotes from within so it is great company for advancement. I personally started as a custodian and then joined the customer service department as a cashier then to a customer service staff. The company also offers tuition reimbursement for approved field of study. I currently participate in this program which helps in funding my education.
good,"Publix is a great company to work for. The work environment is free flowing. You get to know and love your customers and at the end of the day, they feel like a part of your family. I have learned that my job is what I make of it. I am in control of your own happiness. My coworkers are all very helpful individuals willing to go above and beyond to not only serve their customers but to also be there for their coworkers as well. The hardest part of my job is seeing a customer unsatisfied but at Publix that rarely ever happens. The most enjoyable part of my job is making sure every customer leaves 100% satisfied and that their full shopping experience was a pleasure."
good,I worked for this company for 16 years. I previously left to return back to school to further my education. Excellent pay and the job was wonderful but sometimes stressful.(Bakery Manager) The company is very inconsistent with its policies.
good,very good company to work for. but if you have a family the hours can be hard and the holidays are the most busy time of the year. out side of the great company
good,"A good job to improve your customer service skills."
good,"Great place to work. Had managers that were both supportive and pushed me to do better. I liked that the company wasn't about being big and having everything you need, but more focused on good customer service and support. Very clean store"
good,"working in the deli was great I loved the management and my coworkers,  if I had any complaints it would be that once you are in a department it was very hard to get out and switch to another one"
good,When I worked for Publix it was great. Full time only had to pull one night a week and back when they first started opening on Sunday's no full time was on staff. Before that we used to gather and go to Disney or a theme park on Sunday. We were like a family. Hardest part of the job was getting on as a full time stock clerk. Most enjoyable was when I got the job and proved that women can do a good job and keep a clean section. I would have stayed on until I got very old but at that time and considering the fact I was at that time the only full time stock clerk being female I learned that was the end of the line. My manager told me I could not go any higher. I know the company has changed and they now have female managers. Probably should have hung in there but retired instead. Regrets? Yes but then I went to work for Walgreen's and loved that job. So maybe it was just to be. I enjoyed my job and learned a lot which in turn helped me in following jobs. I will always be grateful for Publix for the years I learned and worked there.
good,"Typical day at work, I meet new people everyday which is exciting, I have a few great friends that are co workers which makes the job fun!"
good,"Publix is a great place to work.If you like working with people & helping them, Publix is it.Working here I learned how to empathize with customers, develop relationships with them, and solve problems  they may have within the store."
good,I enjoyed the environment and/or responsibiities I had. It made me feel very productive as well as resourceful. I learned how to file paperwork as well as work with autistic children. Ther principle was very nice and the teachers I vounteered for were pleasent. The hardest part of the job was keeping all 7 casses I organized clean on a daily basis but the most enjoyable part of the job was working with all ages of children.
good,"Although I was a supervisor for the store's front end, I would do many jobs during the day to support the staff and make the customers happy. I would manage the schedule and take special orders, support the cashiers if they needed and extra hand to get through a rush. I did the ordering of supplies and assisted the office staff with the cash office balancing of the safe. It was fun because no two days were the same. Customer relationships were also important to maintain. They needed to know you were there to make they shopping trip easy and painless as possible."
good,"Publix is awesome. Employee ownership provides a sense of pride in the stores. Unfortunately, publix is on the lower end of the pay scale."
good,"Typical day generally involves whatever job responsibilities you've been assigned in your department with guidance when necessary from managers, whom consistently work alongside employees."
good,"In Publix it was fun to work because every day i came in something different would happen. I would deal with all types of different customers every day and would have to react accordingly. I learned how to provide great customer service and how to work in harmony with a large amount of coworkers, managers and customers. I got along with all my coworkers and managers and never had a problem. The hardest part of the job was probably when it would get packed and i would have to keep my composure helping various people at the same time."
good,"Working on the stock crew at Publix, we started at 3 a.m every morning ,stocked your area,reordered inventory and then made everything nice and neat,all the managers were very nice ,I enjoyed helping all of my customers."
good,A typical day of work would be stocking shelves and being able to communicate with the managers and not feel over powered.
good,"My typical day is greeting customers, bagging their order and ringing up their purchase. I have great co workers an nice manager and the best customers. The hardest part is going out in either the hot whether or the cold whether."
good,"I would come in and follow duties as a front service clerk. I learned customer service skills and how to handle money. The management was good, but very very observant; always watching the front end to make sure you're doing everything you need to be doing. My co-workers never gave me any issues, all very friendly. The hardest part of the job was to keep a very happy and upbeat vibe all of the time. The most enjoyable part for me was simply doing my tasks. I liked to be busy when it was busy."
good,"This job taught me how to be friendly with people I do not know.  Allowed me to work with a diverse staff, and allowed my first experience in cash handling"
good,"I had a good learning experience working with talented and dedicated staffs .I would like to work in a company like this, as this company has given me good exposure about the retail world  and working in PubliX has contributed a lot to my professional growth."
good,"I worked there at a young age. I learned customer service, closing out registers, blocking and employee relationships. Management was very helpful in training for future positions."
good,Working for Publix is nice due to flexible schedule and being able to constantly learn every day. The management does seem to drift apart and not work as a team which reflects the the work ethic of the employees.
good,Love working for Publix Distibution Center. Only issue i have is the pay for the warehouse workers $11.25 is not enough for the loaders. But overall a fantastic company to work with.
good,I am able to interact with customers and get to know the regulars. I typically greet the customers and make sure there isn't a need or anything that I can help with. Management is very helpful and very concerning with the workload given. The best part about my job is being able to meet and talk to different people.
good,a very fast paced job that made the day go by really fast.all of publix plants are a very good place to work and grow with.provide uniforms and very good work shoes to choose from.
good,"I always stayed busy at this job. I progressed so fast with the staff that I had, they also taught me so much. Management made sure they took great care of their employees."
good,I have not started this job yet so i wouldn't know a typical day at work. This will be my first job. I learned a lot in math and i can count money. I think the hardest part would have to be having to walk around the store and stacking the food in the right place. I think the most enjoyable part of the job would have to be the cashier part because i love math it's my one and only joy in this world.
good,"Long Work Hours"
good,handled numerous customers with all personalities. you have to be there for a few years to get promoted and work hard to get fulltime.
good,Would arrive at 4 am. Throw the truck. Block frozen. Do random counts. Did out of stocks. Scanned out of dates. Reviewed orders. Supervised people less knowledgeable.
good,Very Secure place to work. The managers are very flexible and patient but will push you if you show potential. They only promote from within so you have a great opportunity for advancement if you are willing to work for it. Great pay for managers.
good,Started as a cashier and worked up as high as I wanted.  You set your own limits.  Management pushes you to grow.  Learned how to lead a team and empower associates and step into leadership.  Fun and always something different happening each day.
good,Publix Supermarkets is a great company with a rich culture that rewards its employees with good pay and great benefits. The privately owned company rewards its employees with valuable stock options.
good,Publix has a friendly atmosphere with good management and plenty of opportunities to move up the chain. The customers are generally friendly and polite.
good,Well focused on employee needs and great benefits. All the managers and district managers are caring and adhere great deal to the open door policy.
good,"Publix is a great place to work. My day entails, opening/closing of our store. It is very busy during season. If i open, I get all tills ready for opening. I set up Lotto, making sure all tickets are in machine, and under our counter ready for sale. Check the schedule for our Customer Service associates and assign their tills/daily tasks. If I close, I pull tills at the end of the day and count tills. Count the safe, and put deposits in safe. I have learned how to assign closing tasks for cleaning. The hardest part of the job was learning how to close in such major detailing. But once I got it, it was fun."
good,"I really enjoy interacting with the customers. A great place to work, and able to do different trades"
good,"Publix is a fun place to work.  It is high pressure; however, I enjoy that type of environment."
good,"This is a great company to seek employment with. They believe in their product and employees. They have a high rate of advancement from within (if you desire to work your way to management), and they have a great record of community involvement."
good,"Provided excellent customer service to Publix customers. Always maintained positive personal relationships with coworkers and management that resulted in a better experience for the customer as well as the associate team. Prevented Shrink by understanding and adhering to store polices. Interviewed and trained multiple employees. Worked under strict deadlines and responded to service requests and emergency call-outs. compiled weekly monetary reports and records for the department manager. Strived for a high standard of quality communication, customer service, and product representation for each customer."
good,"When working at Publix I can say I learned some of the best customer service there is. I was taught to value every customer, and to treat them as if they were the only customer. A typical day at work consisted of a mixture of bagging and cashiering, as well as putting items back when needed. Since customer service is a big deal, at any moment I would have tons top what I was doing if a customer needed assistance. Sometime this made the job a little difficult because it could take a long time to finish a certain task, but it eventually made me faster at most task. The best part about working at Public was the environment. Everyone was always so caring and it made work a lot more fun and the customer service genuine."
good,Love my job amazing place to work just whoo. I got money then I saved it then I got even more money and then I spent that check.
good,"Everyday you enter publix you must enter with a hapy attitide. Typically you greet and ask the manager what is your duty for the day and time of your break. If you are a cashier you then open your lane and assist customers with check outs and price checks. You also help them find things when you currently have no customers in your line. If you are chosen to be a front service clerk that particular day you asssit the customers in bagging their groceries, taking them to the car, and unloading the groceries.Everyone that works at Publix is majority great to work with and have positve pesonalities as well as the management. I've learned that when you do not agree with something in the workplace it is okay to meet with the individual and solve the problem. This keeps the work environment positive. The hardest part about the job is standing in one place for 8 hours when you are cashiering. The most enjoyable part about working at publix is being able to work with different people, meeting customers, and forming bonds with repeat customers that look forward to seeing you at work."
good,Publix is a great company to work for because of the good people.
good,"Working at Publix Supermarkets since I was 17, I learned and I am still learning the qualities of providing great customer service. The Management Level does satisfy customers' needs, reason why Publix offers high qualitiy of providing customer service. Managers are specifically well-trained to deliver their best service skills in order to promote the Company. It may sounds ironic but as for me, the hardest part of the job is also the most enjoyable part of it: Delivering Customer Service. On what I would call a bad day of work, just because one customer would treat me wrong and make me feel horribly disappointed for the day, there also are great customers who all they desire is to experience an excellent customer service moment. I enjoy helping people from different culture and making them feel as if they were home. One typical day that I had at work last year which I will probably never forget in my life is when a customer had come to send a money transfer and for some reason she had found me too young looking and feared that I would mess up the transaction. She quickly ask for someone to complete the transaction for her. the other associate denied to complete it for her saying that I was well capable of doing it myself. Indeed I completed the transaction for her and there was no other issue except one: I felt humiliated but how I handled the situation through excellent customer service is the reason why every time the same customer comes to the store, she is the one ashamed and she always treat me right as a way to apologize. I learned then to always provide great customer"
good,I have worked in six of the Publix in Huntsville and have learned from each Manager. Each store is different in customers but customer service is the same in all stores. That is the Publix way.
good,"A typical work day on the job consist of manning an assembly line powered by a computer database which I had to have knowledge of and operate.  The hardest part of the job was trouble shooting any problems that occurred during production, the most enjoyable part of the job was getting paid every week.  Management at the company wasn't the best, they micromanaged a little to much I feel,"
good,"Daily I would come in early in the morning to prepare the technicians daily work load. I held a morning team meeting to get all involved on the same goals.  As the boats were repaired I assembled another team to wash and wax boats and deliver them on a timely bases.  Our team made the jobs look easy by having a well working ,well managed group of highly motivated people.  It was a great experience. The hours were great and I enjoyed getting hands on experience working along side motor companies and boat dealers. Annually we would go to boat shows and meet thousands of new customers from all over the world interested in our products and services.  What an exciting time."

good,"Publix was one of the best companies I've worked for. One of the best managers they had. Co-workers and I, was like family. That's what they taught us because its a family owned company.

Set-up new products and reviewed requisitions. Also work in produce dept. as floor lead. Performed daily inventory and dept. ordering, and set-up displays, filled floor holes, kept dept. clean and assigned workers to specific areas on sales floor and rotated their jobs daily to keep them more efficient. Also continued sales floor training of associates to attain the best work quality and quantity possible. No matter how much experience you had, there was always room for improvement and constant training, mainly due to the fact that the company was always looking for better ways to improve sales and customer service. Dept. managers always had weekly meeting within the dept. which helped in keeping everyone informed of new company policies and other changes. Communication and recognition of good performance was key in keeping all workers at the highest production level as possible. All of these things combined did make it difficult to stay at the top of your game but, was absolutely essential in keeping with the high standards that the company expected of all of it's employees. The job was rewarding in the sense that not only did employees get individual recognition for their performance but, were rewarded with quarterly bonuses, 9% dividend checks every summer based on the company stock that was given to every employee based on their gross pay. Being an employee owned company was key to their success. The more successful"

good,"At Publix you are on a first name basis with everyone, even management. If you are ever sick, your co-workers will call just to see how you are and not just to find out when you can work again. In the pharmacy, business is just like any other - you process prescription, deal with insurance, and follow up with doctors; however, here the customers are what brighten your day. There are even grocery shoppers who do not get their medications filled with us that take time to stop by and see how your day is and know you by name. There are always opportunities for training, almost to a point where there might be too much training at times."

I've learned a great deal about the food industry and management from working here, and now have a better understanding of how a business should be run. My coworkers are the best team I've ever worked with, and though we may have our disagreements, we always accomplish the missions we are handed daily and maintain a good compliance with the standards and regulations. There really isn't a hard part of my job when it comes to working here, and the most enjoyable part of my job would have to be the interactions I experience with my fellow associates and the customers, and making repeat business happen by bonding with customers."

Examples are Lottery and Western Union. The hardest part of my job was not always being able to help every customers needs.

Management makes sure everyday we consider our safety and accuracy threw every order. Also respecting one another and working as a team. Most co workers that cant perform at a rate myself can ask for help so i just slow down and help them understand the methods of selecting stacking and wrapping.

My co-workers like that I love to have fun but still doing my job. After lunch because the time starts to get slower due to there not being any customers.

good,"Working during the day in the deli was always surprising but working the evening shift was horrible. The kids always disappeared, you would find them hiding in the back of the store or in an office some where, which left me doing all the work which was not pleasant. They said when I was hired I’d be able to move to the bakery but that too was deceiving. I wish things were different I would have retired there through out the many years of service I could have provided."

good,I was a bakery manager and I loved my job. Would still be there if I didn't relocate where there is no Publix. Would recommend working there to anyone who asks me!
good,"Unlike other retail jobs, Publix is a growing company with a really reputable presence in the south. This is a really good company to work for because you can expand off of it and can even grow into it. This is not a job, it can be a career as well. It's a very professional environment even if it is just a supermarket chain because of how above and beyond they go. If you have the patience for retail, if you have the energy to serve ever customer with care, and if you want to go somewhere that can give you a promising future, I recommend working here. If you don't like dealing with customers, you can always try the warehouse. It's a much more physically demanding job than being an in-store employee, especially if you're full time, but the weekly pay and rates they earn is very much worth it."
good,"I've enjoyed working at Publix, its a fast paced place to work, but rewarding. Day to day requirements differ from each department, and I worked in the bakery and the deli."
good,"If you want to move up in the company they have paths to do that. You have opportunities to move departments if you wish. If you do your job, you get raises. They work with local charities. And seem to care more about their employees than a lot of other companies. I was happy while I worked for Publix."
good,"Was a great place to work,Occasionally you would get a few rude customers but all in all very fun place to work awesome co workers great management and if you were willing to work advancement was easy. Publix really did care about their employees."
good,Managers and coworkers were all willing to work together. Fast paced with lots of stuff to keep yourself busy. Enjoyed working there because everyone felt like a family including the customers.
good,"Working in the deli was a lot to learn at first, especially since I had no prior food experience. My experience was overall positive though, I loved my coworkers, my managers worked with me and my schedule, and there was enough work and variety that most days weren't too monotonous or painfully slow."
good,Started working here in high school and continued till after college. They offer great benefits for full time associates but it may take a while to get full time. They are very flexible with your schedule and offer a lot of pathways for growth.
good,"Where shopping is a pleasure right?! But sometimes it gets frustrating and a lot to handle but, put a smile on your face and call it a day! Prodividing premiere customer service is key"
good,Physically demanding and fast-paced work environment. Good work culture. Benefits are available to part-time and full-time employees. Coworkers become like family.
good,"I worked for Publix for 4 months. During that time, the most enjoyable part of my daily activity was the customer interaction and cashiering. Time flew by because of the quick pace of the work environment with the flow of customers. I loved it! If not for a family emergency, I would have continued with Publix."
good,"Publix was my first job, and I could not have asked for a better starting point. Working at Publix gave me the skills I need not only to effectively perform customer service tasks with the company, but to improve my life and be a better employee. This is not a company or store to work for if you simply want to earn a paycheck; you must genuinely care for your customers and your work."
good,I loved working for publix I had a great time and great team. I love the work culture and benefits overall great experience. The only thing is dealing with management that doesn’t align with the culture can be frustrating for a great company like Publix.
good,Publix is a good company management should have more training on how to deal with associates when being difficult  training on being consistent and fair with all associates needing more structure and a better training system
good,I absolutely loved working for Publix and would suggest anybody to work there the only reason I don't work there right now is because I'm on long term disability and if I went back to Publix I would have to start all the way from the beginning again and I don't want to have to do that when I left I had a month's worth of vacation and was a manager of the bakery department
good,I worked for this company in high school-early college. Very friendly environment. The management works well with and around unique schedule preferences/availability.
good,Publix is a great company to work for! They are very family orientend. Very easy to help with schedules if you’re in school.  Publix is a fast paced company and will help you move up!
good,It was a very good interview And a great place to work for and a great bunch of people to work with.The. Managers were great to work for.The company is a great company cause they treat you like family
good,While upward mobility can be slow and you have to really work to get full time and or a management position it is worth it. Benefits including stock options are probably the best in the market. They take care of you and work with you for scheduling purposes. The culture was one the best I've been with.
good,"I'll keep this short."
good,Publix is a very customer oriented organization. Publix associates are treated with respect by management. I highly recommend Publix as a long-term employer.

good,"If you're willing to put forth the effort, this is a fantastic way to have a career in retail. I regret that circumstances forced me to leave and to this day consider returning to Publix even in a lesser capacity"
good,"One of the best places I've ever worked, and you can't beat the stock options. Although Management can be a bit of a toss up. Some of them are great, and others are simply intolerable. However, they don't make the work impossible."
good,We always had a good time providing customer service at Publix. Meeting all of the customers and having conversations was a fun way to keep the day  going and do your job well.
good,"Anyone considering in working at Publix you will not be disappointed. I worked in the Deli Department one of the most busiest in the store. You must be attentive, professional, neat and tidy, a Fast learner, Quick with orders but clean as you go, Engage the customers, lastly suggest other departments or any items of interest that week. As far as Management get to know the managers of each department because they take turns closing at nights and all have different ways of leading."
good,"Fun, Upbeat, you meet a lot of people Great Benefits, Stock, 401K, Paid Time Off, Health Vision dental and life insurance  and also holiday pay I love Publix"
good,"I worked under Publix for a few months but I was only 16 at the time so many positions wouldn't be accessible to me at the start which lead to older people than me getting more hours, leading me to leave so early within the job, however it is an amazing company to work for. Giving many oppurtunities and a new lifestyle for many"
good,I love working at Publix I just need the extra cash because I don’t get paid as much as I would like at Publix because of the raises they give us aren’t to what I thought they would be able to give out considering I know 4 departments.
good,The job was very hands on and fun. I loved helping the people in the store that needed assistance while they were visiting or buying our merchandise. I learned how to be positive and courteous in the work environment.
good,One of my favorite jobs because it paid well and i had great coworkers. Publix always seemed like it was trying to make employees better and almost always promoted from within. Lots of room for growth. I only left because our store was hurting and as the part-timer my hours had to be cut. Overall would recommend working for Publix.
good,Publix is a great place to work. I have worked there for over ten years and never cease to treat me well. The harder you work the easier you can move up in your career.

good,"10-12 hour shifts, learned how to perform different jobs and be able to move up in the company faster than most companies. You learn how to work as a team to get the job done. Great people to work with that are very respectful and always look out for one another."
good,a good place to work .publix cares about seeing the associate move up the ladder. Everything you put in to your job you will see come back . Publix has great opportunities.
good,Publix was a fun and upbeat place to work. I was challenged daily by colleagues and managers. This company also works really well to develop employees interested in the management track.
good,Publix is a great place to work everyone is very friendly and will always help you out. Sometimes though it’s hard to get hours which is my only concern. Management is also great.
good,I was put in stressful situations during most shifts. I had a very supportive crew to help me when it was impossible to do certain tasks in the time-frame given. I wish I could have had more hours because I would rarely be scheduled for 20 hours/week.
good,"Work pace dependent upon how busy the store was on a given day"
good,I enjoyed working at Publix and i wouldn't trade the experience for anything. I met a tremendous number of amazing people i still know today. I learned skills by working with alot of different people with different backgrounds in a busy environment that required both good teamwork and communication skills.
good,It’s a very safe place to work it’s always something to do on your down time it’s just once u get a level for anything it’s like the don’t stop rolling in and it takes six months to get off of your record but by then u would have gotten another one

Publix also offers great benefits for their employees including 401k, health plans, and the opportunity to purchase stock."
good,I had a great time at Publix until they cut my hours for new employees. It’s a great company and a great job but they forced me to leave with the horrible management. That only applies at some stores.
good,Awesome customer service good management seasy anyone can do it. Yeah dude affordable stuff every thing there no problem you know best grocery store in the us
good,"Being a young gentleman and wanting to get to work and learn the way, Publix was the absolute best job that I could have had to teach me certain skills that I still use today. I enjoyed the professionalism along with the schedule that was flexible, due to my High School extra curricular activities. I wouldn't say that there was anything that was necessarily ""hard"". I think those situations are something that come with every job and with your willingness to overcome difficult situations, you become better at that position and for your company."
good,Working there taught me hands-on customer service. Showing me that everyone is different in there own way. For me it was something I would just gasp hold to and move forward.
good,"Working at Publix has been a pleasure while completing a college degree. They are willing to work around your school schedule as well as help pay for some of the business courses. The workplace is friendly, inviting, and fast moving. Publix is a great opportunity for associates completing school and who are looking to move up to management. WOrking at Publix the past 8 years has been enjoyable, although I am excited to start a new career since finishing my Bachelors Degree."
good,at Publix they have raises every 6 months as long as you do good on your evaluations. I love working for Publix. the only thing would be if you apply for part time you aren't guaranteed many hours because of how many employees they have
good,"Generally I manage the store floor by maintaining items on shelves and displays while delivering customer service. The culture is casual, the work is reasonable relative to your position, and the only potentially difficult part is the potential for longer than normal work days due to holiday rushes. The management is professional and respectful towards the employees."

good,I loved this job for the longest time but personally it wasn’t challenging nor did it help me gain experience that would help me in the future when looking for jobs pertaining to what I am studying in college. But it’s a great starting job and is amazingly flexible for part-timers. Would 100% recommend and have recommended to many friends.

good,Publix is an amazing place to work. lot's of benefits and great coworkers and customers. It goes by the rules and that's good to follow. The managers are good too.
good,"I loved my time at this job. Managers were great overall. Weekly pay was nice. Competitive for a cashier, bakery clerk and deli clerk. I was part time so hours were everywhere. Some week 40 others could be 20. I needed set hours and it wasn't an option. That is the only reason I quit. Your fellow colleagues  become your family and I loved that."

good,Publix Deli isn't for everyone. Theres a reason why 70% of people quit there first week. Its incredible fast paced. Requires hard work to keep customers happy. The ordering system in the deli is inefficient so it requires more speed to make up for that.
good,"Performed store opening duties, including counting cash drawers and checking all"
good,"You always know when you are supposed to be there, when you are supposed to leave, you even get a scheduled break time (if you work a certain amount of hours for the day). Management is amazing. All management is promoted from within the company only, making your supervisors able to manage their employees better. Most of the other employees are all genuinely kind, and fun people. The hardest part is, of course, dealing with difficult customers. The most fun part is honestly just having fun, and making co-workers and customers laugh and have a great day."

good,there are so many opportunity to make money with them a great company by far they have amazing benefits to a great work zone your not just an employee there your an asset to the company
good,It's a very good place to work but they lack on hours and it's very hard to become full-time position with their flexible schedule it's hard to make a decent pay
good,"Seriously a great place to work with great benefits, but they expect a LOT out of their employees. If you give it your all you'll get a lot back from them. They have excellent benefits and a corporate structure that works for them and their employees."

good,"The best place to work, weekly paycheck,  great hourly salary, flexible , cell phone discount, mangers every thing about publix was wonderful no complaints"
good,"I was in the bakery so my typical day varied from opening every shift when my manager was on vacation to closing every shift when they were back. I worked opening, closing, and swing but my favorite shift was closing as it was the most relaxed, I saw the least customers and could mostly go at my own pace which was great for me as I've had a hip replacement. My coworkers were mostly easy to get along with and I can count the exceptions on one hand as the culture at Publix is for everyone to be a cohesive team. I was actually really upset to have to leave as I'd made a number of friends."
good,Helpful in making you a better person. Publix will help pay for tuition at college if you commit to working there long term and they are flexible with any schedule. Different managers so hard to keep everyone happy.
good,Managment is good at working with employees and customers. Lots of hours and excellent pay in any department. Co-workers are amazing also. Deli is a hard place to work and is hard to get into.
good,It's a job for you if you don't have kids. The management bring their problems from home to work. That's not fare. They make you work overtime BUT WON'T PAY YOU OVERTIME.
good,Publix was a great first job experience! There is so much room to grow within Publix! They pay great for a retail company!  The specific Publix I worked in stayed busy all year round so shifts went by pretty quickly! The people I worked with were all amazing and always willing to help! We all had a great time together!
good,I have worked there for 3 years and asking for full time for 2. I have been promised full time in the past and worked for it and nothing. It's a great place to work otherwise.

good,"Every day at publix is an engaging and pleasant event. It's always a pleasure to work here because all associates respect each other and you always feel encouraged to succeed. The store manager has often spoken to me personally when I had a problem or concern and even if she just wanted to congratulate me on my good work."
good,"Many opportunities for advancement, as long as you truly put in effort. Nothing can stop you if you want to progress."
good,I love Publix as a company . I left because they were in such need of help they promoted people Unqualified.  I loved having my customers ask fore by name. I loved the fast past work till your shift ends  environment .

good,Very good company to work for they help u to advance an have a great opportunity to grow and be more productive in publix i very well welcome everyone to go apply.
good,I loved working at Publix until I changed stores. The manager I had not only the employees didn't like so didn't the customers. Publix is a great place to work as long as you have a great team and the customers are great depending on the area most of the time.
good,I enjoy working with all of my coworkers. Publix provides a great work environment. They have great training for new workers who are new to the business.
good,"It was a nice job to have, they gave you long breaks with a long shift which allowed you to get off your feet after being on them for long periods of time. The hardest part of the job was probably just trying to stay busy during slow hours. The management was great, the customer service manager was always attending to any cashiers who needed help and didn't mind grabbing something for a customer or taking care of any customer complaints. He welcomed the cashiers into their shift and made the shift go as smooth as possible."
good,It is an amazing place to work. Pleanty of room for advancement in the company. It is employee owned. It can be difficult work but the co-workers are great.
good,Very family friendly supermarket. Very fun and face and slowed pace environment to work in depending on which department you're located in. I would highly recommend anyone in Florida to work there for any full or part time position.
good,"Publix is not a bad place to work at. I worked at 3 stores in the 20yrs. of working with them. My first ( Publix) store that I worked at was in Boca, and I didn't wanted to leave there because after getting attached to my manager and  co- workers. But after been there so many yrs., they transferred me to Boynton store and  I  had to meet new people all over again which I didn't mind. I enjoyed it. I learned different tasks and especially in produce working with flowers, which I didn't  know about  and other task as well."
good,"With a friendly environment and Job security, Publix is the best place for someone my age to work. It is an incredible company with multiple avenues for growth."
good,Publix is a great company. I am looking for a Career change that is better for myself and family. The benefits are amazing. Publix promotes within and their are plenty of opportunities to advance with the company.
good,Publix Is an amazing company to work for with amazing benefits but my experience with publix was not the best but that is just my experience that doesnt mean it will be the same for anyone else. Me and management did not get along so well and my hours were only 4 hours a week (yes literally 4 hours a week). If i went to a different publix it may have been better but overall i strongly recommend this job to anyone.
good,Lots of opportunities for position advancement. Every Publix associate I encountered was friendly and professional. I was guided throughout my training period very carefully to make sure I knew how to do my tasks properly.
good,Working at Publix was pretty cool. Everybody there is friendly and it feels like a family atmosphere. The managers do a very good job of teaching and are fair.
good,"The job was secure and easy. For part-time employment the job is good for a high school student. For a career, I suggest you work full-time so you are eligible for all of the benefits."
good,It would be a great company to work for with opportunity for growth.  They have great benefits; they offer free food to the employees; there is team work among the employees.
good,As first jobs go this one wasn't too bad. Steady hours and fair pay worked out pretty well. Culture of helpfulness and making sure to try improving each customers day really are drilled into new employees
good,"I love working at Publix it was a great job for my first time. If i had a chance to continue working for tjem I would. Everyone that worked there was pretty fair and nice , we worked as a team all together to better customer visits."
good,Publix used to be family oriented and rewarded people for hard work however that culture has since changed. They now want managers to be paper pushers and hard work isn't rewarded like it was before. Some of the managers shouldn't even be in management positions.
good,"The 8 years that I worked for Publix were great. My co workers were awesome. The customers were very sweet, it's was just and awesome experience. I would still be there today if I didn't have to relocate."
good,A typical day at work involves getting carts and bagging groceries. During my time at Publix I've learned to work quickly while still getting the job done. The work culture is very friendly and relaxed. The hardest part of the job were the times i got chores at the end of my shift. Last but not least the most enjoyable part of the job was when we received half a sandwich when. We got a customer compliment.
good,"I really enjoyed working at publix.....It was really fun, but some customers can be rude at times but overall it was great.....Manager was very friendly nice and great!"
good,"If you work hard at your job, the benefits will come with it. If you exceed the goal set for you, they adjust the pay accordingly. Also, they provide free lunches."
good,"When I was at Publix I loved it. If I could get paid what I need I would go back. Maybe when I can retire and work a couple of days during the week. I was a cashier. front service coordinator and back office cashier. checked customers out with their groceries and bag them if needed, take them out. gather carts. back office made sure all tills were ready for cashiers balanced tills and ran end of day reports. made sure front line ran smoothly."
good,"Very fast paced.  Coworkers become your family.  Very much a teamwork job.  Recognized for going above and beyond expected job duties, and encouraged to think out of the box."
good,one of the best places to work you can work your way up. helpful if you know the management there and people like you there work hard and you will stay
good,Publix was a great job to have during s=high school and college. they offer great benefits and the hours are all up to you. loved working here just the pay wasn't that great .
good,"Great atmosphere, great people. Workers just want to help other workers. Managers were great motivators, understanding, and caring. One complaint would be the fixed hours: 5pm-1am or 11am-6pm."
good,"Publix prides itself on Customer Service and ensures that every employee has the proper tools to effectively help the customers. Publix proves that it is an Equal Opportunity Employer, provides great benefits for full time employees, offers an open door atmosphere (very easy to talk to both the department manager and store manager for any reason). Publix is a growing company which provides job security, plenty of options for advancement. While employed I went through 4 Deli Department Managers and 3 Assistant Managers. With that being said, my most recent Manger was excellent, she was VERY knowledgeable about Publix products and procedures and was very helpful."
good,I really liked this job. The customers and workers made my days go by fast.The only downfall of this job is you don't get a lot of hours a week. The pay is decent and its easy to find a area in the job that you would be comfortable doing.
good,Associate friendly environment; for the most part the workload is managable when compared to other Pharmacies.  Great benefits + company gives you employee owned stock.
good,Publix was a great place to work at. There are great opportunities for advancement and for benefits. Work reviews every six months which if you do well will usually come with a raise
good,"Typically I arrive to work 30m minutes early ant await the 5 minute mark to hit to clock in. First make sure the times are correct, as well as make sure that the Clerk has prepared for my shift correctly. I typically have someone with me so that I can teach them the ins and outs of hot food preparation. Everyone gets along with everyone and we laugh, joke and have a blast with our customers. The most stressful part of my job is cleanup, everyone wants to be going home at 10:00 -10:30 p.m. but realistically 10:45 -11:00 is a time to be comfortable with. But the best times are during the holidays, everyone is happy go lucky and eager to make everyone happy."
good,"Overall, I enjoyed my time at Publix. They make it easy for students to work there while in college and they know we don't want to work a ton every week."
good,"A lot of fast-paced work depending on location. There is always something to do, so time flies by when on the clock.Team members are supportive, and the customers are happy to see you if you have great customer service. The latter makes working at Publix enjoyable."
good,"Bom, meu dia dia na empresa era boa satisfatória um dia normal de trabalho  cansativo mais com o dever comprido, aprendi muitas coisas boas entrei como operadora tive oportunidade de virar fiscal trabalhei 9 anos no geral e não tenho o que reclamar o dono muito humilde com um coração muito bom, sempre presente para conversar e ajudar a todos, infelizmente fui demitida pois o nome da empresa  mudou para grand marché  pessoas mais atingas foram mandadas embora  e eu fui uma delas."
good,"Great company to work for. They truly care about their employees and their families. Long hours, but the rewards were great. Always about cleanliness and outstanding customer service"
good,"Great job to have while in school, plenty of room for advancement in the company - in store or in corporate areas; highly recommended to start when you are young"
good,"Publix Was my first job when I became 18. I worked there for five years and it is all the experience that I needed to get a customer service job at sea world, the Hampton Inn hotel, and where I currently am at Aldie. It taught me everything that I needed to know. Publix is great if you’re looking for hours as a part-time when you’re at school as a student, or you just need some extra cash. They are very flexible with your schedule if you let management know. However it’s hard to get a full-time job as a grocery or cashier"
good,"The job overall is a good job. All you have to do is stay to yourself, do your job, and interact with customers. Working at Publix is still a pleasure for me and I have been there two years."
good,the work days were sometimes long and tiring and some were short and sweet. the people there didn't mind showing you how to do something the right way and the work was actually fun
good,"My job at Publix was great, I just had an opportunity to make more money and it was my biggest regret now.  I wish I never left Publix.  The people I worked with were amazing"
good,"In Publix, there was always work that needed to be done even when the store was slow and not many customers were around, this usually made the time go by quickly and kept every employee on track to get some work done until the end of their shift."
good,"The management at Publix was well trained. They knew how to give everyone the right amount of hours, and every six months we had an interview to try to work our way up the ladder. I didn't learn much since I already had my customer service skill from Chick-Fil-A. The hardest part of my job was dealing with customers who had tons of coupons, but only because we had to be extra careful to be sure they met the criteria for the coupon."
good,"publix is a very diverse and equal opportunity company that prides its self on quality customer service, employees are very friendly , management is concerned about your advancement in company , teamwork is stressed wholeheartedly , the work is really not very hard at all , they give you a task to complete and leave you alone"
good,"Being a Publix Deli associate is -not- an easy task. You're always on the move, always helping customers, making subs, slicing meats and cheeses, preparing hand-made deli shelf items (grab and go's, platters, etc.) and when there's no one at the counters, the deli itself is always to be kept clean, stocked and ready. "
good,"Publix is very well structured when management is hands on and the staff is able to get along together. Not every employee takes the job seriously which is expected, but those that though can make a serious difference for any store. The hardest part of the job is working around holidays, the store is never slow. The job is very rewarding for those that work hard, and if you just need an easy steady job then this also can work for you."
good,"Loved working at Publix, great employer, great wages, Competitive wages great customers, worked  hours around school schedule. wished I would have never retired when I did."
good,Great company to work with but I only work ther for a month really good for the costumers very clean and very good food . Their own brand is great quality.
good,I had a great time working as an Apron's Food demonstrator. It is exciting to see customers enjoying a meal you created from the amazing food recipes Aprons provides.
good,the pay wont be great but its great for college kids. They work around school schedules and if you decide to stay they have good benefits if you decide to get into management. Its pretty hard to move up its extremely competitive. The base pay is what you'd expect from a grocery store close to minimum wage but not quite.
good,"Publix is a wonderful place to work. It is diverse, and there is a lot of room for growth and advancement within the company. The Publix culture is truly that of family."
good,"Publix is a wonderful company to work for. The culture is great. there are good benefits, and compensation is very competitive. I have learned many valuable skills while employed at Publix."
good,"A typical day at publix would be coming in before open. Check the floor from the night shift before, for missed stales, or misplaced product, then fill the floor with any products from back up. From there you want to begin with packing and pricing, freshly baked breads and rolls. I learned how time management and how to proof and bake breads and rolls, also to decorate. Not everyone will get the privilege so I am extremely grateful for that experience. The managers do their best to meet your expectations and make you feel like family like always. The hardest part of the job would be just making sure to have your product on the floor, at a timely manner and pulling the product from the freezers before your shift is over. The most enjoyable part of working at and for publix, are the customers. Seeing them smile from great customer service."
good,A great business to work for. The customer are so friendly as well as the employees. It was fun working here. Great dental & vision insurance. If you need to smile come on in.
good,i loved working for publix it is a very nice place to work and the management was great and they have awesome benefits. they are also very understanding.
good,I have learned a lot working for this company. I have enjoyed working with the public and other employees during my career. Publix has been a great company to work for and enjoy going to work everyday. Hardest part of the job is not being able to spend time with my family as often as I would like.
good,publix was a great company really helped mea learn about customer service and how to treat people. I would totally go back there. I shop here because I like the company so much
good,"The hardest part of the job is the customers that bring a booklet of coupons and get upset when you can't grant them all of it. While I appreciate the supportive people around me, it's most definitely not a job I want to be doing for long."
good,"I really enjoyed my time working at because they make sure they take care of their empolyees. However, some of their managment could of been better to me,"
good,"Season is a must for help! Worked every weekend from 8:30 till 6. For two years. I did both floral and cut fruit. my time in my primary position  (floral) was reduced considerably!  I loved my position! Floral specialist.  I worked every holiday valentine's, mothers day. On the days needed I worked long  hours producing for the customers needs. It was my joy and satisfaction of not only pleasing the costumers but having the satisfaction of doing a job well done with the return of the costumer. I had the best position in the entire store. I loved my work and the position I had until the changes and the department I cherished become more of a benifit at holiday and reduced to no time for the interaction and quality of care for this beautiful department."
good,"positive work day. Working here i learned how to operate a register and how to handle the different payment options. The managers were great , the were respectful and worked with you. The environment at the job was very positive, never had a bad work day. There wasn't anything hard about the job. The most enjoyable part about the job was dealing with the customers and the competitive competitions that led to rewards either for yourself or for the store."
good,A typical work day at Publix can be quite draining with all of the standing and in some cases living heavy items and walking customers out to their cars. However the job itself is quite fun!

good,"It's a better place to work than most. It emphasizes the business model of treating the customer like royalty, which is my favorite retail model. It makes the most sense, and if being nice comes naturally to you, it's great."
good,"My time their was great. Great pay, benefits, and management. This is the best retail company. I wish I could have advance quickly but it was hard because some people did not or was not ready to retire. They also have very great stock options."
good,"Employee owned ,, which is amazing for stocks. Company is very structured and has great benefits for employees and flexible with hours. great opportunity for promotion"
good,Publix was wonderful to me during my time there. I was able to work when i was available and take time off when i needed to for school or family matters. It is a much better place to work for someone looking for a full-time job to support their family. They have wonderful bonuses and benefits. Not as great for part-timers as the hours come and go and you do not qualify for many bonuses.
good,The typical work day at Publix can be relaxing in the morning time but it can get very busy. You learn how to deal with different people. Its a very diverse workplace. The hardest part is trying to please a customers that is upset about something. I enjoyed working there. Its a very friendly place
good,"A wonderful company to work for, gives back to the community. Multiple locations and departments. I highly recommend, for those who are going to school and those that have a flexible schedule."

good,"I was young at the time of employment , but i did have fun, management was always helpful , brakes are nice and on time right when you. chart hour is hot but its only an hour!"
good,Career opportunities and advancement are a plus! Great place to work. Management team is excellent! Great customer service is a plus. Great place to meet new people
good,"nice place to work, fast paced, good people to work with, management good, no complaint's, very caring company, always there for you, they believe in taking care of there associates"
good,"Best job I ever had, I worked with a bunch of wonderful people. I enjoyed working in the floral & produce dept. Just my Children church comes first I can not work Sundays. Not sorry."
good,"All that can be said is that Publix, my Publix, excelled at everything set in their motto. They had their faults like any human. But at the end of the day, it was a family."
good,the job is wonderful but hard to advance i worked there for a couple of months and asked to be trained in a different department for more hours and they denied me. I needed to pay bill so I left that job... but besides that it was great people were friendly
good,Publix is a great place to work. Plenty of days available to work with very flexible hours. Pay is very good and there are plenty of opportunities to move ahead in the company.
good,"Go in and work grocery truck. Put up stock, then work back stock. Level shelves for next day. Fill sale items on shelf and display areas. Customer Service - help customers locate products."
good,It was a nice place to work with very nice people always willing to help each other. They have very good benefits if you work full time. They also would work with your schedule if you go to school or have another job.
good,Publix work environment was fast paces and really well rounded. On the days it was packed it was packed and slow days were dead. But if you didnt look like you were working you got cucked.
good,Publix is a great place to work benefits and opportunity for advancement.Great relationships with management and a great company to work for.Great opportunities for management positions.
good,"I learned that Publix will work with you around your school hours and etc. If your a minor, they make sure you get your break and when it's time for you to leave, they tell you to go home. Whatever issue an employee or a customer is having, they will work with you and make sure your satisfied."
good,Publix was a great work experience. I was with the company for 3 years. I started when i what i high school and they really helped to work around school! Overall Great Work Place!
good,"I enjoyed all aspects.  I was an associate, promoted to entry level manager over sanitation, promoted to shipping ( management WAS stressful).  I was promoted to corporate and excelled as a Sr. Training Specialist.  I retired to raise our boys.  My husband was also a manager at the plant, with long and often stressful days.  I was traveling a lot.  We decided it best I retire.  I came back on the retail side part time, and LOVED when I got settled into my home store as front service clerk.  I also learned other departments so I could be more of an asset to the store, and get more hours.  I have bled green since 1995.  Publix gives you shares of stock for however many 100's you make each year, and even though I am not working and they do not give me the shares, I do still receive dividend checks quarterly."
good,"Publix Supermarket was a great experience in my life with countless memories made over the fifteen years I worked for them. The work is hard, the days are long but there was something fulfilling about ending a work week at Publix. I was there long enough to see the store evolve several times but the ideals stayed the same. We worked long hours, we were paid rather well and taken care of as much as our customers were. Publix is and always will be my absolute favorite company to have worked for."
good,"Overall great place to work and if you're up to it, make a career out of it. Everyone I know loves going there because of how friendly and helpful the workers are."
good,You can make a career out of this job if you don't mind stocking groceries for the rest of your life or something. It is honest simple work! Would recommend it to any in need of work.
good,"Good place to work, you get paid based on how fast you move with no top out on your pay, good schedule depending on your department, they also feed you for free"
good,"I currently work as a cashier at a Publix supermarket, and while it is definitely a stable and, for the most part, consistent job, I am not too fond of cashiering. As a cashier, you literally just stand in one place for several hours and repeat the same three or four phrases over and over again to different people. If you're lucky, you'll work at a good store, like I do, and run into the occasional customer that enjoys conversation, which will make time pass by faster. Bagging is a bit better, since you can move around all you want, and I would highly suggest being cross trained. Overall, a really nice place to work, and there are career prospects and advancement opportunities for those interested."
good,I learned customer service is important and to keep a calm steady mind no matter the situation. One of the best jobs I ever had and the workers are amazing.
good,"Boa empresa,com oportunidades , ouvi os funcionários, honra com seus compromissos"
good,I love Publix everyone i work with is amazing and so kind. My manager is so understanding. She is great about working with us with school schedules and second jobs. Our store manager is invested in each and everyone of us as a whole.

good,"Flexible hours, wonderful management and plenty of benefits. Management is always looking out for your best interest and career advancement opportunities are always there. I would absolutely recommend working for this company!"
good,"Good employment benefits, very family-like atmosphere, fast paced but enjoyable, customers for the most part are enjoyable but every once in a while you do come across some crazy characters."
good,Great job. Many opportunities for promotions. Moved out of town. Would definitely work for Publix again. Currently rehire able. On of the best jobs that I've had. The store director is second to none with knowledge and direction of her employees .And always gives positive feedback and negative in a humble way.
good,"Publix is a great place to build a foundation and platform for yourself. It will give you the experience you need and great references you will need for your future endeavors. It it truly a place to grow, a place that is family oriented and a place where you can shine your own unique light!"
good,Working at Publix is new to me. I recently moved to Charlotte from San Antonio Texas. The store is always clean. We have to keep a really high standard of performance and cleanliness. We are held to that standard every day. Customer is ur focus.
good,"They have good Benefits and they also take care of their associates for the most part. "
good,"Publix is a great place to work! I started as a bagger/cashier and worked my way to Customer Service Staff, so there is definitely room to move upward if you want it. I consider my fellow associates like a second family. My management team cares about me as both an employee and a person. They are great at accommodating schedules around classes and very understanding when unexpected events turn up and you need a quick schedule change. I have loved working at Publix since the day I started."
good,Anyone would be lucky to work at Publix. They are very flexible and have very hard working managers. This company cared about you and what you want to achieve.
good,The jobs are good when you get full-time the benefits are great. The promotions should be better handed out to the most qualified rather than other factors; but overall a great place to work
good,"Always greeted and greeting, always training and learning new things,  management is are always concerned over everyone's well being, everyone at work feels like family, occasionally rude people come in, being able to help others find the right meal."
good,"I absolutely love Publix as well as it's culture!"
good,Publix is a great company to work for with excellent benefits. I enjoy working for them. How far you go in the company is depending on what type of worker you are
good,Great job for a student. I really enjoyed working during the weekends. The managers are tough but it's so that we perform well as a store. The job defiently helped my customer service skills.
good,I love/loved working for Publix.  What I am looking for is a better opportunity to better myself and to help me become financially stable faster and my future more stable.
good,"On a daily work day is it's fast paced ,and professional   friendly work,  hard work   the people both working and customer friendly  fun loving and motivational place"
good,"I've had some of the best managers a Publix. Promotions aren't given based on performance, but rather how much you beg. The environment is what you make it and you learn something everyday. They offer a great amount of benefits, paid vacation/sick days, Insurance. I love working for this company."
good,This was my first job I went into it wondering how it works but thanks to All the managers and workers making me feel good I caught on Really Really fast.

good,"I worked at Publix for 6 years, throughout those 6 years, I met so many people who I consider family. I don't regret anything at that place, I needed more out of my life so I left for NJ and needed to start over. Great company to work for excellent benefits."
good,"Overall Publix is a great place to work. It has advancement opportunities and fair pay. When it comes to retail, Publix is probably number one. The only down side is the hours you have to put in."
good,Everyone knows publix is a great company to work for and there is so much room for advancement within each store. Except for one manager at store 470 the job was a pleasure.
good,Ever since I started working at Publix I had some amazing time. I enjoy putting a smile on the customers face and going out my way to help them with any problems they have or concern.
good,"Publix is a great company to work for. Amazing benefits, and stock options, also good hours for working. However its the employees that really bring this place to life."
good,"Great company with great chances for advancement.Full benefit package including life insurance,vision insurance,health insurance,stock options,vacation and sick pay"
good,A typical day at work is usually making sure everyone is happy and overseeing my associates to make sure the job is done right.

The most enjoyable part of the job is that me and my associates treat each other as family and go out as a team.

good,"I greet every customer that enters the store, help them to find items, and help them out with their groceries providing premier customer service. Also, any new employees in my department I am given the job to train them. I have gotten many awards for premier customer service, customers speak highly of me to my manager."
good,"Working at Publix has been a pleasure. Helping customers,greeting them, and making sure your work area is sufficient but clean. If you ever have a question or concerns management is always around to help. Publix is open to any and everybody that is willing to come and work."
good,Great company to work for. Great  benefits!  Bonuses! Excellent work environment! Great associates who work well with change. Great company to start a career
good,Management is a big help and more than willing to teach you or answer any of your questions. Usually they manage and watch the floors during rushes to make sure everyone is doing what needs to be done but will always help out if it is needed. Hours are great and always available. Benefits are great for those who want to stay there for a good amount of time. Moving up is the only difficult thing.
good,Publix overall is a great company benefits for part timers flexible schedule. I love my employees and my managers we all get along great and make the best out of our jobs.

My duties were to maintain a certain section of the store (ice, milk, eggs, water, pop, tea) on non-truck days, and to stock two aisles that were assigned to me on truck days. The work was fast-paced and always kept me moving, which I enjoyed thoroughly. I liked being active for ~8 hours of the day."
good,"Love working here a great place great people how many opportunities a lot of advancement plenty of space to move free lunch, great management understanding issue. Some of the greatest people you could ever work with the time goes by so fast its like working with your family. Couldn't find better people"
good,very first job and i love it  plus i was going to school to try and get my GED which i did and i was so happy i had a job and it is get to know that you can invest in stocks and it really gets busy around the holly days
good,"I worked for publix for 3 years and had a very good time while working there. I left to pursue my college degree, and aside from having to stand long hours, the job was very desirable. I learned to get along with people and smile for customers. The hardest part was the physicality of the job, but I would recommend this employer for anyone."

good,"Working as a part time employee at Publix has many advantages.  I am able to assist customers as well as help out other employees.  Team work on the job is necessary, and it is seen daily at Publix.  I feel like the management is fair and reasonable to everyone.  They make it an enjoyable place to work.  I don't feel like there is a hard part of the job, and the most enjoyable part is the interaction with the customers."
good,It's a great company to work for it will help you out with your education. It has a good culture and the benefits for our associates. The hardest part of the job is to go outside to retrieve cart especially when its hot outside.
good,Publix has nice employees and everyone gets treated the same. The only thing that I had a problem with was taking a 30 minute break everyday and about 2 rude employees.
good,While working at Publix I learned a lot about the business and the people working there. Publix is an amazing place to work at however they have minor setbacks.
good,"A typical day consists of interacting with a multitude of people, young and old.  I learn different patterns and demographics at each location that I work.  How technology has changed over the years is probably the hardest part.  The culture is indescribable, you have to experience it to know what I truly mean. The hardest part of my job is not being able to satisfy a customer no matter how nice or compassionate I am, they won't budge and that is hard for me.  The best part is knowing that the customers and the people that work for me are happy that I was able to help with their needs."
good,Publix is a great place to work. I worked as a cashier for a while before being offered the opportunity to move into customer service. If you're a hard worker and they see your potential then there's a good chance for growth within the company.
good,Hard work pays off....in this lace you are recognized by your hard work.  You can be promoted fast but you must network like in any other business setting.
good,"Publix is a great company, owned by its employees.  The benefits are good and the company really believes in taking care of its customers.  Many opportunities for advancement."
good,"A typical work day consists of unloading trucks and filling items that are on sale weekly. The management is astounding mostly because they promote within, so every grocery, customer service, bakery, deli, meat department, etc. manager leads by example and has been the ""little guy."" Especially the store manager at the Publix I currently work for. The hardest part of the job is that corporate doesn't allow managers to stay at the same store for more than 2 years at a time so our management gets moved around frequently. It gets hard to constantly get used to new faces and do things differently under each new manager."
good,Publix is an amazing place to work for. The company is very customer service based and pleasing every customer. The management is very friendly and are willing to work with you to move up in the company.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Publix for the 15 years that I was employed there. It is fast paced , customer focused and employee family life balanced. I enjoyed my management team and the people that I worked with. They made the day go by faster and made it ore enjoyable . The hardest part of the job was needing work alot of the holidays or extreme hours ."
good,Publix was a great environment to work at. The workers and customers were very nice. The assistant store manager really helped me out a lot while I was working there.
good,"The Distribution Center is a very large site with more than 1000 dedicated employees who are trained to a variety of tasks and are trained to operate a wide range of equipment."
good,Publix Supermarkets has been and will continue to be a leader in the grocery/retail business.  Their dedication to customer service and training in this area is an asset for any future position that you might hold. Publix Supermarkets has the best benefits package around.
good,"Best supermarket to work for. Coworkers felt like family. Our pay increases needed to be better than 25 cents though. Took me 8 years to make $10/hr as cashier. Some customers can be rude, but generally repeat customers are great."
good,"I was a cashier as well as a floor associate, I made sure that shelves were stocked and customers found what they were looking for. Physically it takes a toll on your body."
good,Publix is a great place to work. If you would like first hand experience with people and issues within the store this is the job for you. It will be worth the time it took to apply.
good,the area i was in wasnt so good. but the company itself was very understanding of school and work life. i worked in the bakery where it was very up beat.
good,Publix is a great company. Managers are knowledgeable. There is plenty of room for growth. Co-workers are friendly. Benefits package is great. The free lunch is a great perk.
good,Very good place to work. Pay raise every 6 months. Great for retirement. The people are mostly friendly except for the occasional person as comes with the retail territory.
good,Enjoyed the family culture associated with the company. I was able to be myself and also was listened to by upper management. It is a company that I would recommend to anyone if asked.
good,"in management your typical day was 10hrs long unless something came up in your dept and you needed to stay longer, i really enhanced my organizational skills and people skills with this company bc how huge they are on customer service which was a great aspect about that job"
good,"i enjoyed working at publix, the managers were great. Customers could be pretty hard to deal with but thats all retail environments so you cant blame publix for that"
good,It is good place to work especially if you are a student. The benefits are good. The associates are nice and are willing to help any customer. It is always busy because of their reputation of good quality products. Opportunity for advancement.
good,"I started working at Publix Supermarkets in Florida when I was in Freshman year of high school.  I was told my by my Father, that in order to get a car. I MUST have a job.  Little did I know that starting work at Publix...as my very first job would lead me to life long friends and wonderful memories of how a manager should treat their employees. I could never imagine having anything to say poorly about Publix. I worked there for 5 years, within my first 2 years they promoted me to front office. And within 6 months later they promoted me to back office. I truly felt they watched out for us and realized each individuals potential."
good,"My work at publix is great but some time they cut hours."
good,My joy came from making people happy and training all new employees in the philosophy and benefits of working for this company. Management were professional and employees were kind and caring to each other and customers.
good,"Publix is a great company to work for. I started as a Front Service Clerk and gradually advanced to a Customer Service Staff Member. I learned about customer service and many skills that I can apply to everyday life. They are great when you're a student. They work with your schedule and provide Tuition Reimbursement. If you love retail and want a full-time job or career there, I'd recommend Publix to anyone with that goal or desire."
good,Publix provides many benefits that make it hard to look for other job opportunities. They currently have many job opportunities in management positions which can be stressful at times.
good,"This is your typical traditional company with great benefits. Fast pace company with room to grow, advancement used to come quick. Great place to work for, but not too friendly with management and staff.If you leave forget about coming back, there is a hidden clause that they don't want you back even if you left on great grounds."
good,"Publix is a company with a very high reputation, and for years, they have worked on keeping that reputation by providing premier customer service to their shoppers. The employees are constantly trained and reminded of ways to continue to keep a smile on their shoppers faces. Those training sections are beneficial to employees who wants to work in similar fields or advance in the company. Like many jobs, there will be cons as there are pros. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the reality of the job. It is a retail job, meaning constant flow of customers including some not too pleasant ones. Besides that, the company is overall a great place to work whether it is a first job, a transition job or a career building job. They provide many opportunities for the employees including performance based pay raise, great health benefits for qualified employees, growth to higher positions, educational benefits such as tuition reimbursement and internships for certain programs or majors, a private (employee only) stock market, a credit union, 401k, and many more."
good,Publix is big on growth of the company as well as the careers of their employees. My managers are very helpful in me wanting to learn the store as well. I have been properly trained in 4 different positions.
good,"*it was a slow but always on your feet type of job"
good,working here really was a good time the time passed quickly and i also learned a lot from my older coworkers. the diverse group of customers was alway fun to serve and get to know
good,"Manager was not the kindest person, but I did enjoy working here. It was nice to meet everyone and become family. It was great! I would work here again."
good,Publix has been good to me for the time i was there. I had a good time there nothing too hard . the busiest days are Sunday and Wednesday.
good,"Typical work days were extremely busy and full of tasks. The most important task no matter what position you held was to provide premier customer service, which led to a very generous workplace. The hardest part of the job was gathering carts, not so much from the physical exertion. but because of the weather conditions - extreme heat, severe storms, etc. The most enjoyable part of the job, however, was the employees - the store was small, all departments interacted regularly. It was a great environment that pulled me and several other new hires out of our shells."
good,Public changed my life it help me become more professional. Business became more important to me. Publix was a great place to work and a even better place to shop.
good,I loved working at publix during the short time i was there everyone was like family we all showed eachother respect with getting the job done making our customers day i worked long hours even covered others shifts my manager trusted me to get the job done and working for them was a great experience.
good,"I worked for Publix for 3 years and have to say I genuinely enjoyed working there. Flexible, caring, and compassionate team members and management."
good,"Clocking in working a pallet of merchandise stocking shelves and helping customers."
good,Each day was practically identical. You would punch in and start bagging groceries or collecting carts. It was steady paced and a fairly simple job.
good,I have no complaints about working at Publix. They have always treated their customers and employees with respect. Publix loves to see you learn and grow!
good,"Publix is a wonderful company to work for with great benefits,  advancement potential,  Job security and the ability to have a life outside of work! Fast pace environment at times."
good,"I have been at Publix for almost three years. the typical work day is well balanced and well accommodated to the associate, with communication with management. i learned so much about the importance of customer satisfaction, cleanliness and organisation in a public work area, and an emphasis getting along with associates. I get along well with all my associates, some better than others but well nonetheless. the hardest part of any customer service job is typically the customer service. sometimes its hard to put myself in the mindset where im there to serve the customer, regardless of how they treat me. The most enjoyable part of the job would also have to be the customer service. I love to see the smile on the customers face when im able to go above and beyond with what ever they are asking of me."
good,"The most you can say about this company is is that it is the one place where you can grow in years , your bosses will show you how to be a better boss than them in the long run just because some bosses suck at it or just because seeing your team leader or assistant manager working his butt off more that your general manager . In over all great first job to learn from"
good,Publix is a great place to work in. They offered many benefits and opportunities to thrive. At Publix  they have a very structure work environment and an organized way of doing things.
good,"Fun place to work. Opportunity is endless. If you follow the instructions  and guide lines, possible rase every 6month. Healthcare insurance, vacation and holiday pay."
good,"I was promised by the store manager to be working in the back office, full time withing four to six weeks of hiring.  So far, I've only been a cashier and have had no further training.  Because of this, I am, once again, looking for full time employment with health benefits!  I am continuing to work at Publix part time while searching."
good,Ambiente de trabajo divertido. Mi evaluación siempre ha sido buena
good,"A great place to work. Loved being a Baker. Management is strong and promoted from with-in the ranks."
good,"Great place to work, lots of chances to grow and move up in the company, stock benefits, flexible schedule, and compassionate mangers."
good,Publix is a great company to work for with great benefits. A good company to start a career and get ahead. There are plenty of opportunities working for this company.
good,I stayed with Publix for 8 and a half years due to the amazing company. It is by far my favorite employer that I have ever worked for.  I had a career in mind when I started working for them.  I got one that exceeded my expectations. You cannot go wrong with Publix Supermarkets.
good,Incredible company! They focus on growing all employees regardless of position in all aspects of life. Publix being the United States largest employee company really makes every employee feel like they have a shared stake in the companies success.
good,"Everything that this company does they make sure they're very neat and very organized. The atmosphere is warm, meaning they make you feel right at home."
good,"I started off as a cashier and the management fully equips you with any information you need to do your job properly. If there was something I didn't know, an answer was easily found. I'd say the most important thing I learned here was people skills. How to communicate effectively, find a need and satisfy it, and how to dissolve any issues that come up when dealing with hard-to-handle customers."
good,"I genuinely enjoyed this job. I felt good about making customer feel good. Great managers and coworkers, the only reason I left was due to family reasons. Great location too, was never to busy, never too slow. Every day, I felt productive, but never overwhelmed."
good,I have been working here for over a year and it is by far the best in retail management. I recommend this to anyone who wants a first time job.
good,"Working at Publix has been a positive experience for me, and was a great opportunity for me to get started working as a high school student. The managers were always willing to be flexible and work with my changing school schedules through college, and there are always opportunities for advancement. It was a learning experience, and a great place to have a first job."
good,Learned a lot. Had one of the best pharmacy computer systems. Management expects too much. Wonderful people to work with throughout the company. Hardest part is always the issues and overcoming them. Getting the job done in a timely manner and the feeling of accomplishment is always the best part
good,Great place to work and grow in the company. Friendly staff and clean workplace. Very comfortable and enjoyable environment.
good,"Working with Publix was fun, joyous, and beneficial. It also taught me how to maintain attitude. Publix is a great place to work, I would recommend anyone to work their."
good,For the most part you work with other people who want the overall benefits of what makes a company great. The management is very helpful when you want to move up because they only hire from within so they have all done the same job you have to start out with.
good,"answering phones"
good,"I love this company it has given me great opportunities. I've learned how to contact customers over the phone and take orders down. I've learned that there will always be coworkers that do more then others. I love that the management really cares. The hardest part of the job is watching others not pull there weight and/or getting in discussions with customers, when everyone knows the customer is always right even when they are not. This is a great company if you start in it early. However, since I have bills to pay I can't afford to work part-time for six months before possible going into full-time."
good,I love working for a company that provides a future for their associates and good benefits. I love working with vendors and providing excellent customer service.
good,"j'ai  une bonne expérience avec compagnie."
good,Publix is a great place to work. They have great benefits for there employees. Publix is an employee owned business which can benefit the employees when you become full time
good,"At Publix it gets very busy every day of the week and you need to be on top and pay attention to detail about what you are doing. What I have learned is that I need to follow the schedule and my assigned duties so we do not get backed up and fall behind for customers waiting on their food. The hardest part of my job is when it gets very busy and the lines are long then it gets hard to keep up with every customers order so we try our best to make sure that the lines are moving in a timed manner. The most enjoyable part of my job is the great benefits that we get free dental cleanings, vision screenings, and discounts on sporting events."
good,My typical day at work was running a cash register and interacting with all customers and my co-workers hardest part of the job i would have to say standing for long periods of time but after while you get used to it and my most enjoyable part was the good benefits it came with and just working period was fun working for Publix
good,"Publix was beautiful. They cared about me as a person and as an employee, and they were as accommodating toward my hours requests and personal life as I could ever have imagined. I would work for Publix again in a heartbeat."
good,Its a very positive an motivating place to work. Great benefits an good management . A lot of chance to move up in company an is multi cultural
good,"I've been with Publix for almost 5 years and it has been a fantastic starting job. It really helped me get through most of my high school and college career. It was a great job and I recommend it to anyone and everyone as a good place to work. If I had a passion for the grocery industry I would stay, however my passion is in film so I'm afraid I must move on. But it will always be a quality company to work for."
good,"This particular store was a very busy workplace as it is located right at Disnry World.  I really enjoyed getting to interact with so many different people that came from practically all over the world. I also liked the challenge of it being really busy, I always left with a feeling of accomplishment."
good,"Still work here for stock, great benefits. Wasn't able to get full time, so many people wanting to move up in Central Florida area."
good,the staff is amazing and the amount of compassion they show is unreal. if you have questions they have the answers.
good,The most enjoyable part of working at Publix is meeting customers!!! All of the customers are so friendly and all of them remember us by name the same way we remember them by name. Our managers are very hard workers even though they are the leaders the treat us as equals and they care. All of my co workers are great I don't even see them as co workers we all are like a big fun family. in my opinion there isn't a hard part about my job because we all work together to get every job done and it makes every job easier.
good,"loved the job, enjoyed working there, management ok, co-workers fun, the most enjoyable part of the job was being treated like a family member and helping customers with their choices."
good,I have worked here for 11 years and I have learned a lot about the retail profession and I would recommend anyone. This is a wonderful place to work.
good,"Working at Publix helped build my social skills as well build relationships with other employees."
good,"a typical day at work is filled with copious amounts of stocking and helping customers.I learned a fair amount about proper rotation of product, how to operate a walking stacker, pallet jacks, and loading and unloading trucks properly. My co-workers at Publix are hard working people who have helped me when needed as i have progressed with Publix. Management changes what seems like every 8 months at Publix, for that reason, yet all of them want to see you move up and achieve a higher title at Publix. The hardest part of my job is rotation. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping customers and my fellow associates."
good,"A typical day at Publix Store was to come in cash office"
good,"Publix has great benefits which encourages you to stay longer, yet at times can be very challenging, but overall a great company to work for."
good,I've worked for four different grocery companies in my life. Publix is by far the best one. They take care of their employees like no one else.
good,"Great company to work for. pretty stable. Great co-workers."
good,"Publix was a great place to work! I learned to not take the things customers say about, or to you, to heart. People get upset, but it is almost never because of something you did personally. Management starts from the bottom and works their way up. I feel a small bunch of managers aren't qualified for the job and the higher ups promote some who don't deserve it. Most managers I've had were excellent for their position, it's just sad to see people get promoted based off of favoritism. The hardest part of the job would be the busy seasons. Christmas, Thanksgiving, Easter. Everyone comes in wanting to buy food and you're constantly moving and trying to keep up with the crowds coming in. My favorite part was seeing my regulars come in and just catching up with them. It's great when you can work for a place and befriend the people you're serving!"
good,"A typical day at work is very cool and relaxed. My job is to provide premiere customer service to every customer and make sure they are well taken care of when the depart from our store. "
good,I love my job at Publix. Publix offers excellent benefits and advancement opportunities. However it is very hard to balance my home/work life due to my current schedule. I am looking for employment elsewhere because I have a disabled son at home and cannot work nights.
good,I really enjoyed working at Publix. I had learned a lot with this company. The only thing I didn't like was the working in the kitchen.
good,"Publix was a good job, I enjoyed my job at publix and enjoyed my fellow employees. People worked together well and made good adjustments when employees could not show up."
good,"A typical day at work will be spent mostly grinding at the cash registers, processing transactions.  We are all responsible for keeping a clean and presentable store, as well and maintaining a friendly smile and demeanor.  Some of the arbitrary daily tasked will be distributed based on who is available at the time or who volunteers to get the job done.  These tasks can be anything from emptying the trash, cleaning the bathrooms, making fresh coffee, vacuuming and mopping, buffering the floors, or cart return.  I learned the basics of customer service from Publix, and how to process a large quantity of goods with speed.  I also learned a sense of community, as this store is an integral part of the community I have lived in for the past 10 years.  Management is amazingly friendly and approachable, and means well for all employees.  Under certain regimes however, favoritism can become an issue.  You're coworkers are from the brightest people you will meet and likely come from your own neighborhood as well.  The hardest part of the job can be maintaining a positive attitude even when life has you down, but alternatively the most enjoyable part of it is that you have a family of coworkers and management who lift your spirits, and stay personal with you well after departing as an employee."
good,It was really wealthy in this part of the town but I enjoyed it. They didnt treat everyone equal but thats where having tough skin comes into play.
good,"I cannot say anything negative about Publix.  It is a great place to work.  The only down side to it is that it is a retail company, and retail always puts a bit of a strain on the personal life."
good,"I absolutely love my current job.  But due to hours (retail) I do not see my children.  I've realized I am able to attain goals set for myself, this job has pushed me harder than any before.  I am a good Manager and have taken pride in training others to succeed as well.  I consider my co-workers family, they will always be a big part of me making it this far.  Hardest part of my job is handling lazy employees.  I do not tolerate that well.  We are a team and everyone should pull their own weight. Most enjoyable part of this job is knowing I have the ability to be more than a grocery store will allow me to be.  The design field is where I long to be and have since College.  I do not see that happening for years where I am."
good,I enjoyed being a bagger you could socialize with other employees and with customers and meet new people and become friends with them
good,"Like the title says, Publix is a great place to work for someone in college. It was a fun atmosphere for the time I was there."
good,"I enjoy my job. I have many hours interacting with a wide variety of clientele. A typical day starts with assessing the needs for product amounts for the day and then producing the product with attention to detail and quality. "
good,Everyone that works at publix is very enjoyable to work with always willing to help when you need it and helps you learn and grow as a person.
good,"Publix is a great place to work especially for it being your first job. They teach you how to work with customers,money and food. You learn value of what things cost. The management is good they work with you and try to help you succeed in life. If you go to school they will work with your schedule. If you have multiple jobs they work with you. The hardest part of the job I would have to say is dealing with the customers that just want to try and get everything for free and will not be reasonable. Also working alone and  trying to get all your work done on time and get everything filled and cleaned,  stopping to help the customers and answer the phone and take cake orders and serve customers alone. It can be a little stressful working alone at night because some customers are in a rush and don't like to wait there turn.   I learned a lot of things from working in the bakery, I learned that the bread they make there doesn't have preservatives that's why it last only 4 days,  I learned about food and dates of food items, stocking and filling items. Taking orders for bread and cakes and varies items. The proper way to pick items up if they are heavy or if you need to stack items the proper way its suppose to be done."
good,"I enjoy working with people and their I get to help them with questions, give advises on food preparations, make friends with customers. We work as a team"
good,"I absolutely love working at Publix. I got the job for its flexibility. You can work as little as one shift a month and I've never been declined a time off request that was given in a reasonable time frame. My managers listen to me when I talk to them and I enjoy spending time with all of my coworkers, they are quite the family. Whether you're looking for a part time gig to make some money while in college or are looking to become a manager, this isn't a bad place to start."
good,its a great work environment when its stress free. started as a Bakery Clerk which lead to a cake decoratored and now i'm actually skilled and all areas of the bakery. then became a Bakery Assistant Manager. The associates were great and now you have your good and your bad but at the end it all averaged out. The stresser were sometimes upper management and when the associates did complete their task and you was that person left with the mess. I enjoyed my 15 years at publix. I wouldn't take it back for anything in the world.
good,"Working for Publix is always rewarding. I have learned many different positions working with this company. I started as a front service clerk, moved to cashier, stock clerk, bakery clerk, and finally cake decorator. The team at Publix is as close as a family and they really care about their employees and coworkers. The hardest part of this job is time restraints and getting product out on time, but this is exciting in its own way! The most enjoyable part of this job is working with people and getting a chance to be creative."
good,My typical day at work was always fast paced and a learning experience. My managers were always willing to help with any scheduling and days off that you may need. I loved that my managers knew that i was a valued asset to my job and always complimented me on my work. I learned excellent customer service skills and how to deal with conflict and handle stress and pressure. My co-workers and i always worked as a team to fulfill the daily assignments needed. We would fulfill orders and made our customers feel like they were family and important as they were. There was great security in my job. I never felt like I would lose my job at any point. The benefits were very rewarding.
good,"It is a great place to work. The benefits are amazing. Publix works with your life out of work. the hardest part of working there is closing the store, there's a lot of chemicals."
good,"I would usually work bagging groceries or doing on computer training. I really learned  a lot about how fulfilling it is to work for your own paycheck and the feeling of accomplishment after completing one's task. I feel like the management was fair and my coworkers were very supportive and helpful. The hardest part of the job occurred at closing time because it was the responsibility of all employees to help clean the store completely before the next morning. The customers, like with any job, are the best part of it all. I loved getting to know some of the customers, recognizing regulars and being able to help them have an overall pleasant experience."
good,"Provided excellent service, assisted in returns, handled cash."
good,Publix is a great company to work for and the customers definitely made it the best. I fulfilled my time as a customer service staff and getting to know the other deaprtments as well.
good,I have worked many years with Publix and they have been beneficial in me getting a degree. They have great benefits and uphold many traditional values for work life balance.
good,"Work at Publix was always a joy while I was a cashier. It was a fun, exciting job where I got to know my customers and coworkers that helped boost my confidence to levels I have never known before. The hardest part of the job were some of the complicated WIC transactions and people who came in just to give everyone a very hard time and then leave without getting any groceries."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to communicate with so many people. I enjoy providing premier customer service to all.
good,My 9 years with the company was great. My co-workers were all friendly and easy to work with. Not all managers were easy to work with though that was the only down fall of the company. Besides that the hours were good as well as the pay . They were very good if you needed time off I never had a problem.
good,"Management are very personable and make you feel needed to come and work. Very concerned with associate safety, many improvement from machine guards and safety switches in play to ensure each associate returns home safe and sound."
good,"Publix is a great place for anyone to make a career of. Unfortunately I found them a little too late in life, but I did spend 7+ years until I retired."
good,"Greeted by most associates every start of a shift, you learn how to have confidence in public speaking, and everyday small talk. Managers, if they are good, will provide you with a lot of helpful and motivating criticism. Hardest part is dealing with angry customers, best part is knowing you made someones day by just your kindness."
good,There was always a smiling face at work the people there were very helpful. I can say the hardest part of my job while working there was dealing with unruly customers but as i have worked in other places I have become more adaptable to dealing with those difficult people.
good,"Hours are incredibly flexible, scholarship, and good experience for a first job! Don't really have any complaints about this job or the company itself."
good,Working at public guaranteed a future it also had good management and benefits. I left public to approach my passion for nursing and follow my career goals.
good,Great work environment with good management. Great and helpful coworkers always willing to provide quality customer service. The best part of the job was being able to help each other and work as a team. It was difficult to get used to every manager because they get transferred and promoted all the time.
good,"Great company, good benefits, only part-time, looking for full-time."
good,"I enjoy working with my co workers. The hardest part of the job is: hating to leave work, because I know that the regular customers look forward to seeing me there and they actual look for me to bag their grocery. The enjoyable part of the job is giving the customer that good customer service syndrome."
good,I love my job. Getting to meet new people and talk to them are really the high light of my day. My managers make working at Publix a fun place.
good,"Publix is a wonderful place to work. I have the job title as a cashier and I am generally behind the register for most of my shift. Occasionally, I will leave my desk to attract more customers to my register and to engage in conversation with coworkers and customers. When a customer walks up to my register, I smile and ask them about their day, and then validate that they found everything they were looking for. I always try to keep an open mind when dealing with the public because everyone is going through something, and our job is to comfort everyone that comes through our line. We want them to leave with a smile and an invitation to return again. Management really treats the employees well; we receive raises very often and we are verbally congratulated for the hard work we do. The culture that the managers create molds the culture for the employees of Publix, and in turn makes a rewarding experience for both the customer and the coworker. Publix only hires friendly people and my coworkers are very friendly. I have never worked with so many good people in my life. At Publix, the hardest part of my job is trying to satisfy every customer that comes through my line. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with the customers."
good,Publix is a very stable and fair company to work for.  They have several job opportunities for their employees to grow.  The also have great benefits.
good,"Working for Publix gave me a lot of advantages, especially when being promoted within my department which was the bakery. Started as a night bakery clerk and ended up being Head Decorator. Moved on thru the years, but the company has many great opportunities and excellent benefits."
good,"The every day routine for me and my co-workers are clock-in spot the items on the aisle then clean up the back speedway and then we take a little 10 minute break, and then we stock the shelves. After we finish we clean the store and block the aisles."
good,"I was a cashier at Publix, handling money and returning merchandise to store shelves.I loved dealing with all sorts of people."
good,"In the cash office, the first thing I have to do is balance all the cash from the previous day and do balance sheet reports. Pick up cash from registers, count it through a machine.  Make deposits, run the customer service desk and cashiers. Work customer service desk which includes lotto and Western Union."

good,very busy during season and an ok pace off season. very easy job. maintain a clean work zone in the front end and assist costumers with their items. low pay but that was the start off of a bagger and i was a minor when i got the job so i had restrictons due to child labor laws on how many hours i work during the day and week at the age of 15.
good,"Publix was an amazing company to work for. The management team was very positive and catered to any personal needs an associate could possibly have. Training was thorough and very customer service based. The high pressure environment was fast paced and took lots of concentration, but was fun to work in. Many associates were able to get away with not doing much work, and riding ono the coat tails of others, but those who did take responsibility for their work were both helpful and supportive. I made some great friends at this job and would love to go back and work there again if I could."
good,A typical day would be dealing with customers and couponers. Cleaning up messes and providing premier customer service.
good,I am able to interact with different types of people which can be good or  bad. I get to learn new things about our products. The best part of my day is knowning that i made someones day better. Management is great we have an open door policy and the hardest part of my day is knowning that a customer left unhappy!
good,"Publix is truly a great place to work. From day to day I will switch between customer service and seafood. I recommend products when necessary, keep a well organized and sanitary environment, bag and check out customers at a speedy pace while giving quality customer service. Customer service has taught me to be an outgoing employee, it has also taught me to multi task while serving and being friendly to customers. over a very short time I learned a lot of new faces. All of my co-workers are very polite and friendly. I am very happy to work beside my Publix co-workers. The hardest part of my job is not being able to get full time. Publix is very family oriented so it is more likely for a person with children to receive full time. The most enjoyable part of my job would be all the friendly customers I have met and have come to know over time."

good,"A typical work day at Publix is always fun and exciting. A great company to work with. As with any job there will come challenges and disappoints. Understanding and knowing your purpose/position is the key to any job. I am always willing and eager to help others. I am dedicated and passionate about everything that I do. I am a strong leader and team player. The most enjoyable part of my day is being able to put a smile on a customers face while helping them with what ever their need maybe. Giving outstanding, courtesy,and professional customer service at all times, showing customers how much they are appreciated for the business they bring. The hardest part of my job is always wondering if I could have done anything else to help someone else. I am dedicated to making a difference. I learn everyday that although people aren't always so pleasant, a smile and a positive attitude will keep any negative situation positive. The smile may just rub off. Turning that upset customer into a happy customer. Most of the time people just want us to say hello and ask them how is your day so far. I have learned that this one line releases so much tension off of a person who just needed someone to listen to them vent. As with management I am a firm believer that you get out what you put in. Hard work and dedication will always be the key to achieving success."
good,"A typical work day is to be better then yesterday. What ever you can do to help you become a better you then that's the goal. I learned that customer service is not just a face to face, it's different ways to handle and service the customer.Management is helpful in any way they can be to help you improve with your position or learning a new position to better your knowledge of the company.The co-workers want to be their and love the company they work for, an willing to welcome you to the family, an very respectful to one another.I enjoyed working for Publix because the family with-in the company."
good,Great company that cares about their people. Great benefits and the company is growing every year. Co-Workers are also great.
good,"My life in the Publix deli was hectic but rewarding.  Every week was a new adventure. Holiday season was very busy, but rewarding knowing that you touched peoples lives through providing food for them and their families to enjoy during holidays. I always felt appreciated by the company and left because I was young, inexperienced and dumb."
good,come in to a fun and happy staff. work hard all days with a smile and then clock out still happy.i was a deli clerk and i did a lot of cooking.
good,"I enjoy the environment and the people. The benefits are great and advancement potential is huge, the culture at the company is very caring."
good,Its a great starter job on improving your work ethic and also helps build character and you learn how to interact with others.
good,"A typical day at Publix starts proactively. I fill the cold case with products needed for the recipe that I will prepare--in some cases 3-4 cycles lasting 30 minutes apiece. I interact with co-workers who love to sample my recipes while they are on their meal breaks! And the customers come back again and again for food and conversation. I am happy to answer any questions they may have pertaining to a recipe. "
good,"I would typically clock in then start assisting customers with their groceries. I would also take their carts to their vehicles, I learned a bunch while at this job like how to be prompt and on time. How to handle multiple issues at once. My co-workers were a big help and made my job easier, A few of my old co-workers are still friends to this day. The hardest part of my job was hours that were set and the hours were actually expected to work were different at times."
good,"While working at Publix I notice people constantly advance from either cashier or front end service clerk into another department, people get promoted all the time, and move a lot, management is usually well trained and has great leadership skills, the people who genuinely do not want to work don't advance very far, but the people who put in effort and do their job well see rewards all the time.  Punctuality is a MUST, there is no excuse for a lack of accountability, and if you're going to be late it is expected that you let them know either before or at some point during your shift (and frankly it's courteous to do so)."
good,Publix is a wonderful family oriented company. I really enjoyed all of my managers and associates. There was never a dull moment.
good,"Publix is to be the premier quality food retailer in the world."

good,"A typical day at work in the bakery is wonderful. The team work there is fantastic, and the communication goes hand in hand. We are fast paced, and keep on our toes with everything that comes out of the oven, as well as all our fabulous customers that come to our delicious bakery. My management is fantastic, and I love both of them dearly. My co-workers make jokes, along with myself, all day to keep everyone in a cheerful mood. The hardest part of my job is leaving, and the most enjoyable part is being there."
good,I worked for the company for a small period of time but truly enjoyed learning about the company and getting to know the staff on a one on one level. Publix believes in Team work and premier customer service.
good,"I stock the shelves and assist customers on the sales floor with any questions they may have about any products in the supermarket."
good,Publix is a wonderful company to work for. Co-workers and managers strive to create a family-oriented work environment where everyone works as a team. Publix is great about promoting from within and doing regular evaluations/raises. Publix helps employees advance through regular training and safety courses.
good,"I worked at Publix for about a year, I loved my job, the hours were good, the pay was good and all my co workers were nice and we all got along very well. It was a fun job. You meet all kinds of people from different countries and very different jobs. I was a cashier and I was paid 8.50 to begin. we got a quarter raise in 3 months and another after 6 months of working at the job. There were times where you got very complicated customers that don't read signs correctly or at all which made every one waiting behind them impatient because you have to go check the sign yourself or wait for the bagger to check for you. If you were closing sometimes you had to stay and level which meant pushing everything to the front of the shelves and if you wanted to make some extra hours you could stay and hang the holiday decorations which was really fun. The only thing I didn't like about publix was the fact that you did not get any employee discount for lunch and my big flaw and reason for leaving the job was because my manager did not like me. I didn't want to believe it but my co workers kept proving me other wise. I wish I still worked for this company and I regret having to leave because I couldn't deal with my manager treating me unfair."
good,"I was a Stockman and I work a number of departments at PUBLIX  Prodly seafood, meat and grocery Including Frozen foods"
good,"Great atmosphere, good place to work and offers great benefits and the chance to grow."
good,My customers is my enjoyable part of my job. A day at work is great for me! I love my job. My co-workers are exciting and joyful. I love being able to help out with management. Something I learned for my job is too make sure I keep my customers happy and cheerful. The most hardest part of my job is having to leave my enviroment with my cheerful and happy customers and co-workers or even haven to go out and push bagges or even unpack products.
good,My long-term experience in the service dealing with customer service has taught me how to meet and exceed each customer's expectations with service that sells. I have assisted all types of customer in many different settings and ways. I realize that maintaining loyalty and respect is utmost importance in every company. Positioning a company for better exposure and greater marketability is an obstacle that i have performed with helped succeed many times
good,"Working for Publix has been great. The culture of premier service is strong and present every day. As far as a retail pharmacy, the shifts are similar to other retail pharmacy except that the pharmacy is not open past 9pm and closes on national holiday (New Years Day, Christmas, Thanksgiving, Easter, Memorial Day, Four of July and Labor day) The schedule for pharmacist is rotating and if you need to switch a day with your partner, its always permissible. Like most other retail pharmacies, the hardest part of the job is trying to work with less and less technician hours. The most enjoyable part of the job is building relationships with the regular customers."
good,"Publix is a wonderful place to work. People there are very friendly and outgoing which made it easy for me to fit right in. The managers there are very fair as well. There isn't really a hard part to the job, everything that's needs to be done gets done with no problem. The most enjoyable part of the job is in the break room where all the employees have our interactions."

good,the whole atmosphere was great. I loved the people I worked with as well as the people that shopped there.
good,Packaged bakery items for sale. Made bread from scratch. Decorated cakes for customers and the case.
good,Being promoted from cashier to office staff was an incredible feeling. We get to be on a different level with customers because we spend more time with them than just normal line cashiers do. It feels good to make relationships to keep them coming back for more.
good,Great place to work. Publix has great opportunities for advancement and the coworkers are great to work with.
good,"publix is a great company to work for. their benefits are great especially their 401-k plan. The company is owned by the associates so at the end of the year you get sizable divident check.

The location I work at is very busy and fast paced, so time does fly by which is always a good thing! I enjoy my associates and the managers are pretty cool too! Other than dealing with rude, and inconsiderate customers the Job is Great! It depends on how you are able to deal with the public!"
good,"The only problem with publix is the scheduling. Its like you have no outside life, work is your life. On the other hand, while you are at work it is a great place to be."
good,"In a typical day i would use a cash register to check people out. I would provide premier customer service and answer any and all questions to the best of my ability with a smile on my face. At the end of the day i would stock shelves of product, sweep floors and get the store ready for the next day. My coworkers were very nice people to work with and i enjoyed them very much. The management was firm but fun. The hardest part of the job was going home at the end of the day, i just enjoyed my job greatly. The best part of the day was getting to greet each customer and meet new people. They were always so friendly and even when they weren't, i still enjoyed my job very much. I learned how to keep a smile on my face in every situation and how to let things slide off my shoulders."
good,Work starts at 4 a.m. with unloading trucks of deli foods and then loading trucks for different routes until all orders are done. Can be very stressful at times but overall a good fast paced job.

good,"At Publix I learned to be an effective team member while gaining  excellent customer service knowledge. I enjoyed working with the other employees and managers because, everyone had such a great attitude to help each other and work as a team to get assigned duties finished. When the teamwork was not available I learned to work on my own and be an independent worker. The hardest but most rewarding part of the job is when we did not have help available. I would have to get certain job tasks done in a timely efficient manner without the help we would usually get. This taught me to be  confident in my abilities to complete the job tasks in the way the managers wanted, while maintaining constant positive customer interaction. Publix was a great place to work for and I believe it prepared me for a future career."

good,"good company, good hours, good benefits"
good,"I came from being a regular part-time cashier to growing up to a full-time customer service staff. Later on I got prompted to a customer service team leader, which was a wonderful position. I would recommended Publix to another individual. Publix is a great place to work."
good,"Publix takes care of both its guests and employees. They are happy to promote from within, but I do recommend soaking up all the information you can from the manager you are training under. I feel like my immediate manager threw me to the wolves because his personal work ethic was moderately poor. With that being said, if you are committed and willing to work at least 50+ hours a week, the benefits can be well worth it. As I worked in the deli department, a typical day included helping customers by slicing meats and cheeses, making sandwiches, cooking hot ready to eat foods, and preparing salads and sandwiches to be sold on the sales floor. Daily duties also included stocking products, preparing party platters, cleaning and sanitizing equipment, dishes, and setting up or breaking down department equipment."
good,"A typical day at Publix, for me is being at the cash register. I stand there for about 7 hours, I have an hour lunch, which is pretty fair. The day goes by pretty fast as I'm constantly busy. My co workers are nice and easy to work with, we have good management. Hardest part of my job? There isn't really anything hard about my job honestly. The most enjoyable part is people complimenting on how good of a worker I am and how nice I am. (:"

I also learned how to accomplish several tasks at once while maintaining a pleasant demeanor. The worst part of the job is long hours on your feet at one station. If you choose to do this job invest in high quality shoes. The most enjoyable part of the job is playing with the kids and making the customers laugh.

The management in most stores care about the associates and makes sure jobs are being performed in accordance with policy. The associates are very friendly and you make good friends for life.

If there are no customers that need to be helped, I will stock the sales floor, clean, help fellow employees with other tasks, and complete monthly/and or yearly training. From working at Publix, I have learned the importance of customer service and satisfaction, and how to track inventory. The management at Publix is excellent. Managers and assistant managers are always willing to educate employees to help them do their jobs better. Most of my co-workers are very pleasant to be around, and there is a highly valued culture of teamwork at Publix. The hardest part of the job was working harder than less-motivated employees, and still making the same (if not less) salary than the less-motivated employees.

good,"Publix is a fantastic company to work for, especially for advancement. I learned a lot about customer service and how to satisfy a customers needs."
good,"Moved up from cashier, to managing the front end where I was in charge of all cashiers, and their shifts. Managed the conditions and safety of the front end for both the employees and customers."
good,"The most standard day at work varies greatly. I could be working in the produce department Monday and Tuesday work in the grocery department. I like that setup because it makes the time fly by and I am constantly learning new things about the store. The most positive aspect of Publix would be the managers. They are always interested in what I have to say and they always demonstrate great customer service which makes this place so great. However, the company's greatness is also its downfall. This company moves management frequently which discourages long term relationships."
good,"A Typical day at work would be starting your 12 hour shift at 6:00am. Pulling bad product and any out of dates. Running reports. Forecasting and reviewing the daily order. Unloading the truck and putting away the product. Stocking shelves and processing. Doing daily counts and checking the invoice. Great customer service, treating them like guests in my home. Customers and employees are always fun to deal with."
good,"A typical day at work can vary. Many times we are busy, taking care of multiple customers consistently, other times we are slow, with hardly any customers coming to the cash register, and often times it fluctuates. At this job, I learned how to handle money and I started to learn about medicine. Co-workers are extremely friendly. We treat each other with respect, the same way we treat all our customers."
good,"Publix does a wonderful job inspiring, encouraging, and rewarding it's employees. The training provided by the company is excellent, and it's open door policy is always remembered when dealing with employee concerns."
good,"Publix is a good company to work for, for the most part. I have been with Publix for 5 years and looking to get out. The managers change frequently so as soon as I got a good one I liked they would be gone within a few months. Its fun getting to know frequent customers and most of the employees are great. Publix also has a tuition reimbursement program that helped me get through college. The tuition reimbursement is the only reason I stayed so long."
good,I worked part time at Publix in High School and wish I had stuck with it. Long term employees get very nice benefits and the stock program is hard to beat.
good,"A typical day at work would be either running a register, running the front over the cashier or baggers, doing customer service or at night doing the back office. The co-workers i had i loved and got along with them all. The magagement some of them were ok but others werent very good and needed more training. The hardest part of the job was doing others people jobs cause they didnt finish what they where suppose to do. The most enjoyable part was being in the front office and helping customers. I loved it even when it was busy cause it made time go by faster"
good,"Great friends and great managers at Publix. Almost anything you do at one of the stores can be an enjoyable experience. Very flexible with part-time hours but stay away from the Deli, that is the most nerve-racking place I've ever been."
good,"I work from 7a.m. to 1:30 p.m. I start mixing dough and making bread. I Really enjoy that. My Co-workers are very easy to get along with. I think the most enjoyable part of my job is the interacting with customers and meeting new people. The Hardest part of job is on Sat. when I have to wake up at 4 am!!! Saturdays are my long day and I work from 5 a.m. till 1:30 p.m. I do enjoy working for Publix, I'm ready for change and new challenges."
good,Began employment part time and learned the basics. After 1 year became full time employee and worked different stores when meat managers called for help. After filling in at one such store the manager rqueted me for his store and I became interested in management.After 1 year learning and training for the management test I passed and was put on a waiting list for the next opportunity.
good,Made sure the baggers got thier closing work down.That the part time stock crew had the store ready to open in the morning. And helping the cashiers with thier money.
good,"Great job, want it to be a career but its tough to get into management . Have to be full-time first. Most enjoyable and hardest part of the job is taking care of customers."
good,Publix is all about customer service. My managers and coworkers are awesome at times. Everybody is somewhat understanding from time to time
good,I was a GRS (Grocery Replenishment Specialist) a normal day was unloading the trucks. Neatly stocking shelves. Making sure that the computer had accurate counts for various products in the store. Invenory management. I learned a great amount of responsibility and much about inventory maintenance. Co workers were great. Had a real team feeling to the job. Hardest part of my job here was that many holidays were spent working. Most enjoyable part of the job was making many customers extremely happy. Managemnet was great always willing to help.
good,A typical day at work is a day interacting with customers that shop at the store. Making sure they get everything they need with excellent service along with it. Customer service is the main asset i have acquired from this job. Managers change frequently throughout stores due to transfer.

good,"loved my co-workers, customers, doctors and nurses I came in contact with"
good,"Publix is a great place to work. Everyone is so friendly. A typical day at work for me in the produce department would be me coming in around 7 AM. The first thing I do is go to the sales floor to grade the rack and make sure all products are of good quality and in date. Then I spend the rest of my day cutting fruit for customers, scanning product for pricing and inventory, unloading trucks and stocking shelves. If I am working as a cashier my day consist of greeting customers and making sure their shopping experience is as enjoyable as possible. Knowing that I am the last associate they see before leaving the store I make sure to leave a lasting impression. The hardest part of my job is when we have a ton of fruit orders that need to be done quickly and I have to make sure I have all of them done plus my daily work. The most enjoyable part of my job would be my customers. Being at Publix for 6 years has allowed me to form a bond with many of my customers which is very satisfying to me."
good,"Great company, great chances, and left with the doors open. The best company i have worked for. Great opportunities and ghances to grow within the company."
good,i usually pulled orders for about 8-12 hours a day.
good,"Normal day usually included building displays, keeping stock room organized, helping customers find product, and keeping the store stocked with product."
good,"While employed at Publix, issues that arised were met with a singular mindset: what do we have to do to make it right? Customer service and family values were the key, and the entire company did whatever it took to make shopping at their stores a better experience than shopping anywhere else. It is the only grocery store I'll shop at to this day."
good,wonderful place to work and great benefits. Pretty pleasant for the most part as far as work places go coworkers as well as customers.
good,"A typical day at work was very fast paced, multi-tasking between customers, associates and managers, all the while staying organzied and focused. Patience, company values,and a postive attitude are just some of the things I've learned while working for Publix. The hardest part of the job was learning how to be able to concentrate on many tasks and maintaining above and beyond customer service. The best part of working at Publix, there were no two days alike, everyday I learned something new, and working with the most positive people I've ever met!"
good,"I've learned lots at publix. I notice customers everyday walking threw out the store and having happy smiles on there faces each time they get great service. Publix is a great place to and also very busy and fast pacing. The managers there are an awesome team to work with. But the hardest part of my job is when i became pregnant i couldnt stand much or really smell the foods since i work in a food place or lift much heavy stuff but hopefully it will change soon. the enjoyable part of this experience i had at publix was that i loved helping the customers and being there every second and every moment they needed me, I'd help them as much as possible, I'd give some customers advice if they ever had a problem or something about there visit at publix, These customers are your concern and people you gotta make smile each day and i am always willing to do that for each and one of them everytime im at work."

good,Overall great place to work at if you are a student going to school. They work around your schedule so you are not forced to schedule your classes around work. The regular raises are great and are usually rather generous if you put the work in. The benefits are great and so are the stock options you receive while working there.
good,"Loved working here, I have worked for different locations and everyone single one was the same experience. Amazing co-workers and good management. Only complaint is that some customers can be rude."
good,The best place I ever worked. Family oriented and caring. They really do put their employees first which guaranteed the effectiveness of customer service no
good,Publix is a great place to work and opportunities exist for a diversified work experience.  The down side is that part-time hours can be limited due to budget constraints.

good,"A typical day at work would be started with a smile before I clock in, think that says a lot about the company as whole! I would never find myself wondering what to do next."
good,"It was a great place to work at. A typical day in the deli includes the shift being busy once lunch and dinner rush kick in. That depends on location of the store though. I learned how a deli would work and how it interacts with the other departments in the store. Management is pretty decent, as ""punishment"" with my experience with my managers would be decreased shifts for part time workers. I don't think they understand that I also have bills to pay for. The hardest part of the job would be trying to open in general. There are a lot of items and tasks that need to be done at a certain time, and my deli is very busy majority of the time."
good,I really learned a lot of customer service skills and money skills at this job. They have really flexible hours and they work with you and your everyday schedule.
good,"Publix was my first job and from the moment I started I felt at home and like I was apart of a family. Working with a great group of people and working as a team was always big. Starting as a bagger, cashier, customer service staff, team leader and then asst customer service manager. I enjoyed my time there but then went to venture off cross country"
good,A typical day at Publix is to come in do what is required by the management and then leave. There isn't much more to it than that. There are assigned duties in the midst of everyday tasks to ensure everything runs smoothly. The hardest part of the job is maintaining the highest level of customer service possible.

good,I’ve been working for Publix for 6 years now and I can tell you it’s been pretty amazing. I’ve made so many friends and people have actually became family. I have regular customers that come in just to see me. Clientele can be a little difficult but Publix has taught me patience.

good,"Publix is a wonderful company to work for. The management genuinely cares about the employees. The starting pay isn’t bad, either, and everyone has a chance to move up in the company if they so choose."
good,Working there does get stressful but there are slow days. The managers are very nice and if you’re a good worker you’ll get a lot of benefits. The other employees there were nice but only a handful of them believed in teamwork.
good,Over all good place to work. They work with you while you're in school and even have a program. The only thing that is not fair is trying to get full-time position. Manual labor as well but full benefits and flexible with scheduling.
good,"I worked at Publix for 6 years in Customer Service. Got a lot of experience  with people and learning how to handle money. They are organized and established well. Pay is not great nor are the hours because of the amount of people they hire. Long shifts can help with getting hours. Pay would only increase by a max of $0.75 every 6 months which is nothing. Other than that, it has prepared me for my future careers and helped me learn a lot of social skills."
good,"Working at publix really taught me a lot. It taught me how to interact with customers and how every customer is different. The most enjoyable thing about working at Publix was being able to meet so many new people in my community.

good,Publix was my first job and I loved the culture there. There's a reason they're one of the top companies in the country. I was always motivated at work to make the customer feel as welcome and comfortable as possible.

good,I loved working for publix. Everyone is so nice and friendly. The workers are very nice an i made great friends working there. Publix has great benefits and is an amazing company to work for. I was pregnant while working there and they treated me so well and was very understanding with everything i was going through. Publix is a great company!
good,The environment is according to nothing else put before it. You should have an open mind. You should be willing to masterfully ride transportation get rest and work another job that pays the Bill's. Budget well because the money you get can not be for food. You need some for your transportation. Your primary job one or the other should be your relaxing job that pays for what you can. Overall it's a winner many people no food is well not to worry about and the job you do is for the bills.
good,Publix is easily one of retail's best jobs. The benefits are countless; everything you need and more. The ability to advance is there if you want it. The recognition for hard work is remarkable.
good,"A typical day is bagging groceries and assisting customers out to their cars"
good,"In my opinion, Publix is one of the best companies to work for. Hands Down! With a strong culture and history, sound business philosophies, rapid expansion, opportunities and dedication to the value and employment security of its associates, it is hard to beat."
good,"It was a long time ago but I would work there again. I had a very good experience working there. Management was very nice, Very clean stores! My favorite grocery store to shop also."
good,"I liked my job and I was glad  Publix finally came to Knoxville. They have competition and people are not familiar with this store like they are in Florida"
good,Very enjoyable place to work. There's ability to move up and grow with company. I always tell people you get out of Publix what you put into it. I would recommend anyone to work for them if able.
good,Publix is constantly improving their safety procedures and associate knowledge. They are willing to work with everybody on scheduling conflicts and will do whatever they can to make your time there worth working. I love working there and value the knowledge I have gained there.
good,"Work is work, but Publix will compensate you well not only with decent pay, but all with great benefits. Flexible schedules. Perfect if you are a college student, they will even help you pay for tuition!"
good,"At Publix, I was able to work with people who all shared the same value of helping the community, the workers were great, and the work hours were not bad. Management was understanding and effective they knew how to get the best out of their employee's."
good,If I didn’t get hurt I’d still be working there. But my restrictions will not allow me to fulfill my duties there unfortunately. That why I turned to driving
good,"Good place to be employed, never had a problem working there. I just need more hours and that’s one the only reasons to work there. Would highly recommend."
good,Depending on which Publix you work at depended on how busy/stressful the job could be or slow. When it was slow it could be very boring so I enjoyed when we got busy because the time went by quick.
good,Publix hires young and it set my work standard from an early age. Started when I was 14 and it’s done nothing but help me advance in my career somewhere else
good,Inside the pharmacy its honestly a very stressful environment you have to be able to multitask and be willing to do task quickly. The people are wonderful to work with and everyone is very friendly
good,"Publix is a good job overall, but its great for those with zero job experience. They give raises every 6 months depending on how well your evaluation was."
good,Publix is a good place to work; the pay is good and the benefits are good and the management team contribute and help out in the store instead of hiding in the office and they treat you with respect and like a human being
good,"An applicant must report to their job on time or before the workday is scheduled , Since I had seafood and grocery experience, I had a general knowledge of what was expected of me. As a prior owner, I realized that I was to respect my store manager and supervisors  and work with my co-workers. With Publix being a large corporation, I found it to be a more productive place to work.Their is nothing hard about this job but, an applicant needs to give it 100% every day that they are working. I really like telling other employees and future employees how nice it is to work at Publix"
good,Management gives clear expectations and trains you so that you are given tools to succeed. Everyone is very inviting and it was enjoyable to go to work

good,"Great place to work."
good,"Very fast pace and detailed oriented, must be able to identify all product through UCN numbers, must be able to received product in a timely matter to keep up with Scheduled Appointments"
good,"No matter how introverted you are, it is fairly easy to make acquaintances and friends at Publix and chatting with both your co-workers and customers makes it a fun place to work at. You always put customers first and smile as you go about your duties and always try to help other co-workers and customers out if they need your assistance. Management can get a bit messy when people from corporate arrive because the job culture is different when you're actually in the store versus the office but everyone manages fine. It gets a bit hard when many couponers come at once and you have to open more registers to compensate for the long lines."
good,"Was happy  to wake up and go to work at Publix. There was a lot of physical labor in the cut bar, chunking and slicing fruit and vegetables for 40 hours a week. Felt very productive though and it was very important to me to make my customers very satisfied with our product. The floral department  is my passion though. Love to be creative.  Was so wonderful pleasing the customer with my skills of arrangements and bouquets and candy looms. Have always been a very outgoing and cheerful person that likes to engage with the customers and employees around me."

Pay attention to safety hazards and be constantly prepared to deal with them. Publix is a place where your associates are VERY friendly, almost like family! The most rewarding part of the job is the relations you make with the customers. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the customers (crazy angry people who yell all the time). The most rewarding part of the job is the relationship with your customers, how they recognize you, call you by your name, and ask about your life to see if you are doing okay."
good,Really great company to work for. They train you well and really care about their employees. Upper management changes sometimes but they're always so nice and accommodating.

The most enjoyable part about Publix is how inviting management makes you feel."

good,"Overall, Publix is a great place to work for. They really care about their associates. Publix provides incredible benefits and offers opportunity to move up for those who seek it"
good,"Effectiveness and personal Success varies based on the Department you ultimately choose to become a part of. Most people will start out as a Teller and after a year can apply to work into the Department of Interest they choose from an internal job opening.

When I wasn't feeling well, he genuinely cared; if I called in sick he would wish me well. I was able to speak to him and his assistant comfortably about work hours and anything that I did or did not feel comfortable with. I learned more about operating a cash register, I unintentionally memorized many produce codes, and most of all, gained tremendous confidence. Publix is a place where you know the customers and the customers know you. I could name almost everyone who worked in the store, even those outside my department. Though I did not work there long enough to receive them, Publix provides 401k and health benefits. The toughest part of the job was standing on my feet for hours on end. Additionally, it is rather corporate. Most tattoos are ok, as are ear piercings, but unnatural hair colors, facial piercings, and stretched ears are not allowed. I covered my then red and eventually blue hair and had to wear a clear lip stud. Despite this, the most enjoyable aspect was that it truly felt like family. I still miss my co-workers and even managers today."
good,"I worked there for seven years. I loved being a cashier, a FEC, as well as a member of the bakery team. I discovered my passion for baking while working, and moving up the ranks within the company."

It was a great step and stone for me."

good,"As far as I'm concerned, Publix is among the best employers in the world."
good,They have amazing benefits and love to meet all customer needs to the best of their ability. They are a company who loves to arrive and help the community.
good,I'm not interested in giving my opinion on any company because I am only one person and my one opinion will not make a difference on how a company does or doesn't run

good,Publix is a great place to start off with your very first job! I was hired at the age of 17 as a cashier. I was taught so many great things to help me in this world and to prepare me as a successful person.
good,I worked here for a long time. For a grocery chain don't think you could get better. Great benefits and great pay as long as you put the time and effort in. Highly recommend for first time work. I left because I didn't want to be in my 30s and still in retail. Great place for advancement if you want to go into management. I didn't want to. Much longer hours and high expectations. Lots of lifers. Many of people working there started in high school or college and end up staying 10 or 20 years plus.
good,"I've only been at Publix a short time,and even with spending grand opening and me catching up with my fellow associates,I am feeling comfortable and confident about my positions and the organization,the structure of this organization is great and organized.you are not left in the dark about anything and management is great,I wasn't planning on returning to retail but they have won me over!"

good,"I have never been really thrilled to go to work at Publix, but it is definitely been a safe job for me with high job security. In the history of Publix, the company has never laid off a single person due to financial difficulties. I was a very shy person before being employed at Publix, but now I feel comfortable talking to strangers about anything. I have developed many leadership skills and am more of a ""go-getter"" now than ever."
good,Publix goes out of its way to hire vets and takes care of us. Your co workers and management all make it feel like home. If your looking for a job id recommend publix.
good,Takes care of their people from my experience. They give you hours when you need it and most of the managers care a lot about their employees. They also have great benifits
good,"The job isn't difficult. Many opportunities for job advancement and raises, if you're willing to put the work. Rules and policies are different than other Publix stores, making the environment and perspective of the job different for everyone."
good,Publix is a great company to work with. You really get to know your customers well. The stores are very clean. If you are working there long enough you can get stock with Publix.

good,"A normal day at work at Publix was fast paced but relaxed. I never had a manager that i didnt get along with and didn't like. Working at p"
good,I worked with publix many diffrent times.  I enjoyed working with people and meeting new people.  I was a cashier and standing on my leggs all them hours I had a lot of pain in my lower back because of standing in one place.
good,"They offer great benefits, they try their best to satisfy their customers, also customers are nice and loyal. Groceries are not too pricy and there are deals everyday it changes every Thursday, so before the next Thursday you have a whole week of the same deals before they end."
good,It has been a great experience working for publix! But the management consistently changes and that has affected me a lot. Managers may be inconsistent when changing the schedule.
good,Great company to work for but could use more hours. Everyone is friendly and helpful you just have to work multiple departments to get the desired hours.
good,Publix is fun to work at. It gets boring at times but that's better than it being busy all the time. The coworkers are all easy to get along with and I would love to keep there if I wasn't going to college out of the region.
good,Coworkers and management were very friendly. Management willing to work around school schedules. Work is evenly dispersed among the employees and duties change often.
good,Publix is all about providing top tier customer service and doing whatever it takes to make the customer happy. The people who work there are generally happy because they feel appreciated by management. You have to work as team and be dedicated but it is very rewarding at the end of the day.
good,The benefit's are good and they're willing to cooperate with scheduling. The duties are very simple and rewarding. I met a lot of nice people and everyone I help never had problems with me. Most of the time I would bag customers groceries and without them having ask I would position myself behind their cart after filling in and ask them which way to their car. I could tell they respected the integrity of our Publix.
good,I loved working at Publix. Sure you had some not so great managers but for the most part looking back at my almost ten years at Publix I would do it again in a heart beat. Living in Texas I really miss Publix.
good,"I learned very much about handling questions that the customers asked me and misunderstandings. I learned to work the cash register, how to work at a proficient pace, and I enhanced my communication skills. The management at Athens, AL Publix was wonderful; I loved the people that I worked with while I was there. The hardest part of the job was learning how to keep a customer satisfied when there was a miscommunication or misunderstanding. After experience with situations like I just described, I learned how to keep the customer satisfied and more calm. The most enjoyable part of my experience at Publix was getting to speak to many different people throughout the day. I liked knowing that while the customers were at Publix (and with me also) everything went very smoothly and timely."

good,"High paced working environment with a lot of customer service which I enjoy. I find hard time dealing with heavy boxes full with deli products especially working with them in the big coolers, which motivated me to go back to school. Publix is a great company to work for and I am so grateful to my management for the understanding and the flexible schedule."
good,Great work atmosphere. Managers care about employees. Work schedules are flexible to a point. The benefits are amazing. Salary is good. You get your own uniform.
good,Loved being a part of the team. Being in management had the challenge of being away from home more than 50+ hours each week.  The leadership classes they provided were all tools.  They are actually classes and tools that can be utilized outside of the home and other jobs.
good,Great company to work for. Excellent opportunities as well as great benefits. Publix has been extremely accommodating while I pursued my education in college.
good,"Benefits were very good, however management did not always have good leadership. Stocks are a great financial investment. Opportunities for work committees and certifications were available."
good,"I scan groceries and speak with the customers making sure their shopping experience was great. If not, I then make it right with the customer and make sure I fix the problem before another customer experiences the same issue."
good,"Great days at work, I learned how to work the glazing machine for the cream cakes, the hardest part of the job was pushing the big mixing bowls back and forth. What it enjoyed about the job was the chance to meet alot of people and see how the cream cakes were baked packaged and ship off."
good,"Really feels like family, good pay, flexible hours. Management and staff are always working together to solve issues to better off customers experience."
good,pretty good company to work for especially if you plan on staying with them and working towards becoming a manger because you can make 6 figures with only a high school diploma.
good,"Work days consist of assisting customers with potential needs while maintaining an efficient, operating inventory. Management does a good job planning."
good,I am a hard worker I give 100% to my job. I would have stay with Publix if I had not moved to another state. Publix treated me with respect and encourage me and help when I wanted to become a baker for them.
good,Publix offers great pay and benefits. They promote from within and have exceptional training available to associates to help with success. Publix promotes excellent customer service and a pleasurable shopping experience.
good,"As I was underemployed at the time, it afforded me the opportunity to pursue other jobs while working at the company. I feel that the overall culture is very supportive of the associates. If I was just starting out I would definitely be pursuing a career with this great growth company."
good,"Working with Publix was a great experience. Especially as an entry level position. I started as a cashier and worked my way to customer service staff. I learned to communicate with fellow associates and customers informatively on a daily basis and read people's needs. I would handle all major transactions at the desk from returns to large western union orders. The hardest part of the job was upset individuals and how to keep them under control, and the most enjoyable part of the job was providing customer service and making people completely happy with their experience and wanted them to come back."
good,In the ten years of service l enjoyed my work my co-worker and mangement staff the job was a very rewarding experience it inspired my be proud of my self and the work that l did in serving the public.

good,"Over all, the company is a wonderful place to work. The work environment really depends on the management team. If it is going to be a good work place the store needs a good team of managers to run it. If the mangers are not up to par then it may end up just being a job."

They only promote from within so no outside source of experience can come in and steal one's job. Although they are highly professional with high expectations for one's appearance performance, it is a very fun work environment where everyone acts as a family. The benefits are incredible and go all the way from one's genesis with Publix to his or her retirement, inclusive of 401k and stock options."
good,No work place drama and customers were always number 1 and employees were well taken care of. During the summer there was always a water cooler out so employees did not get over heated or dehydrated.
good,"Great place to work all across the board."
good,I currently work for Publix and i enjoy that its part time and very flexible with my school schedule. The customers are nice and employees are a pleasure working with.
good,"A typical day at Publix would mainly consist of greeting customers and providing great customer service. I learned how to find what customers need in the store. Management was great to work with. They knew who had to do what and how to solve problems with customers. The hardest part of my job would be helping people who speak a different language than me because at that point, I can't really help them if I don't know what they are talking about. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting my paycheck because I get to help out my parents with groceries if they would like or even taking m family out to dinner."
good,The company's style of leadership is great and everyone tries to set an example for the others in being a good person and employee.
good,"On a normal day at work I will cook various foods for the deli."

good,"Great benefits, good working environment. good customer service. overall a great place to work. Would recommend to all my friends to work for."
good,"There is NOTHING wrong to say about this company! It's amazing all the way around. The only negative thing I would have to say is, it's hard to get promoted to customer service if you're not stuck up. I worked for the company for 5 years and never got up there but they would let people who worked there a few months if they were ""goody goody"" with the managers."
good,"Publix was such a great place to work at! I honestly did not know how great I had it there until I started working somewhere else. I loved working in the bakery, it was so much fun! The bakery was a great place to meet new people and learn so many different tasks everyday!"
good,I love working for Publix. Customer Service is the focus and that is why Publix is the store of choice. There are consistent comments of praise from customers. The most enjoyable part of my day is helping customers and making them smile. I love the flexibility and the compassion that this company offers. They understand that their employees are people and have lives of their own. They are telling the truth when they say they have an open-door policy. There is much room to advance. All you have to do is ask. Someone is always willing to work with you. I haven't even spoken on the benefits. Its awesome to be able to walk away from this company with something in hand; part time or full time. And I would say there's nothing really hard about this job. There are difficult and challenging moments. But nothing that is hard.
good,"I enjoyed working for Publix. My managers were amazing and helped as much as they could. The environment was strict, but produced the best outcome of service. There was room for advancement and retirement options. The benefits were amazing and stock options were wonderful."
good,This is a thriving company which I love dearly. There is a lot of room for advancement and they are extremely flexible with scheduling.
good,fun work place with supportive management. not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. decent amountt of hours and days but it is expected from a big company. publix has many benefits for both full time and part timers. it may be hard to get hired at first but once you get hired the benefits will not let you leave
good,publix is very organized and professional. the customers are nice and the employees are even nicer. its a fun place to work. the most enjoyable part is working together with my coworkers to get a project done. evaluations are every six months with possibility of a raise.
good,Everyday would consist of maintaining the work space and equipment clean. There would not be one second where I was not busy. Management was very team oriented and supportive. The hardest part of the job was managing my time with a customer and attending others without making them feel like they were not attended like the previous customer. The part I most enjoyed is that meeting new people that were caring and helpful in my transition to the job.
good,"This was a very productive and well put together company. Everything was fast pase, and the people were extremely nice."
good,"I enjoy going to work with my second family. It can get busy and rough at times, but I learned to smile and keep going even in the toughest situations. My managers are true role models always demonstrating what being a team really means. My co-workers are my second family, mainly because i see them as much if not more than i see my own. The hardest part of my job is trying to keep everyone happy. Although i do a pretty good job at it, it still tops as the hardest because you simply cannot satisfy everyone. What i love the most about my job is knowing i work with a team not just individuals. We all work together to ensure that everything runs smoothly and that all customers leave happier than they were when they came in."
good,"I love Publix, Ive had great experiences there. It provides great opportunities for advancement. Ive been there for what will soon be 9 years because its a great work environment."
good,"Publix is a great company to work for even if you are not management. You enjoy retail bonuses every three months, are given stock whether you purchase it or not. If one desires, the opportunity to advance is offered, and it's a quicker road than one would expect."
good,"Publix is where I started my first job. I had been doing construction with my dad shoveling dirt on jobs. I started when I was younger and started as a Front-Service Clerk. I bagged groceries, learned about the workforce, and talked to different people everyday. I learned how customer service is very important. At the end of the day, it is all about the customer. I would not trade this experience for anything. "
good,"its a lot to learn but needs more teaching.   its so much you could learn from this company, over all their great as a work place but its hard to come by full time"
good,"Working for Publix I've definitely learned a lot. I've learned that multi-tasking is a must in a working environment. Specially when you're dealing with people face-to-face on a daily basis. I've used computers, managed returns, dealt with a lot of Western Union and money order reports. I've been in charge of running the front end from time to time to make sure everyone was doing their job right. Being a customer service representative requires a lot of energy and attention. You have to know how to put your feelings aside and del with the public eye, regardless of your outlook on it."
good,"I love Publix, shopping and working has been a true pleasure here. However, I am ready to exit the retail industry. Only having three guaranteed days off a year just isn't what I'm looking for in a career."
good,Great place to make a career job. Utilizes training procedures that allow you to soar in your field of work and feel safe with job stability.
good,Great company to work for hard work but potential to advance if you meet requirements. Co-workers are nice and management always looking for your best effort willing to teach you so you always learn something new.
good,Typical day at Publix is busy. Lots of things going on since we get get such a large variety of customers. My managers are amazing. They are always out of the floor helping us get everyone taken care of when we get crazy busy. They are both always willing to help all of us learn anything that will help us perform better. My co-workers are like every other co-workers. You have some bad ones and some really good ones. Everyone gets along and can communicate in a respectable manner. The hardest part of working in Publix is making sure EVERYONE is satisfied. Unfortunately we do have one or two who we just can not please. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting that one customer who needs all the help they can get and i get to be part of a special event and can help them relax and get everything together for them.
good,I enjoy working at Publix because the store is always clean and the management is both knowledgable and helpful. I like that this company invests in their employees and offers great benefits.
good,"great job with great benefits loved the schedule , my favorite pace of employment, a nice career starter ad they feed you I loved this company weekly pay"
good,Love my job here. Made friends with associates almost immediately and everyone's always friendly. Hours are have been pretty good but achieving full time employment can be pretty difficult.
good,"Publix treats their employees very well. Lots of room for advancement. Most all employees are great at their jobs and very knowledgeable. I learned a lot about spreadsheets, data entry, associate records, shipping and receiving, how to process store orders and follow them to the truck for delivery and then close them out for processing. Dealing with truck drivers (that was interesting to say the least). Hardest part of job was dealing with some of the drivers some of them had attitudes but I have the personality to give them a smile on their face and make them more pleasant. The associates and managers were the most enjoyable part because someone was always there to help you when you needed it or I was there to help them. Team work for sure."
good,Fun work place with supportive management and great opportunities to advance. I've started at a entry level position in 2007 and worked my way all the way to a career position by 2013. All my supervisors and peers helped me the grow and move up my whole career at Publix.
good,"Publix is a great place to work, They give you great tips on customer service. They encourage you to smile all the time, and have a positive attitude, even where you're down."
good,"The facility is a dynamic work environment that challenges you to step outside of the box and grow in ways that you could not anticipate. The culture is unlike any other that I have seen. They motivate, strive for success in all areas, promote not just a good work ethic, but great ethical behavior, and provide you the opportunity for you to develop your skills, as well as, learn new ones. Publix.....Where Working is a Pleasure."
good,If you like people and enjoy helping others Publix will be the easiest place for you. They're very flexible with your schedule and work with you.
good,Great environment. Showed me that hard work can pay off quickly. Great place to pound the pavement and get rewarded for it.
good,"Publix is a fantastic place to work, with so many opportunities to advance as well as all the benefits they give you, investing in you and your 401k."
good,I started as a cashier in 2008 and moved to the bakery in 2010. As a cashier I learned the valuable customer service skills I still posses today. I moved to the Bakery in 2010 where I was a Cake Decorator until 2013 when I began as a Baker's Apprentice learning to mix bread and bake it to ensure optimal quality product. I loved my coworkers and keep in touch with most of them to this day. The hardest part of the job was the hours and shift changes. The most enjoyable part of the job was pushing myself to become better everyday; always learning. My coworkers were amazing too. I cannot say enough good about my work history with Publix.
good,"Loved everything about this job, wish I could get back into the company. I can't describe the level of care and concern they take in reference towards their employees. I LOVE PUBLIX"

good,"Customers are kind first of all, Pay is great they pay based on experience, management is awesome depending on which store work at. I just love Publix"
good,I've worked in slow-paced and fast-paced pharmacies and being organized is very important. My managers through the years have been wonderful and helpful if I have a question or want to understand more. I have adapted to different pharmacy settings and have a fit in well with other technicians. One of the hardest parts of the job would be working accurately and in a timely manner while being under staffed. The most enjoyable part of the job is the friendships and relationships built with co-workers and customers and knowing you can help them get the medication they need to become a healthier individual.
good,"Typical day would be,Unload tractor trailers loaded with grocery products.Work grocery products to grocery shelves, keep inventory of all shelf tags to gain more knowledge of what sales and what doesn't."
good,Great place to work and advance in. You have the ability to make a good amount to provide for your household. Free lunch buffet style is provided everyday.
good,Good benefits and a good group of people to work with. I enjoy working at Publix more than any other place I have worked before. The hours can be a bit daunting and it is hard to keep up with changing coupon policies and items not ringing up but over all it is not a bad job
good,"A day at Publix was always great. Everything was so fast paced time seemed to go by very fast. Open door policies hey have set in stone are wonderful. The co-workers I had grown close to, everyone was wonderful."
good,Great company to work for if you want to rise up fast into a career
good,"I worked for Publix for 5 years. As I developed within my career there I also developed strong relationships with my managers and peers. Now that I left, all I want is to go back."
good,"A typical day at Alorica was a busy day, there was always work to do which made the time fly by if I was to work an twelve hour shift, I learned how to activate phones, reset phones, file insurance claims, as well assist with trouble shooting phone, activation, ordering phones, etc. The hardest part of the job when you first start is defusing an upset customer without making matters worst if you didn't have an solution to resolve a situation."
good,"Publix motto is all about customer service. The greatest thing about working there was the positive attitude in our staff, which made the shopping experience for customers bar to none."
good,"From the time I come in to the time I leave its busy. You would always have to be on your feet. dealing with over 60 customers a day, you have to do a lot of multitasking. Great company and people."
good,"A day at Publix is truly amazing, providing premiere customer services was a most. I have a lot through the Publix  culture from interacting with co workers and customers in a professional manner, and Management was on top of their game and really treat us accordingly. To be honest I love everything in the Publix culture, however I can say it takes quite a bit to be promoted. The most enjoyable part of the job with interacting with customers on a daily basis and make sure Publix stays on top of the Super Market chains."
good,"Publix Supermarkets is not only where shopping is a pleasure, but also working is a pleasure. I may be bias because Publix is the only job I have ever had. The overall benefits at Publix are some of the best in the nation. Publix is always a Fortune 500 company year to year. The reason that Publix is so successful is due to the leadership, managers, and most of all, the associates (employees)."
good,Publix is a company that takes pride it's employees and the services they provide. Coworkers and Managers are friendly and helpful.
good,"A great place to work, great benefits, great bonuses and the employees are great, a family company. The hardest part of the job is physical but it pays off and the most enjoyable is that  this is a secure job and you have a pay check."
good,Management is always there to help out with any information or questions you may have. Willing to work with employees to help in any way possible. Great environment to work in.
good,"Great work environment with options to purchase stocks. clean, well lit. Constantly learning something new."
good,"Working as a team is to reach a common goal. Which is achieved when through conviction in the proposed goals, members bring into play their knowledge, abilities, skills, and information they have, in general, the skills that each member has; thereby achieving a synergistic effort."
good,"Done integration ,system and database testing"
good,"I would be at work between Three and Six in the morning. My managers and other grocery clerks and I would work together to unload and load up truck, stock shelves, and order truck while doing inventory. We would always help customers find what they needed so we could make there shopping experince better. our managers would always try and help us the best the could with problems that we couldn't fix ourselves."
good,"Publix Supermarkets was a great experience overall.  I learned a lot about customer service as well as personal responsibility and being part of a team.  In the Grocery department, we were required to finish our tasks before being able to leave for the day.  If any of the department lagged behind, it was up to the rest to make up for the lost time. "
good,"I worked for Publix Pharmacy for eight years, ultimately leaving when I was preparing to move cross-country. I now find my move canceled, and am looking for new experiences!"
good,Publix is an amazing place to work and provides so many benefits.
good,"Everyone knows if you don't come in to work or shop early, you can forget about finding a good parking spot. Patients is definitely a virtue because you come in contact with a variety of personalities that you have no choice but to keep yours under control and learn how to handle others in the right manner. All the associates and managers get along great. The hardest part of the job is standing in one spot doing the same job for hours at a time and your only break is lunch. Other than that, being able to laugh and establish a relationship with customers is awesome."
good,"I would greet customers while they come in the door, ask is they needed any assistance with anything also while cashiering. What I learned was how to count money an was able to close a store down. The managment was very nice and fair. The hardest part of the job was probably nothing at all I actually loved the job. The most enjoyable part was when we was able to come up with ideas to raise money for certain charities."
good,its a vary nice publix to work for the management is nice and the customers are even better...occasionaly you might see a boss at a bad time but usually there happy
good,Publix cares about their employees! Loved working here! Great benefits and great people to work with.
good,Great company with the option to grow! Benefits and Retirement are excellent. Bonuses are also given.
good,"While working for Publix, I can honestly say that I rarely had a ""bad"" day at work. The best days were when the lines were backed up down the isle. At that point, I was motivated to take care of all my customers and keeping that happy even though the lines were long. My co-workers eventually became family because we would invite each other to events that we were having. If I was sick, one person would buy me tea and the other person would buy a box a tissue. My managers treated us with respectable authority. I love Publix."
good,A typical day at work is very fast pace. I interact with customers on a proffesional and sometimes personal level. The most enjoyable part is being there to see my customers walk away with a smile and well pleased
good,"I really enjoyed working at Publix. The people I worked with were awesome. The Management was great! And I really enjoyed doing the work there. It felt like family every time I was there. A typical day of work consisted of helping customers take their bags out bringing in carts, doing go backs, or sometimes sweeping and vacuuming. My co workers were amazing. The hardest part of the job was definitely go backs because u had to learn where everything was. The most enjoyable part of the job was to help the customers with there groceries and see there happy face when u helped them find something or helped them out."
good,"No day at work was typical. Yes, you came into work everyday knowing what you were required to do, but the customers made each day different and exciting. Some days all the incidences were positive and other days they were negative. It was never the same. Being at Publix 8 years I learned so many things. I was cross trained in several departments with customer service being the one I worked in my entire stay at the company. I learned how to work in fresh departments and how to be keep track of fresh inventory. I learned how to properly be responsible for all cash on hand and how to handle a diverse amount of customer issues/questions. In addition I had the privilege of learning the administrative side as well. I was trained and responsible for all associates payroll in my location as well as hiring new associates and making sure they were properly trained and all paperwork was done. My management team over the years has always been very helpful. Co-workers could make the day more enjoyable or a little more stressful, but at the end of the day I enjoyed the people I worked with. The hardest part of the job was dealing with people who were stealing and scamming the company. It was draining at times. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that I was coming to work everyday to do something that I loved and was passionate about."
good,"At Publix  management, customer service, cleanliness, taking care of associates all seemed their number one priority. Great pay, benefits, and incentives."
good,"A typical day entails a great deal of interaction with associates, suppliers, and customers. Checking over the details in each department is a must, the focus is on premier quality, value, and service. My favorite aspect of managing people is watching them grow in their job and achieve success. The hardest part of the job is the typical retail difficulty, holidays are very long hours and time away from the family. My family has dealt with the inconvenience quite well over the years, an we always make the most of our time together. I have worked with some of the finest people in any organization, and I always try to take their lessons with me wherever I go, respect a person's dignity, make sure they are properly trained, do everything that you can to ensure an associate is set up for success."
good,"Publix really knows how to take care of their employees. Focus is primarily on customer service and employee well being. Loved working here, love to shop here, love to save here!"
good,I had worked at Publix before in Highschool so I knew pretty much how things ran. I had moved to Jacksonville FL in 2002  and needed a Job. So I applied for a job as a Dairy Stock clerk. And it did find as a part-time as I looked for full-time work. I had no problems with the store Managament. It was a great company to work for etc.
good,i happy to have worked for such a good company. you meet different people and help people.
good,"Opened a new store location and assisted in recruiting and training new staff. Stocked and restocked inventory when shipments were received. Reorganized the sales floor to meet company demands. Directed and supervised employees engaged in sales, inventory-taking and reconciling cash receipts. Determined staff promotions and demotions, and terminated employees when necessary. Completed a series of training sessions to advance from Assistant Manager to Store Manager. Trained staff to deliver outstanding customer service."

good,"I was pleased with Publix supermarkets. The day always started very friendly, They train me in whatever I wanted in the supermarket weather it was meat cutting, baking, stocking merchandise and so forth. "
good,"Working as a stock clerk at Publix is a rewarding experience. The way it differs from other jobs is the job is constantly moving we are always on foot and never rest unless we are on break. We determine as the closing crew when we will get out. It all depends on how hard and well we can work as a team to accomplish all of the daily tasks. These tasks include setting up the store by detailing the store until it looks perfect. Filling milk, eggs, water, ice, detailing dairy and frozen. As stated above we can not leave until all of this is done. This means we must push ourselves 110% consistently. The co-workers i work with are like family, and that is the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"Great job security, management, and customer service foccus"
good,"enjoy working with everyone fun,easy when everyone doing there part,."
good,"I've never had a job that was better then this one, it was a very physical job so people would be extremly focused on their work and try to avoid as much problems as possible. The objective after safety is being a team player. I learned how to work a job that'll literally pushed your physical limit, we had to select items and put them on the back of our pallets. Not only were some of these items heavy but we would have to finish the order within a certain time.Starting pay was 12.90$ but the faster you finish an order the higher the pay. So you could imagine some of the people who had been working there for awhile had the little tricks and shortcuts downpack, so some will be getting 25.00$ and up an hour. Pay was good, management was awesome, they really lived up to making it a comfortable work environment."
good,"great people. good opportunities, nice chances to advance"
good,"A typical work day at Publix to me is understated, while it had trying times, I enjoyed my job very much, I was unconditionally devoted to living up with their mission statement. Providing premier customer service to the people and to my associates."

The management is very good, the co-workers and yourself make great team, you learn from them and them learn from you.

The most enjoyable part of the job can be prepare plattes for customers, serving them, and know that they are enjoying you did!!"

These facts combined with the fact that corporate stock can only be accessed by employees makes Publix a great place to start a career. The only question is, can you live off the wages starting as a part time worker? Most cannot. All employees start as entry level part time employees. No one starts at a full-time position (possibly except certified Pharmacists as they work 12 hour days except on Sundays), or in a management position so you have to work hard to be promoted."

good,"A typical day at work as a stock clerk at Publix includes arriving at work and ensuring shelves are stocked to ensure an easy and enjoyable shopping environment for the customers. At Publix, I learned how to problem solve on the fly and how to better work together with my co-workers to help solve problems for customers and help find products that they're having trouble locating. Management has an open door policy and helps answer questions or concerns of employees. They also come out on the floor to help assist customers or if employees have questions about a product. The workplace culture is the strongest I've seen from any of the jobs I've been employed at. Management puts employees in a position to succeed by being friendly and helpful and establishing a teamwork dynamic that encourages employees to go in to their job every day with a positive attitude ready to work together and assist customers to provide an enjoyable and memorable shopping experience. The hardest part of the job was learning and remembering where each item in the store was located in order to provide premier customer service to all customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was the co-workers and management having a team first mindset and being ready to come in to work every day to solve any problems presented and any tasks required. The satisfaction gained from helping a customer with a problem they had and seeing the smile and relief on their face was one of the most enjoyable parts of the job and what makes Publix such a great company."

The benefits are amazing for part time. for part time you still get dental, and vision as well as a 401K. there are student compensations as well as free employee only owned stock that is given every 3 months for free from the company. typical day depends on what shift you are given. you can give your availability but you are not allowed to change it for 6 months. learned great customer service and how to have a work/life balance. you go to work, you come home and you don't worry about work. you work hard, do what you're supposed to. it's not difficult, but it's still fulfilling and keeps you busy. workplace culture is fantastic. everyone just wants to keep everyone happy and give good customer service. everyone loves working there. even on a bad day for someone-there's also still a general good and bright vibe about the place. the best part of the job are your coworkers and management. they truly make it an amazing place to work. they really care about you. they also know, that because of employee only owned stock, employees own the company. therefore, because employees are owners, they want publix to succeed. so everyone feels they own"

Publix became my family and it will always be apart of my life. The jobs can be relaxing sometimes when it’s not too busy but also stressful when it is busy.

Being able to do things on my own and just being productive. Highly recommend."

With so many up and coming managers rising up to take on new leadership roles for the company, Publix has been a flourishing company who caters to the customers needs as well as the employees."
good,"I worked by myself most of the time"
good,"I started working for Publix at the Decatur store in 2010. I was fortunate enough to learn and work in every single department of the store, including pharmacy technician. In 2012 I was transferred to the Madison store where I planned and facilitated the new store opening for Florence, AL. I coordinated the orientation for all the new hires and ordered proper uniforms for all of them. I prepared and ran payroll for multiple stores while all the new associates were training at different stores. My favorite part of being the administrative coordinator was meeting all the new associates. During my time at the Florence store I worked in the cash office where I handled bank deposits, money orders, and Western Union transactions. I was commended and awarded on numerous occasions for exemplary customer service skills. The main reason I left is because they took away the administrative coordinator at each store and delegated my responsibilities to other managers and associates so I had to work crazy retail hours again. Overall, this was an amazing place to work."
good,"I love working at Publix, but I am not getting the hours that I need. Publix has worked with me through my school schedule and now that I have graduated, I need something that is more permanent."

good,"I love this company, and would recommend it to anyone. they love their customers and the treat their workers fairly. they always nmake sure that the put their best foot forward, it is always a loving environment"
good,"The mission of Publix focusing on premier customer service is evident not only through the eyes of the public, but is also apparent within the company as an employee. There is a gentle reminder that the customer comes first which when combined with a willing employee turns out a respected company. But while customers do come first, the employee is not overlooked. The benefits include a private stock, retirement plans, and others such as a 401k along with great career advancement inside the company. Outside of material benefits, you receive a work experience that you won't find in other stores of such a large scale. The aforementioned focus on customers first allows an employee to offer the best customer service possible and to carry out this mission even when not working. The management is also firm but fair, perhaps some of the best that has been seen. There is a reason that Publix has been ranked in top companies by magazines and nationally recognized as one of the top places to work. It is deserved praise. If you are looking for a job, Publix may just be the place for you. I am thankful for the opportunity to have worked for such a great company"
good,Publix was my first job and I was nervous to be working with customers that I didn't have prior experience with because I am a relatively shy person when meeting someone new. It was hard for me to adjust but I was given a lot of support and time to become more comfortable with my role and though I did not grow into a model employee I learned a lot about myself. Working at Publix is truly what you make it and you get out of it what you put in. I was in a place in my life where I wasn't striving to be the best I could be and that showed. Through all of this I was encouraged to grow and spoken to respectfully and earnestly by my manager. When I left Publix to pursue higher education I knew customer service wasn't a fit for me but not due to being scared away but due to the fact that I didn't find much value in what i was doing and I don't like talking to strangers. I'm thankful for my time there and the lessons that I will take with me.

good,"Stressful but good people, good atmosphere, and quick-pace makes the day go by faster. Overall, good place to work but hours are not as flexible as I needed at the time being a high school student."
good,best thing about this job would be the pay.more of a by yourself job. Get paid based on how you work.competitive pay than other job. The management could be better though.

good,"i loved working at Publix, cooking and teaching customers how to prepare certain food.  Traveling to the different stores to train and teach employees."
good,"Publix is the best company anyone could ever work for, they have the best customer service and make EVERY customer and employee feel important so i'd recommend them to anyone."
good,"The job itself was a decent one, considering I started before entering high school it was certainly the best option available. That said, the policy of moving problem managers into stores that were doing well meant by a combination of bad luck and the well done nature of the store I worked at we often were punished by having rather lackluster managers, who due to internal company policy could not be let go without a very solid reason. Since almost every manager for a new store must be a transfer, once a store is considered stable, it becomes the place the problem managers go, and led to some serious problems. In terms of the work itself, it is generally straightforward and modestly rewarding, with a solid pay scale and clear regulations for pay raises. A typical day in my role was greeting customers, bagging items, retrieving carts and a few cases of helping find stock or helping infirm customers shop, with each of those roles all falling under the purview of myself and several others at a time so all were done at once."
good,A great place for young people to work. good chance for them to advance in their job choice there. Stock ownership is available. Good management. you are offered health and other insurence. meet good and interesting customers.

They have great benefits and career advancement is good, but you do have to work for it.  It's the kind of job you would want your kids and grand children to have as their first job."
good,"Publix offers a wide range of job opportunities and advancements within the company.  For a part time grocery replenishment specialist, one should expect to come to work ready to work with tasks such as: unloading and reloading trucks, maintaining product inventory, rotating product, leveling product on shelves (pulling it forward), greeting and assisting customers, maintaining a safe work environment for yourself and others, working back stock of product from previous trucks, creating and making signs/tags/etc for displays, shelves, and baskets. The workplace itself can be stressful at times, especially if it’s busy, but overall can be fun work environment where you’ll meet a wide variety of people and can work within your schedule. Work schedules can be relatively flexible and you’ll always have the 3 major holidays off work. (Easter, Thanksgiving, and Christmas…close early on New Years Eve and Christmas Eve). The job itself does not require prior experience/education; they have the tools and materials to help train you for any position possible. This particular position is more of an independent based job and yet you will work collectively with your peers within the department for a teamwork based environment. You will learn the ropes of the company and all that it entails, eligible for pay raises every 6 months, and overall, continue to build upon your resume and yourself."

The job itself is demanding with many challenges however if you are open to learn from your peers and work well with others you'll be able to accomplish a lot in a short period of time. The management does a wonderful job to keep the workplace as efficient as possible, they encourage you to work well and if there's anything that comes up they'll communicate with you until it is resolved. I enjoyed working at publix and would recommend the job to anyone looking."
good,"A day in the life of a grocery stock clerk is never the same as the day before. Each store has a specified day of the week in which a delivery and/or reloading truck stops by. I unload the products and place them in our storage space carefully, then break down each pallet accordingly to which products belong to certain aisles. I have the responsibility of stocking products meticulously to ensure that each aisle is appealing to the customers. After, I efficiently organize remaining left-over products to be worked again at some later point in the week. I have obtained a friendly, professional relationship with my direct supervisor and colleagues. Additionally, I am very satisfied with the management skills. Every manager and associate must promote Publix's workplace culture of providing premier customer service. The hardest part of the job is maintaining the high organizational quality of our storage space. The most enjoyable part of the job is the autonomy of being a grocery stock clerk and the identity of my work. Setting up displays, RPM's, side wings, etc., allows me to actually visualize my work, which creates a sense of achievement and satisfaction."
good,"As a produce clerk, My job was to take care of our customers, and go beyond my limits to satisfy there needs. I helped ensure they received the best quality produce.

Atmosphere was friendly, and the management did above and beyond for their employees. "
good,Publix was a great company to work for. It had a great environment for its employees to be comfortable and made it fairly easy to complete our jobs for the day.
good,"At Publix we have everyday interactions with customers/ patients to engage and create a friendly shopping environment. I've also learned how to successfully solve problems on the job and management is always willing to help with any questions you may have or even help you to advance in the company. The culture at Publix is one that promotes a healthy work place and home life balance. The hardest part of the job is interacting with 3rd party billing companies, but that is also very rewarding when we are able to solve issues by interacting with them. And finally the most enjoyable part of the job is creating relationships with the customers/patients."
good,Publix has ups and downs just like any other job you work for. You get paid fair and you get benefits to match that pay as a full time employee.

During my two and half years working there I learned how to handle the easiest and most difficult customers. I dealt with a lot of money and new computer systems, as well as giving off great customer service. The hardest part of the job was honestly being on your feet all day. Being a cashier you have no luxury to sit down unless on your lunch break and I took full advantage to it. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with."

good,"An assistant department manager usually works different stores within the district to develop many working relationships, to learn under different managers, and to learn different customer demographics.  A manger was referred to as a great leader.  A manager was constantly learning about new products, procedures, and policies and then training the associates.  A deli professional informed the customers about the products we sold and about additional products in other departments that would go together to make a great meal.  The most challenging part of the job was the associate call-outs.  The call-outs were a challenging problem almost daily, but we overcame them every time."

good,"A typical day at work would be insuring customer service, making sure all the customers needs are satisfied. What I learned at Publix, is that if the customer leaves with a smile on their face that is the most important part of my day. Management is unpredictable, every person is different, none are the same. The hardest part of the job is listening to the customer complaints but if you do not resolve the issue then your job is not finished. The most enjoyable part of the job is making sure that people are happy, that all their needs are meant, and making sure I go above and beyond for each and every customer."

good,"I haven't worked many retail jobs, but I had a very good experience with Publix. It's very straightforward work with friendly and happy people. It's very easy to climb the ladder, they promote from within so there are always positions available (as long as you check the boxes). The pay and benefits are very honest and good, and they take the time to explain them to you. The only thing I did not enjoy about Publix are the retail hours, if you want to move up you need full availability and your schedule changes week to week. I like regular hours and a consistent schedule. Also, as you climb the ladder they put you in different stores in the area ex: Customer Service Assistant Manager gets promoted to CS Manager but must rotate to the store 25 minutes around the corner. Overall, it's a great company and I enjoyed my experience working there."

good,"I was in a fairly slow location from what I heard but I was always busy doing something. That being said, I had the best coworkers, the best customers (mostly elderly) and I genuinely enjoyed what I did. I never felt belittled or underappreciated. I felt like what I was doing had a good impact on the community. The typical day at Publix mainly included customer service and cleaning. I bagged groceries, talked to my customers, helped them to the car, helped put away groceries into their cars, brought carts back in, cleaned bathrooms, rugs, and trash, and I also helped in every other department in the store. I learned that hard work can be rewarding and that when you are known for good service, sometimes the customers are easier to interact with. The hardest part of the job was probably collecting heavy rugs to vacuum outside, but it wasn't that bad. Most enjoyable part was seeing people respond positively to the service."

I learned from the beginning that customers were the most vital part of a successful corporation...."
good,This was a fun friendly job with awesome superiors. Would work for them if they were in Toledo! Always had your back when you need something. If you ever need more training on something you don't have to be worried about it because they drill it into you and it doesn't take long for it to stick with there training.

I learned how to read shares, how to separate the mail accordingly to certain departments is very tedious, I learned how to read the Epi cards, I learned how to read and look up certain files and labels. The work environment is multi-cultured and the most enjoyable part of the day is actually learning how to work for different departments and how vital is  everyone's role in the different departments. The hardest part of the day is trying to take in so much in so little time about the labeling, the separating, knowing how to read which departments (files, shares, mail, certificates, checks, etc...) these items belong to. The most enjoyable part is probably lunch time and special occasions when everyone partakes and bring different cultured food."

The workplace culture at Publix is very diverse and full of highly productive employees.

good,You can't beat the pay scale and flexibility of hours that you receive with this company. I know several people who worked part time while finishing school and by the time they graduated they never used that degree because they stayed on with Publix and worked their way up to management.
good,Publix is by far the best company I have ever worked for. Being employee owned makes a world of difference in the way the company is run. We are a family and we look out for each other.

Learning how to keep a clean working environment for employees and a clean shopping environment for customers.

The hardest part of the job was the customers that had complaints. But, we were taught to do everything with a smile on our face because Publix is solely focused on premier customer service.

They're very well known to treat and to grant customers first at any occasion during working hours. But generally , it can get very demanding do to the overload of merchandise and customers that the store generates everyday its only part time so some weeks you may only have one day on schedule. It is hard to get in the management program. Very hard to become a full time employee no matter how long you been there and or how good or bad work ethnics are."

good,A typical day at work consists of taking care of all customers and making sure that their needs are being met with the service we provide. What I have learned at Publix is that it's the people that work there that make Publix such an experience. My co-workers are more like family than co-workers. that bond we share allowed us to get things done and not only meet expectations but exceeding them. The hardest part of the job is being used to our managers way of doing things and having to quickly adapt to a new way of doing things. The most enjoyable part of this company is meeting new people from almost all over the place.
good,"I worked for Publix Supermarkets since I was just fourteen years old until twenty-three. That being said I grew and learned as I climbed the ladder in the cooperation. On an average day I would multitask customers needs along with supervising all cashiers and baggers without an issue. Customers that I would deal with myself would be those that needed such transactions as money orders, western union sends and receives, gift cards, as well as nightly banking of the entire store. Meaning balancing all the registers and money in the store while setting up for the new day and sending the rest to the bank. Working for Publix allowed me to work with a melting-pot of different personalities as well as customers which definitely has been a huge benefit in any job past or present."

As a store manager, every part of your job is hard, but if you enjoy what you are doing it makes it all seem easier. Getting to know all the customers that came into the store each day was a treat when you can call them by name and ask about their family or their interest.

I made some great friends with coworkers and had fun working their, everyone was very nice. ive always wanted to work in the bakery but when asked they never got back with me to position there. although I'm greatful for the acquired skills I learned. they have yet to promote me to bakery which I longed for so Iost my passion to work at Publix and decided it was my time to resign and pursue my dreams elsewhere."

I enjoyed working with the customers the most and hearing their stories. Learning how they like their meats and cheese slice and making the subs exactly how they want it.
good,Part time at Publix has its up and down. I work for them 3 years now and I make full time hours but I'm not full time. Publix take awhile before they make any one full time.. but I do have health insurance and dental and vision

I team up with my coworkers to complete tasks and delegate what each of us will do that day/night.

The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that I am working together with others to make sure that tasks are completed above and beyond other standards.

Management was ALWAYS very encouraging! They encourage and empower you to move up with the company and promote being a lifetime family! The hardest part of the job was the competition for advancement. Everyone that is hired has so much intelligence, kindness, determination and passion for the job! It's just hard to choose!

It really can turn a persons day around!"

When my manager asks me to do something for them, they always ask nicely and say please and thank you. There really isn't anything hard to do unless you work in Customer Service.

good,"Publix is a great place to work because company policy nearly guarantees that the customers will leave happy, which makes working in customer service a pleasurable experience. The work environment is always left clean so the cleaning procedures to not build-up into a mess, this also makes it a pleasant place to work. The management, and job classes are broken up in a way that makes everyday run smoothly, even if we are unexpectedly slammed busy. The job classes also provide great ranking so that there is room to promote. It is difficult to get full-time because they only choose the best, which makes it a pleasant place to work as well because you do not run into a whole lot of lazy workers or bad attitudes, since only the best are chosen to work often."

good,"The company is excellent, but stores vary. Management makes or breaks the store. The pay is good for retail, the benefits are good if you're full time. Advancement is all political, and not nearly as concerned with work ethic or productivity as it should be. Good place to start, but very difficult to grow."

However, there have been one or two instances in which some managers were not very productive or eager. The hardest part of my job at first was learning all the aspects of the back office. The training was only 3 days (very fast) and it took me about 2 weeks to get everything down packed, However, this was also the most enjoyable part of my job as I had grown to love working in the back office and all of the responsibilities that came along with it.

I am also a cashier, and while in that position I interact with customers and offer the best customer service I can. I am capable of managing my time wisely and making sure that all tasks are completed in a timely fashion. I have learned patience and communication skills, along with money accountability. While managing the front end of the store, I am in charge of the employee's break times and positions. I work very well with my coworkers and would classify myself as a team player. The hardest part of the job would be being in charge of my coworker's schedules because there are times when employees may call out, therefore backing up the schedule and making us short staffed. When this happens, it is my job to find another employee to cover for the previous one. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the public and continuing to gain customer serve skills which always come in handy."

Also to keep the customers happy and informed and to keep the store clean at the end of the day. I learned how to talk to people and how to manage my responsibilities to get everything done on time. The co workers were around my age so it was easy making friends. The hardest part was when the truck came in full because then we had more work on our hands. The most enjoyable was that everyone would help each other out and we would always get out on time."

The management strives to see the employees advance. I passed test to be on a finalist list for management, but later decided to continue as a full time decorator. The enjoyment I received seeing customers love the product I produced was enough. I think the toughest part for most employees was being able to keep up with production, but once you learn it all. your speed increases within time."

I've learned to help people out in need, and gained the knowledge of how the company works along with the medical scene from the Pharmacy. Going into work puts a smile on my face, because I get to interact with our great customers that we value as a company, and offer great customer service. A day working at Publix is not a dread, instead, it makes the day go by quickly. At Publix, we are a team as a store, and as a company. There are managers and associates that will be there for you, if it's personal or something work related. We even have support with our team in the corporate scene. The hardest part of my job is there are so many actions and things that could be done to help out everyone, every single time, that it seems difficult to be able to offer my service. Luckily, we have other associates that have the same mindset and can assist in keeping our customers and patients happy. Receiving compliments would definitely be the most enjoyable part of my job.

I oversee all customer relations, financial services, and associate performance. My managers and I work as a team to ensure the best experience for customer and associates.

Benefits and opportunities for advancement expands the longer you stay with the company.  After three years of working I have medical, dental, vision, and stock in the company.  My coworkers and managerial staff are exceptional, understanding, and willing to help at the drop of a hat.  I couldn't praise this company more."
good,"Publix is a great place to work. Employees and managers alike are polite, respectful and provide excellent customer service. I learned that our customers come first always. The hardest part of the job was remembering all the different meats and cheese in the deli but labeling made it possible to locate them. The most enjoyable part of the job is the love that is shared among coworkers that transcends into a perfect sub/sandwich, fried chicken, or salads.. More than all seeing the same people coming daily confirms that we extend excellent customer service. additionally, there are the newbies whose faces express delight, and satisfaction of the environment and the service they receive."

You had all the benefits of a Publix employee yet you did convenience store work such as print lottery, clean fuel pumps, make publix subs for customers. The hardest part of the job at times was getting a promotion because it seemed as if there were waiting lists for promotions.

good,"Great business always trying to achieve more"
good,"Each day was different, sometimes I was in the Customer Service desk where I would handle customer complaints, refunds, sell them lotto, money orders and western unions. Other days I would be out on the floor either cashiering or bagging, as a cashier I would stand at the front of my register and greet customers as they would walk by and ask them if they were ready to check out. I would also scan their groceries, handle cash, check or credit cards depending on how they were paying and sometimes help the bagger bag up their groceries. As a bagger I would go to a register, help bag up a customer's groceries and then take them outside and put their groceries into their car. Customer service is a very big part of this company and it is what keeps the customers coming back, it was the big focus for this company and something that the managers pushed on a daily basis. The managers wanted everyone to do well and would encourage people to move up and if they wanted to they would help with this task by giving them advice and helping them fix anything they need to work on so they can move forward. The hardest part of my day would be when I have to deal with an angry customer, it was difficult at times, but I would just handle them as they come and do my best to please them. I adored my co-workers they were my second family and I still keep in touch with most of them today. It is one of my favorite things about Publix, they were my second family."
good,"A normal day at Publix is getting say good morning to your coworkers ask where I can help, start with my work, do get to your manager and say good morning, start serving customers which is my favorite part of this work, then take a small break and then continue to work until it's time to exit."

I will say tho there were other personal reason for leaving that had nothing to do with Publixs.
good,"Publix is a awesome place to work for. I work as a warehouse person, I am responsible for keeping the facility clean and loading pallets in trailers. I enjoy what I do and content with the management team and culture at Publix.

The management there is so understanding and will do just about anything to benefit their associates and customers.

And now for the last 3 years, I had cut fruit all day long. Making such items as watermelon quarters, wedges, and watermelon eights Publix is great because the amount of training is excellant, I have learned so much about different fruit salads, etc. And the best thing about Publix is the 'Family Attitude', and believe me, it is 'Genuine' And we also have a motto, 'TEAM', Together Everyone Achieves More'.

good,"Publix is a great company to work for, it is a very customer friendly establishment. You get to meet so many people on a day to day basis. My typical work day is at the customer service counter where I answer the phone and answer any questions that customers or employees may have. I have learned great customer service skills by dealing with customer compliments and also customer complaints. Management is very flexible with your schedule if you are trying to go to school or if you have kids they are move than happy to work out a schedule with you. I would say the hardest part of my job is dealing with the returns since it`s Publix our main focus is providing premiere customer service and sometimes we have to deal with customers who try to take advantage of that and steal our products and try to return them for cash. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to meet all the customers and getting to know them so when I see them outside of work I know that I made a personal connection with them."

As a cashier, it is my duty to help customers complete their shopping experience with a smile. I help unload carts onto the register, proceed to check them out, help with the bagging of groceries, and help send them on their merry way. I think the most enjoyable part of the job is the customer service. Getting to meet and serve so many new people on almost a daily basis is extremely satisfying.

Once the stories open I assist customers by helping them  locate products.  I work closely with the Back Door Receiver by helping the check in vendors, or putting out product. The only challenge is being able to manage all of the different task that I am asked to do but if I plan in advance and stick closely to that list I get them done with no time to spare.

It's nice to have the customer smiling, enjoying their time in this short period of time. On paper a cashier's job may seem boring and straight forward. Things change when you put it into action at Publix. Their main focus is customer service and i like these 1-5 minute conversations. You begin to notice regulars whom you may form a close bond and go by first name or even a nickname basis. You will of course get customers who are just having bad days and treat you with silence. But this is OK, it's only 1-5 minutes and now you will forget it ever happened. Take the job as it is, you can make it enjoyable"

good,"unloading trucks with items to be sold in store. stocking can goods, dairy, frozen food , working in the deli being able to cook. make sure produce is fresh. you can do any thing you put your mind to it. the managers care about you more than anything. i learned a happy employee will do more for you (when it comes to work) when you treat them with respect. honor your work , a thank you and how you doing goes a long way when dealing with people. not being able to help a customer. that is the hardest of the job. when you can't help customers it seems as if you have let the company down.(i know that is not true but you feel that way. taking pride in your job and to know you gave your all. i do that on every job. working in fla you got a chance to make over time because of the hurricanes. i just like to work for mines. i wish i could work there once again."
