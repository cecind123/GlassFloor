rating,review
bad,my department is horrible. supervisor is not a leader. Company is growing super fast and they dont have control over the operations. I feel discrimination against woman and foreign employees
bad,"There management is a joke, they are so unorganized, their safety practices are even a bigger joke. Employees that have been hurt on the job have been fired even if they were unaware of the danger they were put in. The safety meeting you go to are just so they can say you went through it, they don’t practice it. They always blame the injured and they never take responsibility for there mistakes."
bad,I wouldn’t recommend no1 to work their  Dey don’t care about personal reasons n personal days u need off dey treat asf if u are a slave a management sucks
bad,"Everyone there is married to each other, related to each other and grouped off to all outsiders. Upper management is unreasonable and treat regular associates as disposable items."
bad,"typical work, must be experienced, limited training provided, management unavailable, limited work due to weather conditions, must be fully aware of safe work practices"
bad,"The job was by far the worst job that I had experienced in my life.  The manager who hired lied to me from the beginning about what I was going to be doing for the company.  They told me about career advancement that never happened, and also was held against me for asking after being there and learning the job."
bad,"Primoris Hiring and Training  Office in Geismar Louisiana is by far the worst office environment I have ever worked in. The manager on my second day told me she didn’t want to hire me, therefore she did everything she could to make me unsuccessful at this job. The office was a bully culture environment. I would only recommend this job if you’re a person of non-color.  They very much let me know on a daily basis, I was unwanted there and I do not belong."
bad,"After nearly 2 years of working for this company I went form an operator to a pickup helping to manage my crew. when I ask about official promotion and pay raise I was told ""we have more important things to worry about than your pay rise."" BTW this is after I found out the operator they hired to replace me so I can stay in the pickup was making more money than me."
bad,If you want to work for a compa ny that will expect you to perform at a high standard and only compensate you with newbie wages then this is the company for you.. They will tell you all kinds of good things and promise promotions only to cut you loose on there terms. Will promise the  moon but only give the salt
bad,Been here over 5 years loved the company when it was willbros but they got bought out by primoris and the culture has toldly change no more family atmosphere
bad,"It was very difficult to work there.The rate of organizational change is overwhelming. I'm on my clueless management. The one who hired me was simply excellent, and was one of the best bosses I ever had. Sadly, the last three were among the bottom 10% of all my bosses. Management does not respond to phone calls or emails, and no one is able to schedule meetings with him on a timely basis."
bad,As a previuos poster stated.  Upper management is only concerned about their “buddies”.   They can’t control their tempers and yell at you like a kid or a dog.  Would never work for them again!
bad,"Applied to be a field mechanic, interviewed to be a field mechanic. Was told I’d have to work in the shop for only a “couple” months. Ended up stuck in the shop, driving 150 a day in my personal truck, spending $500/month in gas. Told them the commute was too much for me and asked about transferring closer to my home if they weren’t going to do what we originally agreed on. Their answer was I’m better off looking for another job."
bad,"P.S.C had and still has very poor management due to the ""buddy system"". They only care about people they've previously worked with at other companies and really don't have a good grasp on the actual responsibilities of the job itself."
bad,"I travel frequently around the state of Texas, I have not learned anything to promote myself from this company. I do safety audits, and give training weekly."
bad,"is a good company for hourly people, but not for salary even with your 5,000.00 bonus I could not match my salary with my carpenters, we use to work between 55 to 75 hrs a week, and salary people do not get pay overtime. we work like that for about to years, always with the promise you are going to benefited when you get your bonuses."
bad,Can't think of any thing to give my opinion on  nothing to say either way.  Did not work there long enough to notice. It was different going from a privet company to a public.
bad,"High energy, dynamic project work. Learned a lot about what corners can and cannot be cut when doing an EPC project. Made great friends but not ideal for career development."
bad,Not always work or be fired guys have fun out there. I learned alot from the experienced guys out there just moved on because of the money. Found a better job
bad,I wanted to work with this bunch for years I thought I could retire here but upper management blames the little people for there mistakes and uses them for escape goats
good,"Not really a place to advance at what you get hired on at is what your pretty much stuck with . The safety is subpar , and you don’t get to work much during rainy seasons . Compared to other contractors the eating arrangements during lunch is pitiful , it is poorly done . The labors they hire are really unknowledgeable of what’s really going on and they are Lazy, if you aren’t friends with someone of the company or have family inside it your pretty much screwed."
good,pSC wasn't horrible they kept us buissy  and  over all wantt too bad to work for except some times your forman would cusss you and treat you like you was an involent
good,"The company lays off in a heart beat, very difficult and shady management when I worked there. Nothing good last forever, I felt like I was at a prison there. Constantly being under pressure of finishing the job"
good,"The pay wasn't compatible with my previous pay rate, after being promised a raise after 90 days.  It never came and the company kept on adding more duties.  I do not mind long hours and hard work.  I don't like being told one thing and it never happening.  I did enjoy my co-wokres and the actaul work"
good,"Fast paced work enviroment with little down time and little pay."
good,"Poor management"
good,"On a daily basis it was fun because i love to operate, but management was sometimes not on the same page, and that miscommunication would reflect in the jobs being done by the operators.  We were in the process of building a plant, so there was no time to talk except at lunch.  Overall it was a good learning experience."
good,Started my day loading  safety devices in truck for various jobs. I had to be the first one there and last one to leave. set devices early in the morning for gas and electric companies. tear down was job was completed
good,"This was my first construction job and I must say they have me considering a career change. The wages are low compared to other construction companies. the communication from the top down is horrible. I have never seen so much nepotism and favoritism on a job before in my life. I think it would not be a bad company for someone new to the industry but for someone with experience, I would recommend going to another company."
good,"The work is never-ending, and the pace is grueling.  Training is non-existent and the office culture is insular.  If you don't quickly join up with a clique you're done for.  If you are male and an accountant be prepared to be discriminated against, as the office is overwhelmingly female.  Turnover is high and the workload is staggering."
good,"Typical Day - is a typical day, most people work well together"
good,"Se preocupan por la seguridad de los trabajadores, un salario bastante asequible."
good,"The work culture at primoris is a bit of the good old boy network and a person who is striving to gain knowledge and advance within the company, can not do so on merit alone."
good,"Daily duties were normal.  Management was great to work with, we had a great team.   I was with Willbros for 16 years.  Hurricanes and other reasons Willbros was sold to Primoris from Dallas.  We were in a building with 5 floors with over 200 employees.  Because Primoris has a corporate office in Dallas they no longer needed us and were were all laid off."
good,Go to work everyday ready to work.  There will be some nasty weather sometimes but the pay motivates you to keep working. Cherish family because you will miss them on the road.
good,I would recommend working at primoris. It was a good working environment. I think they put a real focus on safety at the job site.I really liked the QC department.
good,Safety Meeting every morning before you start your job. Learned to build conduits & forms. Management was decent. The workplace culture was very diverse. Hardest part about the job getting to shelter if it started lightning and raining. Enjoyable part was lunch break.
good,I enjoy most of the time I spent with the company. I feel the on site management could have had more reinforcement and backup from offsite management in dealing with unreasonable client demands.
good,Reading and putting together iso.(prints). Carbon. Stainless. Chrome.  From socket welds up to 50 something inch pipe. Some days weld when I get to far ahead.
good,"Good place to work at good pay good hours and good management going on here , they have as many hours as you can take and usually have benefits as well"
good,"I liked my work at PSC, but i had to move to Tx. I got overtime all time and they never say somes excuses for not pay us.  The insurance is really good"
good,"Not the job for a family man, but that’s just the industry in general, but Primoris specifically.  They were pretty bad about last minute notification here. It was normal to get a call late in the day telling you that you were needed on a job the next morning that might be 6+ hours away."
good,"Superintendent did not want to furnish my fuel. No truck furnished  I furnish my truck and most of my fuel  , could not find a house to stay in, motel was to high to stay"
good,"Enjoyed working there.  Challenging, often had to ""wear multiple hats"". Good pay and benefits as long as you don't mind always being away from home and working on the road."
good,This was my first job and I’m now going on three years with them and I was able to learn new things with people that were willing to show you the right way to do it.
good,"A holding company that seeks to acquire companies on a regular basis.  Employees are dispersed across the US.  Services provided are diverse incorporating heavy civil construction, industrial construction and maintenance,  energy, underground and more providing insulation to economic fluctuations."
good,"I worked as a flagger. That is directing large equipment on a construction site. Taking sure the dump trucks are going to the right location on the site. Management was good people and would work with you if you needed off. Hardest part of job was working outside in the heat and the rain. The enjoyable part of job was the wages, $15 a hour."
good,Primoris paid really well and the same across the board for each job task. The company provided the necessary tools to do your job each day. I liked the fact that they were safety minded.  I had the opportunity to do several different jobs so I enjoyed learning new things. I was laid off but we were with a crew that was hired in under a second Superintendant so it made since that they lay us off first.
good,"Travel to where the work is...typically 10-12 hours/6 days a week.  Good pay, good team to work with.  Not a lot of direction from management. Sometimes this is a good thing, other times...not so much."
good,"Over all my experience at q3 was good . Enjoyed going to work every day and really liked how much I learned every day . I did not like how ever that once the tasks I learned were mastered , pay was not increased"
good,"Enjoyed being with coworkers, felt like a family.  No two days were the same.  There was an inviting atmosphere for applicants when they walked in the door."
good,"Good people to work with. They Guaranteed 40 hours, so that help me stay as long as i have even threw the really slow months here lately. That's the reason I'm looking now. 40 hours just does keep the bills where i like them to be."
good,"Although a bit cheap, Primoris is a very well managed company. Always pushing safety first, and doing best to keep moral high on the job. They have lived up to everything they have promised to help with the heat i.e. cooling stations and air conditioning in the lunch tent."
good,"Primoris services is a great company to work for. as a contractor there is little job security. "
good,"Didn't have a chance to work alot with this company but I'd love to work again... but over all a good company to work "
good,This company has a very positive atmosphere to work in.  There is always encouragement from upper management in your day to day activities.  I enjoyed working for my supervisor.
good,"The company is expanding, so there's lots of opportunity, but typical growing pains."
good,This company has high expectations for each employee but they take very good care of each individual and treat everyone with respect. They are very good about making sure you always have what you need to get the job done
good,Primoris is a well organized company.  It's like one big family.  Every employee is treated fairly and equally. There s room for advancement and a true open door policy.
good,great peers to be around. A strong willingness to give hours and work to be done. Understanding and often sympathetic management when personal issues arose.
good,"Met and worked with some great people. Learned a lot and experience more. My Superintendent was one that wanted and allowed you to have knowledge of different situations in Civil Carpentry, Equipment Operating, Concrete Finishing, etc..."
good,"If you have just certified in a craft, or have a desire to increase your certification there are people willing to teach you and opportunities to advance within a project. Turn-arounds are fast-paced with each day bringing in a new application of needed skills. Many of the supervisors are old hands from the James Construction days, and are very experienced craftsmen as well as crew supervisors.  This is not a double-time company, but it is a good company to work for. If you volunteer for the occasional overtime, you will be recognized and rewarded by being moved to active crews as each phase of completion occurs, rather than being laid-off with that phase."
good,"Only a couple of drawbacks in my opinion. When job is through you may not hear anything on the next job for several months. The equipment is open cab so operators are exposed to the weather. Your either cold, hot and always dirty because of all the dust ( especially in the part of west texas i was in). Overall most of the management was very good. Couple of the supers job title went to their head"
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was the crew members. These folks were a diverse group from all walks of live and different parts of the country. They made my days go by Quickly !
good,"This is a nice enough place to work, but sometimes the communication patterns are a little concerning. During my time here the management of the IT department has been good, but there have been some communication issues that recur periodically."
good,"My job at PSC was a fast paced job with multiple opportunities to learn and excel."
good,Working at Primoris can be real physical work. You always have to be in shape. Always keep water to stay dehydrated. Respect others and always give a helping hand to you crew.
good,"I’ve enjoyed my job with Primoris, it has been a great place too work for. Primoris management has allowed me too move further ahead in the natural gas industry, everything I have ever wanted too learn and get experience in they have backed me the whole way. Great company to work for"
good,good place to work good supervisors and safety managers.  i received excellent care and service from my superiors concerning my medical problem i was experiencing while working there and they were very understanding when i had to resign my position
good,its construction work... with good pay and not a bad company to work for all and all.. worked 6 to 7 days a week ... But on this location is was real easy because it was not your normal pipefitting.. I would have to say that given the right crew it makes any job worthwhile
good,"Fast work, if you can’t move fast not the place for you, if you can’t do heat or cold weather not for you because you will working outside. Always work everyone need electricity. Bad the rainouts if it rains no work"
good,PCS was a relaxed environment to work as far as being a new employee. Fast pace always busy. Safety is there top priority. The pay was great and job advancement was available. Classes to advance within the company are available. PCS has great Health Benifits for employees and there families.
good,"The most enjoyable part of my position was when the employees not only understood safety, but used their safety knowledge while performing the assigned tasks. The work culture was good at times, but always in need of attention. Management supported the safety department. I thoroughly enjoyed my role as safety coordinator/ manager/ trainer."
good,Good people running job that kept safety  at the forefront of the job. Always made sure had what was needed to do the job safely and as efficiently as possible. Project managers and superintendent's were willing to do whatever it took to help complete tasks you were given. Always took the time to hear what person that was doing the work thought of the plan. Great place at Doswell site.
good,"everyday made safety meetting before go to start work,,, the company bring gits to the employees,, later we have another meetting with the crew, and talk about the job."
good,Getting to see all of my coworkers I had a great supervisor the hardest thing was get people to say good morning  at the end of day accident free day.
good,The day starts early with a safety meeting.  The leadership communicates and delegates efficiently.  Time and care is taken to make sure the job is started safely and completed safely.
good,"It was a construction job.Good pay and a. Good management team for electrical department.I enjoyed working for this company . I had worked for them before in Houston"
good,I worked in west texas but no time off or drive time to jobs you drive 20 hrs a week for free and everyday that you work gets longer after no days off for 60 or 80 days
good,"Small company atmosphere with many warm and friendly employees. I worked there four years, and would definitely recommend Onquest to anyone seeking employment. Located in San Dimas is the only drawback to working for Onquest."
good,I enjoy everyone I work with. Upper management takes care of they're employee's. Good company to work for. The Superintendents are reliable and courteous to they're workers.

good,"You are a contractor for Xcel.  The culture is great and your co-workers are fun.  If you are hired as a designer, you work on developing plans for electric and gas distribution. You can expect some field time for pre-construction meetings.  If you are hired as an Advocate, you should expect extensive field time and customer interaction as well as problem solving challenges and heavy screen time."
