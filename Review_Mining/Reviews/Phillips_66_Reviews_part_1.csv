rating,review
bad,"was a great Place to work, but when I had a family emergency back home in North Carolina I lost my Job for being gone to long when I kept her up to Date."
bad,"If you want to work a ton of hours and make good money doing it...become an operator. "
bad,Always short on my checks and never got reimbursement. Never received w2s or tax statements. Caught manager stealing cash multiple times. Work foreigners 80+ hours a week
bad,"As the years progressed the job and management decayed to the point that nobody could stand each other( management vs. hourly ) to the point that 99% of the workforce is retiring or getting out of that place at the earliest possible time,no matter the sacrifice.Sad situation indeed."
bad,Most people who were there honestly did not enjoy their day. The work is very redundant so it is a bit hard to enjoy the work day. It's mostly packaging and making sure the machines are doing their job.
bad,"My experience at Philip 66 helped me gain experience in public services but the overall experience was dissatisfying.  At typical day at work mainly consisted of handling two resisters at the same time while trying to assist customers in their purchases of our merchandise as well as alcohol and tobacco products.  My coworkers only helped with the day's work when it was convenient for them and were never disciplined in doing so.  Overtime, I began to notice that I stayed at a constant salary of 7.25 per hour without a raise and I never moved up from my position as a cashier.  Shortly thereafter, my manager began to give me somewhat of an unstable schedule.  Some work weeks consisted of my worked less than 17 hours in a week, and others consisted of a maximum 33 hours of work all while I was attending college when I specifically required a minimum of 20 hours and maximum 25 hours per work week.  In conclusion, my overall experience at at Philip 66 was relatively disappointing."
bad,The management says he hired for his convenience and doesn’t care if you have plans or not you work so he can have a life.  If someone doesn’t show you stay
bad,I would only suggest working for Phillips 66 if there were no other job opportunities available. The work environment at the store where I was employed was very unprofessional. There was also a lack of adequate pay for the duties performed. I felt very under appreciated.
bad,"a regular day at phillips 66 was a calllout or no show, we had to work constantly because we cared about our manager mike kelly who worked sometimes 85 hours a week for nothing, when the promoted an immature co worker to assistant manager was even worse.....she could barely understand english and couldnt understand the paper work so the store was a mess basically everyday."
bad,The owner did not provide a reasonable salary or a good work environment. Fellow employees stole from the store and the owner knew and continued to let it happen. He let the decent employees pick up the slack of the bad ones and treated his good employees poorly.
bad,I hated working in a gas station that allowed drunks to walk in and harass you of all hours of the night and also was very dirty and did not care about there employees
bad,"Fast paced environment many different racial backgrounds. Management never available. Pay was minimum. Only good thing was customer relationships that you would build and become friends."
bad,This job doesnt pay well overworks chemists doesnt hire them off contract for years and does not appreciate college graduates. This company has a strong union and chemists are not part of it you might pick up some wet chemistry experience if you need it.
bad,Manager was always talking about other employees behind there back. Loved to  gossip about everyone. Stood over my shoulder all day long.  Cooler was not organized at all
bad,The work isn't too challenge and the many different patrons keep the jobs interesting. You have to observant at all times.
bad,"Very disappointed in this company. Very low pay ( typical for salaried jobs). Many spies and backstabbers ( typical for salaried jobs ). Too many worms and suckasses. Regret accepting this job for the peanuts they offered. I had 5 jobs to choose from and made one of the BIGGEST mistakes of my life going to work for these worms."
bad,Get to work greeted by managers and coworkers. given the days tasks. prepare for work. Managers were attentive and direct. enjoyed working with coworkers. work was steady and demanding.
bad,"I was let go because, my manager found out that i was pregnant. I was told that he wouldn't have hired me if he knew that i was trying to start a family. He also told me that i should have used contraceptives..."
bad,"Typical day at Phillips was the same every day. Very small gas station, business was slow. I worked about 15-20 hours when I started, and was at 30+ when I had quit."
bad,"Never work for a company whose business isn't in order. They would schedule me at times I couldn't work or at inconviniant times they knew I would either be late for (coming from class) or schedule me really late knowing I had class in the morning. She would even schedule me friday nights and saturday afternoon knowing I'm a Sabbath keeper, I could have sued but it wasn't worth the extra. When I got there the manager hadn't even done her checkoff list so I would have my work to do plus theirs."
bad,this job is not very hard to do and it is a pretty laid back job but after a while its boring and no opportunity for a raise
bad,It was hard while cooking and being on the register running back and forth. But it is for fast paced people and in a ub beat enviorment just a little crazy with customers.
bad,As a hired contractor they treated you like less of a person. You were made aware of this on a daily basis. I was let go because I had medical issues at the time of my employment with them that caused me to frequent the facilities more than they liked. I was literally let go because I took 1 extra 5 minute break in a month. Unless you were a full time employee the culture was horrible.
bad,"I worked at Phillips 66 Wood River, IL refinery through the building trades. Phillips 66 would blame craft and contractors for their mismanagement and shortcomings during turnarounds. They also pushed really hard for our pay to be cut when making billions in profits. The department of labor voted it down but Phillips 66 would not let it rest and took it further (through building trades)to cut money we depend on to support our families. I would also like to add that a few of the craft voted for this and should be ashamed of themselves for allowing Phillips 66 to bully them and threaten them with other tactics."
bad,"You can feel accomplished and appreciated one day, then on the street the next. Lots of favorites to play here. Secret meetings in play. Some have zero accountability."
bad,"The work there was easy to do. The customers were moderately okay to deal with for the most part, however the managers there would steal from their own store and then blame it on you."
bad,"They dont care if you get breaks when working doubles or regular shifts, machinery isnt cleant well. Molding in the ice machinces, called owner and he still hasn't fixed it in 3 months. I personally wasnt comfortable with giving customers molded ice."
bad,Borger plant = Good buddy network if there ever was one . People promoted with no experience in the field they are promoted to . HR is a joke and only out to cut throats . Plant manager is an arrogant pompous man . Hourly as well as salary will stick a knife in the next employee with no hesitation at all . Pay and benefits are average  but the drama isnt worth it . For anyone with knowledge or experience looking for work ..... RUN AWAY !
bad,"be ready for corporate kissers and idiot desk jockeys telling you how to do your job."
bad,"I liked it until I was getting accused of stealing and I wasn't. I put in a lot of hours.I worked when people called in so the manager didn't have to."
bad,"If you are retired military or a new graduate this company has opportunities for you for a period of time. "
bad,"Phillips 66 was a really good company before it was bought out by TA, everything became very hectic and they had the managers doing the jobs that human resources was being paid to do so we found ourselves working over to do their job and hours."
bad,"If you do not care about doing your job, it's a perfect place for you. Management does not care about anything but self-advancement so problems are not addressed and only excuses are made for problems in order to not hurt feelings or upset anyone. It's a toxic work environment where you are constantly on edge because your boss will throw you right under the bus to cover their own mistakes, or go behind your back to discredit your work."
bad,Very difficult procedure for hiring. Very redundant and inane.
bad,"No collaboration of efforts and management purposely remains ambiguous and no  support.  Very disappointed in a promising, historically successful company’s performance."
bad,Working as an engineer at p66 felt roughly the same as swimming in place. Everything is so proceduralized that there is no engineering or thought that goes into anything and zero flexibility to unrealistic paperwork.
bad,Worked at the Santa Maria Refinery. The company failed to protect me from the racist policy of the local management that came on board in 2015. There are a lot of good people there who are not racist and I do miss working with them. I wish I had left in 2015.
bad,"Forget about policy and procedures at Phillips. If you are in the click you can sleep, bring alcohol to work and not do your job. Only certain people have to follow the rules the slackers get promoted to supervisors. What a shame for such a big company."
bad,My boss wouldn't let me send an email out without her approving it.  Bad vibe. The constant criticism is enough to make this hi paying job not worth I.
bad,"Typical day is be available 24/7"
bad,If you want any type of life at all don’t do it  . The pay is ok but the overtime because they are understaffed is outrageous. That’s where you make all the money. If you have kids and a wife you won’t see them. If you are single and don’t mind all the overtime then great do it. You’ll be able to play hard. Management is a bunch of engineering college grads that make stuff up to try and benefit their own progress. They come and go so often things are always changing out there. The moral is terrible. I used to be so much more positive and they stripped me of that. You have the opportunity to train on more jobs but that only screws you because the company will have the chance to stick you more on your days off. Last but not least they don’t fix anything out there properly so everything is breaking all the time. Maintenance says this refinery is the worst in the Bay Area.
bad,Management caused great division between union and non union employees. Very low morale of employees. Afraid to make a mistake or get fired. Lack of training for new hires. Management has no common sense and will not listen to experienced operators. Very dangerous place to work. Very old equipment. Lots of over time. 12 hour shifts 6:30 to 6:30. Upper management makes bad decisions. It's all about the might dollar and not employees lives. Employees are just numbers and family time suffers.
bad,"I cannot speak for other sites, but the Lake Charles Refinery has become a fairly toxic environment.  It used to be a great place to work.  That has changed drastically within the past 5 years.  Management is unresponsive to the employees' needs and suggestions.  It is strictly top down.  No input from anyone below supervisory level.  People who have their own personal agenda and are out only for themselves are common place in management now.  That was not previously the case.  Extremely stressful and demanding.  Affected my physical health, which improved dramatically within 2 weeks of leaving."
bad,"Manager and culture is one where they get what they want from you by threatening you with termination unless you conform.  There is very little to no respect from salaried employees, no team work, no collaboration and cut throat."
bad,"This company loves to spend money. Millions of dollars worth of equipment, never been used, just lying around the plant. "
bad,"there was always a smile on my face, i learned patience, responsability, & fear. i enjoyed my co-workers, the hardest part of this job i would have to say is the way they treat their employees, i worked hard everyday, overtime, double shifts, split shifts, worked days off, but i was fired for something i did not do, i was also brought up on major charges, i faught these charges, & on the morning of the jury trial the company did not go thru with the case because i could prove i did nothing illegal & they could not."
bad,I dont have a issue with the Phillips 66 brand but the individual owner was horrible. It was so disorganized and unprofessional. Thank goodness they finally went out of business.
bad,"That’s about it, too many chiefs and not enough Indians. They are quick to believe whom ever is kissing but that week. Very favorable when it comes to employees. Never does drug screening or background checks!"
bad,"High turnover rate, low wages. Hard to get fulltime, they tend to staff only part time. Benefits are only offered to full time employees. The  amount of work you do is not compensated very well."
bad,"Workload is becoming  unmanageable, training is scarce but to deal with their unwillingness to train or even communcate information, they fire people  for the slightest miss step.  The culture is very negative."
bad,"gather quart samples from large component field tanks 2-3 times a day or as requested... pump component field bottoms to slop tanks, set up analyzers according to the specs of each blend being done at the time, change out filters as needed to the analyzers, make additives for the blends as needed.."
bad,Over work you no pay over time but can work as much as you want but still get pay hourly hired for one thing and do everything to much for little pay.
bad,I worked here for over a year I loved working here and would still work here if not for issues in the company itself. In the end I didn't feel appreciated I worked for a long time many hard hours and never got a pay raise and never got advanced in the company at all. I didny feel I was treated fairly.
bad,Would never work there again the people want some one else to do the work don't wanna help put no effort into making the store any better I just really didn't like the people I was working for the take advantage of there employee
bad,This job came in handy when I needed something that would accommodate my school schedule. This is a third shift position.
bad,"Working at a gas station tends to be slow, but it can teach you things like inventory management and improve your customer service skills."
bad,"The management is not very good. There is a complete lack of respect for pipeline controllers, pay is well below average of other companies in the area. The moral is no good due to abusive management tactics. The control center seems to be completely separated from the rest of the company in a bad way, even though the company can't function without the control center."
bad,"They would take whatever they felt from your pay. Paid under minimum wage. Check amount was always less than what you were owed, and if you messed up on cigarette counts they docked your pay"
bad,I usually worked the graveyard shift. Just kept the place maintained. Would clean and stock shelves. Made sure we had fresh coffee made every 3 hours. Counted tobacco products and lottery.
bad,"I've never worked for a company where the only thing the HR Dept thrives on was disciplining and terminating as many employees as they could. Salary and hourly are in a constant ""us vs. them"" mentality."
bad,"I fueled oilfield locations and well pumps, long days 16 hours to 20 hours, learned how to work in all weather conditions safely, management was terrible and lazy, one of the owners(Hector) was a homosexual and would harrass all the men workers."
bad,"Until I found put the turn around rate was extremely high. And it's a popularity contest as far as I can tell.. ."
bad,This company is very unorganized needs better management needs management with training experiences behind them could use training programs for new employees need better  management for training purposes
bad,They pay well and have good benefits but that is about it. You cant toot without some brown noser snitching. They use you till you get to 50 or over and then get rid of you right before retirement age right when you need insurance most. Really obnoxious goal setting program. They claim they want you to make your own goals but then tell you what your goals are going to be. Totally bogus.
bad,"The management is non existent,  I haven't ever seen someone so unqualified to be a manager.....the place is dirty, stuff is broken and not fixed, it was voted worst gas station in our town"
bad,Contract was terminated because of a misalignment of priorities. The technology implementation I was supporting did not align with the overall goals of the organization.
bad,I had a terrible experience working ther it's always cold in the freezers and the floors always dirty from customers .. alot of hour changes and slow management
bad,I worked overnights and I eventually wanted to get off Overnights Cause I was tired all the time and didn’t have no life and he wouldn’t  take me off overnights
bad,"The store managers are a little korean couple that have very different views on business management than i have ever encountered but i shortly learned and worked with them to get the gas station in order, machines fixed and back in order, got them good reviews with there distributors and got them new distributors for their products being sold in store."
bad,company appears to be hiring interns mostly to replace senior engineers.   keep you head down and opinions to yourself.  HR is not your friend.  Large corporations are like this.
bad,"There is no structure. People call in constantly, owners expect you to drop your life to constantly come in, owners expect you to do management type work for minimum wage, owners will take advantage of you if you allow them to."
bad,Well paying job but horrible management. Zero recognition of going a good job. Immediate supervision and upper management use intimidation tactics on regular basis.
bad,"I eventually got fired because I just hated selling cigarettes and gasoline.  If you don't already hate the oil industry, do your research.   They are killing the world for a buck.  Otherwise, it was just another low paying job and if you're desperate for employment, I know they are stable at least.  That's about it."
bad,Has become very stressful and management is very hard to deal with. The benefits are good but there is little regard for loyalty and they take advantage of those that are.
bad,"My typical day was to run suspense and address BOLs suck in our system. Manage four internal mailboxes by redirecting emails to the Appropriate individual then save to a file."
bad,"A real job for those who like to work in production. Fun, smart and well behaved (most of the time) people. Though, contractors aren't not a part of the team."
bad,"-Expect to train yourself on most of your work."
bad,"Phillips 66 says it cares about people, but upper management does not reflect those words in their actions. "
bad,"Phillips 66 is a good place to work. For a company with the resources and ability to hire the best it is not one of the best places to work in corporate America. You can expect world-class benefits and above average pay. There is opportunity for those that ""show-up"" to work, but opportunities are limited when you do not have a four year degree. There are the typical corporate issues with departments and BU's working in silo's. Communication and expectations are fuzzy. Some associates get by while others give their best. There is a process for employee goal setting and performance review, however an employee's rank for pay increase at year end is pre-determined prior to the year-end conversations and the year-end discussion is not very helpful for personal improvement nor does it reflect the work done during the year. You are not measured on your contributions, but you are measured against others in your pay grade. Promotions are given in title and there is no salary adjustment for assuming extra accountability and responsibility. When considering a transfer within the company you are told you would be more valuable if you were hired-in instead of transferring. i.e. If selected for the job you would be paid more money for the same work and same experience."
bad,"I have been employed here as a contractor .. for many years I have never seen a company treat people the way this company does.."
bad,"If you like the old Jack Welch, competitive out for yourself environment its the place for you. GREAT pay and benefits, but its all about who you know. Day I started I was told I needed to start building my network rather than prove yourself with your work. A lot of great talent gets wasted because they only respect/listen to a select few. There was an article on Linked In a few years back about the top 10 HR practices that companies should stop or not be doing. P66 does 7 of them."
bad,Large petroleum company. A lot of travel and opportunity to work with other people. Good pay and benefits. Downstream operations located across the US.
bad,It is a nice place to work for but it all depends on the team you have. The corporate is ok they will help you if you have issues you need worked out.
bad,"well my work shift starts after noon during the rush hour which leaves me no time to say hi to my co workers , i learned lots of things but the main thing ive learned is to smile no matter what , the customer always right , the management was first class because it was based on respect and grattitude , the hardest part of my jab was the rush hour , all the customers want to be served fast and that can be challenging when some of the costumer take their time at the register , in return the customers will be upset with me , the enjoyable part was when the customers thanks me for being polite"
bad,"I like working there to see all the people. I had set hours, but had to go in when called to handle problem at the store."
bad,"I enjoyed working at Phillips 66 in the beginning, after a few months I started to enjoy the locals that would come in to see me and tell me stories. I became familiar with the police department and all the deputies. It was a fast paced environment which I enjoyed also doing.."
bad,"Worst managed control center in this region.  Control center is micromanaged like a daycare center.  Pay is not good for a control center, management does not value employees"
good,"I worked three 2nd shifts and 2 third shift, which I did not care for, it was very hard on me. On 2nd shift you were constantly busy, working 81/2 hours with knowone there to give you a break. You had to use the bathroom when possible and take a chance that a customer didn't come in and have to wait, since you were the only one there for your shift. Co-workers were nice, but the job itself was difficult. Worked 40 hours a week, and was told the owners didn't believe in raises or paid vacations. So when Steelgrip called I took that job."
good,"It was a fast paced job, lousy pay, your supervisor made or broke the job. I had many good bosses there and many lousy ones. lost of turn over and couldn't keep the bathrooms clean we were always so so so busy.,"
good,"I have stepped up into a position that the 2 previous occupants have made 120k and they pay me 105k. So they will take what you will give them.  It is a good company to work for if you are hourly but when they move you to supervision (salary), they take from you as much as you will give."
good,"The job is easy, but 5 employees to run 3 shifts a day at 7 days a week is unacceptable. Minimum wage with no chance for growth or compensation for 40+ hour weeks with no breaks"
good,I didn't find Roberts entirely reliable. They had trouble with payroll and the only really offer Kaiser. They do pay for vacation and holidays (which is a big deal) but they don't communicate with their employees at all.They should put together a newsletter for the employees and let us know that they are even there.They had to run around to people's banks on payday and deposit checks in their accounts.Not Good.
good,"Great place to learn about customer service and how to handle sticky situations, you have some interesting customers. Great co-workers. Not a really busy store!"
good,"I worked the overnight shift here and it was a good job to have as a full time student who needed flexibility. The job was simple and didn't require much outside of customer service skills, stocking, and maintaining a clean store. This specific business was privately owned and there were many struggles with management, but overall the job was easy and I enjoyed the flexibility."
good,I liked the cahsier part of it all. When the regulars would come it and conversate it was nice. They thing I hated was how strict the owners and manijor was.
good,"I was paid under the table and constantly lied to about my hourly wage. The manager tried to care verbally, although did not follow through his financial promsies."
good,Had great loyal customers and worked my own pace on 3rd shift but other employees did not put the team effort in. Also some employees almost never showed up on time but over all i tried to make the place a lil better.
good,"I advanced as far as I had ever would, so I began to search for a new position and was laid off before I was able to obtain one."
good,"Wait on customers, clean, change garbage, stock products, rotated products, pricing items in store, sweep and mop floors, order products needed."
good,Phillips 66 Denver is a very demanding job with little to no time with your family. The positions also require rotating shifts 24/7 with little to no help or leadership from all of the management
good,The job is very flexible with hours. But its really hard to move up. And no benefits that can help out in today economy. The pay can be better but also guve chance for employees to move up not just feel like a dead end job.
good,Experience was very good for me. Management lacks tools needed to understand how not to micro-manage. This company is good on safety and protecting their image. They taught me many tools I will always carry with me in this industry.
good,A typical day of work is dealing with angry confused customers (due to price changes my manager neglected).  I learned to watch my back and cover myself because people were only out for themselves there.  Management seemed oblivious to customer needs.  Hardest part was the customers.  Getting paid every week was a major plus.
good,"At the end of the day what stood out was our customer service. We all worked very hard to make sure that people that came in continued to come back. That to me, was the best part of my job there."
good,Manager is a knee jerk reactive person. All he wants to do is scream and want to fire someone every day almost. His attitude is from with in his personality but it is driven from General Manager also.
good,"Need room for advancement, great working experience, if I needed time off I usually got it. Met great people and lived my job. I would recommend this as a starter job for people looking to gain experience in the field"
good,"Overall, not a bad company but some of the middle management is terrible and unethical. Pay is good, most people are good, and the work can be interesting some days."
good,This place I didn't feel was ran the way it should have been.  Granted a lot of things could have already changed since I've worked there.  The promise for management positions was not always accurate.
good,"The work is easy and can be hard and tiring at times. The type of work varies and some tasks change daily. The number of hours were a lot at first but as the months past, the working hours shrank from 15 hours a week to just 3 hours! Pay was not worth the time, I was paid $8/hour to do the same work a custodian at any other establishment would do for $13/hour. The employee staff was rude, management did little to intervene."
good,Not a horrible place to work.  the pay was a little low but it was my 2nd job.  if you have ever worked at a gas station they are all mostly the same.
good,"The typical day was stressful."
good,"I have been in customer service all of my working career, so naturally I'm good with people. Working for Phillips 66 was challenging in that I loved my co-workers and the customers. On the flip side my boss was a bit demanding and did not treat the staff very well at all he would yell at us if we didn't do something correct, and he never complimented us when we did good. He also did not give anyone raises, and there was not any health care coverage available to us."
good,Worked in a small environment where I would clean and stock while maintaining store cleanliness. Only saw management during shift changes and they were pretty good about giving you a rundown of what to expect that day.
good,"Overall, working at this place has given me the many things to learn on how to deal with people and giving my best service to people. I always try to make them feel like home."
good,Great job. Middle management in the maintenance field is totally worthless. They will be contracted out within 6 months if they dont figure out take care of the guys who work not the ones under the desk.
good,"I have been here 7 years. Started as a painter. Went through the each year learning the craft getting a pay raise each year to the day. The best job i ever had, most of the time you could always pick up extra hours over time and have plenty of money for the family. They decided they were going to do away with my craft and use strictly contractors. My only option was to go salary as a scaffold coordinator. Struggling to pay bills for my family of 5 i am in the market for a new job. The mandatory salary move took away my ability to get extra overtime for the holidays, mishaps with the house, or any other emergencies that may arise. I have seen 4 Plant Managers since i started in 2011, and at least 3 maintenance managers, all with new bright ideas including getting rid of the craft that i spent 7 years learning and perfecting."
good,"Supervisors do not understand the functions of their assigned groups."
good,Great management...low pay ..no Benefits..barely negotiable on family and personal time..Can't even get them to deduct court ordered child support payments.
good,Phillips 66 midstream involves it's daily corporate work structure into field operations and field management on a routine basis.  Phillips 66 is a big corporate company.
good,"A lot of OT available. Not a lot of room for growth. Upper management doesn't care about the people under them. Work is 24/7 all year round and in all weather, regardless of temperatures or road conditions."
good,I learned a lot from running the gas station alone.  The pay was definitely too low for running a gas station alone and being a key holder.
good,"Prior to the current management, a business team meeting at 7:30am provided valuable information for the various departments of the facility."
good,"Run Registers, Daily paper work, review and check all employees paper work from previous day. Get deposit ready for owner to pick up, Ordering and checking in and out venders, scheduling, checking and changing gas prices when needed. checking dates on inventory, stocking shelves and cooler. Checking prices and price changes. Cleaning and organizing. Working at least 55 hours a week and working a lot of double shifts. Training in new employees. Putting daily numbers in computer, customer service. Stock Cigarettes, ect."
good,"Great starter job learned about cars flushes tire, rotation, bad signs etc.."
good,"I like that Phillips 66 offers the flexibility to there employees, they offer morning, lunch and evening group classes to all full time employees. They are big in taking employees healthy."
good,They will tell you they will fire you for just about anything starting day 1. They are not lying. doesn't matter if its mechanical issue that caused an accident or issue doesn't matter you was there its your fault.. pay is great schedule sucks. benefits are really good to. only thing I hated was the management was out to get you and not help. There are some good ones but trust me there are many snakes. would I pass it up no probably not. I woulda stayed if let lmao
good,"The company used to be great, we had a strong culture of growth and employees were valued. In the last 2 years that has all changed."
good,"The employee relations group was a joke, and the company didn't take appropriate action or protect employee well-being when faced with corrupt leadership direction. Though I think highly of some executive leadership, I'll forever be mindful of what I witnessed while working there. Beware."
good,"Lots of work hours, stressful that there was so much OT. Couldn’t make plans around anything because you weren’t guaranteed days off. Overall not a fun place to work"
good,Big projects big goals.  No one to implement and crazy time tables.  So much work time off is difficult to take.  If your are gone you will be left behind by your project and team.  Simply over worked and burnt out!
good,The Phillips 66 I worked at was privately owned so many or all of the management was left to the person hired to manage and the actual owner. I noticed the station was sold soon after I left and the Phillips 66 emblem was taken down.
good,I would definitely work here again if the pay was different. I loved the people I worked with and the customers that come in. It can be very easy or very challenging but overall worth it.
good,First and foremost this place is run by a group of the good ole boys. If you are not in the squad you will be stuck at the bottom of the pay scale forever
good,This job was great at first until my boss got sick then I was put in manger  title for over 2 weeks then  they brought ssomeone outside the company  instead of promote me
good,"fast paced and every day full of challenges, a gas station attendant is definitely a stressful and rewarding job."
good,overall a good place to work. planning and execution of plans were far apart. management has no clue who really does the bulk of the operations or maintenance work. no accountability for managers mistakes
good,"Go into work usually at 4pm, when I got there I first"
good,"A typical day for me was talking to customers and gauging any needs that needed to be taken care of that day.   Additionally, all the pricing for customers was generated in my office."
good,"The company has great benefits and there is room for advancement but for me as a Christian, I was turned off by them pushing the LGBT group activites."
good,Great job if you are a people's person all different walks of life come through there. Must be able to deal with various attitudes. Pretty cool place to meet different people.
good,"They paid less but had a very conservative culture that made it hard to make moves laterally across organizations or promoted very fast. Very slow working graveyard shift. restocked shelves during the morning, sometimes changed shifts around with people to help them out. Worked by myself most of the time"
good,"Mixed messages from intermediate and executive-level management. There's been a lot of turnover recently mostly due to a business optimization project that has laid off many and driven a few more away."
good,A great company to work for but the satellite office is an after thought for advancement. The corporate culture is very intense with no room for mistakes.
good,I’ve never seen more ppl quit then right now.  People are choosing life over money because this company doesn’t have regular guaranteed days off except for vacation
good,"All good jobs to have. Tasks are interesting"
good,"Good place to work as I found it really interesting learning new things everyday. Management are poor, wouldn't provide coats in the winter or rain even though they had them in storage!!!"
good,Outdoor work environment.  Good pay and Benefits.  Good location.  Easy commute.  12 hour shifts.  3 day work weeks sometimes.  great fellow workers.  Very intelligent work force.  Volatile mgmt. group.
good,"I sit or stand in front of the till, every now and then cleaning till about an hour before we close and I'll turn off the Coffee pot and start cleaning up till we close where I sweep mop etc."
good,Overall Austin is a great company to work for.  Hardest part of the job is getting along with many different personalities and cultures.
good,"Management is friendly and lax, job culture is rather redundant and dull. A typical day here consists of a short list of tasks done every shift, such as replenishing product, disposing of waste to name a couple. When all this work is done, shifts typically run slowly when there are few to no customers. The job is relatively easy; I've had few difficulties. Most of my coworkers have been nice. In this time, I have met various types of people and in turn, have learned to build relationships, keep calm under pressure and communicate with mostly anyone."
good,"I joined IT Support team of this company with great hope."
good,Overall job was a new experience to try . Waiting on customers I enjoyed . Meeting new people every day from young to old . Some good days and some over whelming
good,"Great place to work and succeed in life. Management could be better but it is not horrible.The pay is good not bad either,  one of the best companies."
good,"Phillips 66, Mont Belvieu, Texas, Lead Operator					    January 2012 – July 2019"
good,worked there for a sub contractor plant was ok plant hands was helpful permits was trying at times gave us plenty of lighting on night shift overall good
good,"Great Benefits, competitive salaries, job security, great headquarters in Houston. I do wish we had a work from home policy. The culture is pretty laid back."
good,"Schedule manpower for rotating 12hr shifts, track and report on vacation, sick time and absenteeism.  Prepare payroll by conducting checks and balances of hours worked versus rate of pay."
good,"When I got hired on, I could feel a family atmosphere, but as time went by and they kept changing Management, the companies employees weren't as important as they once were. I'd give them a 5 Star rating if there weren't a constant change or rules and permitting changes."
good,Working for Phillips 66 was good in beginning then got to be real stressful with not keeping help. No on wanted to work their shifts expected to be able to just have some one come in and work
good,"This place sucked I worked alone and basicly ran the operation while  the owner pocketed the cash, I finally had enough and quit, The  owner then hired three people to replace me. He should have paid me what I was wort h instead soon his business was shut down."
good,"Owners, Manager Heather and Co workers were not good to with or for. You should clean when necessary, not every hour if there is nothing to clean. The place of business needs a good thorough cleaning once a month, regularly maintenance checks on the machinery that stores drink and food."
good,"The job was pretty laid back and easy, dealing with the public was hard at times when certain customers would find any and everything to complain about to us cashiers instead of letting the store manager know of their complaints."
good,I loved the people I worked with so it made our night or day go by smoth.mangment wasn't the best. Didn't get health insurance. Did get discount on our drinks
good,I enjoyed my position at Phillips 66 it was fast paced but could get things done pretty quickly. The employees were nice and understanding and made sure I got good hours.
good,People think oil is a licence to print money. Running a petrol station is hard work and at Phillips66 we partner with the operators to provide advice and support to make the venture successful for both of us. The risk of failure is high and the credit group have to be very diligent and on the ball to spot warning signs and ensure that the right trading agreements are in place.
good,I assume working for Phillips is similar to most other Gas Station jobs. You have your regular duties and other tasks you must regularly perform that are specific to that location's needs. Overall My experience was just great. The work can be stressful at times however I had a great Boss and I enjoyed working there.
good,Philips 66 is a good relaxed place to work. The management is very kind and involved in training. Employees are very friendly. Overall good place to work.
good,Each day had its new challenges and unexpected fire drills. Requests came from multiple departments which helped you meet different professionals and expand my knowledge of the company operations.
good,"Poor worklife balance, FIRST FEW YEARS will be a conctant juggle, never know what to expect week to week on a work schedule. You will have to battle long turnarounds"
good,"Management can sometimes be misleading and give empty promises. The pay is very good, the opportunity for advancement at this time is limited in the Bartlesville area."
good,"great place to work, the hardest part of"
good,"I enjoyed working here but there was a lot of favoritism, and judgement in the work environment. Manager is alot to deal with & to much problems in the area"
good,Cashier took care of the store. Cleaned everyday all day cooked for the hot box. Tryed to keep costumers happy.. Then the owner sold it and left us all without a job. With no kinda warning..
good,they always kept safety first and everyone was their brothers keeper and looked out for supervisors as well as employees
good,It's a good place to gain cash register and customer service experience from. By far one of the safest gas stations to work overnight shifts.
good,Has great people to work with. Tries to help employees grow and develop but struggles because of the size. Very little work life balance for employees they deem to be high performers.
good,"No Comments. I have been a very short time. Due to recent budget reduction, my position was eliminated. Therefore I dont have any detail comments about this company."
good,"Phillips 66 has some of the sharpest and well rounded employees I have come across, especially on the trade floor. Unfortunately, that strong micro culture does often clashes with upper management."
good,meeting new people. wrking in a envirement that is always busy is interesting.I always had great employess. There was nothing that was to hard for this job.
good,Borger has some major issues with how it treats people. High turnover rate has not been address for several years now.
good,"cashier 3rd shift mostly  stocking cleaning etc.love to work there,but i got pregnant  and to dangerous third shift."
good,"Meet new people while working, learn interesting facts from them. No two days were alike, liked this job a lot. "
good,I enjoyed working here. I really liked my co-workers. The hardest part of job was dealing with the public and the attitudes that some of the public would have
good,"I love being around people. I love being a customer service rep, interacting with different people, and making a name in my community,"
good,"Pay and benefits are fantastic but there is a divide between hourly and management that is destroying the culture at my location.  Management believes that everyone should eat sleep and breathe work at home and work, both hourly and especially staff."
good,"The daily tasks weren't the problem, it was when we got them the managers would want us to get things done quicker than humanly possible and that would throw off the whole work team."
good,"The company is good overall, but the work/life balance is largely skewed towards work and it can be a high stress environment. The safety culture and employee engagement are very strong."
good,This is a great company. Excellent benefit packages and company culture.A bit dated in processes and offer no work from home policy. Culture is a bit out of wack due to large internal changes.
good,"This is generally a good place to work but it primarily depends on your manager."
good,"The Phillips 66 I worked at was a decent place to work, but it wasn't for me. There were times when things were crazy busy, and times when it was so slow, I would spend an hour cleaning and straightening things around the store because there wasn't enough to do."
good,"This was a fun environment with nice people. Occasionally you'd have a disgruntled customer, or even employee/vendor but, overall the people are really easy o get along with. The downfall to this job (which was a big one) is that it left me no time to have a personal life with my family."
good,i enjoyed my time with phillips 66' all the team was great . i learned what i took to help someone who did not even know how to pump gas' learned alot.
good,It's fun to work with and challenges to know the dangers and hazards in the refinery. Work is not confined in the office but expose you to see the physical condition and infrastracture inside the plant.
good,"The refinery is a great place to work, with few exceptions. The employees I worked with were very helpful and easy to get along with. The day to day operations ran smoothly with little interruption. My only complaint is the management of personnel was very selective. By that I mean management picked favorites and offered them opportunities not given to other equally qualified employees."
good,fun and busy place that help me get by through out school. Numbers were low but president if the company is very supportive
good,I loved the job. Running the place myself. Just could have had a better managing staff. I enjoyed the variety of drinks. Always up to date with the newest stuff. There really wasn't anything hard about the job.
good,The position and job I was assigned was very enjoyable but the organizational skills shown by my superiors where lacking.
good,"I learned about the processes used to make a variety of fuels from crude oil. Experience reading P&ID, and process diagrams."
good,"No comment on this at this time. I had varying degrees up happiness with my job over a 20 year career. There were great times and not so great times as with work in most industrial environments."
good,I really appreciated my time there but the commute to and from was quite difficult. I feel as if creativity is frowned upon and even discouraged. But it can be a Fantastic experience.
good,too much emphasis on education and not enough credit given for experience.  The office politics leave a lot to be desired. The cut  throat environment has proven to be very stressful.
good,"If you are a women working in the refinery, you are treated differently.  Even if you do your job and continuously strive to do good, it's not recognized.  If you work in the office environment, nobody notices what you do or how it affects the process.  The benefits are good but the environment can be hostile.  And you don't want to turn in one of the bosses for doing anything wrong.  They don't do anything about it."
good,"Company has a rotating shift, once there your checking ppl out cleaning bathrooms, stocking products, cleaning around the store to make sure in a clean area.mopping floors making coffee every 2 hours helping ppl if they needed help taking out the trash,, truck day making sure everything goes were products need to be and rotating them while replace new product on the shelf"
good,"A typical work day you stocked product, cleaned, ran a cash register, and watch the gas pumps to make sure no one drove off. Some of the things that i learned while working there where how to do inventory and order the proper amount of product for the store. The management wasn't around much due to being a manager for 3 different locations. But when they where there they help maintain the store as we employees did but with a few tasks of there own. I would say that to me there was nothing really hard about the job. To me it was just common since. I did enjoy meeting new faces and helping them along with all the regular customers."
good,"I was a good work environment,didn't like that we didnt get any lunch breaks or some sort of break. I enjoyed my time working there nice people to work with. Also was a good work schedule for me"
good,Great bosses. Awful pay. Hardest part is angry customers. I hated working swing shifts. No set hours so you cant work 2 jobs.
good,"i enjoy working for this company, but feel like it could be better..."
good,A typical day at Phillips66 included but was not limited to reviewing prior day activities followed by meeting with colleagues to plan out daily operations and next steps. Daily follow up with manufacturing/customers/sales/marketing to get updates on new plans and processes.
good,Phillips 66 is a large corporation with excellent benefits. The salary wasn't the most competitive but the benefits made up form the low/ medium salary.
good,Good people very supportive and family oriented made my feel part od.  They are always trying to give you opportunity for hours.  The chicken there is absolutely amazing
good,"Its a good place to work I learned all my skills to this refinery, can be overwhelming sometimes but it's manageable. Woeked with operations and electrician who are very helpful"
good,Once on the console your no longer union. They push you to train and qualify too soon and hang you out to dry when mistakes are made. Always short one of the 5 shifts. Horrible management of workforce. Multiple people fired due to stress management problems.
good,The job started out great but it lacked structure and a strong manager. Once I was promoted everything fell on my shoulders with no pay increase or additional authority. I was covering a min of 3 no call no show shifts a week and nothing was ever done about it. During a crisis or important events that required the manager the manager never answered their phone so the owner had to be called which resulted in me being written up multiple times because the manager themselves got in trouble. I think if it would have had a better manager that led to having better staff it would have been a great job that i really did love til enough was enough.
good,"It was an okay job but making minimum wage is not enough to live on and it was in a shady spot when I worked there, sort of in the middle of nowhere. There was a robbery in the store a week before I got hired."
good,"I saw a lot of inexperience with P-66, hiring outside contractors that were not safety conscious, or lacked knowledge of basic operations of drilling and running oilfield equipment. Upper level management consisted of College age people with limited knowledge of actual field operations and made calls mostly from what they had read out of either a field manual or a text book, these were the cons.. The pro's were that most people were friendly and willing to help or listen when a suggestion was made, and they welcomed the opinion of others and were somewhat receptive to ideas which were presented to them."
good,Pretty good job as long as you have the right people in management that your working for. You can get lots of overtime if you want it but usually at other locations
good,"Great company, management needs work. If you were in the brother in laws club in maintenance you didn't have to work and didn't have to worry about layoffs.."
good,"The employees at P66 are great people to work with, I have nothing but good things to say about them."
good,"was a nice place to work . learned how to do inventory .customers wee nice and had wonderful employees . also loved the environment to grow and learn,"
good,"Upon arriving to work you would need to set up your register.  Make sure carwash was opened, gas pumps were all working, and running okay.  Fill window fluid outside of pumps.  Work with vendors in filling up pumps, soda, and other orders.  Once received would work to fill those orders while assisting customers with their orders.  "
good,It was a decent gas station. The manager was very likable. Everyone that came in the store knew him and had a lot of respect for him. He was a very understanding person and he was also very respectful towards his employees and the customers.
good,Fear management is no way to treat employees! The pay and benefits are above standard and middle management is great. Upper management and human resources make the job unbearable most days
good,Overall a great place to work / Now that they use SAP software they are heading in the right direction.They are always stressing safety for their employees. This company has been in business for a long time and they are continuing to update and  upgrade their work areas
good,"The typical day was a basic routine. I learned how to operate a cash register and how to receive payment in cash, checks, credit cards. I didn't have co-workers for I worked all alone overnight."
good,"Great atmosphere with employees within operations. Management is not very good, there are too many supervisors to where you do not know who to report to with a problem."
good,It was an ok place to work. not my favorite facility. They did recently update the cables and made it a little more bearable. The remoteness was bad and their timekeeping was horrible. If you cam in a minute after they would round to the next fifteen-minute mark.
good,This job is ok I know most would kill to make the amount of money with the days off but you can have it  shift work sucks and it’s a lot of time spent out here
good,It was nice quiet place to work easy job and received fourty hours a week really understanding manager worked houra with you if you were sick. Had a good Christmas.party enjoyed the customers and environment
good,"Most of the time it is productive, the job really depends on the people you work with. The job is easy going most of the time as long as you get the work done that should be done on your shift while being nice to the customers."
good,Its a good job but no advancement opportunities . Not enough employees for descent coverage for good customer services. Benefits offered were to much money per paycheck.
good,This is a very good company you meet a lot of people some nice some mean a fast pace place but good customer service a variety of food and very good fooh
good,"It's a company that is very focused on safety, awareness and results."
good,"Management changes way too often and they handle things far too strictly by the book, not to be strict, but because they are inexperienced and don’t know how to manage without consulting a book."
good,A typical workday could be stressful and busy at times but had its good times. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers and co-workers.
good,"Not a bad place to work, I work in the sulfur unit currently. You have your typical 3 rounds a shift and normal operational duties. The problem is the console is in a centralized location rather than in the unit itself. Certifications are based on old tests and requests to have them updated are denied."
good,"Management was very stressful and would never take the people that was operating the units advise. Considering they had the day to day on  it                                     "
good,It was an ok job just went out of business.They gave many hours and great benefits. We had flexible schedules that worked out for everybody. The store manager treated us like family.
good,I would open the facility and enroll and take the attendance of the students in the classes. I would accept payments and sell merchandise. I completed all the needed paperwork for payroll and the accounts.
good,Enjoyable for the most part other than a few minor problems but a job nonetheless. The regular customers are considered friends and the staff is like a small family.
good,"Typical days at the plant consist of monitoring the process and making minor adjustments, communicating with fellow operators, engineers, supervisors and the lab."
good,Managed tickets and talked to user online and over the phone. This was just a short term contract to get the company caught up on their ticket volume.
good,good working environment and friendly manager. busy time at gas station is always fun part to work. inventory day is most exciting day. overall working at gas station helps you to learn good customer service.
good,The pay and benefits were amazing.  Management looked down on you if you did not work overtime but it depended on your department.  My department would not let me move on.  I have not worked there in a year and they still have the same people working in the department.  Other departments and managers at Phillips 66 are willing to help their employees grow and prepare them for new positions within the company.  I would have stayed if there had been better employee development in my department.
good,"this was a good company to work for. i liked them. a typical day was hard work but not too much. management was good. "
good,"I've worked at this site for 32 years. I started as an Operator, then Shift Supervisor, and now the OT Network Administrator for the ICS. We work at 19/30 schedule where we work for 8.5 hours a day and get one day off a month in return."
good,"Great place to work. I really enjoy the people I work with. Would  definitely recommend working for this company. They are easy-going, they work with you And they’re just all-around great."
good,"Having been in technology-focused projects, I found my coworkers and supervisors generally great to work with and dedicated to what the company stands for. The company is focused on providing many opportunities for personal and community improvement, e.g., wellness incentives from health coaching and exercise facilities, opportunities to volunteer within and outside of the organization."
good,"Environment is good, u get to work with out any problems. i never have any problem with any of my customers at work may be because i like to keep it professional."
good,"Decent place to work, with a variety of tasks. Stocking, preparing food, cleaning, washing dishes, operate lottery machine, and cash register, check temp on coolers"
good,"Fast paced, multitasked environment, multiple tasks, always had something needing to be done, never boring, a lot of interaction with customers, advancement opportunities available"
good,It's hard to advance up and learn if you don't know the right people. You can work hard but not get noticed for the work you do. It's a great place to work if you're content with having little to no advancement.
good,"I position with Phillips 66 details the D.O.T. monitoring of four pipelines it the joint venture with Paradigm Energy Partners. The lines include a seventy mile 16"" mainline, a sixteen mile 16"" line, a two mile 16"" line that ties into the Dakota Access Pipeline and a six mile 12"" line. My responsibilities included the monitoring of the daily construction activities to insure that all task met the PHSMA requirements."
good,management was flexible with my schedule once i began taking classes. enjoyed working with coworkers and enjoyed the work. only reason for leaving is that i had to move away.
good,"I would show up count into my cashier register for the day other employee would count down from register then leave for the night, if not busy i would mop the floor, clean the counters, made sure all beverages worked, lined up drinks in fridge isles, sure there were hotdogs on roller grill, and then just work on the register until close then I would lock up the store after counting down my register."
good,"0530 start, pull in overnight break in emergency orders, verify schedule and make sure all materials are on hand for that day, verify material is expedited for emergency and warehouse spares. Plan work designated by plant and area priority, Build schedule for following week and up to two weeks out. Manage procurement of material for all rotating equipment refinery wide."
good,"The pay might not of been what it should have, but I treated the place like it was mine and took pride in my job."
good,A great atmosphere for those who love customer service. Independent environment and always room to grow. Time management. My biggest dislike of the company was working 3rd shift by myself on a fast paced side of town.
good,Management need work. Good paced work environment. Freiendly customers fellow employes were great people to work with. Always something to do to keep you busy
good,Fast paced work environment that places high expectations on its employees.  Company overall looks out for its employees and compensates well.  Would recommend as a good place to work for someone with a high work ethic.  Hours can be long and sometimes weekends are required.
good,Can work up to 16 hours per day. Work with external and  internal business partners with supply and pricing. Work billing issues with customers. Organized quarterly group meetings with team members to encourage collaboration.
good,Great company but middle management is beside itself.  I believe this will change in the long run though.  I can tell you that the company will give you every tool you need to do your job safely and productively.
good,"It is a good place to work, but the work life balance is a challenge. Although there are positions where you are free on your day's off, as you work up the ladder, you are expected to spend more and more time at work, or working from home."
good,"Work life is very demanding and challenging, I have tons of experience working with hydrocarbons. We have experienced a lot of turnover in management during the past 5 years or so. Management has changed the culture to where it is not a family type atmosphere no longer. I am challenged to overcome a wide variety of obstacles that we may see on several different occasions and sometimes that we do not see very often or may never see. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to work with a very diverse work force and make a lot of very good friends over the years."
good,"Majority or work is project management, with little to no training. Majority of practical experience is in the field and not in the office, meaning the engineering team is a bit green. Technical expertise has been relocated to Houston office and are not always available. We are encouraged to use third party engineering for all technical projects."
good,a lot of lottery transactions i learned alot about company accounts and how it works my coworkers were very cool the hardest part was being ok around upper management i loved people
good,Give much autonomy and little supervision. I learned so much in such a short amount of time there. Another great thing is that you get to experience more tasks in different business units. This was great for me!
good,A typical day is counting the register drawer to make sure the money is correct before getting started with transactions.
good,"I love working at gasmart.  Always interacting with customers, the friendly environment and management.  When there was a problem, management was always there to come up with the best solution and was very caring to their employees needs.  My co-workers and I always worked as a team to get the job done and helped eachother out any way that we could.  The hardest part of the job would have to be the difficult or belligerent customers that we would sometimes have.  I didn't mind though because I loved the challenge and watching them walk out with a smile on their face after we had resolved the issue.  The most enjoyable part of the job was all the new people I got to meet and interact with.  I love being able to do things for others and make them happy."
good,"Great place, salary and benefits"
good,Cool owner the hardest part of the job working Wednesdays by myself in the morning trying to wait on customers and vendors at the same time. My Schedule was 6-2 just Monday through Friday.
good,"Wonderful place to work, great compensation.  Safety minded company with great advancement and benefits.  Flexible schedules and great vacation pacakages"
good,Found it to be a good place to work. Plenty of sharp folks earnest to improve their use of SAP. I was impressed by the quality of their employees and willingness to learn.
good,"I really loved working for P66 the CEO is top notch, given that the company split from ConocoPhillips the upper management kept all employee's in the loop. I can only say my time with them was great."
good,I really enjoyed this job because I like working with people the customers were great and I received a lot of praise from them.
good,enjoyed working with my co-workers. Also I loved when we had costumers that were lined up to the door. It helped us figure out the best way to serve everyone.
good,"stock,clean,inventory,assist customers with daily specials"
good,Didn't care for swaping shifts from day to nights every other week
good,"La responsabilidad de llegar abrir la estación de gasolina y preparar todo para prestar el mejor servicio al cliente, el tener las llaves del negocio, la combinación de la caja fuerte, el expendio de licores y tabaco fue todo un reto de responsabilidad. En cuanto a la gerencia fue lo mejor que he vivido ya que en mis hora de trabajo  estaba a cargo de todo, eso me hizo crecer como empleado, lo más difícil lidiar en ocasiones con personas bajo la influencia del alcohol, lo que más me gusto el aprendizaje de cuadra caja, productos y sobre todo lo de ley en referencia al expendio de alcohol y tabaco."
good,"A typical day involves taking customers transactions, restocking coolers, pulling forward merchandise, maintaining hot deli food, keeping inventory, and clean up.  I learned how to work a register and give reward credit.  Co-workers come and go rather quickly but the ones that stay are good workers and friendly. Hardest part of the job is many times working without a break and difficulties occurring during rushes. The most enjoyable part of the job is serving the regular customers that come in. "
good,"It was a splendid place to work. Rain nearly every week, causing the entire place to turn into a slop hole that only a pig would enjoy trudging through every single day for 10 hours a day."
good,This was a great introduction into the work life. I met some rsally great people. I dealt wifh real work issues and gained problem solving skills. Overall it was a great experience.
good,There is a very fast paced environment at Phillips 66. Many new challenges are presented everyday. The compensation/benefits are very fair for the area. The background check process was cumbersome and takes ~3 weeks.
good,Employees were very knowledgeable about the unit we worked on. They also were very helpful with contractors that came on to assist them with the shutdown.
good,"Good people, wasnt a bad job environment.. Management was off. I had fun working there, I was there more than I was home. Benefits are a plus, they do have good benefits.. Different shift schedule I think.. But it worked out while I was there. I had fun."
good,I love my job but I am looking for a company that allows me to have my days off to spend with my family. 7 12s for months on end and being on call(and more often than not called) off of every set of graveyards leaves little to no family time.
good,flexible and fun with a welcoming atmosphere and a drama free environment. managers were understanding and flexible at my times with Phillips 66. the customers were great and it was just a fun place to work.
good,Wasnt a hard job. Working 7 days a week took its toll on you. I enjoyed it for the most part. I also worked with 3 friends. And helped closing manager close sometimes by Leavin at 6 and coming back at 11 to 12
good,Never knew when you were going to work overtime. Usually found out at the end of the day. Weekend work was not given out until last minute on Friday. Management did not communicate or operate efficiently.
good,It was a good work environment. Always meeting friendly people . helps adapt to fast pace and adapt on the fly to different situations. Great staff all friendly.
good,I like working here although I don't always get to do the work that I prefer but its a good job (they treat employees fairly) and pays well. Plus you get to learn day to day Refinery operation for a major gasoline and chemical producer. I am employed as a contractor not a full time Phillips 66 employee.
good,"Good Benefits / Good wage"
good,I worked an eight hour shift working the cash registers and cleaning the store. On an average day we had about 300-500 customers in an eight hour period. I loved working with my coworkers they always could make me laugh and enjoy my work.
good,"Relaxed environment, great benefits and hours, a perfect job for a first time job. Easy to get the hang of and very friendly and accommodating staff and management."
good,"I LOVED working here, but I didn't make enough to provide for everything on my own. Sometimes it was hard to make ends meet and that's mostly why I looked else where. It hurt to leave because I have never had such great company and lovely co-workers. Mostly, I loved my work environment, I loved everyone at the ones I've worked at. They all treated me like family. I got to hop to a couple other gas  stations and I loved it at those too! It was a great job, I feel I got a lot of experience from the one(s) I worked at and the people I worked with. The owner was/is always about his business and it's good to see that in someone above you!"
good,"Working in Bartlesville is unpleasant."
good,"People were often over utilized."
good,long hot day but a  decent job but not a reliable job because your contract could get voided don't pay enough for what they expect you to do on a daily bases
good,Job work/life balance could be better.  Management tries to be cooperative with work rules.  Safety is high on the list as far as priorities go.  Advancement can be made within company.
good,It's overall a good company. Really hard to hire people when not competing with other businesses in area. Working way to many hours on salary and getting really drained.
good,"I learned more customer service skills. Communication was huge for this job at times. The management was great to work for, they made coming to work a lot of fun, but also made sure you did your job and learned more each day. There wasn't much of a hard part to this job other than if something got lost or misplaced. The most enjoyable part was definitely laughing and making the best of each day with my co-workers."
good,"Overall good company, understaffed, I like the working the job but company really needs to look at the shift and fatigue policy."
good,Phillips encourages knowledge sharing among employees which will enable you to grow. The best part of my job is working with people who are experts at their jobs and are willing to share that knowledge. The hardest part is managing work/life balance.

I could ask questions about an account or other dataset and not feel as though I were intruding. The work environment was very relaxed and I did not usually feel as though I had to project a persona of pristine corporate professionalism or perfection. My privacy was respected and when I needed to concentrate, I was not disturbed by my pod-mates.

My colleagues were the most enjoyable aspect of the position and made some of the drudges of the actual work more tolerable."
