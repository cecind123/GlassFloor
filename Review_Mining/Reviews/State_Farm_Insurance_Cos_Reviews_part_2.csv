The uncertainty of future employment in your current job location makes it difficult to remain motivated and committed to the organization.  The company is moving many knowledge-based jobs to centralized work centers which are located in metropolitan areas.  If you have strong roots in your current city or aren't interested in living in the mid-west or a busy city, there isn't going to be many job opportunities for you.  They are losing many great employees with this strategic business decision."

We were not set up for current ways to reach out to customers, text messages."
good,"i loved my job that i had here, i just had some things that came up with my family that happen suddenly that i had to leave this position."
good,I grew up with State Farm having it as my insurance provider and both of my parents being employed with the company so it was not too difficult for me to dive right in. A typical day in the office was submitting claims being the first person that the insured spoke to after their loss. I learned proper data entry and how to effectively control a conversation without sounding like I am trying to rush people off of the phone. Management held daily huddles and weekly 1 on 1s with associates to also inform what needed to be improved on and how best to go about it. Having grown up with the company nothing was too difficult for me. Most enjoyable part was definitely how close you can become with your team to where they're like a family to you.

I'm currently a student once I'm done with school I plan to move forward in the medical field. If you've worked in a call center before it's pretty much the same meeting metrics and making sure you treat the customer respectfully. I don't really have con's the company has a points system like most do now a days as long as you show up for work you won't have much to worry about. A typical day you handle an arrange of calls from claims, billing questions, customer needing I.D. cards for there vehicles. I would say one of the hardest things personally for me is hearing someone's loved one passed away."

Benefits are great, double paid time off if you work the holidays / hourly. There's a paid time off bank so if you don't use your PTO it rolls over to next year. There are evaluations every year to see if an employee met expectations or beyond and raises are given along with bonuses.

good,Expectations at State Farm are the highest you will find across the Insurance Industry.  A typical 8 hour day felt like 4 as it is very fast paced. Corporate Field Offices regularly check in to support and incentives to Agents and their producers. There is a clear path to Agency if you have commitment and desire.

State Farm Insurance recognizes the importance of the staff members as the front line and representatives of the company.  Good agents make good staff members and good staff members make good agents great.  Being on the front line is one of the hardest but rewarding parts of the job.

good,"Insurance is such a diverse career! While not every day is the same, meeting and getting to know customers is very rewarding. Thorough reviews of clients needs are highly important to ensure proper coverage is provided to protect their assets/lives in the event of a loss. However there are tough times when having to be the messenger and notify clients of company cancellations.

I learned how to deal with callers who did not want to be called. I learned how to get a point across as to why State Farm would be the better choice for the client. My Co-Workers were very friendly and caring, we would all be helping each other when needed. The hardest part of the job was reaching the goal. Many people do not want to be called and it is hard to get them to listen to you if that is the case. There were many times where I had a couple of full pages where no one would even pick up the phone or listen to what I was offering.
