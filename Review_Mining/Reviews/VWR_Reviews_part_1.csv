rating,review
bad,"One of the worst places to work.  Dangerous, dirty, discouraging.  This site needs a complete overhaul, physically and operationally.  Full of some of the worst people I have encountered."
bad,This may be the worst job I ever had. The entire company is unorganized. They break a bunch of osha regulates rules/standards. Also most of the management team are extremely unprofessional and the produce a very hostile work environment.
bad,"For me it was the more terrible work experience ever. Manager is polish. If you're not polish it will be not the right place for you. Polish stuff will be always right even if they speak with you like with peace of sh**t. Team leaders allows itself very rude and loud communication with staff. "
bad,Management only focused on how much they could get from their employees. Management bullied employees if they did not like them and reviews were not based achievements but perceptions
bad,"Horrible Company to work for,and I worked for them for over twenty four years.Biased and self serving Management and H.R.,discrimination evident here."
bad,The company does not pay employees the salary they deserve. The benefit package is a joke. The medical insurance is sky high and the management is not friendly.
bad,Stay away.  Managers suck up to keep jobs. Went to Director and was ignored. Favoritism in the office and racism in floor. People keep leaving and break room talk is all about who is quitting or going to quit and how company has changed. Applied and  hired right away - very good experience and was told how great company is.  Waited 3 weeks to start work. I quit  my job for this one!  they want degrees and experience but pay is low.  New HR person so fake and clueless.  We see right through her.   Company is a mess.
bad,"Very easy job responsibilites, is pointless to put forth any extra effort since management fails to recognize it, you are better off sitting around doing nothing like the majority of the business does anyways.  If you are lazy or have no ambitions in life this is the place for you otherwise run away as fast as you can."
bad,"Nepotism at it`s best here, they bring you in as a temp do not keep you posted if your in line to get hired on, all the while supervisors hiring friends as full time employees, zero viability, no communication"
bad,So I left as well. I finished implementing the software I was hire to implement and gave them my notice that I was looking elsewhere.
bad,Horribly managed company that can't keep temporary workers much less full time employees. Supervisors here spend most of their day following around associates watching them work because they have an unfair labor management system. Every week there is a forklift accident which makes this building by far the unsafest place I have worked regarding forklift operators. This location is in the process of being represented by the Teamsters which is a result of the poor management and low pay.
bad,The company seems to always come up with some goals that don't align with overall company growth targets. Only favorite and mostly only hire people from certain university. No advancement opportunities. No fair rules to treat workers with different education backgrounds.
bad,"The supervisors are quick to throw employees under the bus in hopes management will look at them approvingly.  Supervisors are not supportive and simply say what they are told to say by upper management.  No compassion and lack of caring about team members, except those they favor.   No career growth."
bad,"VWR is not a terrible job if you have no intention of having a career. If you do just do not work here. It is the very definition of a dead end job. They have a high turnover rate and only replace people with temps if they are replaced at all. Be prepared to take on the work of 4-5 people on top of your base duties with no additional pay and also deal with rampant favoritism where long time employees will take advantage of you and expect you to do their job for them too because they don't feel like it and be obnoxiously rude to you about it on a daily basis. There are no raises, benefits, or paid time off due to them only hiring temps. They love to pat themselves on the back about high growth in revenue but constantly cut corners and refuse to treat employees like they are actually a part of this growth by providing any incentives whatsoever. Management is horrible and uncoordinated with little to no communication. If you have a problem they will not do anything productive about it. If you try to bring up long time employees being rude and dumping their job onto you then they will simply lie to you, have you demoted and moved to another plant. Then you will find out your new role has nothing to do with what you were told and you will get no communication about anything from management. If you attempt to have the temp agency act as a mediator to find out whats going on, they will terminate your contract."
bad,"They lost 150 employees this year. Only want to use temp workers. Do not follow their own work instructions, policy, procedures. At times very unsafe, no training, no growth"
bad,No loyalty .Worked 18 years only to be terminated for defending an employee . They kid themselves with the employee first MOTO! Avoid if possible. The have a warehouse management system built off false data making it nearly impossible for a Warehouse associate to make there metrics.
bad,Employee moral is the worst I have ever seen in my 25 years of working.  Employee turnover in production and most of the departments is extremely high as much due to work expected as the poor management.  Production control being the worst as they require more overtime to get minimum requirements of job done which is why they are straight salary while all other departments are hourly and get OT pay.  Upper management is smart and professional except in how they deal with intermediate mgmt. issues.  Complaint after complaint for same things from multiple employees and nothing ever changes.  Thus things get even worse as good employees get fed up and leave.
bad,job starts of by receiving pallets of parts to put away. i learned how to use an RF scanner. my co worker are really friendly. the hardest part of the job is lifting really heavy items.
bad,"You know more than the managers, the training is inadequate and the advancement opportunities are few and far between."
bad,This company does not care about their employees. They don't act like real life is happening. People have been fired for not coming to work on a day when the city was closed for snow and the schools and daycares are closed or leaving work cause your spouse had an accident. They have supervisors that don't act like supervisors they have control over their group. They have to ask the manager permission for everything. They have team leads but the team leads and the supervisor have the same power. If you go that extra mile they don't appreciate it. They fire without a cause or reason. This job is really easy and this place could really be a great place but the management make this place unbearable to work at.
bad,Not a good job and an adult of family to live off of. Management is prejudice and they don't care about you or your life. Only good for young college students or first job hunters to experience a bad company before you go to a good one.
bad,"Just as the title says, so avoid employment here if at all possible. The company culture is very negative and does not reward it's employees. Management is constantly changing (revolving door) so it's impossible to have an open-door policy when there's no one in the manager's office!!!"
bad,"If you are looking for job security, don't work at VWR.  People are regularly laid off for no apparent reason and with no notice or warning.  It doesn't matter how long you've worked there or how well you do your job ...when they are done with you, they let you go.  Senior management is heartless."
bad,"This company is heading for the gutter. Moral of the employees on the floor has hit rock bottom. Raises are a joke, and the only people who are treated with respect are the ones who kiss..... Do not accept a job here. You should know when all the good people are leaving something is going wrong."
bad,"Company run by outdated Sr. Leadership with no regard for work/home life balance. Poor pay & awful conditions heavy nepotism  no matter how many achievements here & your professionalism Supervisors & Site Manager promotion & raises based in nepotism. Outdated technology & building. No decent cafeteria or breakroom to truly rejuvenate. No PTO & every year pile on heavier workload to those not related to manager. all of us had to wear coat & blanket all day past 3 Winters lack of heat.  Blazing hot in ""office"" rest of  yr. Heavy discriminatory practices against  employees no matter how outstanding their work.  Company refuses to invest in infrastructure Terrible place...RUN don't even consider working here!!!!! OMG  VWR needs to wake up & join 21st Century. Such arrogant incompetent leaders."
bad,"To be honest even though my job ended in the Brisbane call center since they moved to Visalia, the work environment was difficult. The job when I first started was good but with all the changes the management starting not caring. At one point they would give us bonuses, we have Christmas Parties, computer reimbursements but they took away everything from us. It was nice to have those things especially if you were working your butt off, that showed ""we care"". The Team Leads was nice and knowlegable, in Brisbane. We had the best people in that office, the other offices were rude and just one hand full cared. The rest was there for a pay check. I really feel sorry for the customers. I guess that is why ThermoFisher will soon take over everything and give VWR the left overs. It was more the upper management that really did not care. I could see how customers would get frustrated especially when the Combatia(India) office started doing faxes for us. Alot of stuff got messed up but that is just when things really just went down hill. I am not mad because of the layoff because we all have choices but this place is a joke."
bad,"VWR started out as a nice enough place to work; management overall seemed invested in employees, there were activities for staff to be involved in. Its a lively work place. "
bad,There is no growth within the company and favoritism is clearly in play with who they use in different roles. The supervisors are quick to girl the employees under the bus in hopes management will look at them approvingly. Run from this company if you have any hopes of growing with a company.
bad,"Company doesn't value its employees for the most part. Only a select few yes men are hand picked to promote despite their work ethics. Other than that, there is very little room for advancement. Expect long mandatory hours. During the summer 11-12 hour days are regular. Very few long term employees due to low wages and under appreciation."
bad,"At the beginning, management will act as if you are the most important person in the company.  DO NOT BELIEVE IT!!!  They are the most cut-throat group of people that you could ever meet.  "
bad,Boys club!!! If you are a man you can get away with just about anything. Stealing time from the company by clocking out while driving home. Lying to customers. lying about your female co workers. Upper Management is only concerned about there own performance. Better to take out the squeaky wheel.
bad,This company does not treat you as human beings they treat you as numbers and robots. A couple of the supervisors are manipulative and will stab you in the back quicker than you can blink an eye. Human Resources is against you and not for you. If you wanted to be treated like less than a human and work a ton of overtime then this is the company for you. Truthfully I don't know how the Warehouse is still running with a couple of the supervisors they have. The supervisor seem to get away with anything they want to and Human Resources is there to cover it up.
bad,"Worked at the Rouses Point facility when it was Anachemia.  The lab director was a real liberal nut, just could not handle listening to his liberal bull everyday."
bad,"The only positive thing I can say about this company is that the compensation was fairly decent.  "
bad,"As a material handler we are treated less then nothing considering the fact that we are a dime a dozen. The VWR company I work for is the only one with a Union... a weak union at that! We have two Tears, Tear 1 are the $22 hr rate and Tear 2 is the $12 hr rate and our max out rate under this new 5 year contract is $17 hr. Now I know that dosnt sound to bad due to this ecanomic crisis we're in but they constantly hire and fire and there's no job sercurity or advancements what so ever with this company."
bad,The job turned out to be totally different from what I was offered at before I joint the company.
bad,"Low pay, poor management, lack of advancement, very high employee turnover, unorganized, supervisors tend to micro-manage but do not have the on site knowledge of the logistics to perform efficiently."
bad,"My position was busy,fast paced,fixing coworkers and production order developers mistakes daily as I worked at a fast pace to complete my own workload"
bad,VWR has a fast pace working environment . Working for VWR really makes one appreciate a great company from a bad one . Vwr International is not the great company .Healthcare benefits are good along with co workers . Paid holidays are plentiful and weekends off .
bad,"We call it ""Big hat not cattle syndrome"". A culture of trying to show how smart and talented they are, but fail to execute on anything. Endless meetings where nothing is accomplished and projects are never completed. "
bad,"They lied in the job description instead of call centre they said customer service rep. And after finishing the three weeks training discover that you login on the phone the whole day with phone set ,(all day) "
bad,"he does not have enough knowledge to answer questions and forbid you from being a go getter. Yelling and no respect to anyone, only his way or no way."
bad,This place is only for those who have no job and need one..long hours little pay and bad management. Only yes men get good treatment. Alot of turnover including management who either get fired or quit..this place is union now and if your for the union they treat you bad.
bad,I learned the job the hard way with no formal training. I developed my skills as an individual .
bad,Vwr Bridgeport is very backwards .... Management does whatever they want and treat the lower workers like they are children ... Use the employees Christmas party money for a breakfast with santa for their own kids and friends kids then leave the worker to a terrible lunch consisting of cheap food.... HR woman can barely spell her name and consistently avoids your questions and leaves unanswered .... Sad !
bad,This could be a good company but it has a horrible culture in senior management and very little sense of direction.
bad,Once was a great company that cared about its employees. They started to care more about saving money for the IPO than anything else. Laid off best employees and sent their jobs overseas
bad,VWR was a very good company.  Once it was acquired by Avantor it went down hill quick. it has become a slash and burn to go public again. Not a place to work if you want a career.
bad,"If there was ever a company that required a union this is one. The company in no way supports or helps develop their workers. The bottom line is the customer. There is absolutly no leadership at VWR in Misissauga.  There is also a very poisenous culture in the warehouse. little or no training is provided. One of the lead hands is so disrespectful. Totally unaporoachable and a gross lack of professionalism is expressed by him. "
bad,"not a very good company to work for turn over rate is getting high, supervisor wont step up. Alot of procedures that are put in place are not being followed."
bad,"low pay. Incompetent management. Dangerous chemicals. There is a real problem finding employees for the manufacturing due to terrible conditions, unsafe equipment, and low pay."
bad,"Management style is walk through say hello and never see them again unless THEY need something. The VP lurks around, literally hiding behind the plants to see if anyone is not working, then goes and tattles to the persons immediate supervisor. Stay away. No where to move up."
bad,"Job in VWR was initially stimulating and people was considerered a plus. "
bad,"You'd think working at Intel was fun.  The idea is anyway, the job is, well... let's just say it's not very challenging work."
bad,If you only care about being a material handler it a decent job. Poor management and lack of opportunities to move up are the major negatives. They dont like minority's
bad,"The culture has changed where it is more about the companies needs and the bottom financial line than about taking care of their employees, which is their greatest asset.  It's more important to hire new people because they don't have to pay for the years' of value and knowledge they provide.  It's very sad and not motivating at all."
bad,"After the sale to Avantor the work environment has deteriorated. Many folks leaving due to fear of unstable environment. Overwhelming backorders and very lean work force. "
bad,"If you are okay with being treated as one more employee who is insignificant to management, then work here."
bad,"Worked there for A year and a half. Management was horrible and HR could care less all she wanted was to hang out in her office and eat. Pay is garbage, but the worst of all is the Management, nit-picking, lieing, all to save them selves. I would not recommend anyone to work here."
bad,"VWR is an established leader in the Scientific Industry who is currently experiencing high-turnover/low-morale from the top-down.  Internal restructuring in advance of the company going public, poor decisions, and lack of resources have created a leadership and rep-level talent exodus."
bad,"Poison culture.  Clueless leadership who has lost touch with customers.  Decisions made on opinions and not facts, but focus on who to blame when the decision blows up in their face, as it has for the last 3 years over and over and over (see Brisbane for example).  Soul left with all the recent defections and non-boys-club forced defections."
bad,"more concerned about the ""numbers"" than the people who work there. Making production requirements more important than discussing the problems that keep the employees from making their requirements."
bad,I worked for this company for 8 years. I was one of two who were the lowest paid individuals in the whole plant. So much so that corporate had to step in and increase our pay by almost a dollar.
bad,"In my situation i was performing ok,until they moved me .Of course they say only for 3 weeks....And they ended up giving out my position.Also no team work,it was bad atmosphere.Bearly took my brakes i was on the floor constantly."
bad,"poor management, old equipment,very hazardous materials, bad culture, small building, not enough hours or pay. The hardest part of the job is learning how to deal with all the young adults they hire"
bad,"This was a good company to work for, the people were nice and helpful.  They will help with any problems and give you advice and help with customers and any issues that may rise."
bad,I check orders for accuracy as well as integrity of packaging prior to shipment. Retrieve necessary certificates.
bad,"Management is always shifting blame to the little guy and they are constantly loosing good people because they don't treat them fairly."
bad,"rates out of reach /goals out of reach/none caring/managers don't no the job .and they don't want to learn ,its all numbers"
bad,no motivation from manager. no salary increment. very worst company. Careful about mass lay off. No sign when they are going to remove.
bad,"I was able to learn a lot while working at VWR & advance my career, however the current culture is quite negative. The opportunity for advancement is no longer available since VWR was acquired."
bad,Fast paced but stressful. Friendly environment. Always had support but lack of proper management. Provided food for the team but was normally once a month
bad,This company has a good business model but the managers here are not well trained or very good at getting the best work out of employees. Salaries are low for the indsutry and the chance to move internally is very limited.
bad,Very interesting offshore business but lack of control from Admin and Management based at local dept upon foreign coaches.
bad,Good co-workers! Excellent location. Friendly customers.
bad,"As a VWR Onsite Coordinator , my personal experience has not been good. Since day one I came into a hetic chaotic environment which I tried to make the best of but it doesn't seem to be working. I have been with the company for only 2months and I still have not been trained to perform the function of my job role/title. All of their process seem to be out dated and ""old school"" and that creates more stress than necessary. Most of the employees that I talk to here say they are ready to quit or something to that effect. Even the person who was designated to train me, quit my first week on the job!!"
bad,Management more worried about production numbers than staffing and training. Potential new hires are met with lack luster attitude from administration. Lucky to have a job mentality. New hires find out they must work a second job to meet the needs of raising a family.
bad,The company itself is a great place to work for. Day to day was your duty as well as helping other in specific areas
bad,"VWR International is a great company to work for if you don't have small children! The hours suck! U have to start out working 10am to 7pm. Majority of the time you don't get off the phone at exactly 7pm. So your SOL until your done with the customer. U have to work for the company a year before u can be put on the 'waiting list' for an earlier shift. Its stupid to put new employees fresh out of training to be monitored within the first month you work the company. "
bad,"A vouloir étre généraliste, le nombre d'articles créer trop de livraisons partielles"
bad,You are not rewarded for hard work and dedication. Empoyees have to awkwardly approach managers about pay increases. I woked over 8 years at this company and only received 3 minimal salary increases. Two of those increases required me to ask my manager. It is not an intellectually stimulating environment.
bad,"Has great benefits"
bad,"Review upcoming jobs that require CAD drawings.  Layout jobs according to clients requests which included, floor plans, elevations, specifications, and details.  All revisions to jobs checked by client.  All jobs required proposal drawings, shop drawings and final shop drawings."
bad,"Working for this company was interesting, as they never seemed to quite understand what was going on in their own workplace. We were contracted to another company, performing a relatively new service, and VWR never took the time to understand the actual processes, and therefore never learned how to deal with their associates in the proper way. VWR is a very immature company, trying to act like it is a big-time player. I don't think their executives understand how to manage to company that is in the center of a rapidly growing industry. I think it's too much for them. Also, being contracted to another company, we had two sets of rules to follow, and VWR didn't understand that the parent company's rules were just as important as our own. If something was against VWR's rules, yet was required by the parent company, it needed to be considered, but usually wasn't, due to the lack of education (and lack of willingness to educate themselves) the support staff had on the processes."
bad,"Co-workers were good people to be working with, management was not so good, the job duties were very easy"
bad,"*I have been working here for a full time "
good,Job Work Life balance is not good no advancement job culture need to change
good,I learned a lot about being a team player. My job was hard I loved all the people I worked with. Management was not good at all the hardest part of the job was supervisors not knowing their job.
good,Not really much possibility for advancement . Communication is a big problem that really has to be addressed if the company wants to move forward. Management also needs to plan ahead when making decisions and really looking forward
good,"Had a wonderful manager when first started. However, management changed multiple times and the manager that took over the account I was on, was not qualified for the role and was very non-supportive and would not take responsibility for the actions that caused many customer complaints."
good,Very hard fast paced contact center for scientificproducts.  1000's of products.  Monitored on calls.very nerve wracking too dtressful..left us 250 people high and dry
good,Work here only if u need to pay your bills badly. Not a good place to work.
good,"VWR always busy work, gives idea on typical project mangment skills. best for freshers to join to learn more. Fun activities are included. Good food id provided as well."
good,a typical day at work consists of a Varity of different materials from extremely hard to very dusty material that has to be processed and safely put into packaging. Its a hard job but steady and constant work. The best part of this job is getting off work!!!!
good,"its okay if its a job starter, mostly kids work their doing kid things nobody works so there is long hours to be worked everyday"
good,"Good company to work for for a young person needing the job experience, the staff is great depending on the location you go to. "
good,"Spent more time in meetings accomplishing nothing than we did actually doing our job.  Laptops are issued to salaried employees so that you have the ability to work day and night, and it is expected that you will do so.  Management at the Sanborn, NY location is very poor.  Little trust to do your job correctly, and much time is spent redoing what you have already done because you did not do it the way senior management would have done it.  Change for the better is not well received and tools purchased by the parent company to make your job more efficient and effective are not supported by the local senior management staff.  A lot of wasted time which is unfortunate because it could be a great company.  Location in Sanborn, NY is out of the way and there is high turnover."
good,"I'm a chemical technician and the best part about my job is I have a lot of free time. I can do homework, read, whatever I want. The bad part is VWR laid off a lot of people about a year ago and everyone feels like it may happen again. And those of us that stayed on the contract had to take a pay cut."
good,Need  a good make over with Managment team to many teirs for  the union not equal pay
good,"Worked on Intel site with Intel employees runiing basic Foup washing Tools, was often used for other special projects. Went through 3 managers in my 18 months."
good,I was laid off and my job ended There want any training so growth was difficult and management was inconsistant. Little education among co workers. The nicest thing about the job was working with good people and customer service with Intel employees
good,-Management is only concerned with metrics and the bottom line.
good,"It’s a job with very low pay. Management turnover is high, even with the new owner (recently bought out by Avantor). "
good,This was a nice company with a family atmosphere in spite of being a $2 Billion company. before CD&R purchased it.  Private Equity takes away benefits immediately and makes changes on a quarterly basis to maximize cash flow.  No fun.
good,"Honestly you never knew if it was going to be a busy day or not. Near the end of my three years it got to the point where I didn't know what my job was any more, because I had so many. The management did not want to listen to the people and would never fallow through on ideas. There was also unfair treatment some people would get scolded by some managers and some would get away with everything. I felt I had to pick up slack from other workers and was used and abused. They expected more out of some people then others. the management had issues with confronting people and treated the good employees bad."
good,"before emphasising -ve points, this is one of the best company I ever worked in 15 years of experience."
good,"A Typical Day at work "
good,"Stock room is ran like its the 70s. Pay is the absolute lowest in the industry. However, its stable and the schedule is great. Huge divide between team leads and tech in the field. It would be wise to invest in new technology and processes for inventory management as well as creating some sort of supervising technician position."
good,"Key to doing well is being able to connect with internal sales reps, external vendor reps while developing working relationships with customers. Most deals are transactional but need to develop long term customer business strategies."
good,"Call Center Job., Sat behind desk and answered phones, placed orders. Cancelled orders."
good,"Overall a good place to work.  Work/Life balance is a positive.  Recent acquisition has left the organization in a state of disarray while trying to develop the long term vision and strategy, and how to communicate that internally."
good,"We begin with morning meeting. The supervisors review the shipments with employees. We are told whether we will have a light, medium, or heavy amount of orders. We then select our equipment and harnesses. We complete safety checks of equipment and make sure our reach lifts are fully charged. We receive the orders for each pallet from the office and begin travelling to the location of each product. At aprox 15-30 ft high in the air we begin to stack pallets and scan each product. We place each pallet in the loading area when complete. Each pallet must be accurate and completed in a timely manner. At the end of each shift a safety check is done and equipment is placed in the correct areas."
good,"Depending on what is scheduled for the day, and how many people you have that day will make it a positive or negative day automatically. We're the only team in VWR who is GMP but we are compensated the same as everyone else. We have to biggest responsibility when it comes to keeping the GMP side of the building completely clean and ready for J&J to make the drug. However, when there are only 2 people to clean the entirety of the building because management continuously fails to hire new employees, and cannot hire good, hard working employees, that either quit after a month or do something to get themselves terminated the good employees are punished with 3 times the amount of work but no compensation for it."
good,"Couple of nice perks, great coworkers and health conscious employer. Offers opportunities to volunteer for outside organizations. Fast paced work environment."
good,"La empresa se dedica a la distribucion de material quimico ya "
good,A very good place to work and a place to learn many things. But the salary is a lil bit need to be compramised
good,De voordeel van deze bedrijf is dat het een internationale bedrijf is maar als service engineer moet man altijd de zelfde toestellen herstellen en die wordt na een priode vervelend.
good,"very challenging job. Considered it to be my ""career"" however the management structure was poor. You have ""Sales"" people managing customer service departments. They are ""sales' driven, not customer service related driven and they DON'T have your back!"
good,"Productive, and relaxed atmosphere. There are some times that you are required to stay long hours or come in during the evenings. They do allow working from home once you have established yourself. When days are slow you definitely feel it, but most times you can keep busy."
good,"Work is ever-changing.  Great deal of international connection for inter-office collaboration and meetings.  Increasingly expanding product sourcing as inventory needs expand.  Much collaboration with sales and suppliers.  The more I learn how to do, the more work I am able to include into my portfolio. The hardest part of the job is staying with changing trends on an international basis, as leadership changes.  The best part of working here, is learning and researching a massive product procurement ""world"" that, heretofore, was totally un-thought-of!"
good,"Bestellingen in SAP verwerken"
good,"Le  management, le recrutement et l'accompagnement des collaborateurs sont mes premiers moteurs. "
good,"empresa con gran cantidad de clientes y requisiciones esto hace un trabajo muy demandante y enriquecedor. De manera rutinaria se llevan a cabo visitas con clientes, asesorías, presentación de productos, elaboración de cotizaciones, resolución de problemas todo con un equipo de trabajo a espaldas."
good,Company ok just need something new. Company has a lot of ups and downs. Ok for younger people looking  for  A lot of physical work . The company has been sold 3 times in 2 years
good,"Ever since VWR went public, this company has made a lot of poor decisions."
good,"Poor, poor management, lots of favoritism where I was located. no official training. Benefits not explained at all caused issued with my paycheck. Hours were ok. pay ok, but everything else need major inprovements."
good,"I entered orders, or created quotes, from phone calls or emails. I worked with people in each department. I regularly liaised between customers, vendors, sales representatives and our warehouses."
good,It is a good company. Compensation and razes are low. They only increase your wages by 2.5%. The company just went public so they are trying to reduce expenses as much as possible. The culture is good
good,"A typical day at work for me is starting with a maintenance meeting. From there I start on my daily/ monthly preventative maintenance tasks. Sometimes there are more pressing matters and those become priority. Throughout the day I usually perform electrical and plumbing jobs as needed as well as inspections on equipment and machinery."
good,VWR was a good place to work. Sales teams were a pleasure to work with each day. Just went public last September. Working at VWR was a good experience. Many of the customers were a pleasure to work with each day. Management was supportive on certain projects. Most enjoyable part of the job was calling on New Customers each week.
good,Not enough communication with home office and people. Not enough support during the two year I worked there before they closed the lab.
good,"VWR hires good people who are wildly over-qualified for their positions and then pays them well below industry average. As a result, there is a constant turn-over in personnel. Upper management has completely changed in the year I have been there. "
good,"VWR provides excellent benefits and generous time off, However, the management is disorganized and expects the employees to function by there on own with little leadership. Though i must stress this was at the location I was at."
good,L'environnement est soigné et le personnel respecté
good,Job security is good but the incentives are very low.Politics in management and hard work is not at all recognised.Increase the allowance and hike percentage
good,"I worked there for two years it was great until they got bought out. They change processes everyday, a lot of favoritism lack of proper training. So far they been on a firing spree so good luck!"
good,"Ensuring integrity of all shipments for an international Company involved in the distribution of research laboratory products, with over 1,200,000 items in North America and Europe.

good,Cool hours only monday through friday . management doesnt always know what they are doing. Pay is not the best but have good benefits . got alot of experience and left
good,VWR was recently acquired by Avantor Sciences. Since that time the culture and workplace atmosphere has changed. Majority of the previous company champions have left. Many team members and employees that have n=been with company many years have left. The atmosphere has changed.
good,"Société en plein rachat par Avantor"
good,"New management; unsure of direction"
good,Management wasn't ready to move in to the clinical diagnostics role during my tenure.  Legal wasn't ready to indemnify contracts that were necessary to operate in the acute care hospital space.
good,"Trabajo en equipo, aprendi sap, aprendi a pronosticos de cobranza, aprendi a llevar una cartera de 70 clientes."
good,"My typical day is clocking in, processing quotes and orders. Generating reports, conducting audits. Maintain 2 off site locations with products and general on site servicing. Mentoring another Ops Coordinator. Provide training, conduct inspections. What I like about my job is customer interaction, problem solving, and brainstorming. Being counted on to get things done."
good,Typical day would consist of completing orders for our customers. We would normally go into work not knowing what time we would be going home until it was 2 hours before our shift was over. The hardest part of the job was keeping a positive attitude.
good,"VWR is experiencing many changes and transitions recently from being a public company being bought to become a private firm. Their  Warehouse Management systems and processes are a few steps behind from the top world class distribution firms, nevertheless they are making efforts upgrading them, however changes are happening very slow. They value work-life balance in that is a positive aspect of the company."
good,"My day starts with opening all of my operating systems. Pulling orders sent via electronic, email etc and processing. Placing quotes via Salesforce, The days go by quickly due to the volume of requests received from sales reps and customers. The job is not hard, it is very detailed."
good,"They made go there 3 times for interviews, at the end, they said that the position is not longer available. What a waste of time, the position was for inventory coordinator controller and the rate was miserable, the good thing are the benefits, good company for someone who be still a student to start."
good,"Productive and Fun at work place."
good,"When the company was sold to a Venture Capitalist, management change made it a totally different company, and not a good company to work for."
good,"Big Place. Lots of different jobs and opportunities to move around to various departments or other company divisions. Definitely room for growth, especially with a science degree."
good,"Fun work place with supportive management, focused on building a great product and a great culture. Strong leadership."
good,Over all I enjoyed the position. Helping customers I already knew. Management was a challenge as there was a lack of leadership at times. I am sure it was resolved when a new manager came along.
good,The work environment was dreadful for the most part.   The main headquarters in Radnor was a nice building with an onsite gym and nice facilities.   The people who I worked around were decent for the most part.   My manager was a work-aholic who had no family with a live to work mentality.   Traveling and working weekends was expected and compensation time was minimal.
good,Worked as associate in Global cross reference team to find a alternate for lab products based on specification and matching application
good,j'ai requis de l’expérience dans le domaine de la gestion des stocks et différents modes d'emballage par rapport aux articles médicaux et produits chimique de la société.
good,Work was easy but not much for advancement with the company. Nepotism was running wild there and upper management did not seem to care much.
good,VWR customer care department is hands on.  You deal with the customers exclusively and learn per phone call.  There are opportunity to work in other specific customer call environments.  Many people who started out on phones worked their way into management roles and sales positions.  It makes use of your customer service skills and you have to work through issues.  Patience is needed.
good,"Good working environment "
good,"Not a great company, very little opportunity for advancement."
good,Working on the onsite services team is helpful to the customer but can at times feel distant from the actual company.
good,"UNDER STAFF, co worker not helping out each other, there's times when you are left by yourself to load our own trucks"
good,Vwr is a fast pas job great place to work for the people are great as well
good,a good work place...friendly and people are family oriented..
good,The work place is a hostile place to work. The management style is poor.
good,"Steady forty hours and gave me a chance, but had to quit because i was going back to high school."
good,"When I started it was so different than when I left after 17 years. VWR cared only about the company and not the employee "
good,I genuinely enjoyed working at VWR. The work wasn't too demanding and it was fairly easy to hit your numbers as long as you stayed focused. Managers are good about doing anything they can to help you improve and the HR is extremely attentive whenever you come to them with work related questions or concerns.
good,five minute woke out then I go to my station and wait for the builders put the kits together then I check it to make sure it is correct I also go around to all of the stations and count the record kits ever hour .
good,"Not a bad company to work for, plenty of Places for advancement across the world. Competitive salaries For all team members. Great benefits and a wonderful 401(k)"
good,"There were 30 employees at one time, now there are 16, those left are expected to pick up the slack cross training & performing many jobs without the proper compensation, with no new hiring happening. No career advancement opportunities. The staff does get along pretty well though."
good,"Recently the pace of change has outstripped the capacity to support the normal business functions along with the rapidly changing business and IS landscape.  Tools and resources are being removed while, at the same time, demands are being increased."
good,It is a decent place to work but also very impartial with it policies and people. working at VWR was a good learning experience but also very decent place as well.
good,This is a high volume call center the calls start when you log into the system and generally do not stop until your shift ends. The good thing is that the people calling are from the science world and they know what they want. The business culture is decent and people and management are fair.
good,during my time at VWR it was a good working environment the people there were very helpful and friendly however towards the end of my employment people began to get laid off and more pressure on the people still there merit increase was never updated
good,"I was hired to come aboard the VWR Catalyst Team last year after obtaining my college degree.  Over the past year, I enjoyed coming to work along with a great mulitude of people at the customer site.  My VWR Colleague, and the employees at the customer site made it very easy to talk to if I had any work-related issues.  However, in April I received word that my position at the customer site would be coming to an end due to the customer going in another direction.  I'm glad the news was brought to me in advance to plan ahead for the future.  I was lucky enough to be interviewed for two open positions in the Raleigh area...One of them a closer commute for me.  A week after my layoff, my supervisor contacted me and basically said that I would be attending a meet and greet session a few days later for that position, but two weeks later they decided to go with another candidate.  That news was basically a slap in my face.  If you are looking for a job with security and wanting growth within the company, VWR is not the place for it."
good,My biggest opportunity is my long commute!  If I could cut out my hours in traffic and work from home 3 days a week I would be satisfied!
good,"I think VWR was a great place to begin my career, but I'm ready to move on. They have difficulty retaining young talent, most move on within their first few years, and some departments have much higher turnover than others. Opportunities for advancement are limited, and there is no clear path for advancement with the company. "
good,"VWR is a company that has good benefits and stable work environment.They do have great work hours for people that prefer to work Monday through Friday and get out of work by 5:pm  What the company lacks is the ability to promote and advance their employee's. If you are looking for a company to learn and grow your abilities with, VWR would be a place to start your career."
good,"Repetitive duties, great hours, extended benefits offered."
good,"I have been with my company for 8 years and know my job well.  I work independently and now, I am working remote for my company.  The hardest part of my job right now is not being in the office after so many years of being able to get up and go speak to anyone face to face, I now have to work smarter."
good,"It is a good platform for the beginers."
good,Loved working there. Hate they moved overseas. Great company to work for.

good,"Sadia,ótima empresa"
good,Good place to work. Must be quick to make quota on a daily basis. Plenty of opportunity for advancement within the facility. Great people to work with.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is working with associates who genuinely care about their jobs and are willing to help each other when possible.  I enjoy the stability of the workforce, especially on my team.  I have 10 folks who work for me and at least 4 of them have 10+ years of service with our company. "
good,The most enjoyable part of my job as a material handler was the work itself I loved my job and the execution of in and getting my orders 100% correct.
good,"A typical day at work was usually not very stressful. "
good,Good company to start in if you are younger and willing to travel for advancement.  They will help pay for schooling and have a great intranet with many tools to help you succeed.
good,Management was extremely nice.  However: There was not enough room for advancement and the pay could have been a little better.
good,The people is one of the main reasons I stayed with this company for 30+years but the culture changed in the last 10 years.  Good people either left or were let go.
good,"Management and co-workers are the best."
good,"Each day at VWR, I would visit my customers in a life science laboratory.  I would strive to learn about their process, and exactly what they were trying to accomplish in their lab.  It was exciting to learn bits and pieces of research throughout my territory, and to be a resource to my customers.  As I represented over 400,000 products, I worked my best to customize my sales to a customer's needs; so that they would not be overwhelmed by the vastness of the available options."
good,"I have never hesitated to go to the company whatever the time and which day it is. My day will not complete without meeting my people. Its fun and a good place to carve yourself. I have learned how to manage People,Process and Performance with out any pain. Friday will be the most hardest and enjoyable part of the job.One we will have more fun because of less volume and the other part, For the next two days we cannot have fun at work"
good,i picked packed and shipped hazmat chemicals. i liked working for this company . great salary and hours. benefits were excelent
good,"i enjoy working for this company.  I am a technician for vwr catalyst.  A typical day at work consists of running the autoclave machine, glass wash machine, and dryer.  I learned gmp's, sop's and how very important it is to follow all rules and regulations. Management and my co workers are all very good people to work with.  If i ever had a problem with anything someone from my team always came to help or guide me in the right path. There isnt to many hard things about my job. I enjoy the most that the company im currnetly workin for is very understanding.  If you have any problems with the job or life they always have a helping hand extended out to me."
good,High stress environment but you get a feeling self-satisfaction at the end of the day.
good,"Productive and  like speaking with the and engaging with customers and salesman. I took between 80 to 100 calls a day at time. I answered  questions, placed orders, provided pricing information. Contacted suppliers and customers about orders placed."
good,"The GM is an awesome guy who goes out of his way for his employees. The only downfall is the fact that its Food Service, so you are limited to the minimal opportunities for advancement."
good,"Repetitive, high-accuracy placement, no flexibility for hours, irregular and limited breaks, always on feet (standing full shift), hours way too long, regular staff not particularly friendly to the temporaries.."
good,"VWR is a great company to work for, in general terms. If the daily tasks are accomplished, it is the company one would retire from.  However, monotony is king, like on an assembly line. Even if the job description contain less than 8 hours on the phone, your Dr. appointments will still depends of the hours allotted to all. Great benefits!!! Too bad you can't use them. I had Dental insurance and was unable to go for a cleaning more than once in 6 years. "
good,"This company was about to be sold, so there was a big rush to improve sales.  For me, it was a lot of hours, developing software tools to improve sales."
good,"Good Company, fun to work with and great compensation. After 5 years, no advancement opportunities. Management said the opportunity was coming but it just never seemed to materialize. The only reason I left was for advancement with another company and other incentives. I would recommend VWR as a great place to start a career in sales focused on the Pharma and Biotech markets."
good,Priority was placed on doing things cheaply at VWR. The associates on the same banding as me were low paid and unskilled so the work suffered. This was a pervading theme until you reached management hiring.
good,Seems to take on the Avantor model of churn and burn thru people. It has been a very high turnover since the acquisition. VWR was a great company would have worked there until I retired. But the new culture is that everyone is replaceable and it shows with how they treat folks.
good,"Active employees could survive well. Process knowledge and innovations are highly appreciated. "
good,"VWR International is a good place to work with a few downfalls. Management is extremely busy so they are rarely available and have limited information regarding their team members. They are accurately described as project managers, not supervisors as there are very limited leadership skills and training.. My co-workers are great friends and make the job enjoyable. There is a lot of sales-enabling, but lack of compensation for the support. There is very limited room for advancement unless you move outside of customer service and move into sales or become an on-site. The benefits are awesome and start your first day."
good,The company is a good one to work for and they offer some great benefits. The holiday schedule is great. They have terrible communication issues with all employees and departments and their rules on how a tardy is handled is ridiculous.
good,VWR has great hours and the option sometimes to work from home. Managers are helpful and I have enjoyed working under them. I would recommend working here.
good,"Had opportunity to work with high level technical staffs and directly worked with the stake holders and the Pan Asia and US Tech Managers , which was a lovely learning experience."
good,"This organization was constantly getting bought out by organizations.  It made it very stressful about job security,  Not enough support from management."
good,I enjoyed working for my old supervisor but ever since the supervisors were switched. The quality of management has went down hill. The work enviroment is more of a joke than an actual professional business. The first year that I was there was amazing management was top notch and was very well organized. The last two months I have worked there has been the complete opposite.
good,Competitive workplace were we constantly learn in various fields for our clients benefits while promoting the manufacturers latest state-of-the-art products.
good,"While the job was well paying and had very reasonable benefits, management was somewhat difficult to deal with. All of the clients were very pleasurable to work with, which was very enjoyable."
good,I learned a lot at VWR. This place is great for anyone wanting to get their foot in the door for lab work. I recommended VWR to family members. Good place to work.

good,The hours I worked when I was there were the best hours I could ask for.  I worked 7:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.  I was able to get on the road home before a lot of the other companies were letting their workers go so I was able to get home before the traffic was too bad.
good,"Was a great company very much enjoyed working there till they moved"
good,"Hectic schedule"

good,"Good work/life balance if you get your job done in a timely manner"
good,"I like working in our team. Our work is pretty busy and stressful. I am dealing with new challenges and new fields everyday. It's a learning journey. My co-workers are the most hard working people in our company, especially from now on till the end of the year, most of the teammates are required for 2 or 3 times internatinal auditing travel. This work really needs a big commitment to work but I love their positive and passinate attitude."

good,"process and return products that malfunctioned, wrote reports, answered phones, helped clients choose appropriate products for the procedures they plan to run."
good,"Training and management are developmentally challenged. Probably a result of limited resources, attention to issues and size.  Otherwise, a good company with good people."
good,"The job is tough and demanding, but the connections and camaraderie you gain with your coworkers often makes the job fun and interesting, and a fairly fast day. The only downside is that this job consumes much of your week, as the hours are very odd and begin/end with the day, leaving you little time to do much else during work weeks."
good,"I worked at VWR for almost ten years, and while I enjoyed my daily tasks and the customers I worked with, the management was not always willing to provide opportunity for advancement."
good,"When I first applied for the receiving technician position at VWR I was thinking outside of the box. A different job then what I was use to. "
good,"Een fijn bedrijf , echter zijn de doorgroeimogelijkheden beperkt waardoor ik verder zoek buiten de organisatie"
good,Good stepping stone. Co workers were ok knowledgeable of job. Hardest part of job was to not engage in the politics or let them get you down. Most enjoyable part of the job was satisfying the customer and enhancing the reputation of the company.

good,"Productive and casual work environment. "
good,I gained experience in leading and managing remote associates on several continents.

good,I really liked working there but there wasn't alot of room for advancement in maintenance. I took alot away from the experience and my manager was incredibly involved. For the first year I was the only mechanic so the workload was pretty heavy. The best part was knowing that everything there was due to my hard work and dedication.
good,"Close quarter company offices and cubes very small, pay was low for project managers in the construction industry. 45 minute lunch all employees would take at the same time and the office would shut down."
good,VWR as a whole is an awesome company but the managers and the team leaders in the customer service coimbatore shared service center is the worst in the entire corporate industry.Apart from that the company is good.
