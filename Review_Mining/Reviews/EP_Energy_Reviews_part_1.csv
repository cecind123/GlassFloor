bad,I absolutely hated working for EP Energy due to the stressful workdays and disruptive management. We had to worry about whether or not we would have a job the next morning due to sketchy management. The hardest part of the job was trying to take care of 60-70wells and be in town 25miles away for different meetings by 11am.
bad,"After a complete overhaul of upper management, vacation, work structure and more, people want to leave and are hoping for a package. Management now wants teams to alternate the number of days in the office so that everybody can share desk space.  There is unlimited vacation, which means the hard workers will be dumped on the ones who play the game will enjoy LOTS of vacation days.  I feel bad for the hard workers because they will be slammed with work, not recognized and underpaid.  It used to be a good company to work for."
bad,EP Energy continues to overcome the aftermath of being purchased by Kinder-Morgan.
good,"I arrive at 7:00 AM prepared to work. Gathered all the paperwork from the Lease Operators, and various invoices from the vendors from the day before and sorted then filed.  My job position was at the front desk to answer and direct phone calls, stop and talk to all the visitors and vendors throughout the day while doing my daily duties.  Some of the small businesses gave me their invoices to scan and enter in the DO2 billing system to our corporate office in Houston."
good,"Pay is great and people are great to work with."
good,All field personnel worked well together. Decisions in the most part were allowed be handled in the field. Field level management was supportive and easy to work with.
good,"Highly structured, multi-layered organization that was almost cut throat on advancement. Recommendations were hard to push thru because of micro-management from above."
good,"The company is great and the leadership is awesome. However, I would not recommend working in the company's HR department. There are power struggles among the inexperienced young, female leaders and the interaction between their areas is non-existent. Upper management is aware of this, but turns a blind eye to this behavior. In addition, the company is making changes to it's once great benefits, making this company just another cost-focused organization. Perhaps this is due to the company now being owned by private equity firms? The future is uncertain at this company and the outlook is bleak."
good,"My time with EP was short but I enjoyed working there. Ep is a very safety oriented company and it was at the hear of all their policies."
good,Some of the best people I have worked with are at EPE. Lean organization with opportunity to learn new skills.
good,"Liked the flat structure that allowed an employee to impact the business.  Upper management grew up in oilfield and lacks people management finesse; amateur approach to managing/treating people.  Management can be ""bubba"" sometimes."

good,I have learned alot working at EP. It is a good company overall.
good,Very aggressive and innovative. Very good for work life balance
good,"Decent job to work. When oil prices fell, they cut everything. They had a lot of layoffs. They cut a lot of foundation programs. "
good,"Enjoyable and comfortable working environment. Management is concerned about employees, but difficult to locate when there are questions. Communication is infrequent with management. Fine people, however layoffs are too frequent."

good,"The company is filled with a lot of great people, unfortunately there have been so many layoffs due to the company's  struggling financial situation, that the people who are now left are feeling overworked and concerned that they may be laid off next."
good,Good company but upper management very scared to make decisions. CEO is very smart and makes important decisions and wants to be informed of what field and teams need.

good,"I enjoyed the position I was in as an Sr. Engineering Tech.  "
good,Working on a daily basis was enjoyable and the stress level was very low.The personnel at EP energy was great to work with and i would work for them again.
good,"Before the low Oil prices, EP was exciting and interesting due to the many new oil wells being drilled and brought into Production so quickly.  All departments were extremely busy and buzzing.  I always enjoyed my work, my co-workers, my immediate Supervisor and our Manager.  Top Management was always looking for ways to grow the company.  But with the low oil prices things had to change.  I'm sure once the prices go up, EP will once again be a great place to work and grow.  I do believe, they have made all the necessary decisions to secure a future for EP Energy in the Oil & Gas Industry."

good,"Great Learning Experience. Was exposed to completion operations in the Haynesville and Altamont fields. Employees are hard working, but very personable and willing to help each other."
good,"I believe this company has the right ideas as far as business in the oil industry.  I enjoyed my employment for the past 3 years and found it difficult to leave.  I do however, think the company could do more with less if it were to keep automation in the forefront of its operations."
good,"Employees driven company such as award employees to keep fit, and quarterly employee fun day, send analyst to participate in monthly industry meeting and yearly conference."
good,I learned a great deal at EP Energy. The people were very courteous and hard working.

good,There was a lot to learn from hardware to software usage. A lot of workers who were working over there for a time period now were such a help in the process of learning and understanding. Generally it was a good experience.
good,"EP is a small E&P Company with good benefits. I enjoyed working for the company but had to leave for personal family reasons. Everyone is helpful and you are not micromanaged, but you are expected to get your work done."
good,Since EP Energy was bought out by Cantera. I was able to continue to work with my same Supervisors and Team. So I had the pleasure of working under a safe and steady enviroment
good,Fast pace environment with interaction between all levels of management.  Up to date technology providing training in all levels of computer system.  Self driven allowing employees to do the job and seek out other projects.
good,"I learned most of the ground work of Records Management at Shell.  Back then, we used microfilm and I led that group as well as being supervisor of records for Land Administration; G&G Records, Logs, Seismic and Maps.   Met life long friends at Shell.  Work was fun, interesting and always filled with learning about the oil business."
