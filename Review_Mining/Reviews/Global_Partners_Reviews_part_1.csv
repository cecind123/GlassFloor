bad,"The manager at the location I was employed at has zero understanding of work/life balance. she expects you to never make a mistake, to allow her to work you into the ground without complaint, and to be a literal machine with no feelings or thoughts. She will scream, throw things, and manipulate her employees  and in the sake of saving hours she will round down to avoid OT."
bad,"If you want to work for a company that constantly undervalues its employees, has off-the-charts mico-managing problems, has managers who continuously blame their own department members for mistakes, and a seriously horrendous turnover rate, then this is the job for you!  "
bad,"I currently work for Global and I must say that over all they are a great company, however it depends on title and location. They have history of selling stores and having to find employee's other locations to work at, moving up in the company is a chore, half the time you apply for a position and go through interview, secretly they already have someone for the job, and they wont even tell you. So I recommend that if applying for cashier, then you will do fine. Management, forget it!"
bad,"This company at the hq level is one of the most toxic environments to work in.  Employees are expected to work extra hours without compensation. Employees are not given the proper adequate tools to do their job. Management attitudes vary but for the most part they are not good leaders and don't communicate anything. Managers are quick to lay blame with their team than take responsibility for not training them properly.  Be prepared to be written up for trumped up reasons. Seems a lot like Gulf corporate in that respect.  If you are a woman expect to be harrassed and insulted, the practices range from subtle to blunt and those who make offenses are never reprimanded. The gossip wagon is always full.  The cruel, rude and lewd behavior go on day in and day out.  If you are a man chances are you will have a better experience.  The only good thing about this company is....oh wait, never mind.  Stay away.  Sooner or later a lawsuit will happen that will make the news and maybe then they may take policies and procedures more seriously.  Until then the company will still bleed money hiring inept management and lose decent quality employees."
bad,"Global is growing company that continues to purchase convenience store chains. with no structure or no how. Many employees are treated unfairly. pay is poor. if you were part of a purchase, if you come in new they will pay more for management. People with no experience were offered up $30.000 more a year than current management purchased. Also  promises made to new acquires never happened. several offers reneged. I was with XtraMart 8 years before the purchase.Global got to big for them to control. Office has no clue about whats happening at store level. HR is not for the employees."
bad,They pay you a lot to keep you happy and quiet. Never work for this company. HR is terrible. No one has any ideas what they are doing. TERRIBLE WORK ENVIRONMENT!!!!
bad,"If you like being overworked, and underpaid this place is for you. If you're a cashier none of the management cares about you. They call daily with new, redundant, tasks that you are forced to comply with, or you risk getting written up. You make minimum wage no matter how hard you work, and annual raises are less then  $.25 an hour. Trying to move up in this company is basically impossible. They will tell you they want you to succeed, but it's not true at all. Basically, don't waste your time or your effort."
bad,"This is the most poorly managed company I ever worked for.  In addition to being inept, management turns a blind eye to (and even promotes) in-your-face favoritism. It's a toxic environment made tenable for a short period by the fact that there is a minority of good, hard working people.  Easily the worst experience of my life."
bad,This job field is a poor one at best and doesn't work well with you even know they will tell you that. The days weren't good and they try to get you to come in on a day you requested off they don't care about you it isn't a good place I hated every minute I was there
bad,"Direct management constantly belittles & harasses the employees.   Derogatory statements are made on a regular basis.  Upper management knows of the problem yet chooses to look the other way, which only condones the behavior.  No understanding of how to treat the employees properly.  NO RESPECT, yet they want respect in return.  Employees are constantly asked to perform work that puts the worker DIRECTLY into an unsafe condition.  When employees determine conditions are unsafe, they are belittled & treated as they are not completing a job duty in lieu of addressing the safety concerns of the employees.  Safety is only addressed if it's ""in  the budget"".  Workplace appearance is deplorable.  Direct management blatantly abuses company policies without concern of repercussions.  Ratings are a 1 only because a 0 or less can't be given."
bad,"I need to except out of this negative review the boss who hired me then left and a couple of my esteem colleagues. "
bad,"My experience was something beyond terrible, something verging on the surreal.  Simply, I've never seen adults behave so badly, not outside of a reality t.v. show.  And I'm not speaking of the bizarre behavior of people at the (compulsory) sponsored parties."
bad,They allow customers to treat you poorly and they take their side over yours. The store cameras should have sound. The upper management should probably get out of the office and spend days in busy seasonal stores before they pass judgment.
bad,"Manager was horrible, didn’t tell her employees when they did a good job, messed up scheduling horribly, wasn’t kind to all customers, customers would complain of manager not completing tasks and blaming it on her staff. Being the former assistant manager and having all my customers love me I was wrongfully let go and would NEVER recommend working here."
bad,"Stepping into Global was like stepping through the looking glass, but far worse -- the Mad Hatter would have been considerably easier to deal with."
bad,without a shadow of a doubt the worst company I've ever worked for. You a no more than a number and they will drop you like a rock without any notice if you inconvenience them at all.
bad,"When I worked for Global I learned so much. I learned a lot of positive things that I will benefit from for my future endeavors. I loved my customer connection and the “home” sense from seeing the same people everyday. Along with my employees. That being said, the upper management and HR services are a complete mess and there is a serious lack of communication, compassion, logic, and reason. Along with gross misuse of power and discrimination when it comes to mental heath and family needs."
bad,"The place is a circus. At least it's run like a circus.  Difference is that circuses are supposed to be funny, or at least entertaining."
bad,More interested in saving a penny today than making a dollar this week. Understaffed to the extreme. Cheap out on equipment so it breaks on a monthly basis. Massive corporate structure that won't take responsibility for anything.
bad,Working here used to be ok.  Now it’s s total nightmare. Constant scrutiny from a nasty manager who only speaks to the supervisors and team leads (who are equally miserable). The most poorly managed company.   Witch hunts are the regular in my department. Human Resource “business partner” pals around with management so no one will have your back when you are the hunted.  RUN!
bad,When my manager was working me 7 days a week and fixing my time so she wouldnt have overtime the corp did NOTHING about it. This particular manager is very corrupt and doesnt even put in her required hours for salary.
bad,"Terrible place to work.  The management is unbelievably bad and the other employees are just cogs in a machine.  My group was looked down upon and essentially ignored.  Our group never received resources to further development and were chastised for poor performance.  The CEO does not know what he is doing.  They did pay me well, but that is the only positive."
bad,"This was the worst place I have ever worked. Management micro-manages and is always out to get someone. The AR and Retail team have terrible turnover because the managers are AWFUL!! No one stays for longer than a year. If you can, AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS. While it is ""okay"" pay for being fresh out of college, the stress and ""high-school"" like management are awful. No one has a clue what they are doing. Do yourself a favor and do not temp here, do not pursue a full-time career there. If you do.. good luck."
bad,This company use to be great until they brought in a VP from  a Big box company  and he  put all his people  in positions of power and  held back the  people who built the company. no  future with this company .
bad,"This company only cares about certain employees, and if you are on site at a c-store, you will be worked until you break with no appreciation shown by superiors. The higher level management has no idea what happens on site and no help is offered until it is too late to do any good."
bad,"The culture in this place is on a negative declining slope. When I first started I was excited, until reality set in. They pay well for the most part, but what you have to deal with as an employee is not worth the trouble. If you are not upper management prepare to feel disrespected and be totally out of the loop on processes and changes until **** hits the fan. And when **** hits the fan, prepare to be at fault somehow some way."
bad,"The last few stores I worked for at global were honey farms. The management was pretty easy going at both stores, but only really cared about themselves.. I've met a lot of pretty cool people that I worked with. The pay isnt great and advancement is kind of a dead end you only get a dollar more as a shift lead or assistant. Global is corporate so its minimum wage and you definitely feel like your disposable."
bad,"Successful despite much of the management.  Conservative financial management ensures continued fiscal success, but puts a great deal of stress on individuals to ""do more with less""."
bad,"This place has a lot of workers that has a good working skills. The lower points of working here are lack of proper training, your opinion don't count sometime, too many procedures that don't make senses, lack of incentive that should be equivalent with work load, lack of effective project management and business process on taking acquisition of other companies and develop into the company culture  and etc."
bad,"Upper management and management seems to have their communcation issues, but the biggest stumbling block for communication is between the store managers and lower level employees. In my year at the Athol Massachusetts store, we have had two managers and four assistant managers, as each position has had to be refilled at least once. Upper management had been informed several times about the horrific treatment our first manager was giving us, but it took them six months to do anything about it, and when they did... they only transferred this manager instead of demoting or firing them. Corporate policies are often counter-productive to how things are typically done, and will leave each employee wondering why they waste their life working for them."
bad,"Very unorganized.  The left hand has no idea what the right hand is doing. There is no long term plan that makes sense, bonuses are paid months late.  (yes Months late) Employees are poorly paid."
bad,"The job title for this company is not what it seems. It should be titled store monitor or babysitter. You do not use any accounting skills at this company. Unless you work in the GL department (privileged section) where no one in the other department's knows what they do and they make up their own hours. Management is clueless. There is no communication between management and employees, until after changes are made. I gave the work life balance a 4 out of 5 only because they took away overtime at the company so they force you out at 5pm. They pay you dirt for a dirt job. Everyone entry level is per hour employee. No salaries. There is no job security there because its a swinging door company. People come in, with high hopes of moving up, they realize that management only moves up the ""brown nose people"" and then your doing the same mundane thing week after week, month after month. Its a pointless and dead end job. That is why people leave and they fill the spots so quickly. Job culture is good, because the employees there are great, they make the place so much more enjoyable. They really should form a union for employees there so upper management and HR cannot treat them like garbage. That is another point, HR is USELESS. They will never, ever, ever, (did I make that point clear) side with the employee. Going to discuss any issue with management or another department is useless, the issue gets brushed under the carpet. There are 2 HR ladies for a company with 500+ employees. How does that make sense? Like you will read from other reviews, its management that makes this company"
bad,"Co workers were very good in general. The sales managers ranged from fair to terrible. One of my managers was the worst I ever encountered and there are now scores of former employees who would agree. Why upper management would not intervene to improve the atmosphere calls their judgement into question. Bottom line - when you allow managers to behave boorishly, the best people will leave, because they always have other  options. The ones that stay keep there mouths shut and carry on."
bad,not very compassionate company for being privately held - too many meetings - meeting to have more meetings - big dog chasing tail atmosphere....eating up the little guys - not a fun place
bad,"High employee turnover because they talk like they want to help you succeed. But are only on point with you if a mistake happens. Then they berate you. factory atmosphere, one hand doesn't know what the other is doing and don't care"
bad,"As managment  u r required allot of work.  Very timely no matter what, which can make it very stressful day if something goes wrong. U don't have 1 second to sit down so don't count on a break."
good,"slow quiet atmosphere."
good,"There are many things that are great about Global, but there are too many unnecessary demands of employees that create job loss or walk outs. "
good,"Would have made a great manager."
good,Good company to work for they have good  management  at store level and there salary wages is good they offer benefits and you can always progress  within the company
good,"I hate a thief and even if you take a candy bar to me that is stealing, Not clocking out when you should is stealing timer to me also. I play by the books and I find that most people try and take advantage where they work. Coming in late clocking out late to get more time.. I despise  things like that,"
good,I already did a review so dont feel like writing another one. good breaks. definitely 9-5 job that can be a job just to tie you over to your next job.
good,"A typical day involves a lot of ad hoc reporting, monthly reporting, and some random projects.  For the most part, the job is easy.  Management is still figuring out what they are trying to accomplish and the company is definitely going through a transition."
good,There was a broken structure within some departments and a lot of neglect to major issues. Eat day was very much the same with deadlines being pushed back and little collaboration. Management took great advantage of their freedom and little notice to what changes needed to happen.
good,"good outlook on company "
good,Good work/life balance. Lack of communication within the different departments of the company. .......................................................
good,"Company pays good but can be stressful at times.  Staff is nice, management at store level are nice. Good in between job to get through school or you find a better job."
good,"Que sigan así excelente "
good,"was a friendly place to work, good pay and benefits, but the training was awful - I basically trained myself. offered some continuing education which was a plus."

good,"Ok Company. Nothing special.  Pay is average. Environment is getting better, but not a hip place to work by any means."
good,"Great place to work.  People are fully committed to what they are doing.  The pace is tough, but the environment is positive overall.  No complaints from me."
good,"Working for Global Partners, from experience, is a great opportunity for those directly exiting college. It is an extremely fast-paced environment, which forces one to adapt quickly. Fortunately, there is an abundance of exceptionally knowledgeable individuals to help guide your progress."
good,Given very encouraging opportunities to implement ideas and evaluate the scope of project before development. Work life balance is good. Very career oriented
good,Everyone loves what they do here and invest a lot of time and effort into their work to make sure that it meets and exceeds expectations. Able to work from home because a good amount of work can be done on the computer.
good,If you need a job its right for you.  The Employees for the most part all think they are the manager.  I cant say its a bad job its just not a good job.  Different stores in the same cities pay different starting wages.
good,"I like working for Global, however, I do not feel as though there is many opportunities to advance within the company. I really enjoy working with the customers and my co-workers."
good,"Pros: Good Team Members, Great Location, Balanced work hours unless crunch time."
good,Fantastic place to work. The Management and staff are great to work with. Great opportunities for career advancement and development.
good,"Global is a fast growing company and is therefore involved in a very positive culture shift. Its exciting to be here right now.   I work at the home office and the company does a lot for it's associates - raffles, perks (car detailing done on site!), free smoothies...the environment is open and conducive to learning.  My co-workers are open to change and everyone I know here is a really hard worker.  I'm happy at Global."
good,"lots of grow potential "
good,I enjoyed my time working for Global.  I learned a lot in the short time I worked there.  My decision to leave was solely due to returning to my previous career.
good,"Working within the oil and petroleum industry is something completely different if you have never experienced it before. That being said, great place."

good,Global Partners is a great place to work and the management is very supportive. The culture is focused on getting your work done and ensuring your customers are satisfied.
good,"This was a summer position which I learned about corporate industries.  I enjoyed the staff.  The travel was too much for me to continue on to a full-time position."
good,"Family owned business when I started working there, but became public after approx. 15 years into my work career there and everything changed. The company then decided to reorganize and a few years later, a group of us lost our jobs in 2008, along  with so many others in the country. It is a shame they went public, it seemed to be the downfall for so many employees."
good,You will like it here. Good people who like their jobs. Managers are not overbearing. Manageable work schedule. Good Benefits and extras along the way to help team building.
good,"Terrific people, great environment. Passionate, smart employees. Fast paced work, constantly something new, Very caring about their own employees"

good,"Awesome, good company  recommend working there   Please apply there, conitnue to work there, it is great company, great company great company  please apply there"
good,"Learned a lot about the company and gives a great overall understanding of of the company and its history. Was a great learning experience and first internship. Really friendly work environment and they make an active effort to have interns interact with executives and higher-ups, so you can forge important relationships."
good,"Good place to work, good pay"
good,Global Partners LP is a most honorable company with excellent working culture and environment. I have learned a lot about how data is really important if managed and properly served for decision makers at the right time and place.
good,"I am essentially a cashier at this store and all I really do is just ring up customers for whatever they need whether it be gas or convenience store products. When I'm not ringing up customers I am cleaning, maintaining the store as well as stocking and front-facing products."
good,"Developed a sales team to market gasoline in New England through independent dealers which were branded by a major oil company. Each prospective customer required a large investment for pumps, tanks, canopy resulting in a long-term supply contract. In addition to new business we had to manage renewals of each account to ensure long-term growth."
good,Global Partners is by far the best place to work for.  I only left this place because of my law school. I will miss this place dearly.
