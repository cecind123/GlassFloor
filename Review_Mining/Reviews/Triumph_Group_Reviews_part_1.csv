rating,review
bad,The management and Human Resources department is a complete failure at that site. Fellow employees are what you will miss the most out of that place. However the pay rate is not worth the stress.
bad,"This is a gehetto place with no benefits.the owners will hire anybody.it didn't take long to see.thet never have coverage.you will be stuck with all the work.no time off because you gotta find your own coverage."
bad,You have no place here if you don't plan on banging the back of your head on the underside of the managers desks. Biggest bunch of liars I've met in my life.
bad,"Very good company but this location is full of Africans and if you not a butt kisser  "
bad,/management poor management/ lack of experience educated arrogant closed mind no leadership skills  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
bad,"Their human resources people must have applied on their knees, because as far as their job duties are concerned, they are useless. Management cares nothing for their employees. I saw people promoted that barely deserved a job, and talent unappreciated. Good people walking out after years of hard work because of the lack of appreciation."
bad,Managers know nothing and listen to nothing. They have stupid problems that they don’t fix because they are too busy licking boots and the entire place is driven by egos that walk around with an undeserved since of accomplishment. The place is nothing but an annoying headache. Not worth the time or energy.
bad,I worked here 14 years and made a lot of money. I was laid off twice and out 5 months for strike one year. I had vehicles repossessed and a home foreclosed on due to corporate instability. Not a nice company to their employees employees
bad,"Triumph is a place that'll beg you to work many hours, then the moment you have something to do they treat you as if you don't care about the company."
bad,"Management is embarrassing."
bad,"Used to love my job, but after the last year and a half to two years there has been a significant downturn with a majority of it being a high turnover. The rest is the management has great ideas, that we have tried in the past but are not wanting to hear its people."
bad,"Benefits used to be competitive, but now insurance is extremely expensive for subpar coverage. Rarely gives good raises to those on the floor, despite boasting record sales. Typically work 6 days a week, sometimes 7, with no thanks or recognition."
bad,The hours and pay were good as far as everything else i would not reccomend this place to any mechanic the turnaround rate was high management was focused on how they looked and not how the company was ran no one showed you anything they throw you out to the sharks and expect you to produce highly with no training
bad,"They took on too much work from Lockheed without being staffed up for it - I don't know what the drug deal was that went down before I came to work there, but when I was not able to pick up the pieces of their mis-guided deal I was shown the door.  What a screwed-up place this is.  Too bad!"
bad,"company is losing money therefore everything is difficult. All expenditures are watched to the point of shutting down operations, because simply suppliers are not there."
bad,"I applied to multiple job openings, for most of which I had over 70% of the required skills and education."
bad,not organized and very unfair towards employees that were no their favorites. Not a good place for educated employees to thrive and advance. Poor management
bad,Don’t work here. Management is terrible. Quality is terrible. Pay is bad. People are lazy. It’s not worth the headache. It’s a very stressful. Need more money.
bad,This company is very unprofessional. We did not get paid on time. At times management did not seem like they knew what was going on. When the company decided to leave the location they told everyone on the last day before they shut the doors.
bad,"Never know what hours I will be working,where I will be working etc. Money is good ,but moral is bad,people are not treated equally."
bad,"Great place to work. Good benefits, great people. lots of overtime was required to get the job done. We were just a small business acquired with a larger number of bigger companies that did the same processes as we did. Corporate thought it we be best to merge some of the smaller businesses with the larger ones, and ours was one of those businesses that was combined, leaving a lot of displaced workers."
bad,"Poor management, poor business decisions, terrible communication between management, HR and employees. Scheduling is rigid, part delays are blamed on employees. Overtime is either limited, absent completely or mandatory. No operational balance."
bad,"Pésima empresa en todos los sentidos,  ambiente laboral discriminatorio, prestaciones bajas,  oportunidades de empleo para la gente lambiscona y no para la que tiene aptitudes, actitudes, perfiles y  conocimiento. Sueldo bajo."
bad,I have worked for Northrop Grumman aircraft for 7.5 years but name has changed 4 times as an aircraft mechanic and inspector.
bad,This is by far the worst company I've ever seen. They will literally not pay you. Like they will just not send you a pay check or your paycheck will bounce. You will work 80 hours and get paid for 10. You will NOT get paid commission because they will find every reason on planet earth not to pay you. They break labor laws left and right. It's a horrible place to work.
bad,"poor management,causing unhappy employees....poor moral,owners are more concered buying companies for the contracts ..and do not care about the employees or there jobs...nothing but bean counters"
bad,The company at its center only cares about revenue and not the service it provides. Negligence is common especially in salary to the employees. It is not rare to be paid incorrectly or late.
bad,It Has been over a year that I have worked for this company. I have tried countless times and still come up fruitless trying to receive payment from my 3 months there. I have had a lawyer get in touch with them and after one year they still have not been in touch with me or compensated me for the work I did for them.
bad,There are some really great people working for the company. I think the management would have to change in order for this to be the awesome a company. I would like to see that change
bad,"The culture is terrible. Bunch of back stabbers. Management has no idea what is going on and are a biggest part of the problem. No paperwork or work instructions to do your job. No engineers to help."
bad,"Company is not financially stable and current leadership has not been able to turn it around in more then 3 years, stock prices continue to fall.  No ones job is secure."
bad,"Typical day begins with a morning meeting letting us know how far behind master schedule we are but cannot show the numbers to back this, even though not 1 shipment has missed scheduled ship date. I learned how to keep my head down and try to make it through the workday."
bad,Disappointing management of this company. There was no lack of opportunities to improve but lack of vision and shortsightedness keeps this company down
bad,Director of contracts is a nasty person. You are set up to fail. Little to no training. Co-workers are so busy trying to save their jobs that they can't take the time to help. Too many responsibilities are dumped on new people with zero help from leadership.
bad,No leadership lack of leadership bad pay scale did I say no leadership ? Would not recommend working there if you need to make good money for hard work
bad,let me put it this way they pick and choose who they want to do wrong by management no matter how long you work there or how good of a employee you were
bad,"Get the money walking in or get .25 cents average/year there after. Terrible management team. Always yelling, sceaming about stupid stuff. Make you work on Sunday without telling you ahead of time.   If you don't have to don't work there.  Most employees hates their job because of managers.   If you want oldtime jobshop mentality then it is for you."
bad,"I worked for this company for 30 years. Most of my time was spent looking for the proper tools due to a lack of inventory & troubleshooting the work performed the day before due to the inexperience of the shop floor mechanics, who seem not to understand the basics of building aircraft. I learned lean six sigma & process control are valuable tools in any manufacturing operations. My co-workers are great, they thirst for knowledge however the mid-level and upper management lacks the experience & leadership skills required to enable their crew to succeed. Nepotism is rampant in this company. The hardest part of the job was performing Root Cause Corrective Action on non-conformance as most issues not only had a Root Cause but many contributing causes. They have created a culture of build the part first, then look at the specifications to see if they built it correctly. The most enjoyable part of this job was reaching my thirty years, even though my pension froze & they require me to work six more years before I can draw my pension."
bad,This company was recently purchased and is in the midst of a complete overhaul.
bad,A clueless management with not a single managerial degree among them. They do not know how to effectively manage people at this company. There is a lot tension between the union and management. Mandatory 32 hours of overtime a month is pretty much the norm. The work it's self is very repetitious and repetitive stress injuries are common.  I don't believe this is the best place to develop a career in the  aerospace industry. Other than that the coworkers there were very nice to work with.
bad,"The hardest job i had in my whole life."
bad,I don't recommend working here at all. All management cares about is making themselves look good while screwing you over. Plenty of overtime but it comes at a price. You are just a number and easily replaced according to them. Of you take pride in your work and are even good at it run from this place. You will be the most abused person there
bad,"This company had poor management, lack of communication, we received CC almost all the time, never had parts for our job, but had to work 7 days for 10 hours even if you had nothing to do. Poor union, no point of having one. The HR department, all they did was use their note pads and shake their head when you reported a problem. Don’t wok here."
bad,"easy place to work its a walk in the park.we were constantly being trained on things that had nothing to do with our job ,felt like i was in third grade.i would go weeks without seeing a manager. seems like they like to hire ex military,everybody calling you ser and walking around saluting ."
bad,Triumph group bought Fairchild Controls and it's been down hill from that point. Moving all production from Frederick MD to Hartford CT. While working for Fairchild Controls everyone was treated with respect and advancement came easy. But once Triumph took over their main goal was to close up the facility and move it.
bad,Not a well atmosphere place to work. They are hired $12-13 in with no experience instead of keeping $20 +.Will never recommended anyone to work there.
bad,"If you are going to apply there remember that word, 5/10's and sat and Sunday 8 hr.'s. Mandatory If you don't show up you're supervisor will be texting you, or calling you.Training non existing you are own your own. you get two 8 minute brakes and one 28 minutes lunch. Mechanics on general are helpful and professional, can't say that about the supervisors. I seen several mechanics just walk off the job,  Glad I was able to find another job and give my two weeks notice. Culture has to change, If not program will go somewhere else."
bad,"Management is inconsistent and creates paperwork for paperwork.   They fire people to ""save money"" and then force the remaining employees to work mandatory OT.  Salaried employees are expected to work 45 hours a week, while ""donating"" 5 hours for FREE.  Factor that in to your salary before accepting!"
bad,Triumph don't treat  you as a person.they only want machine's to work seven day's a week all year round. And if you want to take off on the weekend they will hold it against you.
bad,"I joined the Vought Aircraft Industries family in 2007 unaware, of the company's position, was like a plane, run out of fuel at 30,000 ft. in the air, as the union and company fought like megalomaniacal captains mad for control; oblivious that the vessel hurtling at great speed towards the earth, which sadly crashed and burned with a merger with a smaller company."
bad,"Once Triumph bought out Vought Aircraft,  they've ran this fine company into the ground. "
bad,"Horrible management.  Favorites or buddy buddy system firmly in place , low pay for job, under cover racist environmental,  job performance holds no weight come layoff time if ur not a favorite or in the buddy buddy crowd u get laid off...no security...keep looking .i promise u that u will thank me later. There are much better jobs to be had."
bad,"Most the workers have a ""click"" if you dont fit in they will force you out.  They all smoke pot.  The HR is horrible and the main boss just flirts with the HR."
bad,"The Good Ole Boy Network is still running strong.  The company has lost sight of keeping existing programs and getting new work.  Seems they would rather beat up and threaten the employees instead of helping.  Asking leadership for help will get you in trouble instead of assistance.  They expect everyone to be experts without providing training.  CEO focus is on the larger sites and manages the other sites with outside consultants instead of getting his hands dirty.  Everyone is scared of losing their job and the site closing.  Many people here are hyper-sensitive which make a toxic work environment unless you are one of the ""good ole boys.""  Watch what you say and who you say it to as there are ears everywhere."
bad,They lie to you from day 1.  I was told I'd be getting a raise after 90 days didn't happen.   I had 4 different managers in 6 months.  No training or continuing education.   After a year and driving down their back log they brought in a new guy for less money and laid me off after the work was done.   Stay far away unless you're a machinist.
bad,"The culture is terrible. Bunch of back stabbers. Management has no idea what is going on and are a large part of the problem. No paperwork or work instructions to do your job. No engineers to help."
bad,Triumph is an okay place to get some experience. It is nothing more than the decaying workforce of Vought. Moral is low and any areas of improvement are crowded with mediocrity. The long term goals of the company are not shared with employees leaving employees feeling isolated and unappreciated. Job roles are undefined and ambiguous. Doesn't seem like management knows what to do or how to get there.
bad,Never good enough. Treated like a child. Stay away if you can. You make some of the most important parts in Aerospace and they act like you are expected to run five machines without a mistake. The lead supervisor has an inferior complex.
bad,"Horrible place to work compared to other companies in the DFW, management will easily a company of this size if executives don't wake up and become more innovative. This isn't the 70s 80, 90s anymore!"
bad,Great pay but for the work being done but management is very unorganized and don't have proper people skills to get the people to work for them it's low morale and the tool control is a huge issue no accountability for the tools or an organized tool box. No proper ppe i.e  when grinding on composites they should be supplying respirators or proper equipment
bad,Always busy lots of work. Alot more cons than pros. Always get made promises but the promises always get broken. I have been working there almost 3 years i do PrePreg laminating and the repair/rework for them. I want to learn more but they do not give you the chance.
bad,"I'll first say I'm not a disgruntled employee bashing this employee. I'm grateful for working here and earning the salary I have and it's allowed me a very good living for me and my family thoughout the years but through the Triumph rein it's evolved into one of the worst employers to work for. All the other owners previously had at least treated their employees with respect and dignity."
bad,"Managers and leads are not on the same page, no communication company wide.  Have a pay scale from the 1980's, health benefits will cost you half your paycheck every payday.  No raises to speak of.  They promise you the moon and you get nothing."
bad,Very unorganized. Would change your shift at any time with no warning. Switched managers every few weeks. Worked people a lot of hours.   Needed more stability for management positions.
bad,"Little to no room for advancement. If you are good at what you do you will be in that position for many years with out a possibility of advancement. Promises are made with no intention of follow-through.  The General Managers and supervisors are not held to their word and break the law, and company policy often.  There is no recourse."
bad,HR Director plays favorites as well as department heads.  There is no room for advancement for anyone else.  Additional duties are constantly doled out and merit increases are insulting.  Morale is at an all-time low.
bad,"They relied heavily on contract engineers but that was a revolving door. They'd lay off some engineers (or the smart ones would leave for better opportunities) in any given week, then process new-hire contractors the same week. They lost valuable employees with project knowledge that way, causing some duplication of effort as new hires were unaware of what had been tried and rejected in the past. Some direct employees would spend half the day goofing off, with no accountability. Then contractors had to make up the work for them.  Leads often set engineers on the wrong path then wondered why the work was delayed."
bad,This company has spun out of control since incompetent corporate managers have took over.  They are getting rid of good people and empowering the manipulators and dishonest managers.
bad,The  CEO is impressive but he could benefit from a refresh of his leadership team. Leadership team is not diverse or inclusive. Employees were not respected.
bad,"A typical day at work is Management telling its employees how behind schedule we are or how bad were doing no matter how hard the crew works were always behind."
bad,There is no more to say on this . The people are good but they must continue to conduct their workday with inadequate tools and training to meet tight deadlines  and with Extremely tight margins and the movement of the majority of their standards to Mexico it  does not provide a  sustainable future.
bad,This company is in the process of a total overhaul and it more than shows! In order to be well received at this company you have to wiggle into the boys club and do as your told. If your a person that thinks for themselves and makes decisions on your own this is not the place for you. Yelling and cursing by upper management at lower level salaried employees in front of hourly employees as well in daily meetings and threatening their jobs on a constant basis is certainly not the best environment to work in. I did enjoy interacting with my co-workers. I found my position to be dead end as there is no advancement opportunity except for a lead position.
bad,"Lost of our social programs fitness programs lost incentives morale and productivity went down.  Loss of contracts, begin hiring people with no type of experience."
bad,I have seen a lot of managers hired in with no aviation experience that lasted only a few months. in my department which I have worked for one year there have been 5 managers come and go. my day varies from 5:18 am to 5:00 pm and sometimes till 11 pm.
bad,"Triumph Interiors LLC was a great place to learn different skills, to be able to work in different departments,which made people able to work as a team."
bad,"People are great to work with, however upper management doesn't have their act together. Unorganized,unprofessional and favoritism being shown, good ole boy attitude of work."
bad,"you can learn alot about bombardier products."
bad,as a contractor I did not receive benefits but all in all it was a great place to work. I worked 10 hour days. I was given assignments and left alone to do the work and there was never any conflict with co employees or with management.
bad,"Triumph is a great place to work people are nice and the work is good very busy at times"
bad,"Once one of the best manufacturing jobs in Nashville, now just a husk of its former glory days.  Years of corporate buy outs and sell offs, lost projects, poor management and a union that protects the mediocre, lazy and infirm have milked this poor old cow dry."
bad,Too many contractor. They treat their contractor with more respect then their direct employees.... management sucks always depend on lead. Thats why company is moving... never work at truimph company again.
bad,"I was terminated after I got denied short term disability through Liberty Mutual. The insurance was through triumph. Rather than contact Liberty, my doctor, or myself to get the proof that they SHOULD need to make a determination like that, they terminated me-THREE days after I contacted them about coming back to work and what paperwork that i needed to procure."
bad,"a lot of good people but management is clueless on many things. Very high stress place to work , a lot of people pushing each other to keep things moving . Have to be ready to take an butt  chewing cause it happens a lot . High turn over rate"
bad,Work repetitive work and you had to do overtime or you would not make it.
bad,"The Stuart, FL plant needs to be purchased by an actual aircraft company. All management from supervisors up need to be replaced by professionals with at least a basic understanding operations, leadership, and communication."
bad,"not a fun place to rewarding environment to work at."
bad,"It was a very easy job,  but the good ole boy network is driving moral and the company down. The pay is not on par with the industry. Management does not respect the employees."
bad,Leadership and management team is unable to provide vision further than 1 year into future and execute projects within planned schedule. Wholesale management change required for entire division to remain in business.
bad,"Primitive and amateurish management structure.  Chronically over-worked with under-staffed, under-supported resources across the board."
bad,"i was training to do one of the most skilled jobs that takes at least a year to learn, however, thats ok if the trainers negative attitudes and tendency to give up on you after a matter of weeks is anything to go by because they keep getting in unexperienced people so the attention is turned to them, and before you know it your learning nothing and lots of mistakes are made, they also whine they dont get paid enough and therefore cannot be bothered. Production output is not good and therefore the customer is not happy, The management have no clue how to run the place its probably the worst ive ever worked for. They don't value employees, i even experienced bullying and having complained about it, it was brushed under the table and nothing come of it, it happened again and i eventually left. Thats quite common apparently. There is constant bickering, finger pointing, an argumentative blame culture that you so easily get caught up in. The best part of the job was my colleagues, lots of nice people who are far to good for that place, but thats a small part of what you have to put up with. You won't get a good work/life balance here as all new people are being placed on 24hr rotating shifts. Go for it if you dont mind being under valued, with barely a payrise or other opportunities."
bad,I learned hard work doesn't always pay off at this establishment. Your supervisor isn't there to help as much as He is to insure you are doing worse than He is. The only enjoyable aspect of the job is the constant smoke breaks. The most difficult is dealing with ignorant individuals who spend more time messing stuff up than working.
bad,Worked at this company for 10 years I gained a lot of experience and knowledge.  Working 7 days a week for more than a year drove me away looking for stability
bad,"All the hourly workers are knowledgeable and will get the job done. If management intervenes which they almost always did, jobs would get stressful and take much longer than they should due to the lack of knowledge of management in a highly skilled industry."
bad,"a typical day at work is full of drama and tension. you are given different tasks through out the day that you are expected to do in an unrealistic time frame. management dose not care about employees at all and the hr team is there for the company's benefit not the employees. they say the more you are willing to learn the better off you will be for growth in the company, but every time you are willing to go to another department to learn more they want to decrease your wages."
bad,Currently there is high turnover due to consolidating and poor management. Most of the people are great to work with unfortunately that number is dwindling due to high turnover. Your experience will vary from location to location and based on what your job function is. The company has tons of potential with the right people.
bad,Wanted to try something different and learn a new skill.  Was completely out of my league.  The noise could be unbearable at times even with ear plugs.
bad,"Upper management is clueless its all about schedule no real training for mechanics, they think you just put anyone on the floor and expect them to succeed, get rid of upper management  and allow the first Levels to run the place."
bad,Triumph is a holding company that bought out Vought.  Departments are not given proper support staff and money is not invested in the aging tools and not available to attract a talented mechanic pool needed to be successful.  People train up for 2 years and move on.  Only those that still have a pension stay to retire.  Management is busy blaming each other and provide zero direction.
bad,"working 7 days a week with no room to breathe.  management only cares about getting the product out the door and not you as a human being.  Always gossip, at times I feel as though I am back in highschool."
bad,"Due to the economy, their is no stability. The most difficult part of the job is the lack of support. The organization is shiffting."
bad,Management has aloud a lot of bad behavior to go unchecked for a long time clocking in then leaving from contractors and directs. Some leave on ETO due back one week don’t get back for at least two should be job abandonment get made lead man with bump in pay
bad,Your job is on the line everyday if they could work you 365 days a year without a day off they would they have a oh your a contractor mentallly you come a dime a dozen
bad,"I was a Triumph for 5 years, with in those 5 years, I was laid off twice. After I was laid off the second time, was told they had another layoff.  They don't try to replace any projects with new ones,  Management don't have a clue of what's happening, if they did It would probably be better.  If Management don't wont you in a certain position, they find ways of demoting you. The money is great. But you'll to afraid to spend it.  You better bank as much as possible before you get the pink slip."
bad,"The company is going through a difficult time of restructuring it turnaround.  At the same time, the company is overlooking the employee and their needs."
bad,"Poor management.  There are people in positions that don't have the skill to be in those positions, but were awarded them because of their longevity with the company.  "
bad,Company is falling apart due to lack of morale and false hope directors bringing in friends and getting rid of the people who were making things happen.
bad,"Contractors are paid nearly triple of what a direct employee is paid to do the same job. A newly hired experienced aircraft mechanic / technician is lucky to get $ 12.00 per hour while contractors are paid upwards of $ 30.00 per hour to do the same work. The UAW Local 848 is present, but ineffective at this location. That being said the insurance benefits are very good, but that does not make up for the extremely low pay. Management pushes hard for completed work even though their big customer can't keep up with the demand for parts and has very poor planning. Quality of work suffers due to the constant pressure from management."
bad,"They did a mass hire- mass layoff and are severely struggling financially. The management is running around like chickens with their heads cut off and don't expect to be paid for the amount of work you do. They don't follow rules and regulations, don't care about employees as people (only as a number), don't know what anyone does and then expect you to drop everything if they want something done. They also give unrealistic deadlines and don't care if you call them out on anything."
bad,Life at Triumph Nashville revolves around fighting fires. Processes and procedures are carried over from the '80's.  Very little progress - No funding
bad,"very relaxed ,cut throat ,people didnt help . Maintance superviser very insecure ,wanted a person to take over just enough to do work but not enough to call itt his owen"
bad,"Managers and Supervisor do not listening and they do not make people feel valued."
bad,"Management doesn't know how to run the company, dog eat dog mentality, company got rid of the union, HR is quit to fire."
bad,"Very stressful environment in the Tempe office.  The Chandler facility was a much more desirable place of employment."
bad,"Was hired as Vought Aircraft Inc. employee; was bought out"
bad,"Horrible place for management "
bad,"Every year healthcare benefits keep getting worse. Pay is comparable to warehouses in the area(fruit warehouses). We as an Aviation industry should be blowing everything else out of the water as far as pay. Yearly goals keep going up, getting met, yet it’s tough to get a raise and a bonus. Upper management of course gets their bonuses no matter what."
bad,"People didn’t really know what they were doing and wages were low, nice amount of paid time off though. Upper management ignored most items you brought up for discussion and you were ignored."
bad,The management of the company was not intune with betterment of the company.  Everything was too easy going and everybody feared for their jobs.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
bad,"would not recommend this job to anyone, friends or relatives. Company does not know where its' going,if they knew where they were going,they wouldn't know how to get there."
bad,"I worked there for 33 years and the first 20 years were great, the place was booming with work people were happy, pay was good and the last 13 years things started go down hill and mean down hill. The management did care about the people started taking away different benefits that we had. They were playing favorites, upper management would hiring the friends that weren't qualified for their position and over paying them.  I had to retire because things got so bad."
bad,New management has recently taken over and they have no concept of work/life balance. It is evident locally and through corporate that employees are simply a number.  It is very challenging to implement any changes.  It’s a tough place to work as everyone seems to be unhappy and looking for jobs elsewhere. I don’t imagine it’s going to improve anytime soon.
bad,No desire to look for another job within the company. Management only promotes people they know from their previous companies instead of looking at the skills of their own personnel.  HR only works for upper management.
bad,"I am a contractor. I have been told that the week of April 23-27 will be my last week. At least I have gotten a weeks notice...Some direct employees were given only one day, some only half an hour."
bad,worst management I have ever seen at Triumph Composite Systems.The managers don't know whats going on because they don't know how to do the work so they don't know if the workers are doing their jobs.
bad,"used to love my job, but with so much uncertainty going on it is not a nice place anymore. No motivation and you feel you are a number not a valued employee."
bad,"Contracts intern after sophomore year"
bad,This company is a very bad example of how companies should be run. They stress efficiency regardless of quality.There is so much pressure put on employees to get the work done that it can frustrate the employee. Some of the supervisors have never been mechanics and do not understand what being a mechanic is like.
bad,"They don't listen to the ideas of their workers. Stuck in their old ways. Buddy system is major part of operations. "
bad,"Things aren't managed properly, there is a lot of bullying that goes on  and everyone feels underpaid. Not a lot of advancement and career progression. This company does not have any type of morale at all, everybody I know seems very sad to work here. It feels like we all have to walk around on eggshells for the fear of getting a discipline. This company messes up peoples lives, a lot of employees have had nervous breakdowns and some have had their overtime taken away.The hardest part of the job is actually getting through the 8 hours with my sanity, the job is actually quite easy minus the aggravation. I really enjoy molding components and getting them through the door."
bad,Management and operational problems.Went through eight supervisors in six and a half years.Upper management underbid the program and held the mechanics responsible. Boeing even sent their own team to the plant with no avail.Which in turn putting stress on the mechanics to meet deadlines thus causing more defects
bad,"Workplace culture is a joke.. the management needs some more training in my opinion. I wouldn't never recommended this job to a friend, or anyone who needed a job(toxic work place)!"
bad,"Recent take over has changed the company for the worse.  Seen many senior employees eliminated as reduction in force, while keeping the younger, lower paid employees.  Now all eliminations will be for what they call lack of performance so they don't have to pay severance package.  Another form of cost savings."
bad,"Aprendí demasiado en cuestión de coordinación de personal y lo que es el manejo de materiales recibo, embarques etc. ya que llegue a desempeñar mis funciones como coordinador de embarques."
bad,"Numbers, numbers, numbers!  Every day cell managers try to cram as much work out out the employees as possible. Fun to build different parts but since the management is moving the work to Mexico the atmosphere is poor to say the least. Lots of mandatory overtime every week regardless of previously made plans. HR is very poor, could care less about the employees even though they ""say"" they are there for you. Other co-workers were great to work with, very close nit group of people."
bad,Worked long hours in tight spaces with only 2 breaks per 12 hr day. If we were waiting for inspection they would have us sweep the same spots over and over instead of letting us take a break. They rush you to do jobs that most people are just learning to do which causes multiple failed inspections. Just very poorly managed. Good pay is only plus! If you have an A&P this is not the job for you.
bad,"Always running out of work. Send employees home every month with out pay."
bad,Terrible management. Downsizing problem. Stock price plunges to zero. Not recommended at all. Engineering manager is a kid! LOTS of issues in aerospace and aviation industries hiding from clients.
bad,"My typical days started with our morning meeting, and what would be the latest fire we had to put out in order to keep production going. Thru my 30 years plus there, I learned to quickly access the problem and the most efficient way to solve the problem. Management: lets not go there other than to say they were under constant pressure and the threat of losing their jobs was always there. I immensely enjoyed my co-workers as we worked together 30 or more years we all became close friends. The hardest part of the jobs was the constant unknown of what the future would bring. The most enjoyable part of the job other than the sense of competence and positive results of what you did, was I admit the pay as it was very good."
bad,"The Nashville, Tn plant is old and falling down. They have let technology pass them by a long time ago. Triumph seems to be letting this facility die because the hourly personnel are union. People don't work together, are rude and do not seem to care if the job gets done. Don't plan a future here."
bad,"I worked here for a very long time. When Triumph took over they changed what was a very good place to work to somewhere you dreaded coming to work every day. They put people in management positions that had NO business in being in those positions. Good ole boy system. I'm thankful for my many years there, but very disappointed in what they have become."
bad,Good work. Poor Management. Culture is cutthroat. Employees are highly unprofessional. Far too many non-value added employees. Weekend days boss is a slave driver.  Knowledge is intentionally withheld by senior employees.  Planning is nonexistent.
bad,No leadership or pride.mang.is so lost no training and no leadership company has terrible operator alot of mang don't care and employee do try just no teachers
bad,"Beginning with management it's a little creepy because they don't know how can handle business when they hire people with no knowledge at all about aero space just because they where in military service but don't how can apply their knowledge like program manager he don't communicate with production planner, engineering, shop supervisor and he always make change or adding jobs there no even there in house jobs still over mexico he add it as inside house and also he has a friend that he said he apply as a production planner and not as expeditor this guys make changes without know nothing about aerospace just because his body is program manager, it's bad to work with people like this ones, they set everything begins, but there is one more person general manager he is body with those 2 just mentioned they run everything bad everybody in the company is happy but they are very afraid to said something because they don't want to lose their job."
bad,I was there 28 years and when I was laid off there was a period of adjustment. Now I'm glad to be away from Triumph but know that I would not have the experience that I have if not for the company that owned and ran the place before Triumph
bad,The Owners hired a bunch of Ugandans and then worked them really hard for years and then hired a few white people that had worked at the place for year or two and then promoted the white people over people the Ugandans.
bad,"Big companies have lay offs, I get that. The issue here is seniority is better than any skill set. No matter how good you are at the task, anyone that hired in before you stays and you go.Can any company stay in business with that policy in present day competitive world? The real issue is some people that have been there 40+ years, could retire with full pensions, 401s and social security, they just won't leave. No life outside.. But that is only half the problem, some do nothing but drink coffee and shoot the bull all day, the others have lost drive or will to work, can not walk without a cane,  eye sight is gone and couldn't drill a straight hole with a drill block... And yet management has no plan to buy out, disqualify or stay on these people to get the schedule met. Too afraid of a lawsuit, or do not know how to go about the procedure to work the problem. Great company if you hired in 40 years ago. Can you imagine working with people that have never had another job in the real world, the mind set is unbelievable. There are good people there, and a few great supervisors. The great supervisors hands are tied by upper management head in the sand attitude."
bad,this place needs all new management. They need to wipe out all of them and start over. A lot of managers talk to the employees like they are dogs. No respect and screaming and yelling
bad,"The people I worked with were great, but it seemed that corporate decisions were made based on the bottom line not considering what it would do to the ability to actually produce product."
bad,Needs better management and raises more flexible with shifts and hours.  Hire from within and from experience not hiring supervisors employees have to train. Not forcing work to do multiple jobs with no compensation and forcing workers to work shifts they can't work
bad,"Triumph is NOT for those who enjoy learning or like to keep busy through out their day. (As far as hourly positions are concerned anyway) It is a union environment and entails all that goes with being such...Lay offs, good ole boy system, general overall bad attitude of workers, us against them attitude..."
bad,"I decided to leave Triumph because I feel like there is no more advancement for me.The managers did not seem to take serious employees. The more you worked, the more was expected of you, even at the cost of being demoted. I intend on having a job that the employer would appreciate the work that I do. I am very intelligent."
bad,Nothing special about working there.  Felt like the 10 years I didn't really gain much knowledge.  They paid well but in general was bored for much of my time there.
bad,Not profitable and no investment in employees.  Long term stability does not exist.  Poor leadership and lack of  policies.  Need leaders who are invested.
bad,Decent place to work until we got told that our plant is closing down! I worked here for 10 years only to find out I’m loosing my job due to our plant closing!
bad,overall there is a lot of pros and cons. this job is a good entry into aviation. the work itself is pretty simple. hours are not always steady. work is 6 days a week.
bad,Great company. Fun people to work with who know their stuff. Very interesting to see there way of operations. :(. A fantastic place to work every day.
bad,good people to work with safety great. I have learned how to drill  layout holes put it aircraft together. i know the does in don't.its a new place to work at close to home health care is great. we have a safety meeting every morning. plane on whats need to be done for that day
bad,"When I started as a data entry clerk, I was assigned to a trainer who never had much work for me to do. Other employees didn't have much for me to help with. After two weeks I was let go without warning or any sort of communication, was only told that I wasn't a good fit, despite doing all the work I was given at a good pace and with good quality. "
good,"Poor management, low job security, low wages, does not care about your home life. Machines I ran couldn’t hold a +-.020 tolerance. Poor new employee training, only thing good is they keep it about 68 degrees in summertime"
good,"Management changes every few months, which makes it impossible for real change. Many false promises, which leads to frustration. Instead of letting go bad hourly employees, they just shuffle them around and place them in other departments. No sense of urgency, though nearly all parts are late."
good,"Extensive knowledge of fuel cell maintenance, no job advancements, poor management and low pay, benefits are poor and sporadic schedule."
good,"My day to day duties vary based on workload, customer needs and company urgent issues if any.Management is uniquely structured and friendly placed. I enjoy working with all my co-workers. No consistency in site management is the hardest obstacle at the facility."
good,The corporate office only cares about the numbers and welfare of employees put on the back burner. The site management struggles to protect their employees' morale but the corporate office doesn't support that philosophy.
good,"Poor management, everything is an emergency, due to poor planning by the management."
good,"Operations management is very verbally abusive and combative.  After working 10+ hours a day there is  ""no thanks"" from management for your contributions."
good,Too many long hours no time for oneself   dirty workplace and unsanitary bathrooms     Management team is unfair and unpractical
good,"The men on the production floor gossip and throw people under the bus more then a teenage girl. Management is indecisive about how to more forward with programs, raises are far and few in between. They've lost a lot of good help to other aviation companies."
good,I had the best boss ever.  Director of Tech Ops supervised M&P Engineer.  He was well respected and knew the business better than most.  I survived first 6 lay-offs but last one got me after hiring director retired
good,"a decent place to work to start your career, but a terrible place to stay if you expect advancement.  Culture is supressive.  Complete turnover of management is needed."
good,"I worked for this facility for approximately a year, the position offered and accepted by me was a Temporary Full-Time position (Contract), that seemed indefinite. After the one year anniversary, I requested an approximate contract completion date, or if they have considered; Contract Extension, Employment Opportunity/Offer/Position with the company, or Termination. After a few times of requesting the time frame for the contract so that future employment plans could be determined, in the course of as many weeks, I never received an ETA from my supervisor or the HR (if applicable, the employees always seemed to be out on PTO). So I couldn't wait around for them to decide if and when they had any intentions of communicating this with me. They could've simply submitted a correspondence to inform me, that they were reviewing the contract, or disabled my facility access card. So I submitted my notice, even though the department that I was recruited for encouraged me to reconsider. With the gross and negligent lack of communication, I was treated without value and neglected to the point where I no longer felt like part of a team, let alone a cause."
good,The local branch is quite good but the organization is pretty divided up. Corporate refuses to give raises and benefits for sticking around long term.
good,Some managers are harder to deal with. Some times waiting on parts. Or other departments to catch up. Some times loss of turn times get old quick. Otherwise it's ok.
good,"Contractors are paid nearly triple of what a direct employee is paid to do the same job. A new, experienced aircraft mechanic / technician is lucky to get $ 12.00 per hour while contractors are paid upwards of $ 30.00 per hour to do the same work. The UAW Local 848 is present, but ineffective at this location. That being said the insurance benefits are very good, but that does not make up for the extremely low pay. Skilled labor isn't cheap, unless you work for Triumph."
good,definitely not a place to make friends that aren't interested in you. expectations were high and values were low. no room for increasing productivity.
good,"Triumph/Vought Aircraft has been a good company to work at, but due to the Boeing takeover in 2018 many are seeking jobs in the Aerospace Industry. I've worked with a great team of Manufacturing and Liasion Engineers, Planners, Mechanics, Procurement...etc group of employees who have helped me grow in my M.E. position."
good,"on a daily basis I would start off checking the computer to see how much work is ready for inspection than prioritize it and inspect what needs to be done immediately by printing out production work orders and communicating with the production supervisor and the aircraft mechanic to locate the area or part of the assembly that needs to be inspected. other than just inspection, I also write WTs (Withholding Tags) for either damaged parts or incorrectly installed assemblies that do not follow Engineering drawings, blueprints or written procedures performed by mechanics describing and explaining in writing how the defect was created to the Engineer to determine what is the best course of action in trying to correct the issue. I've learned to keep an open mind and always be willing to learn because things and events are always changing and don't always go according to plan, we must be ready to adjust and act accordingly to accomplish the goal at hand to satisfy the customers on time. my co-workers were always willing to assist and answer any questions I may have had. hardest part of the job was keeping up with the deadlines mainly due to lack of support from production supervisors and not enough inspectors. most enjoyable part of the job was being able to communicate with highly capable people from many departments either from Engineers or mechanics learning how to come up with solutions how to fix a defect."
good,"A typical day at work is loading jig,ribs and drilling and installing to blue print."
good,"This place is not that good."
good,If you are a independent contractor be prepared for a layoff without any advanced notice which is a common practice at Triumph. The place runs on a haphazard basis due to poor skill of the management causing a constant crisis for the employees to resolve on a daily basis.
good,"zero carriera, nessuna possibilità di crescita, stipendi bassi-"
good,Overall the people are very friendly but the company as a whole has a lot of growing and improving that needs to be done. Process's need to change along with the mindset.
good,need to get thru the changes and stabilize so focus can be on process improvements (change as needed) versus constant change. Great opportunity in the future.
good,"El ambiente por lo general es pesado y carente de cualquier cualquier cultura laboral."
good,"I learned a lot working as an intern for Triumph Aerostructres. The typical day was spent doing data analysis, and this helped me build my Microsoft Office skills. "
good,"I am able to learn how to operate the Roamer arm, which will just add to my Quality experience. Along with learning more about form 3's, and how to navigate Catia and read prints that have no specifications or tolerances on them. "
good,"Typically you have one higher up tell you one thing, and another tell you something else. Never get any praise when do good just when behind. They act like your replaceable and curse at you when upset unprofessional. I had 6 different managers because they come and go like program leads, and engineers the place unstable."
good,"The work place was really unprofessional in some areas and it felt uncomfortable working there.  Everyday there was about the same.  I felt like I never learned anything new.  Most days consisted of reading power points and doing what it said.  I enjoyed the person I worked directly under, but other than that the company culture was lacking.  The hardest part of the job was trying to get to know people because it was very unfriendly there.  The most enjoyable part was learning something useful."
good,"A typical day of work was fast pace with a lot of stress but also fun at times and challenging as well. communication and job awareness started the day with an opportunity for questions and feedback. stretching and work assignment. Management focused on company goals but gave little actual support and rather make excuses for their lack of effort and yet questioned you why things aren't getting done when they already know why. the most  difficult part of the day was getting thru all the Bull. I enjoyed my co-workers for the most part because the veterans understood what you were going thru and were usually helpful and concerned. I enjoyed what I did and the challenges my job provided but , I loathed the lack of management support and their lack of responsibility towards actual team support"
good,"Good place to work, fast pace,  must have previous accounting and Finance experience. quick close and must understand manufacturing and  service business"
good,"The pay is pretty good. Watch your own butt though. Dont worry about others. You'll end up on the chopping block without knowing it. Theres a lot of scavenging for parts that goes on that really shouldn't. And a lot of things that if an FAA inspector saw it, everyone in 100 feet of it would be fired."
good,"Great Employee's to work with. Most Technicians work well together and help each other to get the work done on time. There is so much, about machines, tools, etc., that you can learn by working here."
good,The writing was on the wall from the beginning. The company was being run or mis-managed very badly. Big changes needed to happened. The potential was there for a very profitable company.
good,Management communicates Company goals and policy deployments with updates.  Management open to listening to concerns and takes action to investigate and improve work situations.
good,"It had always been my dream to work in aerospace.  To be a part of the process that allows our insignificant species to travel across the globe in just a few hours.  This company squashed that out of me in roughly two years.  To be treated as a machine by a superior as they get ready to enjoy a 3 day weekend, told im to be working the next 2 weeks maybe 3 consecutively kills.  In just 2 years i had to leave, and ive never wanted to return there.  we used to have a shop joke called ""Going Triumph"", kinda like going postal but instead a hysterical fit akin to a mental break. Be it the exhaustion, stress, eroded self respect it happened at least once every pay period..."
good,"Love what I do as a mechanic just not thinking the company will last much longer with consistly losing contracts, we've also had more than 4 new general managers within the last 3 years"
good,This business unit or division was focused on research and development so it was very different from the rest of the Triumph Group.  The products and people were both good.  The situation change dramatically with new corporate management in 2015
good,Whole plant was shut down and distributed to other places due to Triumph Global's poor financial planning and old boy management style. Differential between production and management pay scales was shameful.
good,Triumph is a good company. Because of the position I was having to work 7 days a week and I had a travel time of 1 hour each way. This was more than what I had signed up for.
good,This is a numbers driven place. The employees does not matter as much as the numbers. There are a number of lay offs that happens each year. It is not a good place for job security
good,"There is no apparent job security and advancement with this company, while I worked there."
good,"Some overtime is required and work hours are set on a weekly basis."
good,"Triumph is an enjoyable place to work,  the sub level associates you interact with on a daily basis are great.Managers and above are lacking when it comes to mechanic interaction and understanding day to day operations."
good,"Es una buena empresa para trabajar y aprender cosas nuevas, la empresa es practicamente nueva y le falta afinar procesos en diferentes departamentos, los compañeros son agradables, a la gerencia le falta mas tacto con los empleados, pero en general buena empresa."
good,"The manager I was working for was not prepared for the job he was given and took his short comings out on other people.  Sometimes you have to lead and not just follow, assuming others can read your mind.  I decided I didn't have to stay where my skills weren't appreciated."
good,"Lacks training for new employees. However, lots of opportunity to continue your education."
good,"Not terrible, not great. All around mediocre. Fairly relaxed work atmosphere. Shop floor employees are mostly good people, which is the main thing that makes working there alright. Don't expect to be more than a number. Poor upper level management."
good,Good learning experience over the years to establish a solid career.
good,Manger sucks layed back with certain people letting people do what they want catching them smoking cigs in the shop and not telling them the rights from wrongs always a one sided person
good,"I dont recommend anyone working at triumph, it is a poorly miss managed company and due to their miss management they are a sinking ship as far as the aerostructures side is concered."
good,I Just want to work at a professional company where everyone works and gets along with good communication. The procedures and how they communicate needs to be addressed. Two many non productive things need to be looked into. Where i used to work at DFF Corp. we had a saying DO IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME... That gave us proffit sharing every 6 months.
good,"Opportunities for level changes and pay raises depend solely on who you know. Job descriptions outline very specific requirements, but the horrendously unqualified are usually the ones who receive these positions.  Advancement is based solely on nepotism."
good,This company promised that they would keep this program going and it was a retirement program but after only 3 yrs we were told the company is shutting down the olant in my area
good,"okay place to work. bad management. good people working there."
good,"Almost every employees at the Hawthorne site  questions the divisions management and communications."
good,"Working at Triumph has made me realize how hard companies will work you, but without compensation for all of the work you put in daily. I wouldn’t suggest working here if you’re looking for a career, however, if you’re just out of school, or looking for a little bit of money to help out with your family then I say go for it!"
good,My typical day would be going in and get my kit with my material and then get my tool and build my part. I learned how to build a lot of different types of aircraft parts. The hardest part of the job was working on the wings. I enjoyed working in the Rapid Ply department where I would cut the kits for the mechanics.
good,Triumph was trying to paid low wages to their hourly worker 90% were paid les than $15.00 per hour. there was no proper training for them and a lot of mistakes were happening.
good,Just watch your back and document everything. I'm currently right in the middle of rewriting my resume and this survey pops up. I cannot proceed with the resume because of it. this is very frustrating
good,"tough working with management."
good,"They give minimal training so you must be prepared to jump.in and run with job role. Minimal managment direction. High turn over. Most of time it's not direct hirw, you must go thru a temp agency."
good,Too much overtime. Poor application of lean principals but act like they're awesome at it. A lot of Management vs. Union tension. If you want to have an impact go somewhere else.
good,"I loved my job. Enjoyed my co workers. Enjoyed my schedule and the trust most of my supervisors had in my abilities to do my job. People on the floor were very often ignored and not consulted when decisions were being made that directly effected them. Due to this the moral was often very low, and frustrating at times. All in all I loved what I did and was very good at it. I needed very minimal over sight due to the fact my job allowed me to plan my day and work to the needs of the areas I supported. I left daily feeling a sense of accomplishment after seeing the amount of work Id gotten done. Hardest part of the job was extended periods of mandatory overtime. We weren't given much of a notice of these periods and they would often last months with no days off."
good,"I learned a lot from different staff here. There was the usual individuals that were very closed off thinking you were there to take their positions, but as soon as they figured it out they were open and willing to share some knowledge with you. Most enjoyable part of the job was interacting and learning from the employees who had been around for a long time. Hardest part of the jobs was watching some of the senior employees leave the company."
good,"Work from 6am to 2pm. Leaves the rest of the day to do things which is nice. The management is poor and doesn't really understand the engineering and manufacturing process that goes in to actually makes the product they are trying to sell. Lots of redundant actions that cannot be removed since all the business majors are in charge of it and won't let us change anything. In the words of our president, SAD!"
good,Triumph bought Vought Aircraft and changed many things. Added many management levels and lay-offs are unexpected and usually come to people near pension.
good,"Very limited opportunity to grow unless you belong to a particular group. Everything dictated by a group of people. It's hard to see the primitive company like Triumph anymore. Due to the market competition, there are only dynamic and versatile companies surviving today. I think Triumph will not survive unless CT State government helps it like Colts."
good,"Not a bad place to start working but not somewhere you can make a long term career out of. Management is always being replaced, with every new manager comes new rules, which isn't a problem if one manager would stay more than a couple months. Not a bad place to start a career though. Co-workers, non-managers, are awesome and it is how you make it. As far as moving up, there is opportunity to move up but the hours are 50 - 60+ week. I will say I thoroughly enjoy working in the facility because there is so much to do and it is very nice and clean."
good,"Triumph Accessory is suck Lead man is the man person that suck "
good,"fine co-workers, had learned lots of techniques. the most enjoyable part of the job is getting the quality check and get and excellent rating for what you had done."
good,I enjoyed my twenty nine years as a employee with this company. As with any company there are things they could do to improve their relationship with their employees. But overall they are not a bad company to work for.
good,As graphic design work goes - your assignments come in and you work them as the customer needs. Customers range from other departments within the company to outside companies.
good,I been working a triumph aerostructures for 13 1/2 years and its a good company to work for and ive learn alot from being here
good,They didn't always pick people persons for managers.  I would  rate the management somewhat poor overall.  They had a hard time distributing work evenly.  Some employees had tons and some seemed to do nothing at all.   The IT department was the worse i had ever seen of any company i had ever worked for.  No help from those guys.  They only wanted to create problems
good,Was at Triumph at a time during a lot of change. They put you where they need you not where you want to go. If not careful you can end up down a road you did not want to go. Good place to start then move onto bigger things.
good,It’s not a bad company. Benefits were better when I first arrived. Have a gone a little down hill since then but still ok. Pay is not real competitive though.
good,Great place to work management a bit sketchy but overall good . Just no job security never no when there shutting plants down or selling off bit nerve racking
good,"No real impression, I didn't interact with enough management personnel to know anything about the working of the company. When you have a specific area to work, you go to that area and do your job. That's what I did."
good,The site is closing soon so there is no room for advancement.  There are a lot of people that work there that will be retiring or laid off soon.  Time to look for another job.
good,"I worked as a contract worker for a temporary assignment when relocating from a warehouse in Missouri to new facilities in Kansas.  Work environment was pleasant, but management rarely spoke with associates on work floor.  Human resource manager and her associates rarely spoke to anyone on the floor.  Friendliness was rarely exhibited by that department."
good,"Twelve hours a day seven days a week. Very few holidays off. Pay is good, but no time to for family.Fifty pc. lot comes in the door, fifty pc. lot better go out the door."
good,Company is stingy when it comes to employee hourly salaries and raises.the job is easy once u learn your job.i enjoyed my job just not the pay and raises.benefits were good.i took pride in my work.overall it was a good experience for me to learn something new.
good,The culture of the job is the best thing about working for tasnaas. Other than that you put up with tons of messes from the office. There growing so they might be better later
good,"Good place to learn, but low stability. Work 12x4 wich is exhausting. No good corporate culture yet. The company is too young and management lacks of direction. Silos culture."
good,"People that worked there was great to work with all cared about there position. "
good,"Due to our signed agreements, we are not allowed to speak about this company in any negative terms. I will only state that they have treated us fairly during the plant closure process."
good,"Great learning experience, fast paced environment, work together with manufacturing and quality engineers, also supervisors and lead hands to move product (Aerospace)"
good,Not in a good place at this time.  Facility is being consolidated and work relocating to other company locations.  People are friendly but work load is not steady.
good,"During my time at Triumph Structures East Texas I noticed the amount of talent that was on the team. Very friendly,family like atmosphere. I came to have a personal relationship with every person who worked in the facility and enjoyed the experience.  The lack of decision making on behalf of the management team was the company's downfall."
good,After some changes in personnel- the work environment completelty deteriorated. This was the overall feeling of the company. Many people were let go because of personal views. Very discriminating. Management did not know how to balance employees life and career.
good,IT was a great feeling after building an aircraft fuselage assembly knowing it was going to be part of a very large aircraft when complete
good,Not stable union shop with to much overhead and layoffs benefits were good but could not add wife very dirty and no air condition
good,"I like my job, but there is not a whole lot of room for advancement. My work day starts at 7am till 330pm. My job as a lay-up mechanic consists of working with graphite materials that are placed in layers over tools and then they will be eventually cured. It is really a learning experience. I also work with some really wonderful co-workers, that have patience when training new employees and help each other out when needed."
good,busy busy busy. good company. can be stressful. good people to work with.
good,"Very busy and fast pasted"
good,"I enjoy working at my current company, i have learnt a lot working here, iv progressed from knowing nothing about composites to running my own department, i feel i now need to widen my knowledge and experience, my typical day at work will include issuing work to 2 large teams (day and night), working out weekly/monthly deltas management meeting, assisting my team during the day, and shift changes. I have also been given the opportunity to get involved in value stream mapping events."
good,"show up for work at 7 am shift ends at 3:30 with in those hours i would write paperwork for full kits to be assembled for 787 airplane brakes which we build 20 a day, use a laser engraver to mark part numbers for manifolds and build such. also inventory duties for extra parts needed for kits and verify torque for co-workers. operate forklift to receive big parts from semi trucks."
good,"Managment wasnt around when needed, most employees were not team players."
good,"My 1st week the president/CEO, whatever his title was, bragged about just getting back from taking his wife and kids to Hawaii for her birthday. Then proceeded to cut OT for weekend crews and other areas. My 2nd shift day supervision was cool to work for."
good,"There are reasonable accommodations around my school schedule, allowing me to make time to study and get my homework done.  Management seems pretty solid."
good,Be prepared to work every weekend. It’s good money and its consistent if you like to work all the time. They offer great benefits.401k 80 hours vacation time once hired on
good,"Challenging day to day tasks, along high paced environment with  the expectancy of high quality volume productivity along professional support and management."
good,"Great group of people to work with, Over all this company has been a good company to work for, since Triumph took over several changes have taken place I guess it's to be excepted. Good old boy culture still exist."
good,Management team is not in line with employees. No training to support the continuous growth and skill level required.  Need shop discipline. No real growth opportunities.
good,The work environment is fast pace and requires overtime. Physically demanding.  The workplace culture high pressure. Management sometimes inconsistent with what is said and what is actually done.
good,"It's a good place to work a bit stressful at to.es because of the delivery dates but nothing to one can't handle "
good,Une bonne entreprise malgré quelques inconvénients côté gérance de leurs employés
good,"A typical day at work consists on improving the manufacturing processes that are either in place or currently being worked on. This includes standard work, innovative technology research, combining of operations and Kaizen events."
good,"the hours were great, managers were nice, nice group of people to work with.nothing was hard about this job everybody got along well. not a stressful job"
good,"Good work environment"
good,"You had to play the game to get anywhere at this company, if you didn't come from the right family, where the right clothes, share the same interests as the higher ups, you were doomed..."
good,"Triumph was a great place to work, until they had to cut costs. It was very fast paced and detail orientated. The co workers were great to work with.."
good,ok place to work not the best i believe the company is no longer in my area bad management no leadership but they paid an adequate amount for the work
good,Many chiefs and lack of best practices synergies.  A lot of pointng the finger and conflicting orders given to resolve significant manufacturing issues.
good,A day at work at Triumph is good and enjoyable. I learned how to schedule my work and work my schedule. Management was OK. Workplace culture is fun and diversified.
good,"Triumph Thermal Systems is a small company focused on making heat exchangers for the aircraft industry.  Their co-op program is a good place to get one's feet wet in the aircraft industry, however it was tough to find meaningful work as a co-op.  All of the engineers are more than willing to work with co-ops, but there is no assigned mentor so the responsibility to seek out more meanginful work falls on the shoulder's of the co-op."
good,Agenzia con una organizzazione spesso rivedibile ma che dà la possibilità di lavorare in eventi anche importanti soprattutto nelle zone di Milano.
good,Upper Management has no idea what it takes to complete the work they are asking for so they are highly under staffed in every job title except Management.
good,Vought was a great place to work before triumph took over. Management was promoted from within so they knew what they were talking if a problem arose. After Triumph took over we couldn't get tool request right because management had no idea what the tool needed were or how to use them we would order one thing and get something completely different
good,"I contracted with Triumph for a total of 4 years.  The people I worked with are great and if you want the overtime, this is the place to work.  Especially if you're a contractor.  I worked at the one in Hawthorne.  Unfortunately they will be closing down in 2018.  I will miss the place"
good,Good pay and benefits.  Good people to work with.  Safe work environment.  Facility is well-maintained.  Good customer with limited work in the pipeline.
good,"I completed three co-op rotations here at Triumph Thermal Systems. While employed, I gained a good foundation in Quality Assurance and Design Engineering procedures. The facility is small making the social aspect of this business very personal. You will eventually know everyone that works there. I enjoyed working there for the three, four month rotations. The only reason why I am leaving is to see how I like the atmosphere of a bigger company."
good,"Management is killing the company.  Just keep heaping on more responsibilities onto people when others leave the company.  Not an inviting culture anymore.  CEO just appears to be a hatchet man.  Morale over all is low right now.  Good, loyal, longtime employees are being discarded with not even a thank you."
good,Working for triumph made me realise that you need to be more ware and focused when working on panels as you cant afford to get it wrong. These needed to be finished following protocol.
good,"I set personal goals for myself to learn as many production processes as I could. My co-workers were the most helpful. I performed all my assigned duties to acceptable levels. There is no regimented or outlined training processes. The company advances personnel to the managements preference, not skills and ability. Overall, I have enjoyed working for Triumph and the experience was pleasant."
good,Not a major aerospace company I am used to. Small minor and major airframe parts for Boeing mainly. I only took job to be in FL.
good,"Typical Day: Busy day every day with mostly fun and upbeat workforce, maybe a little repetitive but a good job"
good,"Very nice company to work for and proud to be part of Triumph in Yakima, WA. I would recommend it to anyone. Very busy day yet learned a lot from this company in the last two years."
good,"It was a nice place to work in the begining."
good,"A typical day was to clock in, clean the sanding booth and sand/repair airplane interior parts such as window panels or galley compartments. Id say its the equivalent to auto body repairs in a way that the area has to be clean, the parts has to be free from any defects to be able to be sent out, and there is specific repair processes that has been approved by the FAA to be performed."
good,Vought was a great company to work for the before it was purchased by Triumph Aerostructers. There was job security and it was a company you could grow with and retire from.  Now it seems like the company is not consistent with its employees and has done several layoffs.
good,"good company for someone starting out.  Similar to but smaller than Boeing corporation, Northrop Grumman corporation, Lockheed Martin corporation, et cetera."
good,Extreme pressure to do more than capable to get done in normal work week.
good,"I was an aircraft structure trainee and underwent training for six months. It was a really great experience and I learned a lot of things that helped me hone my mechanical skills. I learned a lot about aircraft manufacturing. Unfortunately, I got laid off after the training which was very disappointing. I could not say anything about the management since I did not reach the point of having a manager. My trainer was my direct supervisor."
good,"Very busy and a challange from day to day."
good,I was in a seasonal position. There was too much work to only be getting paid minimum wage.
good,The people at Triumph Aerostructures are excellent.  When an issue is present the team works together to ensure task are completed efficiently.
good,I found working a temporary assignment a good way to boost your moral and a great way to confirm that learning new things was possible and empowering.
good,Typical ME work. Management needs to work on leadership skills
good,Inspect machined parts for Aircraft wing assy.
good,Better to work as a contractor than direct. Directs are required to work 8 hours free overtime before getting paid for the next hours of overtime.
good,"I began working here and realized that it was always a comfortable work environment with a very personable management team, and responsible owners."
good,"You will never find yourself not being busy. Meeting service level agreements are a must. Employees are overloaded with meetings, need to find a way to be more efficient."
good,The management at Triumph Group Stuart Florida is very unstable with the average years there is about two. They do not communicate very well with their employees and have gone slowly down hill over the past two years. I really enjoyed the work and the people there and would have liked to finish out my career there.
good,Every year it seems as though there is some sort layoff at Triumph. I was laid off twice on two separate work stretches. I know of others who got laid when I wasn't employed there. Yet another unstable work place thanks to lovely corporate America.
good,I estimated costs for various aircraft. Each department worked well together towards the common goal. There wasn't really a hard part of the job because people were willing to assist.
good,I am really not comfortable writing a review of my former employer. As I was leaving the workplace was becoming more and more unstable. The President of the company told me I was making a good move.
good,Had a very nice first year but after the strikes it was very stressful.  I learned s lot of different things. The union was always looking out for us and I felt like we were always doing the best job possible.  I enjoyed the work and the benefits.
good,".you are able utilize all of your previous skills, as well as learn plenty of new training..... its a great career building industry with great benefits and knowledge to excel"
good,"I've been working here for a little under a year. This is my first real job, and it's a good one. However, there is little room for advancement and management is poor. The most enjoyable part of the job are the coworkers and casual environment. They also have occasional employee outings that are fun!"
good,"8-10 hours and possible weekends "
good,Good place to work for some people. I learned how plane parts are made. I had wonderful co-workers. The most enjoyable part of the job was making the parts.
good,Typical day at work. A valued company to work for. Company is relocating.
good,"The workers were the most important part of the company. They were a great team and accomplished what none believed possible. However, as time moved on the work level started to dwindle and many good workers were let go or demoted. The problem was that those at the VP level would not listen to those below them and business was lost."
good,"Recently purchased by Triumph Group that double the size of the company. Triumph has skilled hourly positions and salary jobs with the goal of being the best subcontractor in the aerospace business. Has company matched 401-K, healthcare benefits. Competitive wages."
good,"Fun to work with a team of people with different cultures and interests. Almost every day you are learning something new about aircraft,materials, etc"
good,"The company chose to move locations to reduce salaried employees and eliminate union membership. The impact of very poor management was the inability to meet Quality Requirements of the customers. And those left have very little moral or motivation, the worst I have seen in my career."
good,"Good:  benefits, pay (for the area), relatively stable.   Bad:  depending on supervisor (I worked with the good ones).  Every 2 to three years go through layoffs.  Seem to have a hard time balancing human and material resources."
good,great working facility except for lack of attention to their working equipment in their test areas. Great people to work with and teamwork. Very up to date IT personel.
good,"The people are amazing, they are like family. They treat you like family and are welcoming."
good,"Normy jak i metody pracy na wielki plus. "
good,Productive workplace that needs that next generation of employees to come in and root themselves within the industry.
good,get to know more about the aerospace industry and how they works and like the work place environment. good co-worker and great company to work for and get to learn a lot from it and how the wing work.
good,As a Quality MRB Engineer I would review discrepancies ensuring the is and should be conditions are present. I would also interview the people involved in the defect to determine the root cause and determine the best corrective action to prevent this issue from happening in the future.
good,It's okay but at times it can be frustrating because it is not a place for a career. Promotions are seldom given.  It is a great pay and good benifits but I don't think they want they're employees to move up in the company. Thy like to hire from within.
good,"bad hours, bad mgt"
good,"10+ hrs a day"
good,"Best thing about Triumph,they hire with no experience. The management changes a lot, not always for the best. Pay is ok for area, not the field. They will work you like a dog and keep you from family and life, with little remorse. Benefits and work quality have dropped since the union took over the plant and rumors have started floating around."
good,"Excellent company to work for if you are a team player. everyone helps each other to keep production rates up with few errors. While the company is currently in transition, soon it will be offering new products and carrier opportunities."
good,Work environment was great. Management could use some touching up. Climate control environment. Easy training at a decent pace. Inventory program could use an update.
good,Great Job very Challenging A ton of yours at Times very hard on yourself working 75 hrs averaging weekly work goes by contracting
good,"The company is a great place to work with great products. The flexibility it has showed to the employees is awesome. Unfortunately, the company is not very well financially speaking and had to make hard choices to survive."
good,"Good learning experience.  Had some good leaders, lots of diversity in the work atmosphere.  Lot of different jobs at the facility.  Good group of people."
good,The work load is not completely reliable. Layoff's are common. The pay is very good. Management needs a lot of improvement. People are great. Job has good environment.
good,Es una empresa que se preocupa por la seguridad personal.
good,"Went in to work at 6 am till 6pm. Learned how to  do Bonding  , insulating parts , Operator Bead Machine  , do inspections on my parts . Quick pace job"
good,I learned a lot. If I could have my same position back I'd do it again if the pay were just a little bit better. Good team of coworkers. I had no problems.
good,"Triumph Actuation Systems is a division of Triumph Group, Inc. Triumph Group manufactures all manor of aerospace products. Triumph Actuation produces hydraulic components: linear actuators, pumps, motors, and hydraulic valves. "
good,"Environment was fast pace.  I learned about SAP system.  Great co-workers, hardest part of job was long hours but still enjoyable.  Enjoyable part of job was my manager Karla she was very good to our team we all enjoyed working for her."
good,"ok work environment,  Poor management but it is getting better  employee morale is great other than about pay"
good,"Triumph es una empresa aeroespacial, que se está transformando siguiendo los principios de un systems operativo."
good,"Temporary job. I learned a lot on how much time planning is involved in making aircraft parts. The company needs a bigger facility, and more machines. Very clean factory, with air conditioning and heat. Clean cafeteria. Helpful co-workers. "
good,"I enjoyed my time working there.  Slow paced and great people to work with.  However, the site is on the way to closed down and seems like upper management isn't doing a good job."
good,Productive and challenging place to work. Assignments are given and expected to be completed in a timely manner with minimal supervision. Coworkers are helpful if tou are willing to ask for and accept help.
good,"Decent Management and Decent work. Always on the move, but the pay wasn't enough. Working with people there is amazing, but again it was never enough."
good,Great working environment lots of opportunity to learn new aspects of the wing building process. 3 different work shifts allowing for flexible work shifts.
good,"I enjoyed my time with Triumph, I do feel like they could pay a little better and give a more realistic raise each year. Over all it was a good place to work, but job security is also unrealistic."
good,"I enjoy working at Triumph, but there is really no room for advancement. The benefits are wonderful and the staff is very helpful, I just would like a position in a company where I can advance."
good,It was a good place to work as long as you perform your task and keep up with the work load. They help a lot to make sure you get to know you get what is expected of you.
good,"Very high phased, extremely professional with great communication."
good,"Terrible management is being changed. Great People working their hearts out and now being appreciated. Really loved working there. "
good,This company provides 747 and 767 Boeing air crafts. I built the end item of the 747 and 767 fuselage. working with a small team we were able to be one of the best producers on the site.
good,"The pay was great.   The jobs were challenging.  The management was disorganized.  It was a Union job which can be a plus and a minus.  For all the cons, I would still like to work there for the pay, but they lay off often, which is what happened to me."
good,"The type of  work is challenging at times, somewhat a skill labor, good pay scale. "
good,"i started with the company when it was called  LTV. It changed names and management many times during my time there. "
good,I really enjoyed working with all of the employees at Triumph including its venders.  All were hard working and at best wanted to perform well.  The only problem I had experience is the current senior leadership does not have the faith to trust its workers to collectively lead its best business practice into the future.  They hired an outside consulting firm which in my opinion did very little to significantly improve the company ability to deliver it products on time.
good,Aerospace programs at the Grand Prairie facility expiring. Likely site closure in 2017. No opportunities for career advancement or diversity.
good,"Great company to work for, but aviation is not a very stable industry to be in. Pays great, the work is great, the job stability is very shaky. management  was very open to work with us on problem or issues. was laided off last week due to a reduction in work force, till the new budget come out, i was a contractor so it expected at times. So now I think i would like to go back to what i did before being a mechanic, and that was working in the shipping receiving department, I enjoyed it so much!!"
good,"Good company and good place to work, doing good business practice."
good,"I've seen several changes over the years, good and bad. I've learned a lot in my position and have had an opportunity to build and maintain positive relationships with both customers and co-workers."
good,"great place to kick start a aircraft mechanic career, you learn a lot about aerospace, great beginner job for aerospace"
good,If you have ambitions then you should probably look elsewhere. If you don't mind a glass ceiling then this is the place for you.
good,My work experience at Triumph was very rewarding.  I learned a lot about proposals and pricing from working and training with a great group of people.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the wonderful friendship which was developed with my coworkers during my time at Triumph.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is learning gear manufacturing with a knowledgeable and friendly staff which helps the sometimes stressful environment.
good,They had plenty of safety procedures but the management wasn't that great and they didn't pay enough for the quality of work being put out onto the floor.
good,Coworkers were great to work with. Management was ok but depending on what was needed. Opportunity to operate very large gantry cnc machines with multi spindles and gantry cranes Machining wing skins.
good,"Pleasure work for the company. Management is willing to work with you,trying to get parts you need to fix the machines.I learn a lot more about the electrical part of machines."
good,Triumph has been going through a growth and transformation phase. This was awesome to be a part of and I learned a lot in a short amount of time working there. I was able to interact with upper management on a regular basis and felt that I really added value when completing projects or audits.
good,"Healthy place to be good work going around, unfortunately, job security is a problem here. Pay is mediocre, but not terribly unfair as it once was. New CEO and management team is really turning this company around."
good,Triumph is a good place to work with good benefits. Relaxed atmosphere with good Management. Not very good as far as salary and advancement. Very busy atmosphere with multiple constraints to schedule that you have to get resolved.
good,Reviewed Suppliers production process and First Articles to ensure parts and products were manufactured using certified materials including specified processes.
good,A great place to work and build aircraft assembly skills. The union is very helpful in backing the workers in resolving issues that can cause possible disciplinary action.
good,"Worked hard with Crews to increase production of the 330 Airbus units to the highest rate ever in a Calendar year. Was then moved to the new program for Nashville the G 650 Wing boxes for startup, we were successful of making our move rate on the 3rd unit before the Company experienced a Sales fall off and a large reduction of the workforce."
good,"Good pay, good benefits. Not a lot of opportunity to cross train or move up. Sick time and vacation time are great. Will demand overtime one day and deny it the next day."
good,"The work at Triumph Aerostructures is fasted paced and interesting. Roles and responsibilities change from program to program. The work can vary from detailed component design, assembly design, to structural layouts."
good,"Its good place and very nice people to work it. However there is not much comunication flow from senior management thus affecting the work flow chain. I quickly grew myself to be leading team of 4 departments and managing the entire MRB system of the company."
good,"Durante la jornada de trabajo desarrollas un estandar de trabajo al maximo y aprendes a trabajar bajo las expectativas del cliente, los directivos de la empresa estan en contacto cercano con sus empleados la mayoria del tiempo."
good,Accountant operated aerospace company which did not understand the concerns of the employees which had vast years of experience in the field.
good,Everyone was sweet. They were patient and encouraging while training me for the job. Could be busy at times but mostly easy to manage. If I had a question there was someone always there to help.
good,fast work lots to learn daily. the wing are standing not Horizontal makes locating things and areas a little difficult. work is fast very up beat must keep ur mind in the game could be dangerous
good,"Not a bad job, a bit tedious. Management is working on getting new delivery vehicles. Always overtime opportunities, if you desire it. Be able to handle the heat, and the cold into the winter."
good,"Broken Promises. Managers talk but don't do. Promised to be able to join apprentice program, ended up not being in it due to something on there end. Broken Promises."
good,"My position with Triumph required the ability to integrate into a relatively stressful, high stress work culture while being new to the Aerospace industry and with very little training available. I enjoyed the people I was able to work with and did not work excessive hours or overtime."
good,"If you like to work a lot of overtime, they have a open check book right now."
good,"The engineering department is top notch & the manufacturing environment is fast paced at times. I would recommend Triumph as a good place to work, learn & grow your career."
good,Good group of people that I worked with. Very good benefit package with lots of overtime when you wanted as well as mandated overtime. Enjoyable and exciting work pace
good,"I enjoyed working at Triumph Structures. The atmosphere was chill, relaxed yet consistent work load in HR and there was opportunity for growth and advancement. I loved that I was able to assist with multiple departments and take on projects to further my skills. If you work hard, you get recognized."
good,"I enjoyed my time with the company. The people were great, the company really treated their employees well. I learned more about the beginnings of how planes are born."
good,"Lots of turnover.  No accountability on assembly production floor.  Support staff tasked with ""fixing"" issues and figuring out how to get things shipped on time."
good,Great place to work for many years. Corporate environment has brought many changes to the business. Unfortunately aircraft manufacturing business has slowed.
good,"Triumph Aerostructures emphasizes on driving quality, they believe in providing their customers with the utmost defect free products to insure profits to their shareholders and employees."
good,The company will give you opportunities to grow and develop other skills if you work hard and have the desire to climb the corporate ladder.
good,Very focused on core competencies. Growth opportunity. Fun environment and good values. Too many chiefs. Overall a great place. Well focused on objectives.
good,Great company to work for if you have no desire to advance. Benefits are excellent. Best I've had. Management needs work though.
good,"The company has a progressive mission that sees the future in the aerospace industry. They strive to have the capabilities to meet current and potential customer needs before rather than after they present themselves.  The thing that I liked over the years was the variety of tasks. Sometimes the task mixes weren't always the best fit but it was a challenge to make them fit to a successful work flow.  Manual entry was always the biggest part of the job but it seems that this was an area that technological progress for efficiency took a back seat to shop technology.  With the changes in management over the last year and the backwards trend the department I worked in was taking, the job became more stressful, labor intensive, and almost life consuming.  Issue resolution was also a regular part of the job but having to resolve issues created by others within the company took a large part that was not conducive to efficiency or company representation."
good,"Easy to learn job, bright and clean facility, also a nice working environment, people was fun to work with, management was ok....."
good,Decent place to work.  However management is notorious for not promoting from within.
good,I enjoyed coming in to work every day. It was challenging and competitive. My co-workers were always helpful. Managements always had everything in order for us.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job, for me, was helping shop personnel and management, accomplish their tasks. Most co-workers were great, but some lacked motivation. (I have a belief that no-one owes me anything and that i should earn whatever I get)."
good,"A typical day of work is processing vendor invoices, processing vendor payments, addressing vendor inquiries, providing support to other departmants as well as direct supervisor. "
good,This was mainly data entry and it was a good job. Nothing to write home about
good,Good employee support. Flexible travel schedules. Good Benefits.
good,"Although I worked for TRIUMPH- our client is Bombardier aerospace."
good,"I believe Triumph Interiors is now closed, but while I worked there, I thoroughly enjoyed the autonomy provided to me by the management.  I was able to make decisions that affected all levels of employees and implemented several programs to improve employee satisfactions"
good,"Consists of clocking in regularly and getting right to work"
good,"Team work fast paced"
good,"Good place to work- effective leadership- upper management availability."
good,Buena empresa si terminas en el departamento correcto
good,Triumph Nashville has a very fast paced work environment that I really enjoy.  No two days are the same it keeps the job interesting which is an added bonus for people like me that do not like to sit around.
good,pesimo salario y no hay oportunidades de crecimiento
good,This company cared about its associate it is a great place to learn f i a career in aerodynamic is suitable for u in this u cannot be lazy u will stay busy
good,"If you are contract worker,"
good,No two days are the same at Triumph. Start the day with meetings and the rest of the day is assisting mechanics and trying to correct problems. Guide mechanics through the build process.
good,"Working at triumph actuation can be very dull if you are not in the design side of the business.  Although work around the shop goes fast, the type of work being done can be very slow."
good,Great company with pay and benefits.  Great hours and shift differential.  The only bad part is the lay offs from time to time.  Great learning environment to learn different skills in the aerospace industry.
good,"Triumph Aerospace / Newport News gets involved with really interesting and challenging projects. I was never bored there, and had the chance to learn cutting edge technologies such as carbon fiber composites and Direct Metal Laser Sintering."
good,Plenty of room for advancement. An average day consists of problem solving and finding root cause. Very diverse company. Very family oriented. I learned a lot at Triumph and there are many programs to assist in furthering education and assistance with advancement as far as mentoring programs.
good,I enjoyed the time I spent working with Triumph Gear Systems. I gained a lot of knowledge and experience to do the job that I am looking to do as my career.
good,"working as team everyday to get the job done on time. I learn many technique from my supervisor, when facing a difficult job we always help each others out."
good,Great work environment and great people to work with. We worked 10 hr days 4 days a week. We worked at our own pace which allowed us to make high quality parts.
good,Everyday you come in focused on making sure you get the job done right the first time. Your coworkers helped out a lot in making sure that you knew how to perform whatever task was placed in front of you. I came in not having ever worked in aircraft. I feel they provided me the necessary training I needed to perform in an efficient manner.
good,"Es un empresa con un ambiente laboral adecuado, el personal es muy enfocado y comprometido, todos los días son un reto pero es una muy buena empresa."
good,"When the company was Vought it was a Great Place to work. Once "
good,"Very interesting to see how our commercial and military aircraft are made. You'll get an opportunity to see everything from drones, helicopters, 747s and even space shuttle noses."
good,"Overall, it is a nice place to start out at but I did not see it as a place to grow and further my career as an engineer."
good,The best I can say about this job is the pay and benefits. The people I worked with was awesome. I learned about many different types of parts on an aircraft.
good,"When things are busy at Triumph Composites, things get very busy! When things are slow, it can be difficult, but the possibilities for skill advancement and training are there."
good,Spend one to two hours tracking down left over calls from prior shift. Which let the start of our shift behind when the production suffered.
good,"te ayudan a crecer y apoyan para evitar errores, la calidad es excelente, el ambiente laboral en procesos es estable buen lugar para empezar y aprender y explotar tus habilidades."
good,"Great place to work with a lot of potential for personal growth. It is on the low end of the pay scale when it comes to compensation and would not afford you the ability to afford the basic necessities to survive, so it would be great as a secondary means of income."
good,"Unfortunately, this location is set to close soon and most of the employees are gone.  The morale was the hardest thing to deal with.  There was a lot of great experience gone."
good,"Had many events for the employees, car show days, rivalry days (UofM vs MSU) and a host of others...."
good,"Although pay was average, this company was pleasant to work for and management is quite friendly and professional. Work culture and co-workers was top notch, very friendly and supportive. I would recommend to anyone looking to establish a ""foot in the door"" and/or a longterm career with pretty good retirement benefits in the aerospace industry."
good,"My typical day revolved around supervising & prioritizing crew work details. I created all departmental reporting, work planning & scheduling amid shifting prioities daily."
good,My employment was a positive experience.  I was treated fairly and with respect.  I would recommend Triumph to others that are currently looking for employment.
good,"I started with Triumph in 1991 as a Receptionist and advanced through the company through the years until 2018."
good,"Employees were interested in teaching me what they do and help me to assist them in making changes which would help to protect them."
good,I would recommend Triumph Aerostructures to others that are starting in the aircraft industry. There is a sense of family and camaraderie amongst the employees there.
good,"empresa con muchos puntos de crecimiento,. aunque poco valorados ."
good,"The team we had was great. Everyone got a chance to advance and learn. Great benefits and a constantly changing, fluid work flow. Bad part is they closed our shop."
good,"buen lugar para trabajar maquinas herramientas, el conocimiento y aplicación de las mismas"
good,"management will to work with employee on a business and personal issues. really helpful on a income level, I get a lot of overtime. when needed time off, management willing to give it."
good,A great place to work.  Always something new to learn and challenging.  Workplace is a friendly and positive environment. Supervision always helpful and supportive.  Management would bring in meals or special treats on special occasions.
good,"Aprendes a manejar maquinas hay"
good,"My typical day at work consisted of offering assistance to  active and retired employees."
good,I like to learn different jobs and do different tasks Iam a hard worker and a team player always willing to help other co workers if I can. I get along with all my co workers I stay away from any kind of drama. I enjoy doing my job and looking at the finish product that I have worked on before it gose to other stages and before it gose to our customer.
good,"Managing Program Details and Project Schedules. Monitoring Product Realization for Customer Satisfaceion, Statutory, Regulatory and International Aerospace compliance. Expanded knowledge in cost and risk management. Co-workers were team players. Each day was a new adventure."
good,I learnt how to lay the composite sheets either they were glass or carbon this was all done in cleanroom enviroment the hardest part was laying the glass sheets if you tryed to complete the task the management were ok.and you got to meet new workmates.
good,I worked at this company for less than a year but it was by far one of the best jobs I ever had. I never dreaded going to work in the morning. I was a contractor who was paid very well and there was ample opportunity for overtime. Most of the other employees I worked with were contractors as well. It was a contractor's paradise until we were laid off.
good,This is a great company to start out. They had some issues but hired a new engineering team and  president that is really trying to change the plant around
good,"Work was like any aerospace location.  Fast, can be hectic due to the requirements of DoD aerospace and long lead time parts.  machined parts require immense planning and care."
good,A great place to work. I learnt a lot from working on various ERP systems. Moved the company from MS Access to C-sharp. It also provided opportunities to grow and learn. I went to various training offsite and helped the company with various software applications.
good,"Triumph has been a great first job for me. There has been plenty of opportunity to learn, and I don't feel like I am over stressed. Management and corporate structure could use work, but that is changing at this moment with the new CEO"
good,Triumph Aerostructures Hawthorne is a great place to work. Teamwork and camaraderie are the two main areas that I can point out that are a plus. You are exposed to all facets of a major Manufacturing Process from Design Engineering through the build process to final delivery as a Tier One Sub-contractor to the Boeing Company.
good,"Good Company to work for, Great Benefits and the Culture is Great."
good,Very satisfying place to work when the company has plenty of ongoing projects. First few years there was plenty of work but later it started slowing down. They need to aggressively pursue new projects with OEMs like Boeing and Airbus and project a more favorable image.
good,Fast work pace. Supervisors and shift lead took the time to teach you. I have learned hands on with tools and how to build Airplane wings. All employee's were great to work with and very helpful.
good,"There was always work to be done at Triumph. Days went by fast, all of my co-workers were kind and dedicated to their work. Overall a positive work environment."
good,"Good  company  to  work  for.  It. Was laid back, you get to work by yourself. Everyone there was friendly. They gave plenty of overtime and good hours a week."
good,"Days always started very organized. keeping parts moving through stations. Learned valuable experience in the manufacturing of aircraft components. Floor management was excellent. Teamwork between coworkers in my area was excellent. Hardest part of job would be, being sent to help out in other areas, and those areas didn't seem enthusiastic about teaching someone new. Most enjoyable would working with my crew, communication was superb."
good,"Fast paced, high volume facility, which I excelled at. Thankfully, my hard work, dedication, and work ethic all were recognized here and I was offered the higher level Manufacturing Engineer level 4 direct position. I enjoyed working here, and was well liked and respected, as I became the lead of 3 other M.E.'s for my 2 panel section responsibilities very quickly."
good,challenging work with big parts and machines.. pay is decent but benefits are better. all in all a good place to work. friendly environment. have no complaints.
good,"Worked on G650 wings for Triumph Aerospace, Benefits and Pay are extremely nice and they are very helpful for the time that I was an employee there.  Would"
good,"Overall, I enjoyed my experience working at Triumph. It is a great place to learn a decent amount about career-level fields in a short amount of time."
good,Was able to use my skills as an accomplished Aircraft Sheet Metal Mechanic applying knowledge of sheet metal mechanics and fabrications to the repair and manufacture of aircraft parts. Adept at following detailed manufacturing specifications and shop drawings and blueprints. Specialize in maintaining strict quality standards while efficiently utilizing available resources.

Youll make your money working the hours. The way i lost my job, i complained to my manager about a guy who had been working there a very long time, and he had said some things about me that werent true, they were rather insulting. I guess i understand the decision as they have to keep the guys that can keep the departments going happy, so i guess my advice would be, if you can land a job here, dont ask a lot of questions as those questions will lead to someone questioning your intelligence. Figure things out yourself and just go with your decision even if your not 100% certain. This is a great job, more like a school to learn how to be the best in the profession. Also, keep your mouth shut and just work because it gets pretty hi schol pretty fast. The moneys right, the culture is a little dangerous when you cant ask questions, and the people are very nice as long as you keep your mouth shut and ask zero questions."
