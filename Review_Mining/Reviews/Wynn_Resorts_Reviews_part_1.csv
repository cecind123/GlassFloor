rating,review
bad,"They aren't fair to entry level employees, management abuses their power, they're more concerned with who you know than what you know, typical of old school Vegas hiring practices and the ""boys clubs"" mentality."
bad,"Department has extremely High turnover"
bad,There PR team is great at lip service. Never backs up their mission and targets line level employees based on whether or not they are liked. The bullying starts at the top and if you try to do the right thing you will be crucified.
bad,I worked at The Wynn for a total of 3 years and it was one of the worst experiences of my life. Management loves to power trip and overstep their place could care less about the employees. Getting written up is very easy so you always feel like your job is on the line. Everyone works all holidays so you will never get to enjoy Christmas or Thanksgiving with your family. Also on holidays it's double points as well so if you do have an off day you can get a lot of points on just one day. My last point that really bothered me was management collects tips on top of their salary.  At Allegro the managers get a full cut of the tips every night and end up making more money then the servers. They managers cut when it's slow so then can make most of the tips. So if your thinkng about working here don't there are plenty of other places on the strip that will treat you better. This place is the worst
bad,"excellent pay great food for employee free and delicious the management employee the whole place is pure EVIL one of the worst job and experience I've ever had in work place it's pure toxic I don't even think they realized how bad they are. They treat people like garbage and a prisoner. The employee just as bad as the boss so worried about their job they'll stab you not just in the back on your chest no kidding at first I thought it was a dream or I was in the movie this can't be really but sadly it is I got out just in time before I lost my  mind or kill someone."
bad,DO NOT accept any job from this place. In wasted 7 1/2 years of my life working in this hotel. I will list reasons not to accept a job with this company....
bad,"Be careful & watch your back.. back stabbers are everywhere, used to be five stars, but changes will have you looking at 1-2 stars"
bad,Stay away!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! They watch you and watch you ...and watch you on camera until you make a mistake. Then suspend you with no pay. You are filled with anxiety every time you walk thru those doors.
bad,They do not care about their employees whatsoever. You are basically just a number to them complaints were never taken seriously and if you complained enough You would be the one fired
bad,"Every decision has to go through several approvals which makes day to day operations extremely challenging.  There is a high focus on the line employee's and making sure its a ""Great place to work""  for them but no focus on management.  Work/Life Balance is nonexistent.  Management is underpaid for the standards they are supposed to uphold."
bad,"The manager in the Compliance Department would leave players CTR forms, which included their SSN in a basket and not in a locked area. The cleaning crew had access to view the documents or anyone else who walked in the office after hours. The salary was not good considering management wanted you to work 10 to 12 hours a day. The management did not appreciate the workers and enjoyed firing them for no reason at all. Management would steal employees ideas and later fire them. A typical day would be auditing Race & Sports, Cage, Slots, and Scan CTR's., etc. Some co-workers were okay."
bad,Management needs a lot of experience and start looking out for their workers instead of themselves. They rather fire their people that have been working there for a long time than take the fault into their own hands even if it is the management fault.
bad,At the encore boston harbor there is little organization with in the food and bev most directors are far removed from working on a floor and have not kept up on been educated on how things have changed in the last ten years in boston
bad,"Promotions based on friendships and not on production. If you are a yes man  with no integrity/ethics work here. Failed to properly train. Was told to kiss butt or find a new job.  Safety of guests, employees and VIP'S are not of concern to upper management."
bad,If you like working with managers and supervisors that do nothing but stab you in your back and try to get over on you by having you do more work then you have to this is the place for you they are not as sanitary as they pretend from leaving towels from previous guest if they don't look touched to leaving the same mattress cover on the beds unless you can see a stain I have one word for this place............. DISGUSTING
bad,"Great place to work at if you seek constant unnecessary stress, poor management, changing standards, and an ever present mournfulness every day of work, (Oh, almost forgot to mention. If you have a family, carry pictures with you, because chances are you will be forced to work Overtime and on your days off, so you won't see them much at all. Good Luck)"
bad,"I was a manager in the bread bakery. My boss would require me to work six and sometimes seven days a week, 10 hours a day minimum. As a manager I got no compensation for the extra hours and I had no protection from harassment. "
bad,"They require you put in a lot of work for little pay. They continue making cuts to departments. Not even directors have job security. They have absurd rules, and retaliation is a real thing. Everyone is scared to speak up or stand up to anyone with a higher title in lieu of retaliation."
bad,Chef Kelly and Chef Albert are horrible people to work for they are liars and will cheat you out of pay and hours.  Dont take this position they are hungry for employees and will say anything to get you to work there.  The position that I took of culinary trainee Clist I was never fully explained what the position was! every 6 months your allowed to look for a new position at the hotel.  So when it was ok for me to look for a new job in the hotel Chef Kelly blocked my chances every chance that she got.  It came down to me leaving because they stared to interfere with my school schedule ! so instead of getting terminated I decided to leave before that happened.  So if you want unprofessional rude chefs work in banquets if not go to a different department !
bad,"This place is a joke. I was so excited to become a part of a well known brand, expecting to learn and grow from my managers and one day grow within the company. In my mind, you had to be the best of the best to work at Wynn Las Vegas. However, i can say that my experience was the complete opposite. I loved the girls I worked with. But management is a complete joke. I have never been treated with such disrespect in my life, like i was not on their level so i was treated like a dog. I would greet management when they walked in and would get COMPLETELY ignored!! Who treats others that way? There are no raises, no advancements. The girls i worked with (who had been there for years) warned me that this is the norm and i just need to get used to it. One manager in particular is known for being awful. She had mood swings and every day we would have to guess which mood she would be in, and that would determine how your day would go. You have to walk on eggshells around her. Others are afraid to even speak to her. I mean is this real life??? lol. My peers would complain and cry constantly when they would get passed up for a promotion that they most definitely deserved. I literally felt like i was being depressed and got out as soon as i could. I wish the best for the girls i worked with. They deserve better. Shame on Wynn Las Vegas for allowing people to treat others that way. Its disgusting."
bad,You can find better places to work that will pay you more and the management is better. I used to work at the Wynn and my co workers and staff were so hard to work with that I always felt that they were pointing fingers at me.
bad,"Greedy busters, pays less than all other on the strip on all the positions. manager also gets our hard working money tips as well and does not work towards helping others. No relationship with the culinary union."
bad,"The security department at Wynn is the worst managed in las Vegas. No respect for their employees, no training and no respect for seniority.dont waste you time working for this company"
bad,"beautiful place, 5 star resort, great buffet ,encore beach club, soul cycle, drake, management arrogant, very strict , nice bars, new building, not a good place to work, pay is decent."
bad,One mistake and you a goner unless they like you if they don't or you do something the royalty doesn't like they will nit pick you to death Humans make mistakes leave your humanity at the door of the employee entrance because mistakes or bad days aren't permitted
bad,"The security department has an extremely high turnover. They contract their directors for 1 year, fire them, and hire on a new one. There are so many problems within the department that it's hard for employees to feel like they can do anything positive. Management sits in the control room and watches employees for any minor slip up, then gives write ups, suspensions, or terminations. Only one person remains of 12 from my hiring class. That was in August 2012. Not a good statistic to have. There is no leadership and employees are always looking over their shoulders. One hour paid lunches are nothing abnormal for strip jobs and other resorts offer better pay/benefits. I did not receive my ""annual increase"" until my 15th month; that was after I sent multiple complaints to management and then above their head to payroll when no progress was made. I left the company before I got the raise, but eventually got a check in the mail for back pay. Union members are the only ones who have any benefits working here. The ""nice resort"" aspect is a facade. Many resorts on the strip are nicer than Wynn. Wouldn't recommend working here unless you absolutely need the job."
bad,"far too much negatives to tell, think thrice when applying."
bad,In my opinion the company promised allot of things that I believe it failed to deliver on. I was promised full time but have been cutting hours left and right.
bad,"It is a boys club through and through. Its about who you know, and kissing their behind. If you make the wrong person angry your insecure you will soon be out of a job."
bad,"Wynn is a place that values professional look and people to fill that professional look. Unfortunately the idea of being the 5 Stars they claim to be is only outward toward the guests they serve, the paycheck. Management and Upper Management are unconcerned with how the people on the floor, in the background, doing the grunt work, actually want to improve the place, and only care about satisfaction of workers when it comes to their company wide surveys."
bad,"Struessful only train you for 3 weeks  have very unrealistic expectations, not never understanding at all.  Job is always a t risk.  Will write you up very quickly for any Small mistake even unintended"
bad,"Ready for what ever the company has for me. To obtain full or part time employment as a casino porter, janitor, dispatcher , pantry cook.The wynn never let u change position .when u go to the supvisor with a problem u never heard nothing about ur situation. They were not fair about solving ur problem.they had picks and chooses about break, some workers can break when they want to. For example if ur break was @ 4:00 am & u had a person wanted to go@ 6:00 they would let that person go, just cause they didn't want get alone with someone that had the same break. People would break when they wanted to. Not fair to the other employment"
bad,"Don't pay enough, don't care about their employees, only how much they can make off the guests. management is in cliques &play favorites.Gets old fast!"
bad,"For highly skilled and qualified table games dealers, this job can be a disappointment."
bad,"Most assistant managers in this department are very unprofessional and petty.  Lots of room to advance and make some serious money but if you do not meet their standards you are belittled and spoken down to until you quit!  Everyone is dispensable, even senior employees  that helped opened Wynn. No one is safe..sad."
bad,"The experience is fun. But the culture of the property and its people will drive you away. Every now and then you would get those people/guests who make your work life great. And then you get the poor decisions of the company to ruin it. If you value your work ethic, don't apply here!"
bad,wynn was great experince for a Forbes property guidlines and customer service expertise. However working in graveyard hours being approached and touched from people who alcohol level was high on a daily can wear and tear on you
bad,"No job security at all. Either do everything perfectly to  their standards without question or slight mistakes, or you will be written up. All management does not carefully follow up on whats going on in their department."
bad,If someone above you has an issue with you then don't expect to be employed long. Management is influenced very easily even if its off of opinion given out of spite. Wynn being one of the highest grossing hotels on the Las Vegas Strip they pay their employees very poorly and often weren't competitive with other hotels because they believed people should work there just because of the name. They have a lot of work to do there.
bad,"management is overly critical and does not trust employees in my department. highly stressful environment, employees are made to feel inadequate for no legitimate reasons."
bad,"Days varied on positions or assignments, on what things you needed to be watching for and continuous customer service. Had decent shift managers and coworkers."
bad,"If the right person or persons like you the advancement opportunities are good. They do not care if you are more knowledgeable than others, some work a lot less making more while others do more work for less money!! Great opportunity to break into the casino industry but don’t plan to be there long!!!"
bad,"Very busy and not enough time in the day to get it all done. Work life balance was not there. Great benefits, fellow team members were helpful. Long day and long hours, no time off."
good,"Retail at the Wynn is unlike retail anywhere else.  They play by their own set of rules and not by industry standards."
good,"Hours were not guaranteed, pay was good schedule was not fixed & your given your schedule 2wks in adv. Wynn is a nice casino to work for if you get FT"
good,"Investigate all correspondence and email copy to appropriate department Manager or Director."
good,"lowest union pay on strip, no to low morale at best. no team work, no feed back from management"
good,"Enjoyable place to work if you are an night person. Great people, and all in all a good place to work."
good,"They are in the middle of a civil suit still that i am a part of. Management was horrible. Payroll has constant issues. Two different systems are used and every few months at least one full work day would be missing from my check. Not just in my department, others as well that i spoke to while working there."
good,"Team members are some of the best in the business but potential wasted in leadership who feel very threatened with their position."
good,"The job itself isn't too difficult, but we aren't always given the tools necessary to succeed, and barely any direction from the higher-ups. The workaholic mentality is strong here, and most of the higher-ups don't understand that people like myself have lives outside of work, and also strive for something better than working in a casino all of our lives. Oh, and there's no appreciation at all, they barely notice we exist until a mistake gets made. Seriously, I thought life would be great there, but instead I'm completely miserable and dread going into work every day. On top of that, we have to mind our P's and Q's with everyone, because the place is chock full of people just looking for someone to throw under the bus, just to make themselves look good. So much for teamwork...Honestly, I hate it there, and I'm doing everything in my power to find work elsewhere. The corporate atmosphere just isn't for me."
good,"Lets start with completely unrealistic expectations from upper management (Asst. Director and up) this is a group of people that have forgotten where they come from and has let a little bit of authority run to their heads, and refuse to listen to those that are doing the work without severe skepticism from their end. The lack of staffing is ridiculous there are several employees even now that are taking on the work of 3-4 other employees that are not accounted for and they are still expected to keep and maintain a 5 star rating. Now with the exception of the few; Management and the Asst Management can be described as back biting and un-knowledgeable about their position, the rules that apply to that position, and the over all department, company, and union policies that they are suppose to be upholding and enforcing. The products that are supplied to the employees are in fact , for lack of a better word, CHEAP and scarce, the employees are so paranoid about NOT having supplies that they will DISMANTLE machines and hide the parts and other supplies in some very creative places, like in the ceiling that's in a closet in a high end restaurant. Now lets move to the pay and salary, for the time spent at the Wynn the pay is far from fair for the amount of stress the lack of communication, and the over all redundancies surrounding the job at hand. "
good,"It is a descent place to work.  The benefit is that it allows people to transfer to different departments.  So if you do not like where you currently are you can transfer every three months.  Overall, as long as you are willing to learn you will do just fine."
good,Great place to work but if you're not part of the 'click' they have or don't fit in you will not last past the 90 day probationary period.
good,"food and beverage management is lazy, and does not care about it's employees "
good,Management made the job very stressful and an unhappy place to work.
good,"Place has no loyalty to its employees, young management plays favorites and parties with its subbordinates. Management targets anyone who challenges management."
good,The position is only part time so it is ok for that reason. They work around your schedule. The pay is good. I think management would benefit from working together more effectively. It will help all shifts to be on the same page.
good,Working at the Wynn was not bad.I made decent money as a cocktail server but felt that all employees could be paid more given how profitable the Casino industry is.
good,was a good place to work at first then they changed management who did not care about employees I still did my job at one hundred per cent always got along with everyone
good,"Overseeing and coordination paperwork for the Executive Director of Marketing to present to president of Wynn for all future negotiations"
good,This company will hire and give many opportunities to all the employees. The competitive nature of the workplace inspires everyone to work hard but also creates an environment where employees would start being over competitive.
good,"Very big place, very hard work due to the 5 star requirements. "
good,productive and fun place to work. Management wasn't very supportive at all. Hardest part of short breaks and micro management. Learned perfect customer service skills.
good,Co workers of the department and other departments were great to work with.  Always exciting to go to work and assist guests and employees in daily routines.
good,"It's a beautiful property, so you get to enjoy that daily. However, the salaries are not enough for what is expected of you. If they were higher, I would gladly deal with upper management's scoldings."
good,Management breathes down your neck and the other employees are always looking for ways to get you fired. It's a stressful job even if you know what you are doing because everyone assumes you don't and will treat you like dirt.
good,"ONLY the Senior Clerks are informed if some one is out sick, even though the rest of us have to pitch in and keep that person's desk caught up; which leads to another person's desk falling behind."
good,The hotel and casino are just beautiful. The people there are kind of like robots but in a good way. They are there to serve the controller. Guests are a little snooty.
good,The property is well maintained. They do not relate feedback well or provide direction for improvement or allow for modifications if there is an issue
good,A typical work day involved staff meetings and meetings with customers. Working with other departments to ensure a smooth check in experience for guests and to resolve billing disputes.
good,Wynn/Encore is a very beautiful hotel. The hardest part of the job was having to handle a line of people alone in the poker room while the other employee was on an hour break. The most enjoyable part of the job was being busy most of my shift. I left the job learning to always take my time so that my job is done successfully.
good,"i learned all ends of security in a hotel, and learning more about customer service"
good,"Working at the Wynn hotel for seven years afforded me the opportunity to be surrounded by architectural and artistic grandeur that can only be rivaled by the resorts professionalism and intensive training.  The Forbes Five Star and the AAA Five Diamond accolades are immediately evident in the hospitality and attention to detail that is expected of every employee. It has been said that, ""the resorts greatest assets, his employees.""  It is an honor and a privilege to be a part of such an amazing place."
good,"great work environment, food good, employees good but"
good,Answering the phone. Worked with great people. Enjoyed it all
good,"Typical day could be really busy or really slow based on promotions, events. "
good,"I love my job and the employees that I work with, but I want to work doing something different and something that I enjoy. I want to change the routine. I have been working in this business since 1991."
good,wynn is a good place to work but don't do make no mistake no tolerance but over all good place to work
good,"Working hours are from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm. Typically I perform many duties such as maintaining all connectivity at the resort. Management seems to be adequate as my coworkers are slowly learning their evolving rolls. The inability to be proactive is one of our stumbling blocks however, the climate with my peers is pleasant."
good,Great place to work and great benefits.  More demanding on customer service and appearance.
good,"• Assist with managing staff by couching and counseling when  necessary."
good,The Wynn and Encore always say they are there to help you and anything you need they will have your back. This is not 100% true. You are just a body that they need on the floor to make sure our guests and customers are well taken care of with a 5 star 5 diamond attitude.
good,"The wynn was a great place to work. Decent living wage, the food is amazing and management does its job. I would highly recommend anyone working at the wynn las vegas"
good,"I'm working in Accounts Payable . My duties at work is processing all the invoices for the payment. Prepare all the checks double check before mailing out to the vendors My duties volumes extremely heavy . I am dealing with most department individual and vendors. I also do all the research and guide lines to vendors or department to get the problems solves.   Each day is learning experiences. The hardest part to help vendor or department to get resolves from point A to point B. Sometime vendor nor department has no idea where to start. My co-worker over all are okay. Each co-worker do their own job and only focus on their own work. Management in my department is unorganized, poor of communication skill. Noting in my department never be in the same page no support. To fix some problem require manager to get involve  but many time I have to fix on my own or asked other director from purchasing to helped to fix the problems.  The most enjoy able is when I can completed all my work or be able to help department or vendor get problem taking care"
good,they could have handled some sorts of the job differently.  what I learned is to handle constructive critisizm better.
good,"I was a bike office rat the Wynn and I got to say I met a lot of my friend there and I had a blast everyday I was there. I actually miss it.  I patrolled the strip and dealt with guests and helped them go to where they needed to go,"
good,"You are expected too much to work here. People get fired for no reason, You are expected to look like a top model and receive nasty phone calls from the owner or the BIG office. "
good,"Kitchen helper preparation on the food details on plates. Cleaning dishes,separate forks, knives,spoons,and a lot of glasses and remember which ones go into a case and select the right ones."
good,The money was great for the most part. But the culture of the atmosphere was filled with racism and feminism. The work was easy of course. Lot of favoritism
good,"Although the organization's Core Values are admirable, when it comes to push and shove, the lack of managerial skills from many leaders are revealed. Coworkers, well, let's say that it's high school all over again, and if you can play the game of office/workplace politics, this is your playground. If not, you're out."
good,"Overall great company that pays well, however no one will ever have your back and at the first sign of trouble or problems they let you go. A place to work, not a place to be friends with the management"
good,"Corporate environment with all the corporate issues. Mr. Wynn has high expectations with low staffing. This creates an extremely stressful work environment. "
good,Many opportunities for varoius types of employment. Tuition assistance is very helpful and meaningful. Employees are hired from within. You are given many opportunities for advancement.
good,"I learned allot and helped many nice people along the way. "
good,Great positive staff with plenty of options for growth and development throughout the company. Great  program  training in all programs and positions on site.  Management helped tremendously with helping employees transfer to better positions.
good,"If loud music and crazy fun interest you, XS and Intrigue are your nightclubs to be. Never a dull moment. Must be able to navigate threw crowds."
good,"Great overall Company. The only potential gripe would be that middle management tends to take advantage of the non-unionized employees, driving them to unionize."
good,"That was my first casino job so i enjoyed every bit of it. It had a normal working hours and great people to work with. "
good,It was beneficial to grow with the company. I have learned much from the chefs.
good,"Great place to work, enjoy working with everyone there. Has a real homy feeling."
good,I worked in the entertainment at the Wynn. Met famous people. fast paced. Very little room for error. good salary. worked with people from all over the world.
good,"Nice place  to work. Meet a lot of nice people and they give you free lunches with high-end food. I do recommend working here but because it's a five star environment,they are very strict."
good,A wonderful store. Great product lines. The best customer service I have ever seen.
good,"Excellent workplace culture."
good,Nothing was ever allowed in the open environment if you were not watching it.  You could not leave papers on your desk when you got up to go get something from the printer or make a copy.  Only 2 personal items in view ans no pictures larger than 5x7.
good,"The floor supervisors treated us very well. Even though we were basically just paper pushers, they made us feel appreciated. Always were respectful and appreciative of everything we did. The pay was great for what was asked of us."
good,"The best part of working at Wynn was their medical benefits were stellar.  Having never worked previously in Hospitality, I found it to be an interesting and fun environment to work most of the time.  Upper Management was looked upon as unfair when they decided to decrease employees' salaries by 10% for a full year."
good,"I LOVED my job, it gave me a sense of independence, that means a lot to me. I adored most of my co workers and my supervisors. Eventually we all came together and worked as a team for the end result. I never did like the shift bid. I always thought there could be ways of improving that situation some how with the many smart woman I worked with. I'm sure they could have thought of something better given the chance. The Wynn employees work extremely hard for their money to ensure that our guests are happy guests. If your one of the lucky ones to get a job at the Wynn just make sure you don't get cheated out of your benefits. I did. I not only had long term/ short term disability, but I paid extra for the ""BUY UP"" But when it came a time that I would actually need it, I was completely cheated out of it, the whole entire thing. Never got a dime. Stay on your benefits department! THEY SUCK !!! Because of them I was left out in the cold and lost a lot of money WHILE I WAS DISABLED!! THE TIME WHEN I NEEDED IT THE MOST!!"
good,Wynn and Encore are beautiful resorts. I enjoyed the 9 years that I worked there. The pay was decent and for the most part the people I worked with were great. Advancement is hard to come by unless you are a favorite. just like any large corporation its who you know and not what you know.
good,Loved working with the Culinary Team. Leaned about Food purchasing. Never a dull moment. Loved the daily challenges. Seasonal peaks and valleys of the business kept a good balance to ensure great business practices.
good,Everything to be expected with large corporation. Great opportunity however little room to go outside of policy for human kindness and understanding.
good,"Day started at the clock with brief summary of what's happening and what projects (if any) were coming up.  Break down of duties that day and being prepared for evening.  Team work was a very important part of the job.  No way could our duties be done as individuals, but as a team.  My direct supervisor was a very fair and well adjusted man for his duties.  Being in charge of 8 guys from the area of productions can be a tiring job, but he was able to perform above a professional level at all times.  My co-workers came from various parts of the production world and overall could work together well.  But at times, egos could get in the way and a great work environment could change into a very negative area that you didn't want to be involved.  The hardest part could be keeping a good attitude around people wanting to cause problems and stir up trouble in an environment that didn't need distractions. The most enjoyable would be the crew members that could balance the job and keep a great attitude about the job at all times."
good,Low paying compared to the rest of the strip but the most secure place to work as far as job security. I loved my time here its just hard to get full time if your not management. Wynn is probably the smartest CEO on the strip for sure.
good,great place to work very fair and knowledgable staff. Takes great care of employees.
good,"All large corporations have their ups and downs. With 10K employees on property at any given time, you realize no matter how much you put forth, you are just a cog in the machine."
good,good company to work for and great for family men & women. I was given great trainning. And they truly look after thier empolyees when I was workng for them.
good,"I work in the night clubs enjoy it have met interesting, fun and very nice people, never a dull .....  just keeping track of the liquor bottles and names can be exhausting but wouldn't mind testing some of the flavors that the Wynn sells, over all enjoy my job"
good,"One of the finest hotels in the world, great place to work. lots of room to move up if you are patient. I learned a lot and got good training, would recommend as a good place to work"
good,Working at the wynn is definitely a great place to improve your skills in the job force. Being that it is considered a five star resort they stress heavily on five star service and what it means to go above and beyond. They have plenty of opportunities for people who look to work in the casino business. When you work at the Wynn though you may not think it at times you truly do think of yourself as a family and they emphasize.
good,Mr Wynn is very nice to work for. But being such a large company he is unable to no everything that goes on. I loved my job at Wynn and for years I never minded going into work it was fun and exciting for me. But when you have Managers that are many times unfair to the employees that had been in position for years and letting many of them  new employees take your customers means they are letting them steal your money it became very frustrating
good,The Wynn las vegas is very strict and always follows the Forbes standards. Fast paced and teamwork applies in order for everything to fun smooth. Management is always their to provide assistant to anyone in need. Hardest part is keeping every single guest happy understand rush hour experiences. Most enjoyable part of the work day is the guest experiences and meeting new people from all over the world that comes to the hotel and casino.
good,"They know how to treat their employees very well in general. Very nice employee dining room, very nice changing rooms, and everything is super organized. The only downside is that this environment is very strict and very particular. As a Forbes 5 star Resort an employee must adhere to all procedures exactly and will be written up if otherwise."
good,Enjoyable with a great sense of community. The company is always thinking of new ways to interact and motivate its employees. It offers free classes and an excellent tuition reimbursement program. The company helps employees with growth in the career of their choosing.
good,"I learned a lot about casinos and Patron Management systems when I first started at the Wynn. I made it clear to management that I was very interested in advancing my career their. When requesting a transfer to a different department, management has declined for reasons, such as being short handed, or having a verbal warning that was not yet settled. It was only when I put in two weeks notice that a transfer for myself was approved. When I spoke with an executive in the Far East Marketing Department, the department of my aspirations, I asked for advice on how to get into the department and was told to seek a similar position at another company. I love the attitude that the we as employees develop there, and I do believe that our customer service is certainly five star/ five diamond. However, I did not appreciate working for management that did not seem interested in helping me advance in the company."
good,Working at the Wynn allowed me to improve my customer service skills. Most employees were very professional and helpful. The company provided all the necessary tools needed for the job.
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with and most of the people I worked for."
good,"Opened hotel , and worked food service for five years. Hotel was very slow for opening and returned to very slow business at the end of my tenure. Food offered for lunch was comparable to eating in a normal staff restaurant."
good,I learned how to respect the customer and my fellow employees i learn how to be a better person working for wynn Casino. We learn how to be a family we have are ups and downs but we get back up.

good,"I love working here.  I've been very lucky to work with great people. "

good,There is not really a typical day at the Wynn every day brings a different task. You learn about new software that is introduced into to the hotel world to make business run more efficient. And the management is very helpful in helping you obtaining your goals in the the world of IT. There are a lot of different personality that your co-workers bring along with skill Sets. There really is no hard part to my job but if i had to say anything it would be finding the time for some of the projects. The most enjoyable part of my job are the end users the business getting to service them.

good,management is fun and helpful. Everybody gets along with one another. Guests are friendly as well. Variance policy is fair. The only con is the long walk form the employee garage to your workstation. This is not an exaggeration 45 minute walk one way.
good,"Working in a very small department, Manning the S.A.F.E fire control system as well as engineering dispatch it was very important to have a tight nit unit. Supervisor was one of the best I had the opportunity to work for. The ideal leader, She led by example and dove right in and assisted in the day to day operations. Covered shifts when short handed and never showed any frustration about it. Co-workers followed this lead and were a pleasure to work with. Hardest part of the job was learning all the functions of the fire panel. Most enjoyable was coming to work everyday with an awesome bunch of people."
good,Most enjoyable part of the job is working with people face to face everyday.
good,"A lot in tips daily as a food runner at the pool, but the kitchen can be incredibly hectic and stressful. There were days where staff was low and I spent 10 hours getting slammed, but there were also days where I had 1 or 2 orders the entire day."

good,"One of the best hotels on the strip to work at, union job with great job security. Also great management, the only downfall is there is no movement with the job. Been working with the company the past 8 years and I am still an on call steady extra employee."
good,I’ve worked for Wynn since 2011.   It has been a good job with a lot of stress.  My income has gone down due to poor management.  Recent management changes have been brought in from Harrahs to enhance the working environment.  It seems the jump over the dollars to get to the pennies without regard that Wynn is a 5 star property catering to high end clientele but they would rather cater to low budget clientele
good,"this company is the place , where you can start from the bottom and give you the chance with the time to grow . What ever department that you are ou can move forward if you push yourself"
good,"Great company to work for. Beautiful spa. To remain 5 star property, employees are attending trainings often to ensure quality service. Highly recommend."

good,very team centered department both managers and co workers are always willing to help. The hardest part of the job was trying not to loose any calls but was hard to do because of the call volume
good,Took pride in workplace and had multiple learning experiences in regards to job entitlement. With company for 10 years and top notch company
good,Every day was different and exciting.  This is a great company that values its talent.
good,"I'm working in France for all technical in big complex swimingpool named:"" AQUALORN - complexe aquatique - LANDERNEAU. I'm not speaking and not writing very well english but i know one thing: Las Vegas enjoy my heart. I'm 48 old and i'm the best ""i mean perhaps"" to secure and for the maintenance."

good,worked during the opening of encore was a great learning experience I started at a entry level position and moved up the rank very quickly learned a lot while i was there.  Had great mentors
good,Great overall work culture. Free paid lunch.Great place to grow within the company. It's easy to start from line-level and grow into management if you hustle. however  only downside is some poorly chosen managers get promoted that way.
good,"Pretty easy going day, I have learned communication, marketing, and office skills, Management isn't the best, my coworkers are awesome, hardest part is probably handling multiple phone lines at once, and the most enjoyable part is being able to have my own office."
good,"Great place but can get highly stressful when understaffed. Lots different outlets and opportunities to advance when given the chance. However, like any other restaurant there is always preferential treatment towards certain individuals."
good,The Wynn is a great establishment to work for. The wages are really good and they have lot of perks for everyday city life to offer.  As a cashier I'm able to meet and deal with a verity of people.  The hardest thing is to keep up with the different systems of each room.  I enjoy have the people contact everyday.
good,"Hard position on the hotel "
good,"No part time available, work any shift, sometimes working 14 hours in a day with no overtime, work 8 days in a row. They don't work with school schedule."

good,"This was a Temporary Position. I was Hired on the Staff as par of Their Hotel Tower Remodeling Project. Worked in the Carpenter Shop. Good People, Good Job."

good,Company is great to work for. Looking forward to all of the upcoming changes and more job opportunities. They always provide classes for Supervisors and Management. Very interesting classes that provide a variety of different skill sets.
good,Work is steady but not many chances to change careers or move up. People that start new have a higher chance of getting Manager jobs over ones who know the hotel both inside and out. I would’ve like to stay but maybe might try again later in the future.

good,"Beautiful workplace and I gained so much knowledge."
good,My Job is fun. Every thirty minutes I get to meet nine new guest from all over the world. My co workers and I work closely as a team to make sure that we run our room smoothly.

The retail department is its own monster but it greatly unique as to how they refer/consider customers as guest and truly live up to that standard. Wynn standards for service is why the Wynn is what it is,as it trains employees of its values and holds them accountable to keep the same standards. I would recommend everyone that is interested in working for the Wynn."
good,".A typical day at work was always a fun experience and got me out"
good,TEAM work is part of the daily function.  Assist guests with their requests and make the impossible POSSIBLE.  Enjoyed interaction with all areas within the Resort.  Employees are friendly and willing to assist.
good,"A typical day at Wynn Las Vegas, would be to walk the casino floor and meet guests and assist them in any way they needed. Converse with coworkers if needed to accomplish that goal. Fix accounts, issue complimentary items, discuss upcoming events with guests, make sure to pick up any trash that is seen. I've learned to be more patient in dealing with each guest and learned what 5 Star 5 Diamond status really is. The most difficult part of the job was not being able to make every guest leave on a positive note."

good,"I do enjoy and love working at Wynn. Of course, as with any job, you can have bad days, but this company is the first company I have ever worked for that values it's employees over guests. I would highly recommend it. I know that every casino offers free lunch to employees for tax breaks, but Wynn takes it a step further and provides a healthy free lunch with quality food. It's easy to stay on track with a diet or even inspire one to eat better."
good,Worked with a great team for a large casino resort. Management always worked with you if you ever had any issues. A great experience with a lot of great people.
good,"Expectations are high, but so is morale.  Every employee is a professional and conducts themselves with the highest of standards."

good,"Greet each guest and have a consultation on what their expectation is on the service they are there for.  If they are getting a haircut I needed to see what their desired look was and make suggestions based on their hair type what would look good.

Compreendi entao a frase ""faca o que voce gosta e nao trabalhara um dia sequer"".  Apesar de ter uma carga horaria puxada, as horas passam e voce nem percebe! Lidar com pessoas de diferentes partes do mundo faz com que voce esteja aprendendo e alimentando sua mente e espirito em tempo integral. O problema de se trabalhar num meio assim eh lidar com a ambicao das pessoas que nao medem esforcos para sempre ter mais e mais dinheiro porem isso jamais foi um aborrecimento para mim, pelo contrario, foi um grande aprendizado de poder ver na pratica que as coisas de valor nao sao coisas. Da hora que eu entrava ate a hora de sair sempre foi um trabalho bem puxado ja que estava lidando com pessoas muito importantes e queriam um atendimento, uma resposta instantanea. Tinha que ser, alem de muito simpatica, muito agil e muito paciente."

Wynn hires top-notch employees from all over the world so you get to work with very diverse individuals with extraordinary talents. I enjoy being able to go into work everyday and meeting people from all over the world and if I had to mention anything about this job being hard I would say the hardest part of the job is being able to communicate with people from different coutries that do not speak English, we have people from all over the world working there so their are too many languages to learn and many accents to get used to."
