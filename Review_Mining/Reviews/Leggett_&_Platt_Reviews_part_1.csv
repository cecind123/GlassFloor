bad,"Too much favortism, poor management they allow arguments and fights, unless its physical no one its held accountable."
bad,Wouldn't wanna ever tell anyone to work here. Treat people bad. Buddy buddy system. Bad management in the office and HR is terrible not for the workers
bad,"I wouldn’t recommend legget and platt to my worst Enemy, line leads don’t even do the work correctly when working on line which is very rare they even work on the line as per line I worked on which was 3 , line 1 & 2 had there stuff together , realized after 6 months of being there not many people stayed due to how poor the line lead treats the workers , he walks around on his phone all day and works when he feels like it , A lot of drama which leaves negative energy , pay isn’t worth all the stress"
bad,"I replaced  the last receptionist who got a promotion to the customer service dept..  she was fired after 3 weeks??  management  didn't care ,  they fired me the same  day I got back from vacation, for NOT doing someone else's job  ??!  people came and went,  they never stayed too long,  they wanted to give me a  15 cent raise??!! co workers had their click,like any job .  they went out of business 2 yrs after I was gone."
bad,"I wouldn't buy anything from this Company.  Over priced, sub quality work. Must products carry the prop 65 label that states the items are known to contain agents that cause birth defects and cancer"
bad,Dirty hot and cold place leaks unsafe and old not much good about it it was a job til they closed up but the people was nice to work with down to earth and helpful
bad,They are a horrible company and won’t work with when your sick and or you have kids who are sick they will fire you in your 3rd time you’ve missed even if it was a family related issue or you have child support issues they don’t care about there employees ever!!
bad,"Leggett & platt years ago was a good place to work , it has really went down hill in the last 4 years . We have horrible surpervision , they have slowed the line down where we can’t make any insentive"
bad,I didn’t like the job because of safety issues..I was injured while working there that my employers said wasn’t severe enough to leave and go home..and I still have the same pains in my hands as I had before
bad,"It was a fun place to work. Very laid back, not a lot of pressure from management and not a lot of over time. Co workers easy to get along with. Management very understanding to needing time off"
bad,Place needed a lot of organization. Not the right management in place for job asking to be done. over all did enjoy the culture their. everyday was a different day of work.
bad,"Cut throat"
bad,"Fast pasted, stressful, to much favoratism, over worked underpaid, alot of days we have more downtime than work, alot change overs, and everything changes, bed rail, bag parts, instructions, boxes, end caps,"
bad,Working for this company is overrated. Long hours and back breaking work for little to  no money. Supervisors are extremly biased and only care about the elders of the company vs the needs of the new comers.
bad,the company basically continues to bathe in white supremacy. The company structure was built on not giving out bonus and not seeing the average floor worker succeed
bad,"Low Pay, many hours, leadership needs training, upper management needs training, production culture where quality and safety come last, low morale, .."
bad,"did this review already, not doing it again??  It was a union shop and when the union did not want to desolve their contact Leggett move the plant to a sister plan and we all were out of work"
bad,"worked there over 6 mnts.  never offered job employment review nor raise.   dirty environment."
bad,"Management played with employee hours the whole time. Would cut hrs. without notice. If I was you I would run as far away from this place.  It a  harsh work environment, it don't seem like you work in America. It like working in a sweet shop over seas in a different country."
bad,"Worse job ever!!! Always smelled like paint, even after you took a shower you still smelled like an paint can!!!"
bad,"It is easy to get hurt. If you apply for workers-comp they find a reason to let you go. Management with lie to your face and don't care and your co-workers will do the same. There is nothing enjoyable about this job, there's no air conditioning, it's dirty, pay is terrible for what they make you do, lunch is only 20 mins., I would never recommend working there unless you really need a job but if you do find something else a quickly as possible"
bad,A day work was ok until the supervisor start acting crazy because they had their pick and that was it and they had low payment
bad,"Where to begin. Low pay, constant fear of job cuts, terrible, industry bottom benefits for IT. Managers that have no experience in what they manage. VP level completely void of caring or understanding IT. Accountant in charge of IT, no CTO. Just all around no positives. A culture of fear, brown nosing, horrible instances of nepotism and favoritism. Just remember to take it all and smile, be a good drone, you're lucky to be employed and should love it!"
bad,This would be a ok job if they had better management. I worked both night and day shift and both were horrible. The supervisor there was prejudice against black women the team leader was a drug addict people would come to work high off of god knows what and drunk they would get high on the job and drink on the job. People would run up in the job to fight the employees. The Night shift team leader was prejudice against black womenswear because her husband was black and would flirt with them. She was messy and inexperienced This job was a all around mess filthy a
bad,"Don’t not work here. Racist management. If you have kids and can’t find a babysitter, tough luck. You better come in or get pointed for not coming in. A few points and your gone. They also play favoritism. If your not white or kiss serious butt, you’re not going no. No promotions. Nothing. They have line leads but all they do is play around and yell you like they’re your boss. Everyone is in everyone else’s business. You curse, you’re getting sent to the principals office. Very unprofessional. I’ve worked there for 3 years and was paid the same wager as I first started. Oh, management and supervisors will tell you one thing to do, then tell you I didn’t tell you to do that. You work, your life is over cause all they want you to do is work. Forget your regular life. It stops soon as you work here. So if you want to go they all of this, being disrespected and talked down to, be my guess and work for this place."
bad,"-Poor management - not willing to listen to experienced workers"
bad,"My experience with Leggett & Platt was the most awful and unprofessional experience I have ever had with a company. The Adjustable Bed branch that I was employed with had a plant manager that constantly talked about everyone on the management team and he, as well as the ethics manager at corporate, was honestly the biggest joke I’ve ever met. Total little mans syndrome."
bad,Well it's a dead end job it's for someone that's in  college are for someone who loves to work in fast pace invoriments are someone who has a felony that can't land a job those carpet padding are very heavy if your up n age don't consider it it was ok until my wallet disappeared but far as a company for teen who needs money yes but 30 r older wouldn't recommend..
bad,The union is a joke here. I cant believe this place is still running production because the management is pushing all the good guys out the door by cutting wages. They have a poorly clock in system I have witnessed people get fired over it and those people were the best they had. They will be shut down before to long I bet.
bad,"This company used to be awesome.."
bad,"Management was inexperienced, safety a complete joke, trying to fix broken machines with other broken parts, low pay, backstabbing coworkers.  Not a good place to work if you value your health or safety."
bad,Liked working for Leggett and Platt. Was hurt when they closed the doors. It was a great place to work for. It was a great work environment. I enjoyed working with all my co workers
bad,Very poor management and there was so much  favoritism and racism in this work environment it made it really hard to deal with on a daily basis.  There is so much shady stuff that goes on in the office and on the floor where the employees are.  Find out for yourself and see what you think.
bad,Management was horrible the supervisor didn’t know his job had an attitude and treated employees horrible. Worked 70+ hrs a week nice paychecks decent benefits
bad,Work weekends all the time. Bounce from days to nights.  Have to work weekends before and after vacation.  Lack of experienced workers and they have a hard time keeping them.  Poor management and safety.
bad,Leggett is a very stressful place to work. You work 60/70 hrs a week and no time to take care of home. Management does favoritism and extremely inappropriate verbally and physically. No one to trust to speak about issues. Environment feels like highschool again. I would not recommend this job. It would be a better place if they didn't treat u like robots and actually cared about you. And if they get better management
bad,Very hot in summer and very cold in winter. Dangerous machines. Managers are uneducated as far as no degrees. It's worse than it's ever been. Not getting better anytime soon!!!!!!
bad,"The management is their own little clique. They had their picks. If we rent friends with them  outside of work, there was no chance of you advancing or making a fair wage. Very bias workplace. You try to work hard to make more money but that's not the case here. I actually took a pay cut to get hired in. As a temp I would bring home around $360/wk. After I got hired in it was cut by $40. Avoid at all costs unless you like being taken advantage of and having all pride in your work sucked out of you."
bad,"Hired to make unwanted changes.  Multiple divisions operating separately - even completing against each other.  Senior Management of the Furniture Group are not professional, supportive or able to hire or develop good talent."
bad,Be at work 6 days a week 10 hrs a day then they stay messing up paycheck have to wait another week to get your money . They have no advancement till sumbody retire.
bad,its ok but wen things get slow its not good a production job .if you dont have any bills its ok but making a living u must have a roommate
bad,"Don't work here if you can help it. They expect you to know how to do everything there without any training. Also, they are not very accepting of new employees. Office politics and backbiting are rampant."
bad,"originally we were a different company, but our division was sold to a competitor. buy your facility then shut you down in favor of scrubs that can't do half the job you did."
bad,no management or advancement at this place. U only advance if your liked. skilled workers get over looked because of gender and race
bad,this company is terrible to work for because it is very hard to work for someone that thinks you are dumb as dirt and don't listen to his employees ideas when they are better
bad,"Each day brought different challenges.  There was truly no way to predict how things would unfold.  Some days were stream-lined while other days there was many issues and errors to resolve.  There were so many errors both internally and externally that often times much phone work was required which would delay getting results or fixes in other areas."
bad,"Most people here are nice enough.  The maintenance supervisor has zero people skills and has run off 11 technicians in a year.  They quit without even giving notice.  They got their toolboxes, and hit the door because of this guy.  I'm getting ready to do the same.  Money doesn't compensate for this guys abuse."
bad,"Worked maintenance and the schedule changed almost daily because the turn over was so high.  Maintenance manager has no people skills and a micro-manager.  Total bad experience, worst ever."
bad,"Hours of operation good. busy work pace some days. Learned how to operate a RF scanner, computer input, polished my forklift skills, learned how to assemble inner springs into special units, repair them, modify them and properly ship, store, and handle them. Learned how to assemble from scratch  box springs and foundations. Built the wood flat frames, attached the metal frame, and the use a lots of air tools to accomplish that. Some management skills were lacking causing issues. Some employees were allowed to doings that would never be allowed anywhere else. Enforcement was not done correctly. That created work ethic problems with those of us who did do things right. Hardest part was some physical lifting or keeping things straight and done correctly following S.O.P. Starting benefits were great, working attire and some follow employees made it fun. Learning new skills and meeting different people helped. Benefits helped a lot."
bad,"I can go on all day about this company.  They pay low wages for the type of work performed. They don't hesitate to try and work you 50-60 hours a week. It's an okay job, as long as you have no home life."
bad,"Do not work here. I will not go into specifics, but this is a place that will wear you down to the bone. Management does illegal things, and doesn't follow state or federal required laws with employees."
bad,"Forced to work over time in the summer but multiple days off unpaid in the winter."
bad,"The work isn't hard that's not a problem, but it pays by production which would be great except the favoritism in there is terrible, some people literally get paid for other people's work and I have proven that by keeping my own records of my work."
bad,"Upper Management from Canada made poor decisions for N.A. operations and Sales departments.  Large disconnect between Canada, Michigan and Missouri divisions.  Company needs a better communication channel to has consistent lines of company goals that are established.  They can't continue to have 2 or 3 people in Canada try to run the whole company and make terrible ill advised plans for the future."
bad,worked for them for a year after they bought the plant that I worked at then they decided to lay employees off first third shift then second shift followed by first then found out they closed the plant.
bad,"I would not recommend this job because they have their employees working 60/70 hours a week. With 2 10 minute break, and 1 30 minute break. You do not get paid enough to work that much and that hard or fast. You have absolutely no time for family, friends, rest or personal situations. They tell you if you have a family and need time for that family then leggett isn't the place for you. Also you get In trouble for getting water out of the break room when working as much and hard!"
bad,"There’s no teamwork, they play favorites, and are very disrespectful towards the workers. It has really turned for the worst. A lot of people plan on leaving Line leads, supervisors, and management talk to you disrespectful. They only care about is product and not the employees. Half the ppl are on drugs there. But they don’t care Because they need beds made. I would never recommend this place for anyone to work. The workers really get treated bad."
bad,Ok place to work but management doesn’t own up to their end and they have favorites. They allow people to past by safety rules and get other people hurt without holding them accountable!!!
bad,"This place is a joke... Long hours, 6-7 day work weeks, no time for a family... I only stayed long enough to allow my family to eat and have a roof over their head"
bad,it is an okay job the hours tend to be long and no matter how much hard work and dedication you give them they are never satisfied the company as a whole is very self centered and selfish.
bad,"I loved working here but as time passed I was given more dutiesand not being compensated, I allowed this to happen for almost a year and a half until I had enough. The promises that were made to me never happened and I had to move on."
bad,Management was not good when unknown more than them in a short time u work there  when ask how to to sumthing supervisor or other employee  been there longer didn't know how to do a certain task or management didn't either  when ur supervisor tell u take ur time make this last all we got to do
bad,My typical day at work was to come in an hour early. Then set all my guys up on what we were doing for that day. I would have to teach them if they were new or just have to rego over what we have done. I learned the assembly of industrial units.
bad,"Who ever slept with a few women there probably got herpes "
bad,Worst job ever. Clipping is the bottom of the already shallow barrel of jobs there. It does long-term damange to your hands. Clippers are under paid for everything you are supposed to do.
bad,I was there 4 years and only made &10.04 a hour.  I like working there but it really needs to work on how to give a raise they have no idea how to do that they mite have a better place to keep help.
bad,"Very hard work company always trying to get more work out of a person and never wants to even discus a pay increase they try to work the people that they already have working like slaves to work hard because they don't want to hire anyone else because this company is the most selfish people that I have ever seen in my life they really don't want to hire more people until people either quite or either get fired and most of the times it's the company fault just about any and everything will get you a whole point or a half of point this company also never spend money on new equipment that we really need such as expenditers, tires for the equipment, etc. This company are so fake they put on this show like they really care about they their employees they only care about the money that they make"
bad,I have no comment! No communication at all. They state it’s a safe work place but the management team does not follow what they want employees to do Strick attendance policy even if it’s a family emergency with documentation company still document as a point.
bad,"Great company but unfortunately the Branch management is completely outdated and lacks the education and skills! "
bad,"The Company itself is a good company, my particular branch is very stressful, not pto, have to use vacation for both sick pay and vacation time"
bad,"Easy work, just could be paid better, some coworkers weren't easy to get along with, every one always had their own things to do though. I enjoyed it for the most part though."
bad,"Had to place to work you were always micro managed, the salary never did incease much and the so called bonus was a joke, they always wanted more and more for less"
bad,Turn over rate through the roof. They care nothing about anyone under management and your work ethic goes unnoticed. They will try to overwork u so bad and won’t offer u any help. Don’t work there
bad,Not a very good place to work. Long hours with short breaks.  Poor maintenance was performed on machines. Couldn't keep machines running. A lot of down time.
bad,The management is awful and the pay is terrible. They will only band-aid fix their machinery and equipment until it breaks to the point that they have no choice to replace it.
bad,"My department manager is verbally abusive and not professional at all.  Due to the managers style this is by far the worst place I have ever worked.  Other than that, most of the people are nice and its not bad."
bad,This place had no Union Members but they would push a one sided union contract on us. It was a complete fraud. Very dangerous place to work.
bad,The company started out being progressive and possibly a long term future...apportion management of projected sales and overspending on product that was not needed ended up being the company’s downfall as it let most of its production personnel go as for laying them off...Myself included! So not worth the time or trouble as they are close to being shut down completely
bad,The company closed when Sterling closed - we were all let go and no compensation was ever offered. There was talk of organizing a Union and No Benefits were given to employees.
bad,"Hot, loud factory work.  They will hirer anyone.  Long hours of shift work, and the helpless feeling of only being another clog in the machinery of life.  Dead end job that should have been moved to Mexico long ago.  Plus you will die from cancer from the toxic lead."
bad,Keep workin all the time if you going to work at this company don't stand around and not do things you can either clean your area or fix beds if you have down time.
bad,"•Focus on the company and your individual experience while employed there"
bad,"It Started great but after a while it turned out to be a hard place to work for, employee welfare was the last thing in this company's mind. I really hope it has changed in the last few years."
bad,"Upper management was not receptive to changing ideas. Comments were ""We run this Company, not the employees. Flexable favors for their favorites. Floor Supervision is not trained."
bad,Spanish managers look out for just the spanish people and its all family on office staff.  Was promised a forklift drive never got that put me on assembly.  Manager said he would put me in for a permanent job next thing I know I was let go and they kept people who never showed up for work
bad,Legget & Platt helped teach me how to audit several materials. Having been thought that helped me get my job at Industrial Timber. The pay is low and it takes a long time to see a raise.
bad,fast paced and very stressful.  Lower pay for the area. Poor management.  Good retirement.  Growing too fast.  Generic by the most part.  Too cheap with money ie buy items from China instead of commercial grade.
bad,"A typical day at work starts with turning on your machines and performing quality checks. You are assigned to four machines which was later changed to three machines and you are to keep them running all twelve hours you are there. Mass manufacturing is the goal while keeping things in spec. The company is trying new machines (3 years old) so they do not really have anything set in stone and the incentive/pay scales are questioned by everyone. There is a high turnover rate with people in and out the door trained by there fellow employees. In three months time at the company I have been asked to train new hires, fix other employees machines, perform change overs, and so on with no pay advancement.  I am coming up on a year now and nothing has changed."
bad,"It was steady as we go for a lot of years. But even before recession in 2008 it lost alot of business to oversea's markets.  The plant did close in 2008,  I was told."
bad,Good place to work good workers great shifts good pay and time off new  Technology to work with good benefits Great supervisors Wonderful   Office personnel
bad,I worked at Leggett and Platt for 2 1/2 years and it operated under favoritism. Mostly everyone was related. And if you had a disagreement with anybody they ganged up on you.
bad,"When I started there we worked 10+ hour days 6 days a week. It wasn't that bad until we started working 7 days a week for months at a time. I have a newborn so time with her is way more important than being required to work 70 hours a week. You don't get double pay after 60 hours either. If you don't have family you see all the time or children then it really isn't that bad of a place to work. I loved my job but I didn't care much for the people in positions of authority directly under my team leader. They involved themselves in all of the drama, and laughed and made fun of people who had no experience instead of working with them and helping them. The company does not train. I learned every position on that line on my own accord. You don't even really get a 10 minute break, you're lucky to get 6 minutes. And you only get two 10's and one 30."
bad,"If you absolutely need a ft job, Leggett and Platt is for you. The pay is actually above the sector normally pays.  However, with all the nepotism and favoritism going on, I can't recommend it as a long time position: you pretty much have to know someone (or be related) to even get considered for a promotion there."
bad,They have moved new Equipment into the building. Only to minimize the work load up all of the workers to justify and validate paying minimum-wage to those of which who have been working there for years of their life.
bad,great place to work and it balances with your life outside of work. Always something to learn everyday. Its a fast pace environment and you can move within the company.
bad,Extremely hot during the summer. Really fast paced and hard work if youre not used to it. Liked how it was strictly dayshit. 5am until whenever you got done for the day. Never kept me passed 5:30pm. Decent money but the hours added up for good checks.
bad,This company was fun to work at although I didn't spend very much time employed there. I was a machine operator in charge of cutting carpet padding to specific lengths and sizes.
bad,"Very long hours.  12 hour days, 5 or 6 days a week year round.  Ok if you don't have a life"
bad,I didn’t really enjoy working there the work was hard and the pay was not worth it. The hours and days of operation was great especially if you have kids
bad,Team leaders are rude as well as management. They are going through a lot of changes. You never know what your day is going to be like. Too many chiefs not enough indians. Some just can not handle their positions.
bad,"Plant closed and moved to China after spending approximately 3.5 million dollars on new equipment.  Until that, plant was in the middle of a complete turnaround and getting back into the black"
bad,"it was ok just they fired all the african americans and hired all mexicans i guess they work harder. they did not give us safety glasses when we requested them, fiber glass kept getting our eyes they did not do anything to prevent that."
bad,"They are very hard working people."
bad,It was nearly impossible to ever meet production requirements making it harder to make any real income. Job only last approximately 45 days but was never intented to pay production
bad,"pay is excellent but management was horrible and didn't care about your problems. plant supervisor never cared about you unless you were a ""teachers pet"""
bad,a typical day here was doing the same thing over and over each day I worked on an assembly line got real god at it n was making some good money cause it was piece rate I learned how to work together as a team n help each other out to make that good money
bad,"Cutting chickens parts on an assemble line like legs, thighs, tenders and etc.."
good,Best part of that job was I was given a Special Projects position that allowed me to actually design and build from scratch machines and controls.
good,ok place to  work if you like lots  of  down  time and  like dealing with different people blah  blah   I  really don't have much  b=more to  say  about  this  company
good,"Company is good to work for, but advancement from within is poor and the pay does not stand up to national standards.  They pay employeres in Chicago what they make in Cathage, Mo. when the cost of living is different"
good,Different everyday never knowing one moment to the next if your running or shutdown helping another libe. Never have materials when you need them. Always doing inventory counts and still can not run some lines then over time because orders not complete.
good,"Changes dont come down the line. You will spend a lot of time and work getting something done, working on a particular task and it will change completely negating weeks or months of work."
good,"as a warehouse manager I enjoyed customers at will call are an the  crew I supervised, I enjoyed been busy but I had too much on my shoulders, everyone got used to me doing everything for them from fixing their workstation pc to drive a tractor trailer on deliveries customer service had made order date mistakes"
good,Long boring work days very repetitive. The management is very much all over the place. Also upper management does not care about it's workers. If they would allow radio to be played on your 12 hour shifts it would make it much more tolerable.
good,un día normal en el trabajo la gente de mi genero era muy amable aprendí sobre el valor de la responsabilidad que debería tener sobre que las personas de alto puesto no se sobresalía me gusto la sencillez de los jefes con un alto puesto no me gusto que el supervisor se creyera demasiado y no supervisara por platicar en su celular y bueno creo que eso es lo mas importante que yo creo del trabajo
good,"the benefits suck, and they have a ridiculous attendance points system that makes you feel like you're working for a camp."
good,"Very good company to work for but of all the management I dealt with in 10 years,85% of them have no credentials to be manning their positions.HR and management is nothing but a big ""clique."" It's you against them.This is why they are looking for over 60 people.I've seen so many come and go.Look to yourselves.You are the problem."
good,"Face pace work environment, poor training, advancements and raises based on favoritism not work ethics. Provided most tools though tools are often stolen by other co-workers."
good,Was an okay job if you accept required extra shifts since you were the newest one with the lowest seniority and you will most likely work 6 days in a row on your shift and the first couple of months they work you that way to where it is an unsafe hazard and I have fallen asleep on the way home from work because I work 3 p.m. to 11 p.m. shift. but the overtime pay is great so it may be a job for you but it wasn't a job for me who has a family
good,"My manager at the time was not friendly or helpful, but the company was good to work for. The department I was in was separated from the other buildings. "
good,fast pace hands on learning itget hot even in the winter time. hardest part of the job was getting to work during the snow days. break time was always fun.
good,"Customers that I worked with were fantastic, but coworking staff was often juvenile and created a toxic office atmosphere. Oftentimes it felt like being back in high school."
good,Overall i loved the job i enjoyed making all sorts off wood products using the CNC machines there and i learned alot. What i didnt like was the change in management as all top level supervisors and managers were replaced or they quit due to internal matters. The supervisor they put in charge of us knew nothing of the CNC process therefore there wasnt good direction and or management in that department which led me and many others to leave the company unfortunately.
good,"However, the company moved to Liberty and I neded a shorted commute."
good,This place used to be a great place to work until they got new management.  Now it's a joke. Cut employees wages and treat you as if your just a number
good,supervisors that I like to listen to employees about certain things away prove the place working becomes very hostile employees try to improve work environment nobody wants to be wrong
good,Not enough incentives to keep employees motivated.  Hours were cut short after Leggett and Platt bought off Sealy.  They never offered a job security environment after they took over.
good,a typical day at work was kinda easy all we did was install compartments fpr different companies like cable company electric companies overall i like working their
good,They don't care about the employees as long as they show up to work. I would never tell anybody to work for them they don't care about thing that happen in your life if you need a day of for something they will point you they don't treat all employees the same.
good,i have worked there for numerous years. the way they are changing  management and the way they conduct business has become absolutely insane...favortism is so obvious in that place.
good,"All day typical at work because management know about raw material is not proper but want to make productions,we learned about face the changeless and work hard all the time,management is very uncomfortable with employ they don't care equipment and co-worker is cooperated,hardest time to part of the job run wrong raw material in to the machine.and most enjoyable part machine run 90 to 99%."
good,"good place to work but went out of buisness, good people bad financialy"
good,It was an okay job but did train me to operate forklift. It was a warehouse job I really didn’t mind it but was very boring at times. It was too far from home which is why I’m looking elsewhere.
good,Stayed busy every day. Favortism is horrible at this location. Bad management. Towards the end of my employment days were getting more and more stressful due to no reprimanding.
good,"Manufacturing adjustable bases.Supply products and services that conform to all established requirements and a dictation of his customers.  Fast paced work environment, teamwork is required."
good,"The supervisor has 2 buddies that have the worst attendance records and lowest productivity, but will be there until they close the doors. The supervisor is the plant managers poker buddy.If there is an issue with any employee, there is nowhere to turn. Until this supervisor was hired, it was a great place to work"
good,"During the time I worked at this job; The General Manager was in conflict with Corporate over implementation of Continuous Improvement opportunities. This caused constant conflict for me, trying to implement program as taught by corporate and almost impossible for me to meet Corporate mile markers in a timely and precise manner."
good,Ok work environment but management could be better. Hard labor and fast pace work. production required. U will get dirty n hard hats steel toes are mandatory. Very hot during da summer time.
good,"I issued out tools and parts, kept up the inventory, ordered tools and parts, I learned about the different parts and tools used for the machines that were being operated"
good,It can be a friendly environment if you click with the right people. Pay is awful. Pay you what they would pay a teenager or  someone with no responsibilities. Management sucks.
good,"Ran machine to make sure the carpet padding was coming out correctly"
good,The company was a good company but they have made changes that I am not to happy about. The business has slowed down and my hours have been cut.
good,This was a nice paying job but it was no strict guide lines to go on.
good,"The company has a hard time communicating with the employees. If you need a job with an lot of hours, this job would be great. In my case I do not. You learn how to measure products with numerous tools."
good,Not a bad place to work. Depending on what you do some management have no clue what to do. But overall not real bad place to work. Best place to go is assembly.
good,"in my honest opinion i would not recommend this place for employment , they decided to lay off over 80% of the employees , within a month or two month"
good,"Corporate waited too long to make needed changes to management.  "
good,Good hours and benefits. Poor management and preparation for job requirements. Poor communications from management. Lack of details to job from management.
good,Good job security but no advancements. The job is off production. You work your station or area in your department. You have no help which is ok because that lets you work and focus on making your money.
good,"Es una empresa con poco personal, y buen ambiente de trabajo."
good,"I was fired for an incident that I wasn't even involved in. Then they tried calling me in the next work day, which I refused. I was supposed to get hired on and get a raise after 90 days working but they made me wait 5 months. After breaking records for this company I figured they would have a little more respect for me."
good,I like the job itself I just do not like how they tell you at any given time ok you have to do this shift temporarily an then next week no it's gonna be permanent
good,Over work employees and management is rude to there employees that come in everyday and give them there all.no days off and they punish us for taking off.
good,The people I work with are very good people and work hard for the company. nut the management is lacking structure and organization. Most management does not know what is going on with other departments because of lack of communication.
good,"Very strict schedule. Did not allow any flexibility in schedule such as changing lunch time to go to Dr. Appointments. If you are out of work-start looking for another job, cause there is no room to be sick even with a Dr note. 5 points you out. Huh Turnover should be a clue to managers."
good,They are a worldwide company. We were always busy and I worked very close with management. Part of my job was to make sure my co-workers had the necessary equipment and tools to do there's.
good,Great company to work and co-workers are fun. The benefits are the best I ever had. Working for Leggett and Platt gave me the foundation for my accounting career.
good,I worked for this company for 5 years. i always enjoyed going to work there.  Everybody got along but the front office needs to go BRO.
good,It was a great place to work at with direct interaction with the plant workers and upper administration. If it wasn't for the long commute I would love to go back to work there
good,"The benefits available are amazing. The people are rude, inconsiderate, and hard to work with."
good,My typical work day consisted of loading and unloading trailers and making sure that I kept production workers bins supplied of any material or parts that were needed for us to complete the orders.
good,"Great place to work at, I was a floater. I found out i was getting paid unfairly. Company shutdown. I learned a lot of new thing working there. Overall I liked it."
good,Typical call center more technical. Pretty stable very fast past. Family oriented i enjoyed the close net family environment.Maybe  little understaffed but over all alright company paid every week...............................................................................
good,To many lay offs when I first started we were working 6 days a week then suddenly we were barely getting 40hrs a week shortly after that they laid all the temps off and now they have done 2 mass layoffs possibly a 3rd coming
good,there wasn't any career longevity with this company but you could make a decent wage that would beyond a regular pay rate when hitting the production goal
good,"The pay is lousy and they want the ultimate sacrifice all yr time with pple provided to you tht don't know there job description let alone yours . I mean it's a job and a opportunity,  but don't make it a home"
good,"Leggett & Platt was a nice place to work, very relaxed environment. The people were nice. I don't really think there is any room for advancement but it was cool"
good,Overall best place I've ever worked so far. Management was always good to me. If i could have gotten a tranfer to where I was goin I would have stayed.
good,Hard working skills and self motivation a must as most of the operations are controlled on a piece rate system meaning the more product you put out the higher the potential wages. Difficult and sometimes dangerous enviorment to work in.
good,"Nothing to get excited about, just an industrial standard place to work with a past history of an overly strict attendance policy.  Almost half of the workforce is Hispanics and they are not encouraged to assimilate and learn to speak English creating a cumbersome environment."
good,they need to get rid of the union....they loose good guys do to seniority....seniority guys lazy!!!!! they come do better!!!
good,"My first manufacturing job. Really loud, jot and dirty jobs. Pay was low but had potential to make more money daily wit product quantity."
good,Loading & unloading semi's. Learned the bedding industry procedures. great management & co-workers .The hardest part was trying not to keep getting cut from product. Most enjoyed the steadiness of the schedule.
good,Very exciting and fast paced schedule on daily activities.
good,Its a job that can be irritating when you go the extra mile because you may still remain in the same place. A work environment with a huge learning curve and a high turnover rate.
good,just went       under new management so things should be better for the future in my opinion decent pay they promote from within just gotta apply your self
good,This was a high paced line assembly for sleep number mattress The manager was nice and professional never had any issues overall was a job and good hours.
good,"I learned many jobs with Leggett."
good,Great work environment conditions and resource. Outstanding leadership. Its good company when it comes to safety and working. Our work quality is great we do our jobs to the best of our will.
good,It's okay for a job that you need to get by for a while. Income has a base of about $11 an hour with a chance for more but you'll hardly ever get that chance. You'll get cut a lot even with gloves on and you only get a new pair every month which isn't enough if you're on fast machines. The benefits are nice and they do offer 401k. Decent job overall but it's hard on your body so don't get stuck there. (I've never met or heard of the CEO of l&p so I just hit yes I approve of him)
good,I was responsible for performing departmental tasks as assigned by supervisor in accordance with standard operating procedures to meet specified production goals
good,"Recent changes in management at branch 0001 have lead to a decline in the work environment. Obsession with being the low cost provider has led to management paying the lowest amount possible, and that has led to a very high turnover rate."
good,"a typical day at leggett and Platt started at 6:00 in the every morning and ended at 4:30 everyday. We had a 4 day 10 hour week leaving weekends available for family time. The higher management didn't really care about it's employees, it was left up to the supervisors to make their department moral were it needed to be. I was able to work with people from different culture and beliefs. The hardest part of the Job was dealing with people that were negative about everything and wanted to fight people of authority. I was able to make some good friends and that was the most enjoyable part of the entire job."
good,"low pay, i can say in the shipping dept. for the most part it is a relaxed type environment, when it comes to hiring people within the company that is qualified to do a job, they will hire someone from outside that knows nothing."
good,didn't mind the work. i really the hours and the days that i work. i felt like this job gave me a chance to capitalize time at home. really sorry that they had to get rid of production.
good,Its a great place to gain experience a opportunity to learn the ropes of all machinery that's set in place even the product that being Peace together.
good,I started at leggett in the student learner program in my sophomore year of high school and grew to graduate and to work there for a few years after..
good,"easy going to certain extent."
good,"Reviewed, analyzed and updated standard costs, product margins and cost variances; suggested and deployed actions to improve revenue and profits. Performed inventory control on a daily basis; recommended alternatives to avoid surplus and cost savings by improving the Purchasing Department strategy. Prepared profitability analysis and evaluated new products including pricing relative to the market as well as setting up appropriate markups. Closed and prepared monthly financial statements carried out general ledger functions, including account analysis and reconciliation, journal entries, and AR/AP. Developed budgets, and performed variance analysis in accordance with business plan. Responsible for payroll processing for hourly employees. Review and analyze inventory turns and usage reports. Inventory Adjustments and research of raw material and finished good discrepancies and stock outs."
good,Company has no interest in bettering the plant and their employees. I am allways looking to better myself and my family. I have been there 24 years and feel the need to find something that looks at an employee interest.
good,Long hours. Plenty of overtime. Relatively fast paced enviroment. Good benefits. Able to learn multiple machines. Vacation after a year. Good employees.
good,"Leggett and Platt is a solid Company to work for, They are a family run business that looks after their employees. Do not hesitate to apply with them."
good,"good place to work but hot in summer time not very good ventaltion, but overall work experience was good. was there 5 years and learned alot about machinery"
good,"it was a job, hot inside, lots of temps working there you seen different people all the time. the management was so so, the hardest part of the job was the other mechanics they did not do their jobs good at all, always fixing their work!"
good,"management doesn't care about their employees. work is very monotonous, however working on machines is very educational. hardest part of the job was when i worked first shift and had to wake up at 230 am."
good,"I worked at the bunk table when I first started in September 2015. I made bunk bed frames, all sizes. Then I moved to the rollaway table, which required making rollaway beds, all sizes. It was a great experience"
good,started out working in warehouse loading and unloading trucks until one day my supervisor asked me if i had commercial licence and i applied for position and they hired me
good,"Decent company to work for, management was very respectful and understandable. Pretty good work hours that include three shifts. Overtime available if needed"
good,"ERP systems lacking which requires a large amount of manual calculations in order to display trends. Additionally no product forecasts are provided, so all items must be purchased by performing predictive analytics."
good,I was a lead line operator we made pads for beds air condition I made sure that the machine was working right and I over see employees on my line
good,"Typical workplace. A lot of opportunities to improve benefits and invoirment to team."
good,Fast paced work environment. Decent pay and many over time hours available. Great employees and decent management. Very quality oriented company.
good,great job hard work new found employment for future jobs which involve hard labor and skills which needed for loading and unloading trucks
good,"Fast paced environment"
good,"Walk in go to my area and make sure I have what I need. See If there was any boxes left from the night before and break them down getting them ready for the compactor, then went around picking up the trash and cleaning and moping and getting the boxes as they are done with them so it does not get in there way of making them beds. "
good,"working for this company was great, and ok most of the people spoke Spanish and very little English. health was great  covered everything. family outings was good. this was a good company to work for."
good,"Good company to work for but some that have been there for lengthy periods refuse to change and are not held accountable for their jobs or actions.  The controller gets the majority of the workload that the Office Manager, HR Manager and Scheduling Manager are supposed to be doing but don't and won't.  Drama is ramped in this place and should not be.  Hard to believe a company of this size allows for such immaturity and lack of knowledge of the jobs people they manage perform.  In my personal opinion, all managers should know, understand, and be able to perform any of the duties that their subordinates perform.  If they cannot, there is no need for them to be in their position."
good,"They want you to give it all even to the point of putting work before family but they don't want to give back.  There is no room for advancement unless you meet certain ""personal"" requirements."
good,"Production is hard, the part all made on breake press machine, you have to have sample for every part you that you breake,all are 90 degree angle , you are to check every 10 peace ,assuring they are all the same 90 dree angle,"
good,This is a factory making hardware for furniture. I worked on an assembly line running a riveter.
good,"never new what you were going to do day to day"
good,"10 hr shift , coworkers very friendly, never see upper management, a lot of safety issues that need to be addressed. most enjoyable part of job is co workers and work schedule."
good,Clock in go to my department and begin Then when orders came to me i would deliver them to the departments that order them. This was a 10 hour job. You had to scan product in and also scan out when order. Most product had to be put away and delivered with stand up lift. I did not find the job hard i enjoyed this job. Co workers were mean and talked about people all the time.
good,"I get a work order from the enginering dept.with prints and a decription of the requirements needed for the order. Then I will break it down into piece parts, Then I will write work orders of parts I need from the floor or I will make them myself. I will sometimes have to make tooling to do the job. Also make the pieceparts myself if they are a small quantity. I will form the parts on the breakpress,weld,spotweld or use a endmill to make a special part for the project. Some projects are small and some have been as large as two stores worth of merchandice ranging from making the cabinets to all the gondolla system that the store needs. I work well with my coworkers, they have become some of my best friends after seventeenyears working with them in the modelshop. The hardest part of my job is all the hours I have to put in to make the deadlines. The enjoyable part of my job is to be able to do different things and work with my hands."
good,The job was challenging which kept me motivated. I looked forward to each day because the tasks would be different. It was a pleasure to work there.
good,This branch runs itself pretty well without much direction. There are fast and slow times so during the end of the year there is a chance for people to be sent home for not having enough work. There hasn't been a layoff in a few years however so they manage their downtime pretty well. Promotions are usually from within the branch and are generally given to the most qualified person available. Overall not a bad place to work
good,"I liked the job, but when they hired me they told me I would receive a raise after  30 days for the first 90 days after 4 months, I didn’t get one. Talk to supervisor he told me that they had changed the pay policy and I would have to wait a year. I had no points no write ups so I went and talk to HR about it and they informed me that because I started before the change, I would be awarded my pay raises. I was given my raise on August 1st . On August 2nd I went to work and I received a write up. On August 3rd I was terminated. I guess going to HR was the wrong thing to do. But God never closes a door without leaving a window open. God does everything for a reason."
good,I believe it is a stable job n has good employee relations for the most part. It has a little bit of boss organization improvements to be done but overall a good job place.
good,Leggett was a company that provided as much training for your role that deem wanted or necessary.  With Leggett there was no room to grow in the field hired in or if your interest in another position arose.  The environment was very laid back.  Once you became knowledgeable of the job hired to do; you were never challenged to improve or evolve for better opportunities.
good,"Leggett pools its talent from the local area, and that hinders it because the young and talented have already moved away for something more challenging. And the existing employees stay a very long time."
good,"Overall this is a decent place to work.  The job wasn't difficult, the management was involved and friendly.  My issue was that they operate on old union rules without a union.  Seniority takes precedent over skills which means a lot of fully qualified employees miss out on job opportunities so that a more senior and often less qualified employee can have a position."
good,"Great pay, Great benefits, too much drama and favoritism. bad employees protected by management. left after 2 months for hands were tied to hold employees accountable for negative actions. husband & wife run company behind GM back"
good,Did daily functions. Minimum management. Challenge to work with other employees who didn't want to accept changes in procedures but working with the same employees was the most enjoyable due to great people in general. The hardest part of the job was staying occupied. Company sales declined.
good,My work day consisted of running sales meeting and doing store visits to assure the proper process of adjustable bed sales was being done. I Would do new hire training as well as continued education.
good,Responsibilities are not too complicated. People I worked with were very nice and always willing to help. If you needed to trade shifts most of the time someone would help you out.
good,Fast paced very competitive job. Very productive job that can enhance your skills in any department within the plant. The hardest part of the job would be trying to adapt to the humidity in the summer time
good,"it was very demanding job trying to keep three machines running at the same time and in the process repairing beds, in the summer was very warm, and it was very greasy job."
good,"physically Loading and unloading Ice from trucks,Semi and tractor trailers for delivery I also used forklifts and handy lifts. My co-works was nice and helpfl at all times they show me what to do not just told me what to do and the place was nice they took me out to see the world and helped me understand that this type of job took people skill."
good,Not going to say too much. Over all its an ok company to work for and a great plant to be and also have some nice co-workers.
good,"The days were long, but only when you first arrive it is hard. The work gets easy and things become better. Team work never was a issue it was a plus. I learned so much about the job and operations, but I also learned more life skills. It also kept me in shape. The typical Day was hard labor between 9am to 3pm even though it was a 8am to 5pm things got better. I did what was expected of me and more."
good,"report to work on time.  Load unload truck while the forklift driver.  Management would inform you late on your shift on Thursday that you had to work on Saturday and Sunday it didn't matter if you had family plans and they would always say families come first yet work 60 plus hours a week."
good,"You deal with alot of truck drivers and alot of inventory that you must handle in a timely manner. We do cycle counts every morning and load, unload, and warehouse."
good,"Overall I enjoyed working for the company but if you haven't made it to production rates yet and you finally do, you won't see much difference in your check because they ""make up"" for your lack of production prior. I loved my coworkers and bosses. But you basically bust your butt day in and out just to have them take money they think you owe them all because you couldn't reach production by being on one machine or machine breaking down. Your pay also depends on how well operators can run the machines. If there is a lot of downtime your chances of production pay rates are low."
good,My typical day at work would entail answering e-mails concerning inventory and shipping issues. I work very close to my supervisor to ensure material is ordered to keep production flowing efficiently. I also work with my material handlers and tow motor drivers on a daily basis.
good,I enjoyed working here and felt like I was a welcome addition to the organization.  This is an ideal job for someone like me who likes to stay very organized.
good,"I worked here for almost two years I loved almost every second!"
good,"The pay was low and there was little opportunity to advance , but the people are friendly and the work is good . The hours were consestant and acceptable . Overall it is a good place to work"
good,Job pay was over all better the most places in Winchester factory wise. But after working there for years my pay was cut every year. The management picks favorites and don’t slow you to move up.
good,"Hard long work hours, I learned how to work mechines and fort lift, Co-workers was nice people who helped when ever help was needed"
good,It was a call center and all of the calls were recorded.  If you were not in good standing with management you could get suspended with no pay for 3 days to a week. A few coworkers received this type of punishment because they did not use the correct tone of voice.  I was so scared this would happen to me all the time.  The customers are horrible and they scream and yell at you all day long on the phone...but remember all calls are recorded.
good,"El ambiente de trabajo es tranquilo y divertido por que hay mucho que hacer y siempre se mantiene uno ocupado,el aprendizaje es muy extenso para el que quiere aprender a ser multifuncional ,en la parte de la direccion en mi opinion, siempre han  estado las  personas que no es su ramo y desconocen del tema pero han sacado a flote los problemas, de los colegas es un reto trabajar con diferentes caracteres pero a la hora de trabajar en equipò todos aportan algo para trabajar en armonia y dar los resultados como euipo y luego nos reimos todos de las diferencias que se crearon,sin embargo esa es una de la parte mas dificil del trabajo ponernos de acuerdo para hacer algo, para finalizar lo que sin duda mas me gusto es la gran oportunidad que se me dio de aprender tantas cosas que nunca pense y seguire aprendiendo ."
good,"Production work. I worked on an assembly line making bed springs. I learned that I wasn't going to do this the rest of my life and enrolled in college. Management did not communicate well with employees. I got along well with personnel in my department, however, there was a large turnover of employees. The hardest part of this job was the work environment, it was extremely hot during the summer months. I enjoyed interacting with people in my department."
good,"É importante que a demissão seja um momento para se refletir sobre os seus novos objetivos de carreira e, principalmente, manter as portas abertas."
good,"world for Leggett for first part of my work, went from inside sales to out side sales to Branch manager to General manager. bad management did not know what thy were doing.."
good,"operate sit down forklift weigh up scrap and load raw materials into machine,monitor machines &troubleshoot problems,maintain a clean work enviroment throughtout the entire warehouse"
good,"Great co to work for,would still be there today,if they would not have moved"
good,I learned how to operate a forklift. The hardest part of my job was unloading and loading a container. I enjoyed the shipping process while I was there.
good,"The company is too big to understand what management goals are, so I don't really have an opinion of the company, however, the have a very nice place and good equipment."
good,It's a okay place to work . It's noisy and oily place but with good chances of learning and building your knowledge and wisdom to learn . A very big building and a growing conpany
good,"love working here it's just a shame this branch had to close."
good,"N/A---- Great Company to work for.  Great benifits, if you are not a Union employye"
good,"Typical day consisted of having a cup of coffee followed by contacting customers via phone/email every day.  I would solicit orders, resolve credit"
good,Legett and Platt is a good working place for people to work at they work hard it's a fast place experience in there they have slot of different things you can do whatever you want to do.
good,"My employment time with Leggett & Platt, Inc. was overall a good one.  My bosses were excellent and knew their position and had an open door policy, which they honored."
good,"It's been a long time since I worked there, but I do remember always enjoying my job and liking the people around me. wish I could have stayed longer."
good,This was a great place to work. I learned a lot of new skills and met a lot of wonderful people. I worked with a lot of very diverse group of people that I learned a lot from.
good,Was an easy welding job good place to work hated seeing them shut the doors at the location I was working at. Had good benefits and decent pay for the job
good,"Other than work conditions and very rigid hours, the job itself was good. The pay and benefits were great. Most of the management was great, and I've also heard that they revamped as far as who is in management. I'm glad to have learned hard work, and a lot about heavy equipment and running machines."
good,Was a decent paying job.  The job since it no longer exist was ok.  A little far for me to travel from my home but sometimes pay made up for my travels.
good,"Clock in. "
good,"Leggett & Platt provides a great working environment with very well pay some of the best benefits you'll ever find. I was assigned the hardest job at Leggett & Platt but I gained a lot of keys elements from working the job such as good team working skills, great hard working skills and excellent physical durability."
good,"I loved working dayshift and only 4 days a week.  its union.  so quicker you get production , the faster you go home. great people to work with"
good,"Well established public company with global presence.  Accounting related duties included month-end processes, financial and operational analysis, management reporting, and day-to-day assistance with the operations. Challenges included bridging and consolidating information from the vast array of different systems used as part of being a public company with a global presence.  I truly enjoyed the day-to-day duties helping management with business objectives, and helping the team carry out the mission."
good,"In a typical work day you could be doing any number of things , such as operating large machines to created metal parts for building and putting together metal shelving and bedding for commercial customers."
good,"I enjoyed working for Leggett & Platt."
good,"Love the work environment and my job. The pay was not that competitive however, the benefits were great. Upper management was very helpful and geared towards working as a team. The job I had busy fast paced and at times a challenge but I loved it. "
good,"work was good and co-workers are friendly. Easy going, good pay"
good,Stable company and very professional working environment. Very interesting manufacturing company.
good,"Thats all i can say is it paid well, everything else about the position was not good."
good,"era muito legal trabalhar na Leggett, eu aprendi muitas coisas boas lá dentro, eu aprendi por ex a fabricar molejos para colchões e sofás com muita atenção para que as peças saísse com perfeita qualidade éra muito legal porque a direção dava prêmio para os funcionários que fabricassem mais, molejos com perfeitas qualidades ."
good,Alot of bending and turning. Gotta have quick hands. People in the office were always nice and helpful.
good,stable company -- been in business over a 100 years. largest employer in south west missouri -- has many branches throughout the united states.
good,"I liked my job and what I did, it was great, but it was hard to trust anyone.  Always looking over your shoulder.  Very high turn over.  I felt like management was out to get the productions employees.  Thank God I didn't work in production."
good,"Good company "
good,"To get ahead you have to know someone, or be in the buddy system.  Some in manage ment show a lot of favoritism to few employees.  If you can get past that good benefits and live able pay."
good,"Great Company with a great future, great CEO. They listen to good ideas. "
good,"If all you need is a place to grind out dough, then this is the place that you should go.  Where everyone works with thoughtless faces, and all the gray metal stays everyone's paces."
good,this job was challenging at the begging but it proved itself to be a very good learning experience from new tools to new people and learning how to deal with all types of obstacles
good,"honestly if your looking for factory work its not bad. provided you get along with the environment, otherwise if they want you gone theyll push you out. good benefits but youll hardly live outside of your job."
good,moved up from lower level to management - observe hard work and prove it through promotions and compensation. Was willing to relocated and in doing so I was able to make manager.
good,"I enjoy driving and i was good at what did there,driving trucks was my passion and the work was sometimes hard but it was full time employment and supervisor's changed"
good,good working enviroment and friendly like family run bussiness only bigger
good,Una empresa con compromiso para con sus trabajadores
good,It was not really hard work you had lifting and you worked 6 days a week. It was really hot in there. It was also very loud. You had four breaks in a 12 hour shift.
good,Good company. Became focused too much on having a degree as opposed to recognizing those who had been already doing that job. Awkward transaction from  approved mid manager to highly paid secretary.
good,I loved working in Human Resources as I have a passion for helping people however this company was not a flexible position with hours able to be changed when priorities changed as far as children's appointments and the need for raises. I enjoyed my job and its' responsiblities but wish they would have been able to accommodate me and my children's needs better.
good,A typical day involves morning meetings to review the production schedule. The purchasers order their parts based upon their suppliers' lead times. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you work with and the relationships that you develop.
good,I liked my job I was going to retire from their but the plant closed.I had a lot of friends their that I knew for 26 years going to miss them.They did have good insurance.
good,"I would go in an bust my butt persay, and  get my work done and then do others employees work and never thank you or anything. The more you would do the more they want you to do."
good,Attendance policy is extremely strict and does not realistically allow for the way people may need to respond to different circumstances that require them to miss work.
good,A lot of tasks on each individual. Very fast paced. Lots of detail. Not much training. Meet a lot of nice people whether employees or vendors. Payroll was the tricky part
good,"A nice company, open door policy, management was very accessible. Coworkers were like family. Benefits were very good. Nice work environment and atmosphere."
good,Leggett takes very good care of its employees. Co-workers are top notch. Great benefits. Work is stressful. Difficult to complete tasks as the tools given to complete the tasks are often antiquated. The people at Leggett really are great to work with though. Very ethical and stable company.
good,Management are very nice. Known most of them most of my life. The only bad part of this job would be the danger and the heat. I produce oil tempered wire from 20 gauge  to .625 gauge. This wire is used from car seats to coil springs on semi trucks.
good,"Leggett and Platt offers a great place for entry level positions, there is moderate potential for growth. Leggett and Platt Global Services provides internal consulting and support for international purchasing withing the company."
good,"fast past environment , everyone is friendly an easy to get along with. team member always willing to help and understandable"
good,A typical day would be busy and fast paced which I love and I got to become certified as a ISO 9000 Auditor.  I got to start up their ECO Initiative Program and got them certified.  The people were great.  The downside was that Management tended not to hear some of the ideas of other.  I really enjoyed all the things I learned there.  I could cover 3 other departments and proud to be able to do so.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of receiving in product used in the production of our product and materials used for the shipment of said product. We in shipping and receiving packaged and wrapped, banded or generally prepared product for shipment. As the shipping and receiving supervisor I also created shipping documents, bills of lading and was responsible for ordering materials used in shipment of  product. I also helped in the development of new packaging for newly developed product for customers. I was certified as an ISO 9000 auditor for desktop and compliance auditing within the plant to ensure we met standards required by our company and our customers."
good,"I really enjoyed my time with Leggett and Platt. It gave me ample opportunity to refine my management skills and interact with customers, manufacturing engineers and various machining scenarios."
good,"it is fun working with the group of guys I work with because they try to make work fun by laughing and joking around, makes your day go by a lot faster and work is more enjoyable instead of it being boring."
good,Pay at the plant is good and plenty of overtime is available.  Benefits are really good and the environment is laid back as long as you are doing your job.
good,My job was stressful but worked by myself most of the time. supervisors were ok to work under. operated forklift for most of my employment until they down graded to smaller crew.
good,"When I get into work in the morning, first thing I do is check the e-mails on my Outlook Inbox. Then I go over my event planner and see what following events or appointments are coming up. I then do my safety walk through of our production plant, receiving, shipping, and office area and check for any violations (exit signs, fire extinguishers, tripping hazards, PPE, safety signs, etc.). I then log in and write down my findings on an hourly basis. If it's the day for weekly fire extinguisher(62)/ eye wash station(8)/ exit sign check(23), I conduct this and write down my findings. If it is end of month, I do a riveter damage check(27), and safety supply room inventory. If we have a new hire that day, I train them Safety and OSHA wise. I may have to duplicate a form or flow chart and add or remove items on these forms. At this company I have learned how to work a manual press, automatic press, learned how to pack 1300 bed frames in one day. I learned how to type, microsoft office, how to make appointments, how to train, how to fax and scan, how to conduct Internal Audits, and how to conduct Inventory on raw material and finnished goods. I use a forklift when necessary to move material or machines. Management conducts meetings or BMP's. I am fortunate that my manager opened the door and put his trust and faith in me to become a Safety Coordinator. We have around 80 employees and Im happy to say I am friends with each one of them. I can also say that they are hard workers. I would have to say the hardest part of my job is doing something for the first time. That nervousness and wanting"
good,I enjoyed this job im just looking for better opportunities
good,I only work here cause I can't find anything better but if you can get what you want out of here then good luck
good,it was a good place to work and good people to work with but the thing i learned was to work on a production line. the management was off because of the other bosses would try and come to our boss and tell us we were holding them up and we would work super hard and have to stop because of the other crews wouldnt be done with they order so we would have to take a couple of days off. the hardest i worked was to band the things on the line to send it off to sipping room. the part i liked most was we worked four days on three days off.
good,"As a diversified manufacturer Leggett provides a challenging and dynamic work experience. "
good,if u like shop jobs its for u its fast pace and demanding but the have health insurance and good medical and i worked graveyard shift and i have no complants

good,While working at Leggett & Platt I was responsible for building products for R&D. I had good hours with regular and scheduled breaks and meal hours.
good,"Clock in and come to the office.  Check load sheet for the day.  Load trucks in the dock, if none pull piece parts and get ready for other loads.  Look up orders on computer, and call customer service if needed.  Scan bar codes as I load trucks print out bill of ladings.  "
good,"Leggett & Platt is good company to work for with really good management. The only real down fall is that being such a secure place for people to work, it is hard to make a lot of movement in the company.  This tends to have new fresh talent leave the company before Leggett really gets to see them shine.  It is often a training ground for new graduates before they move on in their career."
good,"Since my start there has been a new maintenance supervisor and it has aleviated alot of the previous issues, good place to work in a safe team environment."

good,Company has a strategic vision and is experiencing a transformation in the IT area.  Operations is becoming more open to investing in IT infrastructure and technology.
good,"Decent place to work. Starting wages aren't too bad, but raises are extremely cheap and hard to come by. Management isn't too bad. The production work is fairly simple and easy. The quality of production employees could be better, but that goes hand and hand with the pay scale. The vaction and pto days are pretty good and the benefits package isn't terrible."
good,Loading and unloading. Also work in receiving. Put up product that comes in daily . Had to scan in product that came in and store in the warehouse. I also unloading wire that comes in every day. Plus keeping my area clean on a daily base.

good,"Fast paced workplace. One never knows what to expect each day."
good,Very good company to work for. Wanted to retire there however the plant shut down in 2012. Management was very resentful and there was always a struggle and drama between them and the union.
good,"At L & P the pay as well as the benefits are remarkably high if not unmatchable.  The workweek is quite flexible at only 36 hours a week with Fridays off.  This lack in a full work week is not due to shift work rather to a lull in business, as a result the company is continuously going through massive downsizing.  The overall atmosphere was not overly positive as a lot of people seemed genuinely concerned about the potential of mandatory layoffs.  If you were within the upper echelon up the company you may be safe for those who aren't; keep your gainers crossed."
good,Great people with good pay. Big variety of jobs and always ways to better yourself.
good,"Flexible hours, Friendly work environment and support from upper Management., Leggett encourages advancement as well. They could pay better than they do but everything else was spot on."

good,A typical day at work is getting all work orders out for that day. I learned how to stand up for what's right. The hardest part of the job was foreseeing that everyone was doing there part.

I learned how to run my area finding new ways to do it correctly and find flaws in my product easier. management worked hard to make everything run smoothly even jumping in on machines to help at times and the small cook outs around lunch to show their thanks for everyone's hard work. the workplace culture was family mostly we all worked as a team no matter who you were. hardest part was just the lifting of materials into my machine but after a while it became normal tho hearing a product fail meaning we had to make more just to cover for the fails and to locate the failed starting machine up the line. the coworkers made the job worth it and most enjoyable

good,A typical day at work was always busy and challenging but would go by fast.I learned a lot of things that a data entry clerk does.Management was very nice and professional.My coworkers were also nice people.The hardest part of my job was when sometimes it was really busy and had a lot of written orders but I would always finish without a doubt.The most enjoyable part of my job is that I had my own desk and was able to decorate it as I pleased and was able to have my little stereo which made my day flow awesome.
