bad,The most toxic company I had ever worked for. No wonder the company went down. The management always had new shiny object syndrome and ignored their  long lasting employees
bad,Got work place harrassment all the time for nothing supervisor constantly breathing down my neck. Verbally attack by coworkers and seen others get get sexually harassed and still are working at this place
bad,"A promising renewable energy company that attracted creative, smart, high-energy people that was dismantled overnight due to increasing debt and risky growth strategy through M&A."
bad,"Sunedison, at one time was a company that you could be proud to work for.  Now they are financially unstable and treat their American employees like trash.  The benefits have been poor for years and raises non existent.  The culture is very divided, corporate individuals may be treated well, especially for new candidates coming on board.  Use it as a stepping stone and get out.  Turn over is high amongst corporate ranks too. Read the public information regarding the three companies and if you can see thru the smoke and mirrors you will either see corruption or incompetence."
bad,This company is ran by middle eastern men who have no use or respect for women. The corporate division has all the perks where as the manufacturing side has not had a raise in 7+ years and works most holidays.  The management gives the impression that they have no real direction and the press releases make that clear to the point of being embarrassing.  The constant contradiction is costing them millions.
bad,"La turnazone 3-1 è alienante e faticosa. Il giorno in cui si smonta il turno di notte è l'unico riposo prima di quello del pomeriggio, non consente nessun recupero dalla fatica e quando si fa presente il problema al direttore questi risponde che se non ci sta bene possiamo anche andarcene. È la classica fabbrica  stile anni '50 nella quale, quando si verifica un problema, non si cerca una soluzione bensì un colpevole. Troppo facile così."
bad,"Lavoro interessante e parecchio impegnativo, anche per via della turnazione sfavorevole che, nel caso dei somministrati è ancora più pesante, dato che non sono previsti riposi compensativi."
bad,"Management and engineers are running production from their desk instead of being on the front line with the operators where all the work is done! To many programs to maintain Lean, 5S, Culture training, that is basically what you should have been taught when you were a child. No account ability for anyone, nobody wants to hurt your feelings, no consequences for repeat offenders.  Operator pay is to low for what is expected from the operators which is causing quality issues and job turnover."
bad,"Moved from a very stable position to Sunedison. Expected long-term career at large corporation. "
bad,"If you ever thought your job was a role in a circle of Hades, you have no idea. The place is terrible, and the people in charge are clueless about process and business management."
bad,Racist working environment with a lot of back stabbing front management till the general workers. Salaries always cutt of without any logic reasons with a lot of injuries without covered by socso or any insurance companies.
bad,"could not take vacation days due to short staffing. Warned company of impending disaster, they let it happen, people were burned, HR was completely unresponsive to site needs. People rose to their level of incompetence. Flattery gets you much further than ability with this company. They are in chapter 11 due to gross mismanagement, cost a lot of folks everything."
bad,"Fires would happen and burn equipment almost every day."
bad,"Temporary Assignment getting books in order to emerge from bankruptcy.  Reconciled intercompany accounts that had not been reconciled for years, therefore, a lot of data to be reviewed."
bad,"Poor management, over expansion, poor accounting, questionable business practices, Bankrupt, no continuity among projects, poor handling of employee notification."
bad,I honestly don't think ANYONE at the company knows what's going on or what to do....I have never worked for such an unorganized company in my life!  They do not have the most basic procedures in place.  Complete chaos.
bad,Busy with equip doing procedures update
bad,"I loved the people I worked with, except a few higher level leaders who treated employees as inferior to them as people. Middle management did not do this; they were great as people but underqualified as managers. If upper management had run things different people would have enjoyed working there more."
bad,"I joined in 2014 and it was a great place to work, growing fast and many opportunities to make a difference. Management was overly aggressive trying to grow and buy other companies and this was the tipping point."
bad,"Poor upper management at C level destroyed Sun Edison."
bad,"SunEd upper mgmt are to blame for CH 11. First Wind got screwed over when SunEd acquired them in 2015"
bad,horrible. Could be gone but they are broke and their merger is going bad. their stock is in the craps. I was lied to about my position. I had to quit. I quit with a few 100 others.
bad,"I did not have a good experience at the end of my tenure at Sun Edison, but I left 10+ years ago so I have no idea what the culture is now.  I learned a lot while I worked there & met a great group of people"
bad,"I have had a good time with my immediate co workers. To many unnecessary meetings, to many organizational  chart change with in few weeks or months. No clear path set to move forward. Abrupt mass lay off and I am among one of those with no fault or poor performance of mine. I enjoy what I do and very knowledgeable on my skill set, but oh well I am one of those  scapegoats."
bad,"when I was there, very unstable with poor leadership at the top.  Has morphed into a very different company.  I am not familiar with the new company, Sun Edison"
bad,"Good place to start out in a plant to gain the experience needed to move onto another plant. Horrible Upper management, makes very poor decisions financially which places the worker in a bind. ( Not enough people, always overtime, vacations cancelled). Since this plant is Union, it ties the hands of the Supervisors to make any changes when you work with lazy people."
bad,"High turnover, very few days off, on call every day off, very few experienced operators left in a very dangerous environment. Explosive raw materials. Pyroforic process."
bad,"Under equipped, over worked, not  paid enough, not  trained  correctly, and  lied  too"
bad,"The future of this fab always seems TBD. And while many are doing the best they can, there are a nearly equip number that do not. It will be interesting to see how the fab reacts when times are tougher."
bad,"Bankruptcy proceedings started in April 2016 and just recently came out as restructured company, smaller version."
bad,Too many rounds of lay-offs.  Very low morale.  Constant changes within Exec Team.  Company has begun bankrupt proceedings.  Do not work for this company.
bad,My opinion in this company is just normal cause we are facing with a lot problems including too much work with a small benefits(salary)
bad,"Company where no clear roles and responsibilities defined"
bad,Co-workers were fun loving young engineers. Enjoyed working with them. Management was questionable. Facility was acquired by another company who filed brankruptcy immediately after.
bad,"Poor change management and disregard for employee communication was detrimental to this company. Equally poor business decisions led to this companies demise. Over-hiring leaders and letting go of the workers, made it impossible for survival."
bad,I do not wish to make any comments about this employer at this time.  The health plan was good as well as the retirement plan.  The schedule was flexible.
bad,I work hard for the company twelve hour shift forced overtime and when I was under a doctors care they let me go for to many points.  Not real compassinate unless your a supervisor then they do as they please. Very poor management.
bad,"turnazione su tre turni irregolare"
bad,"had to dress in clean room suits and ppe standing and walking on aluminum floor temperature controlled rooms"
bad,"not the best management choices coupled with difficult market times"
bad,Company did not seem to have American workers best interest at heart. Risky investments worldwide.  Operator duties.  Moderate pace of work with busier days during upsets.
bad,"Ok, salary and benefits are fine, stability is not, shut down most departments."
bad,Culture of elitism. Poor long term strategy. Limited strategic visibility. Limited IP transfer.
bad,"Employees come last,  schedules are unbearable,  exposure to dangerous chemicals.  Jobs are not secure in this industry because everything gets shipped overseas where the bulk of the work is done by lower paid people."
bad,Company was a fast pased good environment to lear many roles in a short period of time. Unfortunatedly had some challenges that forced it to declare bankrupsy.
bad,"Likes:"
bad,"Coworkers are nice but there is no proper process in place."
bad,"Human glue is used (meetings at all hours of the day) to make up for the lack of processes/systems on the business side."
bad,"Really enjoyed the responsibilities and work environment; lots of fun people; Positive, rewarding and challenging; great company!"
bad,There was not a lot of opportunities for advancement and when they did open it was not merit or skill set based. MEMC-SunEdison did not offer internal growth career paths.
bad,"SunEdison was a good company to work for, but had already started sliding toward bankruptcy when I was there.  I was transferred to a different company as part of the chapter 11 proceedings."
bad,when I started with them it was a great place to work but with the chance in management it not the same place
good,"A lot of things to do, but sometimes you can't get your work done, because you don't have the things needed to complete work"
good,"gestione dittatoriale del personale, nessuna collaborazione."
good,"Very complexed environment.  Data not properly maintained; therefore, research was challenging regarding payroll tax, employee history, and exchange of management roles"
good,They tried to be to big to fast and bought our previous company and tried to combine them and didn't quite have all the logistics down and they ended up going bankrupt.
good,"As a process engineer and site planner for the chemical plant, there are a lot of responsibilities. From day-to-day activities to long-time projects. Involving all disciplines from business, supply chain, to engineering, maintenance, among others."
good,Learn about complete PV solar plant design as well as Project management skill.
good,"The Renewable Operations department had plenty of opportunities to 'stay curious' and see the inner workings of solar panel operations in a distributive generation and utility sized scale. I learned a lot from automation, sql for reporting, portfolio management, data backfills, solar panel maintenance, and my job: monitoring."
good,"ambiente stressante con turni 3/1 senza riposi compensativi, con contratti in somministrazione da 3 anni e mezzo"
good,At times I have been treated well here.  The company has changed ownership and/or names 5 times during my tenure.  There are many good people no longer with us.
good,Few people were leading the projects keeping the others in dark. It had a great team with technical background and sound financial engineering.
good,when I first started there they treated every one great .as the years went on they did not and took a lot of things away from us .
good,"I loved the equipment and the level of responsibility that I personally got to handle, I however didn't care for the inactivity of others and the general acceptance of it by some of the management.  I got a lot of great experience and expanded my understanding of PLC's , Robots, etc.  I did grow tired of the 4 day work week consisting of 12 hour shifts."
good,"Management and direction consistently changing. There doesn't seem a well developed long term plan for the company. Benefits have changed dramatically for the worse this past year, decreased match for 401k, change in pay structure for overtime that has had a significant effect on gross income and has had a negative effect on the morale."
good,"There have been so many changes in management & company goals, it has become a confusing place to work.  Hopefully the sale & new management will bring positive changes."
good,"My typical day at Sunedison is to get a tie-in with previous shift usually there are at least 3 of the machine are working or it doesn't have the product there to run anything ,so I will look on the the computer to see the overall tie-in throughout the line to see if there is a reason that the the tools are DFM, the read e-mail and help out on the others modules"
good,"Societa' mutinazionalle  statunitense, che giustamente nell'ambito del controllo e riduzione costi, ha decentrato e sta decentrando parecchie attivita' sia produttive che manageriali nei paesi Asiatici."
good,"Company had everything going for it to become a super-major renewable energy company. However, taking on too much debt without rational hedging brought it down."
good,"We have a very good Quality Team and Back End Team, whereby the guidance is always there and solving the problems with Team Work. Hence, there must be efforts and willingness to learn on the process and work flow in order to learn fast."
good,"Low leadership, no future planning, at times ok, hot days, very dusty. Working on PV equipment and trouble shooting.At times work would back up due to poor planning. Working with co-workers was difficult at times due to difference of opinions."
good,Lavoro pesante ma colleghi collaborativi e cordiali.
good,"Good working environment but poor management"
good,Good company to work for.  Technical jobs.  Great learning experience. 25 years of service.  Jobs moved out of the country.  Laid -off
good,"I enjoyed my stay there even though some of the staff are bullies. I know that its not what matters in a job, I was able to stay civil and do my responsibilities"
good,Preferisco non dire nulla a riguardo. E' un' azienda abbastanza riservata.
good,"i was employed for over 20 years, i would recommend this company"
good,I think this job would work well with someone who doesn't have kids.  The days off are great but working 0615-1830 doesn't work well when you have kids and live alone.
good,i was work for this company more than 2 years.i have a productive and fun workplace.i have enough rest after 4 days working.i can work for more years if this company did not stop their operation.
good,"-Exciting work environment"
good,The company provides very few opportunities for formal training. Junior staff are attached with senior staff and learn on the job. Opportunities to learn new skill and area but it means that you are required to do tasks outside your job scope.Generally  a good working place for young workers to learn fast.
good,This company started out great when I started last summer but quickly took a turn down a steep hill. The company had the wrong people making decisions at the top.
good,"Poor management and not a good work/life balance but very good people work at SunEdison.  Due to poor management and other extenuating circumstances, the company is now in bankruptcy."
good,Misguided upper management trying to figure out which direction the company is going.  This leads to disgruntled employees and lack of trust among peers.
good,"typical day at work very busy, what I learned is how to leak check machines with leak detectors and nitrogen and how to fix leaks and identify different type of O-rings and what there used for. The hardest part of the job was to stay on track with the machines in a timely manner because there are so many."
good,"Typical tasks throughout the day may include picking up packages (small, never back hurting weights) and hand carrying them to the proper desks and associates within the offices. Mail assortment and pass out is common but the majority of time is spent filing and backing up or deleting new and old documentation from throughout the year. Best temp job ever. Helped me buy my first car."
good,"Due to the small size of the complex I was able to learn a lot about a very broad spectrum of chemical plant management including operations, maintenance and small and large capital projects."
good,"I learned a great deal working for this company.  However, we were hired to assist the company to work through a bankruptcy.  They are no longer in business."
good,A good solar developer that got overleveraged.  Its too bad they were heavily dependent on the feed in tariff program.  I think there is lots of opportunity still to be had with SunEdison.
good,I liked my time at Sun Edison. It was unfortunate that they made cut backs that did away with the position I had. I worked with some wonderful people.
good,"Stressful, not much training for the job I did."
good,cleaned and processed silicon wafers for computers. worked with many different acids. broke up chunks of silicon rods. The hardest part was the acid process.
good,"Although the company is no longer is business, the people I worked with were hard working and creative. The company gave me opportunities to grow my career in management and supervising people."
good,"This company was bought by a company in Taiwan."
good,"Very independent work enviroment.  You get to travel to solar farms and perform repairs, preventive maintenance, site resets and computer upgrades.  The team of people is small but efficient and effective.  Every day was an adventure."
good,Working at Sunedison has been a great experience but difficult financial times for the company. Great global footprint and great global team to develop the results.
good,"It was an interesting experience, great people and ambitious vision but critical executive management mistakes leading to eventual Chapter 11 banruptcy."
good,"I started very recently with SunEdison and was aware there had been some struggles in 2015. However, the struggles turned into a crisis in 2016 with a perfect storm of factors that have driven its market value to nearly 0.  I like the culture, the diversity of employees that are from all over the world and the fact they are all excited about renewable energy. However, the financial issues have caused quite a few of those people to move on as the future us uncertain."
good,"At Sunedison i learn workmanship & I Build Good Team to Work at any comfortable level ,  "
good,"Only worked here just over a year, did not engage too much with office staff as I am always on a job site."
good,SunEdison is a Productive and fun place to work with. It provides a lot of learning scope and healthy environment to explore our work.
good,A typical day I will revive a verbal tie-in from the previous shift. Then  check to make sure all available equipment is running. Check the portal for a tie-in from the production coordinator. Using computer programs look up product running that day find and stage the product. When finished  processing take product to next operations. Maintain a clean work verbally tie-in with co-workers for breaks and meetings. Call management when equipment is down put equipment down in proper programs. The hardest part of my job is the long hours and mandatory holidays. The most enjoyable part of my job is being my own boss in away
good,Innovative and dynamic company. Great projects for renewable energies sector. International profile and great challenges for professionals. Solid company's culture.
good,Company believes in developing leadership skills. People having more Extrovert nature are successful here. you are free to work but travelling is too much.
good,"i would love to move to Alaska im a hard worker and motivated to do anything im asked to do. i love beeing outdoors in nature, i love the cold weather in NC is to hot in summer and has no season it goes ffrom hot to cold , thats when i thrive. i love to hunt."
good,MEMC Electronic Materials Inc. now SunEdison was a great place to work. There was always something new to learn that challenged me to be a better technician. Management was engaging and helpful towards the employees and my co-workers were great. I'm grateful for the time I worked at MEMC Electronic Materials Inc.
good,SunEdison Semiconductor Inc. was a great company to work for as there was always something new to learn and challenge me everyday which made me a more competent and productive technician. I found management to be insightful and engaging with the employees and my co-workers were great to work with. I'm very grateful for the time I had working at SunEdison Semiconductor Inc.
good,"Great work environment. Not the cleanest of jobs, but not that dirty either. Many varied experiences in my 28.5 years there."
good,Challenging and ever-changing environment.  Company going through a positive culture change with an emphasis on improving work environment and recognizing employee value.
good,I worked the overnight shift in the edge polish department. It was a temp position and the pay wasn't bad considering. Pretty much left alone to do your job during your shift for the most part which was kind of nice.
good,"The work routine start at 8:00 a.m. I and the other trainees and co-worker will be briefing about the daily production task. Then , we will out perform our assigned tasks. Throughout the training period in QC Department, I learn a lot about the parameter in Quality survey such as AQL, ISO, and others. Besides, I also learn the time management and teamwork while perform the tasks given.The basic correlation between the department also being developed. I learn about the vital communication skill to generate the efficient work. The toughest and the challenging is also exist in this part .The diversity in labor practice and culture may lead to conflict in some cases.However, the healthy communication will resolve and make the labor bondage become stronger."
good,"- Nice People"

good,"Good pay, easy job, just looking for better hours."
good,Good company to work for.  Corporate Culture with opportunity to advance.

good,Company was just purchased by a Taiwan company which is expected to come in and make major cuts to the company.  The Taiwan company was smaller that SunEdison Semiconductor Ltd and does not have the support staff to handle the acquisition but evidently they do not know that.
good,"Great people to work with, unfortunately the company was run into the ground by poor executive management ans shady deals."
good,"I've loved most of my 6 years at SunEdison.  We have a great team of people that are completely dedicated to bringing clean, reliable energy to people around the globe."
good,"I enjoyed the people and the opportunities I created to move up. However, it is a very volatile industry, with many uncertainties."
good,"Worked here for 20 years until laid off.  Silicon industry is too topsy-turvy. China influences this market a lot.  12 hour shifts, work 3 days one week and 4 days the next week totaling 80 hours (paid bi-weekly)"
good,"Worked on various content on daily deadline to promote awareness on renewable energy to homeowners. Came up with topics on solar, wind and thermal energy that would inform, educate and entertain the target audience."
good,Many experiments so when starting work for the day must dig for information through emails and paperwork to find out what is running and if the information you have is correct or incorrect and you still may not get the right answer. I have learned to operate complex machines and also a great deal about culture. My co-workers here have all been great.The hardest part of the job would be the lack of employees to do the work therefore heavy workloads make it stress full. I would have to say I enjoy the employee's and thier willingness to help each other out in any circumstance.
good,"It was a fast growing company that placed high value on the One Company One Culture set of values in order to align company goals with its customer goals."
good,"This is tough place to work, but has many opportunities in business area and also personal area. Most of management is new and culture is new."

good,"a nice place to work "
good,Tasks became too complicated with the amount of thought process involved by team members in order to make a decision.  Too many times the wheel was being recreated; didn't learn from previous mistakes / experiences. Senior management looked out for themselves financially.
good,"SunEdison in Pasadena Texas closed it doors due to financial difficulties. But through all of the financial troubles, the company maintained a safety culture that ensured the well-being of all of their employees."
good,Exciting place to work but not sufficient for carrier advancement as limited post available for upgrading.Good place to learn and really challenging as the equipments are old but old equipment is not the barrier for improvement and developing ourselves.
good,"Eliminated over 500-700 jobs in St. Peters in the last 5 years. Last reduction was January 2017."
good,Company gives lot of opportunity to learn and responsibility to handle. Management is good but very demanding. The staff is highly Qualified and supportive. Job security is the hardest part here. True efforts are highly appreciated by top management.
good,The management was very into caring for their employees family. they would ask each shift how you were doing. was very non-personal.just barked out area of work .
good,"Once upon a time worlds largest renewable energy company now dosent exist, company got bankrupted and closed down its operations in India, Work Environment was good"

good,"I Have learn professional working very close to work with Sunedison, Work culture is good and SunEdison team is very strong."
good,"Job security exist for those who are competent workers and for those who want to excel. The company has been operating pretty lean during the last 4 years with difficulty for advancement, and tight budget for pay raises."
good,Ci ho lavorato duramente nel 1996.  Lo ricordo come fosse ieri. Un'esperienza indimenticabile. In positivo. Peccato solo non essere stato valorizzato. Desiderio di vita potervi lavorare mai più realizzatosi. Mi ha lasciato qualcosa dentro. Di indelebile.
good,"The CEO ran the company into the ground.....Filed for Bankruptcy, and closed the Pasadena, Texas Facility."
good,Once a great place to work. Now Chapter 11. Company executives fell out of touch with core business model resulting in the collapse of the world's largest solar company.
good,"giornate di lavoro diverse in base ai macchinari, o in parato varie mansioni,la gestione dovrebbe migliorare, i colleghi come ogni ditta ci sono quelli che ti trovi di piu e quelli meno ,la parte piu difficile di tutta la ditta era un reparto che ora non ce piu e stato cambiato e migliorato ditta molto attenta alla sicurezza ,la parte che adoravo di piu era che se suonava qualche all 'arme ero pronto a correre"
good,Great pay and benefits but you i worked really long hours and didn't have nuch time to spend with my family
good,In the beginning it was a basic design. The employees helped me out with learning as I go. Once you are there for a bit you will be given your own tasks.
good,"Unfortunately the plant closed down or I wouldn't ever left."
good,I enjoyed my overall experience in managing a new office for them while bringing over a new team for the office to excel with. Unfortunately the inner workings of the company slightly lacked but it was also impactful to be apart of turning this around.
good,"Company has been downsizing in the United States, the St. Peters Plant is a fraction of the size it used to be. Used to be a great place to work ( times change )."
good,"Management and staff working to catch-up financial records for 1,500+ operating sites. Making significant progress toward completing the task and returning to a normal monthly cycle."
good,On 4/21/16 company filed bankruptcy and laid me off on 7/11/2016. the company tried to buy two billion dollar companies and went bankrupt.
good,"My managers would always emphasize being proactive and finding novel solutions to problems. This is part of the culture of the company. I have learned to think creatively about the different ways of resolving an issue.Typically the workday is around 8 hours, but can be longer depending on what is happening that day. The hardest part of the job can be the independent reign you are given, however that can also become the most fulfilling."
good,"Very good place to work. Have been here for 8 years and would have liked to continue here but the plant is closing down. I dealt with connecting full trailers of raw materials to off load for our process, disconnecting empty trailers after offloading, pressure testing empty trailers for leaks before shipping back to our supplier. Testing of process water for P/H and Fluorides and adjusting additives as needed for control. Training of new hires to our department. Loading and offloading Silane trailers and cylinders for our process."
good,A typical day is twelve hours long with most of that time spent on my feet. My job was to keep the crystal puller machines running efficiently. I was constantly learning about the different issues that come with each machine. I had excellent management and great co-workers that worked very well as a team. The hardest part of the job was the frustration that came when the machines were down and the parts weren't available. The most enjoyable part of the job was the challenges I faced everyday and the people I worked with.
good,"Worked for SunEdison for a while."
good,"This company was a fast expanding company. They paid great and also had a great benefits package. They were also willing to hire people that were in tough spots. They have a lot of working so there was never any slow time, they always made sure you worked."
good,Learned a lot about maintaining equipment and the importance of keeping up and running. Very helpful management in answering question and helping in resolving a problem.
good,"In the R&D dept., I have never worked with a more professional team of engineers. As a former R&D technician, I can honestly say that my short term of employment with MEMC was the most gratifying of any in my career."
good,"Unique and exciting technology, much science and research, many locations worldwide, customers - leading semiconductor manufacturers, accumulated deep knowledge in materials technology."
good,"Before bankruptcy, SunEdison was a really good place to work at. There was focus on research and there was freedom for R&D employees to do exciting research."
good,SunEdison is a leading company in the silicon industry. The hours are long and the work is challenging. Since starting in 1992 I have been involved in a large number of changes as the company has grown and changed owners. We used a variety of methods to track the product quality. Each process is complicated and requires strict adherence to procedures. I loved being a supervisor most of all the jobs that I performed over the years. It allowed me to grow as a leader and develop my skills in dealing with very difficult situations and challenges. This position helped me mentor employees to become valuable and able to attain higher more technically skilled positions. Also I treated my direct reports as I myself would like to be treated. By treating them with respect and fairness.
good,"challenging, relationship with each other, teamwork, alert to the machine, culture, learn to have good environment ( place- tidy ), good supervising, goodcommunication with operators."
good,Great place to work but real leadership is lacking and bad financial decisions broke the bank. Great people but terrible management.
good,"This was one of the most ""social"" places that I've ever worked. We had catered lunch once a month, happy hour in our game room every Friday evening, in-house gym with personal trainer and many, many more frills!  We worked hard but we also played hard. The stock market crash of 2008 brought that culture to an abrupt end. 59 of us were let go in a matter of hours."
good,"I have been working with SunEdison in project management department. I am responsible for project execution, project planning, project contract and project procurement."
good,"Good benefits, Good Corp. Industire challinging with the product that is made"
good,Most enjoyable part of the job was the comraderie and tight knit relationships between team members. HR did a great job of hiring like-minded individuals with similar values.
good,"Company has had its ups and downs, but overall I enjoyed my time there. Most of the employees were fun to work with and talk with. Management was good, never encountered a boss who felt needed to yell if a mistake was made."
good,The company was one of the largest renewable companies in the world and had very big potential but for it going out of business. The employees were fantastic to work with and so was the management.
good,I was laid off after 9/11.  The job was excellent.  Good wages and technically challenging.  I liked my supervisors and the engineering staff.  The hours tended to be long.
good,working at MEMC was good but they shutdown the operation to move it overseas to increase their profits and they ended up going belly up. i loved working at MEMC
good,"I worked almost 20 years for this company, the plant shutdown in 2015.  We, in maintenance, stay on to oversee the plant tear down.  The local management, worked well with the craftsmen, and allowed us who could to move on to new jobs.  We were compensated  for staying to the end of the plant closure."
good,"good work environment, company is no longer in business. Call center job, with the possibility of moving into sales. Was hoping to do sales with corporations, company is no longer in business."
good,"Overall great place to work, just could not keep up with the pricing of Polysilicon due to market/ trade pressure. The culture within Sunedison was enjoyable yet challenging within the R&D group."
good,"I spent many years working for SunEdison. Unfortunately, the company went bankrupt, Overall, it was a great place to work. The management was great and the other employees were like family."
good,"Work Load: Could be challenging some times, and there is not much training provided. If you are a self starter, and enjoy an unstructured organization, this is for you."
